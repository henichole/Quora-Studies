Rahul Chauhan,4y,Why is the BJP government good?,"Head constable Ramashankar Yadav, 57, was killed by 8 SIMI jihadis when they broke out from Bhopal central Jail in Madhya Pradesh, in November 2016.

Shivraj Singh Chauhan was the CM of BJP government at that time.

What happened?

All the 8 terrorists were hunted and killed in an encounter trying to resist arrest.

All 8 SIMI terrorists, who escaped from Bhopal jail, killed in encounter

Ramashankar had fixed the marriage of his daughter at a date that fell a month after his death.

CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan took the responsibility of the wedding personally.

MP CM Makes All Wedding Arrangements For Bhopal Jailbreak Martyr's Daughter

Chauhan, who attended the marriage ceremony of slain jail head constable Ramashankar Yadav's daughter Sonia on Friday, donned the role of the girl's father as he welcomed guests at the entry gate.
He stayed for the wedding and performed all the tasks that Sonia’s late father would have done.
CM Chauhan gave Yadav’s daughter something she would remember for the rest of her life: An appointment letter for a Group 3 government job.
The chief minister said, “Even though I can’t take the place of a father in Sonia’s life, but by hosting the wedding I have fulfilled the duties of a father.” He further added that a job in the state secratariat will ensure a secure, happy future for Yadav’s daughter.

Only a part with roots in the service ideology of RSS and ground based leaders in BJP could have produced a leader who cared so much and goes over and above to serve them.

Rahul Chauhan,Updated 4y,"Everyone was saying that it is impossible and extremely difficult to scrap Article 370, but how come the government removed it so easily?","Its a very calculated move the foundations of which started from 2014 and action plan put into action right before 2019 elections.

BJP pulled the plug at opportune time to J&K Govt so that president rule can be imposed. In case of both houses passing the abrogation of Article 370, the President needs to take J&K assembly in confidence. But during Governor's rule this power rests with the Parliament, hence first step.
Before election results, BJP almost toned down the rhetoric against BJD and YSRCP and allied with AIADMK to get Rajya Sabha numbers in favor and overall strong numbers in the parliament.
Constitutional amendment can be done through parliament which Modi Shah can manage the numbers and 20 states are also with BJP Rule.
UAPA bill amendment introduced to single out separatist and declare individuals as terrorist in case of anti national activity
Triple talaq bill was a test of numbers
Cases against Mufti and Omar are in forefront to tame them
Slow build up of forces across the state
Evacuation of tourists and pilgrims from Kashmir to avoid any violence against them
15 August is nearby so celebration across J&K the way that has never been done.
Balakot airstrike to neutralize hundred of terrorists and operation All out for last 18 months for terrorist elimination and funding of stone pelters have been stopped in such a manner (remember Pakistan has stopped funding for time being before September deadline for FATF blacklisting) so that repercussions can be curtailed

Leading to

Ladakh is now a Union Territory.
Jammu and Kashmir is no longer a state but a union territory with Legislature
Government scraps Article 370(2) and 370(3) and 35A
Complete integration of Kashmir

Future

If political parties boycott elections now BJP will win every single seat in J&K union territory elections and they pass resolution to agree to all the changes.
If they fight election then they accept the changes and are part of the political process still and thereby ending any opposition to the move.

All because of BJP led by

Shri Amit Shah
PM Shri Narendra Modi
Great Patriot and founder of BJP Shri Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
Another founder and mentor of Jan sangh and Later BJP, Shri Deen Dayalji

and the builders of Modern BJP as the largest party in the world

Shri Atalji, Shri Advaniji, Shri Bhairon Singh Skehkawatji

Edit -

Tributes to Shrimati Sushmaji, a pillar of Nationalism and contributor to rise of BJP as a major power, she was a scholar of Hindi, Sanskrit and spoke Kannada which she learned for Karnataka, a state close to her heart.

David McFarland,Updated 5y,"If nuclear power is relatively emission free, why aren't governments supporting it?","Lobbying. Politics. Fear. Ignorance.

In America, Republican politicians are lobbied by fossil fuel companies. Democratic politicians are lobbied by renewables. Both hate nuclear. Renewables hate nuclear because it is as clean as wind, and cleaner than solar, by lifetime CO2 emissions
.

Fossil fuel companies hate nuclear because it can intrinsically inertial balance, support a full electrical grid, and once built can quickly render fossil fuel plants obsolete. (I recommend watching the documentary Pandora’s Promise)

So what do the two do?
Get it over-regulated. The nuclear industry, as safety-minded as it is, doesn’t really oppose it, either. More safety? That will only make the public like it more, right? Right? It doesn’t matter if nuclear power is already the safest their is, right
? Adding a few more layers couldn’t hurt, eh?

That over-regulation kills the remaining politicians who were on the fence, because it artificially inflates the price of nuclear power. Man-hours go up. Construction costs go up. Investigations, surveys, testing goes up. Materials require more testing before they can be implemented, making R&D costs skyrocket. It would be much cheaper than it is, save for extreme regulation.

On top of all of this, there are still people who don’t understand a thing about nuclear power and subconsciously consider “the Simpsons” to be a valid source. Raise your hand if you think nuclear waste is a glowing green liquid. Now recognize that if you’re a part of that crowd, recognize that you know functionally nothing about the subject matter, other than it’s name. If all you know is the name, you know nothing at all.

More will cite “Fukushima!” or “Chernobyl!” Again, this shows a lack of understanding. This is somewhat understandable - few people receive a real education about nuclear power. But how do you explain to someone that a Chernobyl, half-century old RBMK BWR is nothing like a new Westinghouse AP1000? I could sit them down and spend hours to teach them all about temperature coefficients and void coefficients, but how many of them do you think would be willing to be taught? How many would listen? How many could I reach?

Ok, so, let’s get this straight - in such universities if a student attended 72% of the lectures but would have got 97% in the exams they would fail. But if some other student attended 78% of the lectures (possibly not understanding a word of them, possibly playing with their phone throughout) and then got 55% in the exams they would pass?

I mean, what is wrong with these universities? If a student doesn’t get anything out of lectures and wants to do it their own way for God’s sake let them. Or if the lectures are completely shit why make everyone go?

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,6y,What's the reason behind Akhilesh Yadav’s loss in UP?,"Indian opposition parties seem to drastically underestimate the popularity of Modi and demonetization. (Mis)Guided by a skewed media they are bowling head-on into the strongest areas of BJP. Their strategies were way off and getting onto silly stuff.

If you have to win BJP you have to ask tough, pertinent, uncomfortable questions that even BJP supporters cannot reject outright. Rather than some stupid stereotyping — “fascist party”, “organized loot”, “anti-Muslim”, “Hindu terrorism”, the opposition leaders should learn to use the grey matter between the ears. The communal card is no longer working and rather than speaking in Yadav-Muslim or Dalit-Muslim terms, speak in terms of real issues relevant to the people.

Some of the pertinent questions they didn’t ask enough was — “Who is the BJP’s CM candidate?”, “What has BJP done to UP since winning in 2014?”, “What is the success of key policies like Make in India?” etc. If you ask these in neutral tone without accusation it will be like Glen McGrath bowling on off stump. That is what is tripping BJP in Goa. If you start having colourful adjectives and unrelated European ideologies [fascism?] you will get a deaf ear and get out hit-wicket.

Now, coming back to BJP’s win:

Modi is extremely good in leadership and administration. There is no other major leader anywhere in sight — within and outside BJP. The more you deny the reality, the more you get surprised with results like these.
The opposition parties are extremely stupid and insipid in how they fight BJP. They are bringing sticks to fight a nuclear war.
The only logical opposition leaders who can anywhere near stand up to Modi’s capabilities are Nitish Kumar and Omar Abdullah. Nitish was thus the only one who could upset Modi in the past few years. SP-Cong could have roped him for some campaigning, but they overestimated the capability of the “two smiling beauties”.
While the opposition parties accused BJP of being communal, they all went after communal polarization. Mayawati wooed the Muslim votes and so did SP, Congress and AIMIM. The state is just one-sixth Muslim and how many parties rely on one community alone? To make the injury worse, BJP won even in some Muslim majority seats. BJP has been slowly eating into the Shia votes and even some of the Sufi votes among the Sunnis.
Under SP, the state police force of UP is even more communalized — with non-Yadav communities often fearing to even go to the police stations. This fear erupted out in the past 2 elections.
BJP government at the center has been able to avoid major scandals, riots or other big controversies so far.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,7y,"Even after 70 years of stable democracy, why is the Indian political system so corrupt and governance inefficient?","I’m not sure that the DAWN op-ed: Three questions from Pakistan that India needs to answer
 is a sincere one. For DAWN’s standards, it was of pretty poor quality.

First, the author asks how India can be corrupt if it is also democratic. The assumption is that democracy is a magic wand that removes all illnesses. For its size and poverty, India ranks fairly well in the Corruption Perceptions Index
. 100 nations [including China and Pakistan] rank behind India. Of the poorer countries, only 4 [Bhutan, Senegal, Lesotho, Rwanda] rank ahead of India and all of them are very small. India is corrupt, but most of the world is far more corrupt.

Second, the author wonders how India can have religious violence when it is secular. Again, the assumption is that having a secular Constitution would magically bring about all the necessary security infrastructure such as a modern police force to contain riots. For the size of its population, India’s religious violence rate is quite low. And way lower than Pakistan. The status of Muslims in India is infinitely better than that of Hindus in Pakistan.

Third, the author asks how the people can love their army in a democratic setup. I guess the author knows nothing of US. Democracy doesn’t mean you hate the military. In fact, being in a dangerous neighborhood with a key terrorism sponsor next to us, Indians are quite thankful that their army contains most of the bad stuff trying to get past our borders.

All in all, a very poor article. India has its share of problems and is poor, given the circumstances of the past few hundred years.

Anthony Zarrella,3y,Why shouldn't the government be able to buy back all the firearms they sold to people?,"First, the vast, vast majority of all privately-owned guns were never sold by the government in the first place—just like the government can’t “buy back” my house or my car, because the government is not Ms. Elizabeth Membrino nor is the government Acura of Auburn.

The only guns sold by the government in the first place are a (relatively) small number of military surplus rifles (and an even smaller number of sidearms).

So, what about those? Why can’t the government buy back the M1 Garands that were sold through the Civilian Marksmanship Program?

Well, they can—if they offer a price the current owner is willing to accept.

But if you mean, “Since they sold them in the first place, why can’t they demand them back at whatever price they think is fair?” then I refer you to Rule 1.3 of the PCC (Playground Code of Commerce):

“No backsies.”

Unless some contractual clause says otherwise (and discounting certain time-limited statutory “rights of recission” which apply mainly to large investments), a completed sale cannot be unilaterally reversed, nor does the seller retain any right whatsoever in the thing sold.

William Connell Cawthon Jr.,Updated 2y,The justice department has told the state of Missouri that they can’t void federal gun laws. What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?,"The Justice Department really doesn’t have a case, so there isn’t much it can do.

The Missouri law, and similar laws in other states, doesn’t really contest the enforceability of federal laws. It just refuses to be part of the enforcement of laws considered to be unconstitutional or to violate the sovereignty of the state.

Missouri is one of fourteen states with some form of Second Amendment Sanctuary declaration. As the headline on the graphic says, 60% of U.S. counties are either sanctuaries themselves or are in sanctuary states.

Missouri is on very firm legal ground. In two separate cases New York v. United States and Printz v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government was forbidden to compel states or state officials to enforce a federal law. The state cannot be required to supply any aid whatsoever including personnel, assets, funds, documents, state, or incarceration facilities, just to mention a few.

The supremacy of federal law gives the federal government the authority to enforce federal laws anywhere in the United States - as long as federal agents are handling the enforcement.

A lot of people who really should know better claim that Second Amendment Sanctuaries are meaningless and are merely symbolic, but that is not true, especially at the state level. State laws can prohibit not only state agencies from enforcing the laws, it can prohibit enforcement by any county or municipality and provide civil or criminal penalties for any that violate the state law.

In practical terms, this resistance makes it very difficult for federal agencies to carry out enforcement efforts. Federal agencies depend heavily on state, county, and municipal assistance. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has a grand total of about 2,500 sworn agents; the FBI has about 13,400 special agents. Compare that to the state of Missouri, which has more than 14,000 sworn law enforcement officers. Texas has nearly 55,000.

Missouri does go a step further and says federal laws deemed unconstitutional by the state will have no effect in the state. This does challenge the supremacy of federal law and may well result in a showdown between federal supremacy and state sovereignty. For years, Congress has been pushing the limits of federal powers, encroaching on the powers of the states. This includes workarounds of the delineation of interstate commerce and intrastate commerce.

For example: In strictest terms, interstate commerce governs only commerce between the states and the channels of such commerce. Once a product leaves the channel, as happens when the product is sold to a retail customer, subsequent private exchanges between residents of the same state are not subject to federal regulations, other than things such as excise taxes.

In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that the Gun-Free School Zone Act was unconstitutional because it exceeded Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause. In response, the Justice Department said that federal regulations could extend to items that had moved in interstate commerce. The DoJ’s legal legerdemain hasn’t really been challenged, but it potentially extends Congress’ power to anything that has ever moved in interstate commerce, which includes almost anything consumers buy. This certainly exceeds the limits envisioned by those who created the Constitution and well as the separation of powers guaranteed by the Tenth Amendment. Congress was never given the power to regulate all commerce in general, so Congress doesn’t have that power.

This is one of many grounds for challenging the federal government’s assertion of supremacy. If the challenge is sustained, it would throw a very large monkey wrench into the Biden administration’s gun control efforts.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9ca42lih0vjukfdn', 'title': 'The justice department has told the state of Missouri that they can’t void federal gun laws.

Palkesh Asawa,Updated 7y,"Why can't the government, central or federal bank of a country just print more money?","In India, shoes are not allowed inside a temple. Therefore, most people simply put them in a shoe stand and are given a token instead of it. They can show that token on their way back, and the shoe keeper will give them back their shoes.




Now, just imagine - suppose you met your friend inside the temple and you want to sell your shoes, you can simply give him that token; he can show that token to the shoe keeper and can take his shoes back! As simple as that.

But what if you don't really have shoes and simply produce a fake token, will you really be able to sell it? Merely creating a token does not magically create extra shoes! The token is of value only if there are actual shoes.

To understand this better, assume there were 100 shoes in the shoe stand, and 100 tokens. Now, the shoe-keeper simply generated 100 extra tokens (without shoes). So we have 200 tokens and 100 pairs of shoes. Earlier, one token was worth a pair of shoes. But now, one token can only give you a single shoe (no pair).

The point being: printing extra tokens will reduce the value of the token. It is not all that interesting to have a token any more, since it cannot give you what it used to give you earlier!

In the same manner, printing extra currency notes will only reduce the value of those currency notes. This is because of inflation. When you print extra money, there are more number of people wanting to buy food; but the quantity of food hasn't increased. Therefore, prices will rise.

As simple as that may sound, it is the truth. Governments should not resort to printing more money because it creates inflationary impact. To understand this better, read on to get a grasp of the concepts:

What is a wealthy country?

When we say that a country is a ""wealthy"" country, what do we really mean? Do we mean that it has more number of currency notes? Surely not. If it were as simple as that, all countries would simply print more money. A country is wealthy if it has better resources.

Better resources will help a country provide for its citizens, by making more useful products. A country that has good water for its people and food to fill their bellies. Such a country is a wealthy country.

So what is real wealth?

In our example, we understood that generating fake tokens will not give you the shoes. The real wealth will be if you have shoes. What are those shoes, in the context of a nation? The real wealth comprises of four factors:

Land - All natural resources; including water, mines, minerals, oil etc. Without these resources, the economy cannot produce anything.
Labour - The people of a country, who create something useful out of those resources. If someone can drive a car, he is a resource for the country, because the car would be useless without him.
Capital - All the man made resources that can further create resources. A trolley is a 'capital', since it helps to transport goods to people. It adds value
Enterprise - This consists of all entrepreneurs, people who take the risk to use all the above factors and create something meaningful for the people of the country. Businesses, governments et al.



We would say that a country has become wealthy if it creates any of these. For example, if it can create more defence equipment (capital), better roads (land), better education (labour), a country has really progressed and elevated it's people from poverty.


Can we exchange resources?

In the previous question, we concluded that real resources are of four types. In an economy there are many kinds of people who need different resources. Suppose there is a person who can offer ""labour"", but he wants ""capital"" in return. For instance:

I can drive a car for you, if you promise to pay me an electric press instead
Anyone who wants to sell coal; I have some food I can use to pay for it?
I need some food, and I can pay for it using this artistic paintings I made


You see, in an economy the real wealth is in these resources. And actually they can be exchanged with each other. However, that can happen only if you can sell something that another person wants to buy, and in return wants to sell exactly what you wanted to buy. This is called barter system.



Many economies actually started with a barter system. All was well, until some difficulties started to surface.

What are the difficulties in barter system?

Barter system sounds interesting really. But the real difficulty is in valuing the resources. Consider the following barter exchange -


One man wants to sell apples and buy a chicken. The other person feels that he should have more apples for the price of a chicken. But who can tell what is the right exchange ratio? How many apples should you sell to be able to buy a chicken? Suppose you don't have apples at all, but have oranges instead. How many oranges are worth the price of a chicken?

You get the idea now: in barter system, you had to value your resources against all the resources. Isn't that simply unrealistic. I would say its unimaginably painful. Hence, we created something interesting. We created ""money""

What is money?

Money is simply a standard which helps us to measure the real wealth. Now, you do not have to have a price of everything against everything. You simply need to value everything against money. Therefore, you could say that ten apples buy 100 dollars; and 100 dollars buy one chicken!

Therefore, money was introduced to standardise the trade and commerce. In other words, money only represents the wealth; money is not wealth in itself. Just like how those temple stand tokens only represent shoes, they are not shoes in themselves.

Therefore, just like how printing more tokens will not give you more shoes; merely printing more money will not give you real wealth.

Who prints money?

In our temple example, who really created those tokens? It was the shoe keeper, who kept all the real wealth in reserve, and issued tokens in its stead. This is because it is easier to trade using tokens. In real world, that shoe keeper is the Central Bank of any country. In my country, India, for instance, the Central Bank is called ""Reserve Bank of India""

You see, when we realise that money is a symbol of whatever wealth is there in the system, we should understand that the only way we could create more money is if we create more wealth. The only way we can introduce more tokens in the temple is if the number of shoes rises! But then, how can we create more wealth? That's a million dollar question now, isn't it?

How is wealth created and destroyed?

Now we're talking. More wealth can be created by production. This could be something very simple - a hen lays eggs inside a poultry farm, and once they hatch, there is more wealth for the farm owner! Let's take another example. Assume ten workers (labour) come together and build a ship (capital). This ship would then help transfer more goods to port, which in turn would create more wealth. We'are all set!

Wealth can be destroyed or eroded. A machine will wear out with time; food will rot when not stored properly. Wealth may also, simply, be consumed. I mean, food may not rot; but it will be eaten by someone, therefore taking it out from the system. In other example, the chicken may die. The factory will stop producing etc. Therefore, all wealth is not permanent. Sad thing, isn't it?

So how can we print more money without creating wealth?

This question is rhetorical, really. It is merely stating the obvious. You cannot print more money without creating wealth. However, if the old notes are torn and destroyed, new notes would be required to replace them. Essentially speaking, this shouldn't be a problem; since you are not making new notes without wealth to back it up.

But, the question is: can we print money without creating wealth?
Theoretically, yes. Well even practically this happens. So yes we can print that. The real issue here is not whether we can do it, the real issue is: should we?

What are the issues with printing more money?

You see, when you print more money without any actual economic value addition, there are essentially more people buying the same number of products. Therefore the prices of those products will rise.

Alas, we were thinking that giving more money will make poor people eligible to buy the products? What a shame that now the products have become costly, and we are back to square one. We didn't really help them, did we?

Hence, printing more money is not the solution.

Then what is the solution?

It's not rocket science. We already discussed that any economy's real wealth is in its resources. Printing money is not the solution; the only solution is to provide resources. What are these resources?

Education
Employment
Skill development
Investments
Governance (law & order)


And all the other resources that we talked about.

This is what will alleviate poverty. Nothing else will.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6dkh1xq47rt0ny3p', 'title': ""Why can't the government, central or federal bank of a country just print more money?"", 'score': {'original': 0.479, 'ai': 0.521}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In India, shoes are not allowed inside a temple.

It adds value\nEnterprise - This consists of all entrepreneurs, people who take the risk to use all the above factors and create something meaningful for the people of the country. Businesses, governments et al.\n\n\n\nWe would say that a country has become wealthy if it creates any of these. For example, if it can create more defence equipment (capital), better roads (land), better education (labour), a country has really progressed and elevated it\'s people from poverty.\n\n\nCan we exchange resources?\n\nIn the previous question, we concluded that real resources are of four types. In an economy there are many kinds of people who need different resources. Suppose there is a person who can offer ""labour"", but he wants ""capital"" in return. For instance:\n\nI can drive a car for you, if you promise to pay me an electric press instead\nAnyone who wants to sell coal; I have some food I can use to pay for it?\nI need some food, and I can pay for it using this artistic paintings I made\n\n\nYou see, in an economy the real wealth is in these resources. And actually they can be exchanged with each other. However, that can happen only if you can sell something that another person wants to buy, and in return wants to sell exactly what you wanted to buy. This is called barter system.\n\n\n\nMany economies actually started with a barter system. All was well, until some difficulties started to surface.\n\nWhat are the difficulties in barter system?\n\nBarter system sounds interesting really. But the real difficulty is in valuing the resources. Consider the following barter exchange -\n\n\nOne man wants to sell apples and buy a chicken. The other person feels that he should have more apples for the price of a chicken. But who can tell what is the right exchange ratio? How many apples should you sell to be able to buy a chicken? Suppose you don\'t have apples at all, but have oranges instead. How many oranges are worth the price of a chicken?\n\nYou get the idea now: in barter system, you had to value your resources against all the resources. Isn\'t that simply unrealistic. I would say its unimaginably painful. Hence, we created something interesting. We created ""money""\n\nWhat is money?\n\nMoney is simply a standard which helps us to measure the real wealth. Now, you do not have to have a price of everything against everything. You simply need to value everything against money. Therefore, you could say that ten apples buy 100 dollars; and 100 dollars buy one chicken!\n\nTherefore, money was introduced to standardise the trade and commerce. In other words, money only represents the wealth; money is not wealth in itself. Just like how those temple stand tokens only represent shoes, they are not shoes in themselves.\n\nTherefore, just like how printing more tokens will not give you more shoes; merely printing more money will not give you real wealth.\n\nWho prints money?\n\nIn our temple example, who really created those tokens? It was the shoe keeper, who kept all the real wealth in reserve, and issued tokens in its stead.', 'result': {'fake': 0.0087, 'real': 0.9913}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'This is because it is easier to trade using tokens. In real world, that shoe keeper is the Central Bank of any country. In my country, India, for instance, the Central Bank is called ""Reserve Bank of India""\n\nYou see, when we realise that money is a symbol of whatever wealth is there in the system, we should understand that the only way we could create more money is if we create more wealth. The only way we can introduce more tokens in the temple is if the number of shoes rises! But then, how can we create more wealth? That\'s a million dollar question now, isn\'t it?\n\nHow is wealth created and destroyed?\n\nNow we\'re talking. More wealth can be created by production. This could be something very simple - a hen lays eggs inside a poultry farm, and once they hatch, there is more wealth for the farm owner! Let\'s take another example. Assume ten workers (labour) come together and build a ship (capital). This ship would then help transfer more goods to port, which in turn would create more wealth. We\'are all set!\n\nWealth can be destroyed or eroded. A machine will wear out with time; food will rot when not stored properly. Wealth may also, simply, be consumed. I mean, food may not rot; but it will be eaten by someone, therefore taking it out from the system. In other example, the chicken may die. The factory will stop producing etc. Therefore, all wealth is not permanent. Sad thing, isn\'t it?\n\nSo how can we print more money without creating wealth?\n\nThis question is rhetorical, really. It is merely stating the obvious. You cannot print more money without creating wealth. However, if the old notes are torn and destroyed, new notes would be required to replace them. Essentially speaking, this shouldn\'t be a problem; since you are not making new notes without wealth to back it up.\n\nBut, the question is: can we print money without creating wealth?\nTheoretically, yes. Well even practically this happens. So yes we can print that. The real issue here is not whether we can do it, the real issue is: should we?\n\nWhat are the issues with printing more money?\n\nYou see, when you print more money without any actual economic value addition, there are essentially more people buying the same number of products. Therefore the prices of those products will rise.\n\nAlas, we were thinking that giving more money will make poor people eligible to buy the products? What a shame that now the products have become costly, and we are back to square one. We didn\'t really help them, did we?\n\nHence, printing more money is not the solution.\n\nThen what is the solution?\n\nIt\'s not rocket science. We already discussed that any economy\'s real wealth is in its resources. Printing money is not the solution; the only solution is to provide resources. What are these resources?\n\nEducation\nEmployment\nSkill development\nInvestments\nGovernance (law & order)\n\n\nAnd all the other resources that we talked about.\n\nThis is what will alleviate poverty. Nothing else will.', 'result': {'fake': 0.0015, 'real': 0.9985}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 16, 'credits': 1987099, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'In India, shoes are not allowed inside a temple. Therefore, most people simply put them in a shoe stand and are given a token instead of it. They can show that token on their way back, and the shoe keeper will give them back their shoes.\n\n\n\n\nNow, just imagine - suppose you met your friend inside the temple and you want to sell your shoes, you can simply give him that token; he can show that token to the shoe keeper and can take his shoes back! As simple as that.\n\nBut what if you don\'t really have shoes and simply produce a fake token, will you really be able to sell it? Merely creating a token does not magically create extra shoes! The token is of value only if there are actual shoes.\n\nTo understand this better, assume there were 100 shoes in the shoe stand, and 100 tokens. Now, the shoe-keeper simply generated 100 extra tokens (without shoes). So we have 200 tokens and 100 pairs of shoes. Earlier, one token was worth a pair of shoes. But now, one token can only give you a single shoe (no pair).\n\nThe point being: printing extra tokens will reduce the value of the token. It is not all that interesting to have a token any more, since it cannot give you what it used to give you earlier!\n\nIn the same manner, printing extra currency notes will only reduce the value of those currency notes. This is because of inflation. When you print extra money, there are more number of people wanting to buy food; but the quantity of food hasn\'t increased. Therefore, prices will rise.\n\nAs simple as that may sound, it is the truth. Governments should not resort to printing more money because it creates inflationary impact. To understand this better, read on to get a grasp of the concepts:\n\nWhat is a wealthy country?\n\nWhen we say that a country is a ""wealthy"" country, what do we really mean? Do we mean that it has more number of currency notes? Surely not. If it were as simple as that, all countries would simply print more money. A country is wealthy if it has better resources.\n\nBetter resources will help a country provide for its citizens, by making more useful products. A country that has good water for its people and food to fill their bellies. Such a country is a wealthy country.\n\nSo what is real wealth?\n\nIn our example, we understood that generating fake tokens will not give you the shoes. The real wealth will be if you have shoes. What are those shoes, in the context of a nation? The real wealth comprises of four factors:\n\nLand - All natural resources; including water, mines, minerals, oil etc. Without these resources, the economy cannot produce anything.\nLabour - The people of a country, who create something useful out of those resources. If someone can drive a car, he is a resource for the country, because the car would be useless without him.\nCapital - All the man made resources that can further create resources. A trolley is a \'capital\', since it helps to transport goods to people. It adds value\nEnterprise - This consists of all entrepreneurs, people who take the risk to use all the above factors and create something meaningful for the people of the country. Businesses, governments et al.\n\n\n\nWe would say that a country has become wealthy if it creates any of these.

There are three things I can watch forever: fire burning, water falling, and vatnik women. I love vatnik woman! I really do.

Vatnik woman has endearing crassness and blunt directness. If she says no, she means yes, and vice versa. And when she says, “no, and I mean it!” it’s “maybe.”

That does not mean she’s not brutalsky because she’s tougher than nails!

Vatnik woman loves to do nails: she’s either a self-employed manicurist or a client of her manicurist friend.

My eight year old daughter Margot loves to do nails. She knows every nail salon in the hood. However, I’m afraid she’s refined and well-mannered and won’t become a vatnik woman.

Vatnik woman’s world revolves around nails, beloved “my husband my husband my husband,” kids and beyond that lie vast snow-covered lands steeped in heroic military fantasies, populated by spirits of the heroes-martyrs of the glorious past.

Vatnik woman glues to TV screen for must-watch religious rites - Victory Day Military Parade on Red Square and Putin’s two-hour long address to the nation.

She would not listen to the actual meaning of the words. She’d seek reaffirmation of her beliefs, and the tsar’s speechwriters would always deliver on the promise.

Mother Russia is strong.

Putin has vanquished fifth column on the inside and dealt a decisive blow to the foe who want to break Motherland apart on the outside.

Reassured by Kremlin leadership’s might, vatnik woman returns to nails, husband husband husband and household chores.

Once a year, vatnik woman would take her family to a photo studio to do a glamorous photo session of her beloved heroes-martyrs in Red Army uniforms.

Kids dressed up as little soldiers holding automatic guns. Husband husband husband in military uniform armed and heroic. She’s a nurse, or a tank factory worker, or a loving wife in vintage dress.

In a few days, vatnik woman’s Instagram feed with painted nails is interspersed with her gloriously photoshopped military family.

And then one day, vatnik woman’s husband husband husband is mobilised to fight Nazis in Ukraine. A cosplay is suddenly real? Not so much to vatnik woman.

She records the ceremony of parting with her husband husband husband at the town square and posts it on her Instagram with the same soundtrack that every vatnik woman uses for saying-goodbye-to-mobilised-husband posts.

“My husband husband husband is going to fight Nazis and liberate vast lands of glorious Motherland!”

Were you to ask vatnik woman to name one Ukrainian town and find it on the map she’d say Penza and point her manicured finger at Minsk.

Brutalsky found a game changing weapon that can turn the tide on the battlefront: Tsar Cannon.

And then, one day, vatnik woman learns that her husband husband husband was killed in action.

Vatnik woman would act surprised. It can’t be! My husband husband husband is a hero! He didn’t go to fight Nazis to die. It’s impossible.

Because you see, when vatnik woman parted with him on the town square and posted a video with that same melody as other vatnik women do, she was absolutely sure it was all fun and game, like a photo session and he can’t die.

But he did.

Her hero-martyr from the military-styled photo session. Vatnik woman had told her husband husband husband you should go and fight Nazis! Don’t run abroad like office plankton. Don’t hide like your friends from factory.

And now she’s stuck with mortgage and kids and slim chances to land another husband of equal value. Her life prospects have been degraded, but she does not understand it!

She posts pictures of her hero husband on Instagram and tells everyone that he died to rid Armenia or France, one of those distant lands, of Nazi scum.

And then, comes another shocker.

Vatnik woman is told that her husband husband husband wasn’t really, you know, a hero. And let’s skip a bit into the future to the era when vatnik woman learns from TV and her clients that her husband husband husband who posed in military uniform every year for a heroic photo session, was in fact a war criminal.

Husband husband husband raped women, tortured men, killed civilians by thousands in a foreign land where there were no Nazis. And if the enemies are not Nazis, this can only mean one thing: her husband husband husband was a Nazi!!!

You might think that vatnik woman won’t be able to come to terms with cognitive dissonance that her husband husband husband is not a Nazi Slayer but a Nazi but that would imply having to deal with two conflicting thoughts at the same time. And clearly you don’t know vatnik women! Not as much as I know them at least.

Vatnik woman will quietly delete all the brutalsky military style photos from her Instagram and pretends that there was no husband husband husband. And when her son asks where are glorious military photos from his second grade mom will tell him , there have never been any.

It’s always been just her and the kids. She despised Nazi military parades and Putin’s Nazi speeches. And as for the new president, she firmly believes he’s the best leader Russia has ever had!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wq1kax5093sycopm', 'title': ""What is the peculiarity of Putin's dictatorship in Russia over other dictatorships?

Dave Haag,Sep 7,Why does the government want to ban guns?,,{'error': 'missing content request parameter'},
Robert Clouse,5y,"Why do some claim guns cannot stop a tyrannical government when that did happen in the 1946 Battle of Athens, Tennessee?","The 1946 Battle of Athens isn't the only time guns have been used against tyranny. The example is Robert Franklin Williams.

Robert F. Williams - Wikipedia

As a member of the NRA, he created the Black Armed guard.

He called the Monroe Chapter of the NRA the Black Armed Guard; it was made up of about 50–60 men, including some veterans like him. They were determined to defend the local black community from racist attacks.

Newtown was the black residential area of Monroe. In the summer of 1957, there were rumors that the KKK was going to attack the house of Dr. Albert Perry, a practicing physician and vice-president of the Monroe NAACP. Williams and his men of the Armed Guard went to Perry's house to defend it, fortifying it with sandbags. When numerous KKK members appeared and shot from their cars, Williams and his followers returned the fire, driving them away.

""After this clash the same city officials who said the Klan had a constitutional right to organize met in an emergency session and passed a city ordinance banning the Klan from Monroe without a special permit from the police chief.""

Later, he used guns and his group to defend Freedom Riders working for civil rights in the South.

Around this time, a white couple from a nearby town drove into the black section of Monroe when other streets were closed by mobs because of protests at the county courthouse. They were stopped in the street by an angry crowd. For their safety, they were taken to Williams' home.

Williams initially told them that they were free to go, but he soon realized that the crowd would not grant safe passage. He kept the white couple in a house nearby until they were able to safely leave the neighborhood. North Carolina law enforcement accused Williams of having kidnapped the couple. He and his family fled the state with local law enforcement in pursuit.

When he returned and was trailed in 1975, North Carolina dropped the charges almost immediately.

Black civilians with guns defended the NAACP for over a decade against the KKK, both as the Black Armed Guards, and the Black Panther.

Now you know why their was so many gun control laws created during the 1960′s. Many states in the South passed gun control laws during the 1960′s, and selectively enforced them against blacks in the South.

In 1956, after Martin Luther King’s house was bombed, King applied for a concealed carry permit in Alabama. The local police had discretion to determine who was a suitable person to carry firearms. King, a clergyman whose life was threatened daily, surely met the requirements of the law, but he was rejected nevertheless. At the time, the police used any wiggle room in the law to discriminate against African Americans.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/x3usjdn58g2iry4k', 'title': 'Why do some claim guns cannot stop a tyrannical government when that did happen in the 1946 Battle of Athens, Tennessee?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The 1946 Battle of Athens isn\'t the only time guns have been used against tyranny.

Anonymous,5y,What are some dark truths of life as a government employee?,"I’ve to go anonymous for obvious reasons. This is something I’ve buried deep in my heart as I couldn’t really tell anyone.

Story is from 1996, my father was back then in District level court and was on one of the relatively high positions, he had always lived by the principle of not taking anyone's money (bribe) for doing the job and he was incharge of his table/office, this setup is consisting of 4–7 people usually and they handle different departments like Civil, Criminal and what not per table/office. Since he was incharge of that table and he did not take any money, all the others were not getting opportunity to take that extra benefit home either. Which used to be pretty big considering meager government salaries back then.

So due to my fathers honest nature, nobody was getting “malai” and this annoyed them greatly, they used to find ways to bother him so he will apply for transfer to different table or district all together, usually they are transferred after 5 years each, but you can apply for one in advance in case of problems. But no matter what they did, he never gave up, and maintained his stance to follow rules. One dark day of my life, woman from their group falsely accused him of “sexual harassment”, so he will at least get suspended and then fired. Which did work, internal complaint was lodged and if found the accusations true he would’ve been fired. He had been suspended till the proceeding were over, to make appeal he stayed in court only, as usually you have to give reply in written for any form of notice. Unfortunately for our family of three, one of the policeman (Havaldar) who heard this incident was my mothers relative (as incident was big), he came to our house and told only side of the story that he knew about, which was “my father being suspended for harassing a woman at workplace”.

My mother took this to very extreme levels, cried all day, but she did not mention a word when my father came home. As if she was waiting for him to tell her all that, which unfortunately he didn’t as he was never the type of man to bring his office problem to home. This angered her further, and you know what she did? When me and my dad was watching TV (those days some Krishana Malika was very popular and it was being played on our black and white TV), she locked herself in our kitchen and burned herself to death. Those days we didn’t have Gas, we used to use one of those “rokel stoves” and we had 5 liter can full of kerosene in our house, she used that to kill herself.

Just because of some incident in my father's office which was actually result of him being honest and doing his job? I was only 7 years and you know what happened next? My mother's family accused him of killing my mother, which by the way was false as he was with me the entire time. I can’t explain the details very clearly here, but this got him suspended for 2 years till case was to be given verdict on. And you know what? at age of 9 I was in court giving testimonies whether my father had killed my mother or not. As prime witness my testimony was taken right after the incident too, my mothers another relative lived close by and after the incident police took my father and they took me with them for couple of days till matters calmed down. They tried to “coach” me to give false testimony even after me giving them honest account of the incident. Thankfully police had immediately written down everything I had said right after the incident and they used that as prime evidence to prove my father innocent 2 years later.

Thankfully, my father was cleared of both the incident as there were people contradicting ladys accusations of sexual harassment and my immediate testimony as prime witness was accepted. Finally he was free, he had virtually no savings, no money to do anything during that period. Everyone looked at him as wife killer. Even our relatives would distance themselves from us.

I came to know of backstory many years later from one of his coworkers who used to come home after his retirement and we used to discuss many things. He thought this was something I needed to know. I’m glad he did.

Till my fathers retirement after the case, he still kept his head down and worked honestly. He was retired at even higher position due to couple of promotions but till 6th pay commission we didn’t even have our own home. We just weren't able to buy it as we never had any saving in meager government salary. He also never married again, raised me all alone and even now, in such a old age does social service.

I was probably not able to explain lot of things as things are too old, but hell, that incident changed my life. COMPLETELY!

Whenever people talk about how there are no honest government workers, I can’t help but smile to myself bitterly. Afterall, that honesty has cost me quite heavily, which people think does not exist.

Sorry for any spelling and grammatical mistakes, I’m fully grown man and I’m crying atm, probably won't even have heart to read it again to check and correct. Sorry.

Thank you for listening. I feel like huge burden was lifted off my heart.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8b25x471wpy6elqf', 'title': 'What are some dark truths of life as a government employee?', 'score': {'original': 0.8357, 'ai': 0.1643}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I’ve to go anonymous for obvious reasons.

This is something I’ve buried deep in my heart as I couldn’t really tell anyone.\n\nStory is from 1996, my father was back then in District level court and was on one of the relatively high positions, he had always lived by the principle of not taking anyone's money (bribe) for doing the job and he was incharge of his table/office, this setup is consisting of 4–7 people usually and they handle different departments like Civil, Criminal and what not per table/office. Since he was incharge of that table and he did not take any money, all the others were not getting opportunity to take that extra benefit home either. Which used to be pretty big considering meager government salaries back then.\n\nSo due to my fathers honest nature, nobody was getting “malai” and this annoyed them greatly, they used to find ways to bother him so he will apply for transfer to different table or district all together, usually they are transferred after 5 years each, but you can apply for one in advance in case of problems. But no matter what they did, he never gave up, and maintained his stance to follow rules. One dark day of my life, woman from their group falsely accused him of “sexual harassment”, so he will at least get suspended and then fired. Which did work, internal complaint was lodged and if found the accusations true he would’ve been fired. He had been suspended till the proceeding were over, to make appeal he stayed in court only, as usually you have to give reply in written for any form of notice. Unfortunately for our family of three, one of the policeman (Havaldar) who heard this incident was my mothers relative (as incident was big), he came to our house and told only side of the story that he knew about, which was “my father being suspended for harassing a woman at workplace”.\n\nMy mother took this to very extreme levels, cried all day, but she did not mention a word when my father came home. As if she was waiting for him to tell her all that, which unfortunately he didn’t as he was never the type of man to bring his office problem to home. This angered her further, and you know what she did? When me and my dad was watching TV (those days some Krishana Malika was very popular and it was being played on our black and white TV), she locked herself in our kitchen and burned herself to death. Those days we didn’t have Gas, we used to use one of those “rokel stoves” and we had 5 liter can full of kerosene in our house, she used that to kill herself.\n\nJust because of some incident in my father's office which was actually result of him being honest and doing his job? I was only 7 years and you know what happened next? My mother's family accused him of killing my mother, which by the way was false as he was with me the entire time. I can’t explain the details very clearly here, but this got him suspended for 2 years till case was to be given verdict on. And you know what? at age of 9 I was in court giving testimonies whether my father had killed my mother or not. As prime witness my testimony was taken right after the incident too, my mothers another relative lived close by and after the incident police took my father and they took me with them for couple of days till matters calmed down. They tried to “coach” me to give false testimony even after me giving them honest account of the incident. Thankfully police had immediately written down everything I had said right after the incident and they used that as prime evidence to prove my father innocent 2 years later.\n\nThankfully, my father was cleared of both the incident as there were people contradicting ladys accusations of sexual harassment and my immediate testimony as prime witness was accepted.

Ian Lang,3y,Which regimes have attempted to implement pure meritocracy?,"Oh dear Lord, no.

If you have a society where only the capable rise to positions whereby they get to run things properly, what you get is a society where everything runs like clockwork and there’s absolutely no mileage in taking the piss out of your supposed superiors.

Where would humanity be if that were the case?

Switzerland, that’s where. You name me one famous Swiss comedy. Can you point to one thing from Switzerland that’s got anything to do with something that’s not either banks or money?

Well, they do do chocolate, I suppose, but even that they somehow make tedious:

Bugger off Switzerland, that looks like a first aid box and what’s with all those white bits that make the chocs look mouldy and taste like a welder’s boot?

I mean honestly. You buggers from Basel come over here and take over Rowntree’s and do this:

Black Magic, Joachim. BLACK MAGIC. It’s supposed to evoke shades of voodoo.

See? Much more sexy. Looks like you’ll be sacrificing a chicken to Baron Saturday soon, with that box.

So no. If we elevate the sensible, level-headed people to positions of authority, we’ll end up with a society that’ll drive us all quite potty with the tedium in a month. Like Switzerland. They’ve not been in any of the European punch-ups for hundreds of years. They’re all overcome with the weight of being sensible. Here’s Zurich:

Yawn.

Nope. We need a level of persons that know what they’re doing, and then another level of complete halfwits to completely stuff things up to stop the capable from getting too complacent. Because on the day we all turn Swiss, that’s the day humanity declines.

By the way, thanks for this question, because I’ve never had such a good opportunity to have a go at the Swiss before. Makes a change from taking the piss out of les Frogs, ze Germans! and the Armada-Losers. Perhaps we ought to start a campaign

“Tossers to the top! Wankers, not bankers!”

Having said that, it’s got to be the right sort of tossers. Whilst it’s true that MBAs (what? look, I’ve just insulted at length an entire nation of about nine million people with a side-swipe at three more countries with 195 million between them, did you MBAs really think you were getting away with it?) are indeed tossers of the first order, the problem is that they’re unamusing tossers and you can’t trust any of them to even occasionally do something interesting and we’d end up in a worse situation than a global Helvetia.

Which is why I like Boris so much, because he treats everything like a game of Rugby. You get serious when you need to, and not when you don’t, and like me, he thinks that it’s only against the rules if somebody catches you doing it.

Tossers unite! March into Trafalgar Square! Well, when I say march, I mean meander about in a semi-directed fashion eating a packet of Monster Munch, and stopping for a bit of a chat if you bump into somebody you know.

Organised expertise. We don’t want that, thank you very much. We’d all be much happier keeping buggering on in our shambolic lurchings just averting catastrophe by the skin of our teeth, thank you.

Except Switzerland, and admit it - the first thought that popped into your head was “Heidi” wasn’t it?

Vineet Banga,4y,Is the BJP government's decision to sell Air India correct?,"So, let us look at history of Air India! Air India started off in 1932 as Tata Air Services and christened Tata airlines later. They decide to name it Air India after WWII and it became a Public Limited Company. It was founded by J.R.D.Tata and in fact he used to fly some of the flights himself. After Indian independence, Govt bought 49% stake in the airline.

Now, let us look at why we need a National airline. I am sure you have heard of Emirates or Qatar. One of the finest in the world! They have huge hubs from where their flights take off or land.

Many politicians fear their nations will be irrelevant if they abandon their money-losing flag airlines. That’s probably a stretch. In most places, the market likely would fill the gap — provided the government got out of the way. But national pride is powerful, and few people want to see storied brands disappear.

— Brian Sumers

The idea was to connect your country to the outside world. Also, for the outside world to know that a country exists and is capable of running their own airlines which can connect to any other country in the world; as needed. So, just like outer space mission, it was a pride that we also have National Airlines. But is this relevant today?

Now, let us look at why this move by the Govt is a little late. It should have done if not two decades ago, then at least a decade ago. Air India has an annual bail out budget or Rs. 4,600 Crores. As per my knowledge, Air India has never made any profit. So, while Local buses and trains serve the people to connect within the country and are trying to reinvent themselves, why should we continue to carry a burden of Rs.4,600 crore which is going to increase every year.

Will people lose jobs? Of course they will! Why do you think they are losing money? It is because it is the same old bureaucratic set up where tenure and reservations hover above merit. So, letting it continue to run when the losses mount up is not anyone running a business would do. Air India has served the Politicians more than the people.

The airline most often tops the chart when it comes to poor on-time performance, flight cancellations, passenger complaints and grievances redressal. For instance, the airline's domestic operations registered 287 complaints in July, the highest among all airlines. While all other airlines managed to address the issues, AI couldn't close 65 passenger complaints against it.

I have flown within India for 15-Years, and the only time I used Air India was when I used to fly from Hyderabad to Bangalore because it was the cheapest flight available. They had a flight coming in from Gulf landing in Hyderabad and then flying out to Bangalore at 3:45 AM or something like that. The price was always Rs.1300+change. Way better than taking a bus.

So, to answer your question, I hope they find a buyer. Air India should have been sold long time ago. You cannot run a company with Unions and Politicians holding the threads.

Good riddance!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3m5g7nxl2syjciuv', 'title': ""Is the BJP government's decision to sell Air India correct?"", 'score': {'original': 0.8533, 'ai': 0.1467}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""So, let us look at history of Air India!

For instance, the airline's domestic operations registered 287 complaints in July, the highest among all airlines. While all other airlines managed to address the issues, AI couldn't close 65 passenger complaints against it.\n\nI have flown within India for 15-Years, and the only time I used Air India was when I used to fly from Hyderabad to Bangalore because it was the cheapest flight available. They had a flight coming in from Gulf landing in Hyderabad and then flying out to Bangalore at 3:45 AM or something like that. The price was always Rs.1300+change. Way better than taking a bus.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I hope they find a buyer. Air India should have been sold long time ago. You cannot run a company with Unions and Politicians holding the threads.\n\nGood riddance!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.8533

Rajan Singh,Updated 5y,What are the most irrelevant things Indian government wastes money on?,"While serving as an IPS officer, and having many friends in the IAS, I have seen government functioning closely and the biggest shocker is not corruption. That we already know. The biggest shocker is something much more benign looking.

Let me show you the typical state of a government hospital. See below some images I picked randomly.

This is in south India, which is relatively better administered. I dread to think about the other parts of the country.

If these hospitals got a few crores every year, they could be upgraded to a somewhat decent standard. But the government does not have money. And we understand that.

The same problem with government schools. In some places there are no facilities, nothing. But we don’t have money to spend. So it is fine I guess. See below one such school.

If we could give 10 such hospitals Rs 10 Cr each, we could do wonders.

Now let us say government did have 100 Cr, but someone stole it. Would you be outraged? Yes! It would be a huge corruption scandal, and rightly so.

But what happens if we just throw away 100 Cr? You may wonder, “How that can happen?”

What about Public Sector Units? How much loss have we suffered in Air India? 50,000 Cr. And what for? Are there no private airlines willing to serve customers?

What is the government trying to do? Run hotels. Run grocery stores. Run anything you can imagine: Airlines, cement factory, electronics, machinery… you name it. In some places, government is also selling chicken. No kidding. In fact I am surprised that no government has started manufacturing smartphones to compete with Apple.

When you can’t run a government office where the ‘customer’ is captive, how will you run airlines? And why?

The argument we always hear is that it is for poor people. That poor people can’t buy expensive things sold by private companies. I think it reflects a very poor understanding of how businesses work. When there is competition, companies have to sell cheap. Have you not seen discounts raining from companies like Ola, Flipkart, Amazon etc.? Are smartphones not getting cheaper everyday?

I think most of the time this ‘for poor people’ argument is complete nonsense. Not always, but most of the time. I would ask a simple question. If it was your money, would you spend it that way? Would you expect people with the mindset of a clerk to run your business. I would not.

Would you invest in Indian Airlines? Would you invest in government owned hotels? When you go to a 5 star hotel, do you want the receptionist greeting you to be like a clerk, with a life long secure job?

World’s worst crimes are committed in the name of lofty ideas. Nationalism, equality, religion/God, honour… Millions of people have been killed in their name.

I think in the name of ‘poor’ we are throwing away thousands of crores every year. Because it is ‘for poor people’, you shall not ask questions. If you ask questions, you are a capitalist stooge.

I am not saying all government expenditure is bad but government has to stop running for-profit enterprises. They better be called for-loss enterprises since a ‘kingdom of clerks’ can’t run businesses. Period. Put the same money you are putting in the PSUs in a bank fixed deposit, and you will earn 10 times more interest. Spend that money on hospitals and schools.

He meant it. He proved it. His legacy was written in blood.

46 years later, after killing 6 million people, Stalin laid in his bed dying.

Stalin’s personal physician was unavailable. Why? Because he was in a dungeon being tortured — for having suggested Stalin didn’t look well and needed rest.

This is the legacy of Russia’s leadership: savage paranoia and power consolidation. Imprisonment for doing your job.

When Stalin’s security guards found him unconscious, they were too afraid to call for help. Decision-making was too centralized. They feared Stalin would wake up and realize they’d called for help without his permission.

James Fennell,Updated 3y,Has there ever been a push for something like the Second Amendment in the UK? Is there a way to protect themselves by force from the government?,"The Peterloo Massacre 1819. We don’t want that again.

I’ve answered this question before.

The British had the same problem as the American colonists, but demanded and got a different solution.

In days of yore the British had a Militia to maintain law and order. If there was ‘trouble at mill’ the county Sheriff or his Magistrates would call out the Militia. The Militia were armed volunteers in the service of the Crown. Usually minor land owners, small businessmen and tenant farmers who could afford a weapon and a horse.

Sounds familiar? That’s because the same system was established in the American and Australian colonies.

In the village where I live there is an ‘Armoury Hall’, where the militia kept their weapons, funded by the local worthies, to restore order and keep the highwaymen, free-miners, sheep worriers, rum-smugglers and other surly ruffians, cads and blackguards at bay.

Trouble was that as Britons demanded more rights and freedoms they were no longer content to be threatened and even attacked by the Militia every time they demonstrated for the vote or against some draconian government measure.

The whole thing came to a head in 1819, when the Government called out the Yeomanry (militia on horseback) when a crowd gathered in Manchester to demonstrate against the corn laws and for better representation (also sounds familiar?).

The corn laws (for anyone who is interested) fixed the price of corn above the market rate after the Napoleonic Wars, to prevent farmers going bust when cheap imports starting flooding in from Europe - o.k. if you are a farmer but bad news if you are factory worker in the new fast growing cities like Manchester, and need to buy bread to feed your family. So the factory workers wanted the vote.

Anyway to cut a long story short, the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry charged the 60,000 strong crowd in St. Peters Field in the city centre, killing 18 and injuring 400–600. The press called it the Peterloo Massacre, and from that day onwards the idea of armed policing was a complete politcal no-no.

So when thirty years later (by which time, after the Great Reform Act, most male freeholders had the vote) it was decided to form a police force, to deal with an explosion of petty crime in these same new industrial cities, there was no way they could be a military force or armed with lethal weapons.

The result was the uniquely British model of ‘policing by consent’. The police was to be a civilian outfit, armed only with the law - a warrant card giving them powers of arrest - who patrolled the streets with the consent of the people.

What the British had done to protect their freedom was to prevent the government arming itself against them, and thus there was (and still is) no reason for the people to take up arms against the state. Indeed if we did, then the Militia would be back, and we don’t want that again.

The way we protect ourselves against the Government is with the vote, and we don’t let the police carry weapons they may use against us, except in exceptional circumstances (when one of our number breaks the covenant and uses lethal force for criminal intent, or to threaten our democracy with terrorism).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o8ij01xg26p9rnbl', 'title': 'Has there ever been a push for something like the Second Amendment in the UK?

We don’t want that again.\n\nI’ve answered this question before.\n\nThe British had the same problem as the American colonists, but demanded and got a different solution.\n\nIn days of yore the British had a Militia to maintain law and order. If there was ‘trouble at mill’ the county Sheriff or his Magistrates would call out the Militia. The Militia were armed volunteers in the service of the Crown. Usually minor land owners, small businessmen and tenant farmers who could afford a weapon and a horse.\n\nSounds familiar? That’s because the same system was established in the American and Australian colonies.\n\nIn the village where I live there is an ‘Armoury Hall’, where the militia kept their weapons, funded by the local worthies, to restore order and keep the highwaymen, free-miners, sheep worriers, rum-smugglers and other surly ruffians, cads and blackguards at bay.\n\nTrouble was that as Britons demanded more rights and freedoms they were no longer content to be threatened and even attacked by the Militia every time they demonstrated for the vote or against some draconian government measure.\n\nThe whole thing came to a head in 1819, when the Government called out the Yeomanry (militia on horseback) when a crowd gathered in Manchester to demonstrate against the corn laws and for better representation (also sounds familiar?).\n\nThe corn laws (for anyone who is interested) fixed the price of corn above the market rate after the Napoleonic Wars, to prevent farmers going bust when cheap imports starting flooding in from Europe - o.k. if you are a farmer but bad news if you are factory worker in the new fast growing cities like Manchester, and need to buy bread to feed your family. So the factory workers wanted the vote.\n\nAnyway to cut a long story short, the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry charged the 60,000 strong crowd in St. Peters Field in the city centre, killing 18 and injuring 400–600. The press called it the Peterloo Massacre, and from that day onwards the idea of armed policing was a complete politcal no-no.\n\nSo when thirty years later (by which time, after the Great Reform Act, most male freeholders had the vote) it was decided to form a police force, to deal with an explosion of petty crime in these same new industrial cities, there was no way they could be a military force or armed with lethal weapons.\n\nThe result was the uniquely British model of ‘policing by consent’.

John Wagner. “There’s a Reason I Don’t Drink at Parties”.,4y,Why did the Democrat-controlled VA government reject Gov. Northam’s assault weapons ban?,"Probably because almost all of them had calls from constituents who made it entirely clear that loss of a job was definitely on the menu next election if they supported the bills.

How do you ban something which doesn’t exist. What is an assault weapon?

It would be like banning sports cars because they are dangerous and people get killed.

Now, define sports car? Is it a car which goes over a certain speed? One which accelerates too quickly?

We will need to be banning electric cars or governing them down. You watch. They will be governed in a hurry. Imagine what a weapon an autonomous vehicle which can be accelerated into the mid 100’s in nothing flat? Using a remote and a drone you could high speed attack with a kinetic energy weapon. Fill it with flammable liquids and scrap metal. Make it very heavy and flammable.

Are electric cars now to be classified as “Assault Vehicles”?

You can turn anything heavy enough to drop on someone from a third floor window into a murder weapon. How many people could be killed and maimed by a vehicle? We are already well on our way to being controlled at all times.

By the way. A $75 pump pellet gun can put a .177 caliber pellet right through your brain. Guns kill. Guns also prevent far more killings than they ever cause.

Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore,5y,What are the steps taken by the Modi government to encourage the sport culture in the country?,"Thanks for asking this question. PM Narendra Modi ji firmly believes that sports is absolutely essential for overall development. He has said in the past that the character development of those who have sports as a regular part of their lifestyle is at a higher level. Thus, broad-basing of sports, and taking sports to grassroots, has always been a focus area for us.

Some people think that there is a dichotomy here: you can either focus on elite athletes or you can take sports to the masses but not both. However, I reject this dichotomy. In fact both approaches are interwoven. Without taking sports to the masses, and without finding talent when it is young, we cannot produce world class athletes. This philosophy is reflected in many steps we have taken, some of which are enumerated below:

1. Khelo India:

Khelo India – especially its revamped version – is truly a game changer for Indian sports. With 12 verticals aimed at various target groups like women, children and rural areas, we aim to address all segments of society and make them part of India’s sports culture.

To this end, we have decided to allocate 1756 crore rupees for the holistic development of sports under Khelo India scheme alone.

2. Long-term athlete development program:

The trick to create champions is to catch the talent young. This is exactly what our long-term athlete development program aims to do.

Under this, we will select, through Khelo India school games and various other nation championships happening around the year, 1000 budding young athletes every year.

These athletes will receive training and a scholarship of 5 lakh rupees per year for 8 years. Moreover, this program itself will add 1000 new athletes annually, for 8 years.

Thus, this program envisions that at the end of 15 years, we will have a large number of champion athletes ready in every focus sport.

Moreover, by providing young athletes with scholarships, we seek to address the question of financial stability for them. We seek to make sports a viable career option.

3. Development of coaches:

However, you cannot have great athletes without great coaches. We plan to train coaches at and for every level, so that there is an organic steady progression linkage in the training that an athlete receives over his entire career – from playground to podium.

A cascading model of Community Coach Development will be adopted for development of community coaches across the country. Under this, 2000 accredited PETs will act as master trainees and impart training to community coaches and teams. The designated institutes for the same will be Lakshmibai National Institute for Physical Education, Gwalior, and various institutes of SAI.

In addition, if we want the best, we have to pay them well. To that end, recently, we have decided to DOUBLE the salary cap for Indian coaches from rupees 1 lakh per month to rupees 2 lakh per month. Needless to say this will help us attract quality coaches.

4. Enhanced support for TOPS athletes:

Financial stability and security is possibly the most pressing question for our athletes, and anyone wanting to choose sports as a career in India. We wanted to ensure that this does not undermine or affect athletes’ performance in any way. This is why we decided to make our star athletes covered under TOPS eligible for 50,000 rupees per month as out-of-pocket expenditure. It’s a small but significant step towards making sports financially viable as a career. This sum, by the way, is in addition to the dietary and other allowances our athletes already receive.

5. National Sports University:

We are in the process of establishing a first-of-its-kind National Sports University in Manipur. The relevant law has already been enacted by the Parliament. With 4 schools and 13 departments, this university will offer courses in sports medicine, sports psychology, sports management, sports journalism and largely every aspect of a complete 360º sports ecosystem. This is why this university is such an important step forward – it encompasses sports holistically, something unprecedented for India.

The university has already started offering courses, and we will be offering those courses through pilot centers running across the country.

This is a partial list of the major steps taken by us for the promotion of sports in the country. For paucity of time and words, I have to keep the list partial, but it does cover the major focus areas we have in mind.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5zyn0v7w9md3sixb', 'title': 'What are the steps taken by the Modi government to encourage the sport culture in the country?', 'score': {'original': 0.3075, 'ai': 0.6925}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Thanks for asking this question.

Rohit,Updated 4y,What are your views on the new cabinet in the Modi government 2019?,"Too happy for the way Sushma Swaraj is being replaced.

When I got to know that Sushma Swaraj won't be a part of Modi 2.0, I couldn't find a best candidate for EAM (External Affairs Minister) even after thinking for 10 minutes.

Then came the Modi's masterstroke.

There I saw an unusual face in the middle of all politicians.

It was S. Jaishankar, IFS (Indian Foreign Service) 1977 batch.

He served as Foreign Secretary in Modi 1.0.
He was Ambassador to China and USA.
The man who played a key role in Nuclear deal with US.
An expert in Russian, Japanese, and Hungarian language.
The man who handled Devyani Khobragade controversy.
The man who played an important role in India joining MTCR (Missile Technology Control Regime).
Finally, the man who showed China its way in Doklam.

With S. Jaishankar as EAM and NSA Ajit Doval, I am damn sure that India will be following an aggressive foreign policy in coming years.

I see India going strong for an UNSC permanent member status with P5 countries along with Brazil and South Africa (IBSA Group) and NSG membership by 2024.

Assured that,

Tough days are ahead for Pakistan and China wrt diplomacy.

Colin Riegels,1y,"If Roe v. Wade is overturned, why don't women simply make mass migration out of the danger state to more abortion-friendly states? Mass depopulation will force employers to leave and pressure the state government to adapt or die, no?","You often get questions like this Quora: “why don’t people simply move state, or move country”.

There is nothing simple about it when it comes to packing up, leaving your home, leaving your family and friends, leaving your job, pulling your children out of school, and starting over in a new location.

But is interesting that the although there are a large number of states which have ‘trigger’ laws or which have indicated that they will ban abortion completely if Roe is overturned, a lot of those are already fairly lightly populated states. In terms of the US population, by far the larger part of it is in states where the right to an abortion will subsist even if Roe is overturned.

The states with trigger laws are Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.

Scott Dismukes,Updated 3y,"Are all laws ultimately backed up by an implied but real governmental capacity for force, by ""the gun"" if you will?","You have only to look at Shelley Luther. She lives 80 miles or so outside of Dallas, rescues horses from abusive and negligent owners. She also owns a hair salon in Dallas where she leases space to hairdressers. She is not, herself, a hairdresser.

Along comes Covid and the city of Dallas shuts down her business. After a bit, as other businesses are allowed to reopen, she reopens hers. Now salons and bars and gyms and the like are not allowed to reopen. But she does anyway. She spaces out her tenants, she does all the masking and cleaning the other places do. Her tenants are hungry and getting behind on house payments. She feels obligated to open up. So the city sends her a letter. Shut down or else. She stands on the courthouse steps and rips up the letter. In front of all the news crews.

The city throws her in jail for a week. The judge opts to lecture her. After the Governor declares jail time is NOT a valid response to unsanctioned openings, they let her go. But they persist in trying to find something to throw her back into jail over. Eventually the city capitulates to the Governor’s ruling.

So she’s running for state Senator and is in a tight runoff with a career politician type.

So the city was fully prepared to throw her into a hole for disobeying their edict, not even a law. Imagine what they’d do if she violated an actual law? If she resisted, they would most certainly use ever more force - even gunfire. No one is permitted to defy the government if they choose to enforce their position.

There are clearly situations where the government isn’t willing to go that far. I think of the rancher stand-off in Oregon - the government backed down when it became apparent how serious the people were about defying them. Outright war was pending. Saner minds prevailed there.

Scott Steward,3y,"Does the 2nd Amendment say what arms the right to bear refers to? If not, then is it up to the government and judiciary to decide?","The Second Amendment states that “The Right of The People to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed”. Period. Full stop. It does not have any “except for” clause. So it covers all arms, from spears and swords to any other weapon the owner can make or afford to purchase and operate.

At the time it was written, individuals owned rifles that were far superior in range and accuracy to the firearms issued to the most powerful army of the time, the British Regular army. American civilians owned cannons, the artillery of the day. They owned fully armed ships capable of fighting against British warships. And guess what, after the 2A was passed and ratified, they still owned and carried their superior rifles, owned their artillery pieces, and their armed ships. There was no confiscation or “buy-back” or illegalization of any of their private weaponry. The Second Amendment clearly is not meant to restrict private citizens to only have weapons far inferior to police or military. Quite the opposite.

Moreover, just a few years later, the most decisive battle of the War of 1812 was fought by motley collection of American gunboats against an assembled British fleet, and a motley collection of militia, pirates, Native Americans and frontiersmen with their own personal rifles, powder, and shot against an organized, trained, and fully equipped army of British regular soldiers, wherein the Americans won a decisive victory against the most powerful army and navy in the world at that time. The result was the end of British efforts to harass and recover their former colonies, and the full recognition in both diplomatic and trade matters, of a fully independent nation called the United States of America, which then expanded from sea to shining sea.

So by clear written text of the Constitution, by historical evidence and precedent, and by enactment in a history-changing battle, the Second Amendment does not limit the arms available to private citizens. In fact, the Constitution still authorizes issuance of Letters of Marque, which presupposes that private citizens shall even now own and operate private vessels outfitted with armaments sufficient and effective to interdict foreign shipping on the high seas.

Robert Side,1y,"In other countries with socialized healthcare, why are they comfortable with the government managing their healthcare? The government shouldn’t be responsible (or trusted) to provide healthcare for its people.","My wife is worried about melanoma. We pay a private clinic $209.00 once a year to map her whole body for suspicious moles etc. We do this because it is a dedicated expert service, and takes pressure off the GP system. This year they found one.

Off to the doctor, who agreed to whip it off that afternoon. So a 15m consultation, 30 minute operation, nurse assisting, etc. Total cost $12. The excised flesh was sent to a diagnostic lab for analysis. Unfortunately positive. Total cost $0. Doctor called, said a referral to a specialist surgeon was needed.

This took place the following week: 30 minute consultation, further surgery was scheduled. Total cost $6.00 for parking.

Although the surgery was deemed a priority, it was 2 weeks before it was scheduled as it had to be coordinated between plastic surgeons, radiologists, and overnight bed availability. On the day of surgery, there was an hour’s scanning to locate lymph nodes, then 4 hour’s surgery to remove a larger area around the melanoma, plus 4 lymph nodes, followed by an overnight stay on a ward in a private room. We met with two surgeons, the anaesthetist, nurse assisting, plus others before the operation. Total cost $13.00 for parking, plus $17.50 for lunch for me.

The next day she was discharged, total cost $3.00 for parking.

Two days after, we visited the District Nurse for a dressing change, unfortunately due to the nature of the surgery she was unable to lift her arm high enough and was sent to the Emergency Department so anaesthetic could be administered. For various reasons this turned into a 9 hour saga. Total cost: $0.00.

Today the District Nurse visited us at home to check there were no further problems (and there weren’t). Total cost: $0.00

A further 2 nurse visits are scheduled, total cost $0.00

A follow up surgeon’s consultation is scheduled in 3 weeks, total cost $0.00

No government or bureaucrats in sight, all decisions made by doctors, surgeons, nurses or wife.

No worries about insurance companies, co-payment, loans, mortgages, or finding money for food.

The passengers who had originally reserved the seats had not turned up, so he took the liberty of giving away their seats, and fill his own pocket.

Each ticket checker also gets a seat, and this gentleman even gave away his seat for 1500 rupees.

What is the big deal?

He made 3500 rupees on a short distance, from Bangalore to Hampi.

Then this happened that day.

The compartment in which he had given away seats caught fire. The three passengers also died. He was in a different compartment when this happened. So, he survived.

The passenger he gave his own seat to, did not get any compensation, as nobody knew who he was.

The two passengers who had reserved their seats and had not turn up, were presumed dead. Until they showed up and told that they never even boarded the train.

The ticket checker in question, upon seeing the burning compartment, had ripped his trousers, burnt a bit off his shirt and suitcase, and threw away all the reservation charts.

In the inquiry, he told the authorities that he somehow managed to escape, as he was awake, and there was not aware who was sleeping in the two seats that were empty.

No reservation charts were found as he had thrown them away in the fire.

Rapid rollout of cashless infrastructure to rural India. Besides POS terminals, the emphasis could be on more incentives for smartphone penetration and internet connectivity. There might even be special schemes for women - as their smartphone usage is low. Target 100% smartphone penetration by the end of the first term.
Making it illegal to do cash payments for any purchases above Rs. 20000. Everything from cars and homes and home appliances and jewelry to be bought through cashless payments. Like in the developed world, anyone having wads of cash will be looked at suspiciously.
Enacting benami transactions bill to impede purchasing property with other people’s names.
Greater transparency in real estate transactions through a new act.
Finally, the Direct Benefit Transfer for all government subsidies. Instead of the government giving you cheap kerosene, power, urea etc, the intended beneficiaries will get money directly sent to their account. That will let government machinery focused on real problems.

A length of rope, a weight (commonly a lead ball about 1″ in diameter). A bit of whipping cord (black in this picture) to make it look pretty and last longer.

that we have so many checks and balances in the system?

Checks and balances are a lovely theoretical idea, which many governments adhere to—so long as it politically and practically expedient.

Very often, politicians test the boundaries of their permissible conduct. Usually? Nothing happens. Often, the “check” against them will endorse their behavior. And so, the check in theory is often a practical rubber-stamp. “See we at least checked it, and we approve.”

And so, government power slowly expands.

Then, there are the other occasions where some part of the system simply chooses not to acknowledge their constitutional restrictions. They simply find an alternate explanation. The officer feared for his life. Or a threat of imminent danger. Or some vague threat to national security. Or some gossamer foreign enemy several thousand miles away.

But often? The rationale is simply that the government could not do its job if it were checked. Which is becoming an increasingly successful argument.

We have checks. In theory. But their diligent application is never guaranteed. Checks can and often do fail.

Aniruddh Kamath,Updated 3y,What are some signs that tell that the Indian Army is getting stronger under the Modi government?,"Thanks for the A2A.

EDIT 1(04–06–2020): After suggestions by many, I am cutting off unnecessary info and also thank you, everybody, for the amazing response. I will instead limit it to mainly a list of major latest equipment purchased, so everybody comes to know what our Modiji did for the armed forces. Also taking down the specification -the number of pieces brought.

NOTE: But I will take down the numbers only on equipment like Bulletproof jackets but not missiles or Rafale jets as they are something very common.

Also, India the 4th Biggest Military spender: India was 4th biggest military spender last year

First I would suggest you read the book - Securing India The Modi Way by Nitin Gokhale. It clears all such doubts.
But before you read more just keep in mind this one thing - What The Modi Govt has done for the country not even a minor part of it was done by the previous NSA. I will specify more on what all he has done but the main thing is -' Giving Pak a befitting reply'.
Since the Modi Govt came to rule not a single major terror attack took place outside the valley. He taught Pak what they will have to go through if they hurt India. It knows that the Kashmir that they are dying for is just approx 16,000 sq km behind whom they are like ' Allah ' but Balochistan is 45 per cent of Pakistan's landmass so over there they would have great difficulty. In 2015 Ajit Doval was quoted saying "" If Pakistan conducts another 26/11 type attack then it will have to lose Balochistan. Today whatever they are doing in Kashmir sooner or later they will have to suffer 10 times more in Balochistan. Just like how they require a passport to travel to Bangladesh the same way they would require a passport to travel to Balochistan. This is mainly what stops Pak from major terror attacks. They are scared of India! And obviously our Army intelligence and also the army guys stop them…
The army didn’t have Bulletproof jackets, Rifle Accessories, Light Bulletproof helmets, New SUVs, Artillery, New Light strike vehicles, Anti Tank Missiles, Small tactical drones and quadcopters.
BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS THAT EVERYTHING WAS IMPORTED AS IMPORTS GAVE HEFTY KICKBACKS. Proof of which are Denel, Augusta Westland, Finmeccanica all of them date backs to 2004–2014.

Going one-by-one:

BulletProof Jacket:
• Batch 1: By Tata and MKU

• Batch 2: SMPP Pvt Ltd with Tech transfer from DRDO.

(Batch 2 contained pieces triple than that of Batch 1)

Gun Accessory:
Army wants new guns, but seeing the long process the present government gave go-ahead for massive modernisation of existing arms which included installing Rails to accommodate various optical sights and modified handguards.

All the modifications are done mostly by OFB or FAB defence (an Israeli company).

BulletProof Helmets:

MKU, Kanpur: Almost 2 Lac+

An Infantry pre-2015 even in an operationally hot area looked like this “Ram Bharose”

Today it’s much better:

New SUVs and LSUVs:

The Tata Safari Storme is now standard SUV of the army:

The New Light Strike Vehicle is: Force Motor Gurkha

Orders bagged by local manufacturers in recent years for Forces

Force Gurkha: 4×4 LSV

Ashok Leyland: FAT 6×6 (450)

10×10 Super Stallion (81)

4×4 Ambulances (825)[https://defence-blog.com/army/indian-army-has-ordered-825-ashok-leyland-ambulance-4x4.html
]

TATA: Multi-Axle Trucks (1200)

Safari STORME (3192)

Xenon Pickup 1Door (500) & 2Door (52)

ARTILLERY: These were the first artillery purchase and modernisation in 30 Years.

ZU 23–2 Upgrade: Punj-Lloyd and OFB.[Upgrade of ZU-23mm 2B Air Defence Gun]

Akash 1S SAM: DRDO

L-70 Upgrade: BEL:[Indian Army receives 2 BEL-made L70 upgrade guns]

DRDO ATAGS: 1200+

OFB-Metamorphosis

Small Tactical Drones:

Spy-Lite Drone:

Idea-forge Netra drone:

Add to all these Rs 40000 Crs to the army to whatever they wanna buy on an emergency basis and without much government interference.

Indian Air Force:

The biggest purchases were:

DRDO AEW&C: 4

Astra BVR:

Swati WLR: Inducted

Rafale:36

LCA Tejas: 40+83

[Did not take down LCA TEJAS manufacture numbers as it is manufactured by our own Hindustan Aeronautics Company(HAL) and the figures are clearly available in the public domain]

Turbofan Engine for UCAVs:

It is a commendable job indeed. The Manik engine is being prepared for the first prototype of the AURA UCAV programme named SWiFT. Thus showing the UCAV programme is moving well under the wraps.

The engine’s technology transfer has been done to several private players including Bharat forge. The one with the best quality will be finally selected for supplying engine for the UCAV.

Not only this UCAV programme, but we can also use this engine for smaller Jet powered reconnaissance UAVs like a smaller jet-engined Rustom with a limited weapons payload.

Apache Choppers: 36

[NOTE: The number of Apaches are also easily available on the net.]

HAL-LCH: (Almost 190) As of now IOC achieved.

INDIAN NAVY:

The biggest achievement was:

Operationalising the Arihant nuclear-powered submarine

Opereatinalise K-15 Nuclear-Capable SLBM.

Since the Question deals with only hardware procurement I shall keep the scope of the answer limited to this further when defence R&D is concerned keeping the record of present Modi government in front of the Congress shall bring bigger embarrassment to them.

Overall I would rate the present Government 10/10 and the previous one 2.5/10 that includes No R&D, Corruption, delay, No private sector participation.

Somebody wants even more comprehensive report, here is it from Parliament’s standing committee report:

Parliamentary Standing committee on defence report 43 suggests otherwise:

This isn’t the days of old where you barely knew people the town over.

The American Military started doing something few other militaries had, after The American Civil War, that would prevent such a massive breakdown from ever happening again. They started mixing the military up. Gone are the days of the Pennsylvania Regiment and the Maryland Regiment. You’re now serving with comrades from all over the country.

We also live in the digital age. The country is more homogenous than it used to be. We are more connected. If we bombed our own citizens, we’d be reading about it on Facebook the next day from our High School friends, and the command structure would fracture.

The military wouldn’t unanimously break apart, but the US citizens would find themselves as not just guerrillas, but augmenting Active military units. The Navy and Air Force would be inoperable in many cases.

It’s not weapons that civilians have in their favor.

It’s the communications.

We servicemembers are cut from the same cloth as the rest of America.

The current Archbishop of Canterbury then blesses the subject's hands with Wolfsbane in an ancient English ritual.

The subject is then tasked with drawing the sword from the stone.

If he fails, he's sectioned under the mental health act for life.

However, if he succeeds. Then Parliment is dissolved, the current royal family is dethroned and King Arthur claims absolute power and people in Great Britain no longer have to pay taxes.

Valerie Rhea,Feb 16,I advocate zero government growth for the next five years. What do you say?,"As a practical matter, this is quite unlikely for the simple reason that the vast majority of our spending involves wealth redistribution programs that explode in cost, no matter what we might hope for. The sad truth is that Americans have designed a system that expands under its own power, no matter what we might try to do.

Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Obamacare subsidies, and so forth are “entitlements” - anyone meeting the basic requirements is entitled to benefits. Between our aging population, inflation, and the influx of low-skilled workers, the number of Americans eligible for these programs climbs steadily. In fact, the CBO tells us that about 60% of all Americans receive some sort of subsidy from the Federal government.

From our past as rugged individualists, America has transitioned to a nation dependent on handouts from government, it would appear.

That’s bad enough, but many of these programs have escalating benefits baked into the system. Social Security, for instance, has COLA (Cost Of Living Adjustments) that automatically raises benefits in sync with inflation. Between population growth and inflation running high, many of these costly programs are rising in cost at 5–7% a year, and the dirty secret politicians don’t like to talk about is that even at these rates, many of these systems are headed for bankruptcy within the next decade.

Despite that, imagine the uproar if someone were to suggest that Grandma didn’t deserve her Social Security check to grow in value one year…better to bankrupt the nation than to suggest such a thing, I suppose.

The interest on the national debt is also a vast problem…in 2023, for instance, for the first time in modern US history, America spent more in interest payments on the national debt than on the entire US military. Given our skyrocketing debt and the trend towards higher interest rates, our debt service cost is on track to rise by literally hundreds of billions a year for the foreseeable future. In the not-too-distant future, these interest payments will become the single largest expense our government has.

The grim reality is that even if Congress locked virtually all discretionary spending at today’s levels, overall government spending would continue to climb by about 4%. To achieve the net-zero spending increase that the question contemplates would therefore require us to cut discretionary spending - that’s spending on military, education, energy, infrastructure, and so on - by about 10% a year. Compounded over the five-year period as suggested, this means cutting spending across everything except entitlements by a massive 61%.

It’s hard to picture what America would feel like if we cut discretionary spending by 61% so as not to touch our entitlement programs. Not only would the US military find itself unable to fulfill its current commitments, but countless military contractors and manufacturers would likely end up bankrupt. Federal law enforcement, the CIA, NSA, DoJ and so on would face radical cutbacks. I imagine the FAA, NASA and our National Parks would be relics of the past, and we could forget about education subsidies, R&D investments, roads and bridges and all sorts of other government programs. On top of this, a million government workers could easily find themselves unemployed, forcing us into an even more dire situation as we paid various unemployment and welfare benefits to these former workers.

Follow this for eight years instead of five, and America would find herself in the perverse place of spending just as much as we do today, but getting virtually nothing except wealth redistribution for it. No funding for the courts, so I imagine we’d resort to the law of the jungle to settle our differences. No diplomatic core or foreign ambassadors, so we’d be completely isolated in the world. Not even salaries for Congress and the millions of Federal workers out there. With no way to defend ourselves, perhaps China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea would come and put us out of our misery. Or, perhaps the last act of a dying America would be to trigger nuclear armageddon, and the whole world could start over again once the fallout disappears…

The point is, if we don’t find a way to resolve the drain that our entitlement programs represent, there is no possibility at all of getting government spending under control. Until Americans are ready to have that conversation in a nonpartisan and realistic way, we are facing eventual economic collapse.

Sadly, Democrats insist on clinging to fantasy and class warfare, while Republicans seem to fear being labeled the bad guys. In retrospect, our demise can be traced back to just three of our Presidents: FDR (Social Security), LBJ (Medicare), and Obama (Obamacare). Still, that we are powerless to undo their damage means we just careen along towards a catastrophe that’s easy to see coming.

As a nation, we seem impotent to fix even the most obvious of problems. Perhaps it will take some sort of economic collapse to wake us, but until then, I’m not optimistic about the US getting on a more sustainable path.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ukpsqgcn7v2jo9ha', 'title': 'I advocate zero government growth for the next five years.

Elijah Krause,2y,What do Minnesotans think about Jesse Ventura's tenure as governor?,"This reminds me of a funny conversation I heard about former Governor Ventura.

The other guy is a self-described anarchist who once spent a few months in prison for doing anarchist shit.

They are complete opposites on the political spectrum.

Weirdly enough however, through some back-asswards horseshoe theory shenanigans, they agree on a surprising amount of things, most relevantly, that Jesse Ventura was a great governor.
