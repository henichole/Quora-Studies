Girish Arora,Updated 5y,What is the secret to success?,"Have you ever tried pooping in public toilets? Like in school, office, etc?

You sit in one of the cabin near other cabins. Now, you are little bit nervous because there is some other person sitting in the cabin next to you and he can listen to your fart, or sound of splash when your poop touches water :D.

You try to keep it low, or you just keep using flush regularly to suppress it. But somehow you know it is not going to help. You being nervous or afraid to get embarrassed, gets so uncomfortable to poop that you can't do it properly :p.

Now, consider you went to same toilet with your headphones on. Just like this:

As you can’t hear anything now, or you are so occupied with your favorite song, you will be able to poop properly. Mission accomplished.

Similarly, if you want to succeed in life, you need to focus on the only thing you want to do, regardless of what people will think/judge.

Ishtmeet Singh,Updated 4y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"This may change your life, or a part of it, for sure.

You must know this man, right?

For those who don’t know, this gentleman is Cristiano Ronaldo, born in Portugal, is one of the most popular and talented players in Football history.

One fine day, Cristiano Ronaldo dressed up as a homeless man, with moustache and beard - went out in Madrid City to show some Football skills anonymously.

His appearance? This is how he was looking in that make-up -

No one could’ve imagined Cristiano Ronaldo behind that make up. He picks up his football, ties his (borrowed) dog to a chair and starts doing kick-ups. The disguise works.

No-one gives him a second glance. To everyone else in the Plaza, he just looks like a homeless guy trying to earn a few euros from the locals.

Occasionally, passers-by will stop to watch the homeless man's impressive football skills, especially when he decides to replicate Ronaldo's trade-mark step-overs.

Several hours pass before the heart-warming pay-off finally happens. A kid decides to play with him and the two take part in a bit of one-on-one.

After few moments, Ronaldo gives him a hug (still dressed as a tramp), picks up the ball and signs it.

The little boy looks confused, wondering why this man has signed the football - that is until Ronaldo begins to peel off the disguise, leaving his new best friend in open-mouthed wonder and on the verge of (happy) tears.

And, no doubt, everyone else was shocked.

There’s a lesson :

No one gives a fuck to your football skills, unless you're Ronaldo.

What should you learn from this?

No one in this world cares who you are, what you are doing, and what you’re going to do unless you’re someone very famous.

If you’ve an aim in life, don’t be worried about - what will he/she think about it? If you have a doubt, raise your hand and ask your professor/teacher about it, because at the end, no one cares if you ask or you choose to remain silent. If you’re thinking about a startup, consider making it a reality without a thought of - what will he/she think if it fails.

There are 7.8 billion people in this world, you can’t expect everyone to appreciate what you’re doing. Instead, you need to appreciate what you’re doing, and continue doing it.

I’ve started applying this formula in my life, and I’ve become a very strong person, than I was an year ago.

This might be the secret mantra of success.

Johnny Reinsch,5y,How can we make the world a better place?,"“Why don’t you high five a different person every day for a month?” one of my engineers challenged me.

He’d always make fun of my month-long challenges. I did the ketogenic diet, worked out every day, and meditated every morning—among other things.

So I accepted.

On the 1st day, I high fived my wife.
On the 2nd day, I high fived my CTO.
On the 3rd day, I high fived my neighbor.

Things got interesting when I ran out of people I knew to high five.

I’d stop strangers in the street and say something like, “Oh man, that’s a sweet dog!” and “Hey, I’m loving that jacket!”

I felt vulnerable putting my hand up and smiling. There was no assurance that they’d high five me back. We live in a society where mistrust is the norm.

But 9 cases out of 10, the other person would high five me. Their face would break into a smile, and we’d share this moment of electric joy that would never have happened between two strangers otherwise.

It was amazing.

They walked away with a little extra bounce in their step.

And so did I.

Who knows what such ripples of happiness can create?

I realized that we’ve got a chronic deficit of kindness.

And that working on it one high five a time—

Is not a bad way of tipping the scales.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mqy9ew3ks6idt28o', 'title': 'How can we make the world a better place?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“Why don’t you high five a different person every day for a month?” one of my engineers challenged me.\n\nHe’d always make fun of my month-long challenges.

Mamta Satywali,Updated 6y,How do you increase the value of a white paper without writing on it?,"1.Take two big bowls filled with saffron and green color respectively.

2.Hold the white paper breadthwise and make sure the ratio of sides is 3:2(length x breadth) as shown below.

3.Dip the upper 1/3rd rectangle of the sheet into the bowl full of saffron color, as shown next.

4.Dip the lower 1/3rd part of rectangle into the bowl containing green color.You’ll get something like this:

5.Take a smaller bowl , paint its rim with navy blue color and press it down exactly at the center of this rectangle, like this:

6.Finally, take a matchstick or toothpick(or any stick of similar girth) whose length is equal to the radius of the bowl used in point 5.Now, dip this stick in the same navy blue color and paint the circle above with 24 equal radii partitions to get something similar to this:

Rajnish Prajapat,Updated 5y,What are some examples of very simple startup ideas that turned out to be successful?,"Pulse Candy -

1 Rupee candy crossed 100 crores sale in just 8 months and 300 crores sale in just 2 years.

It was started with a simple idea, A candy laced with black salt in the centre.

It was a simple, one-line brief:

If the product is tangy then your eyes should close automatically to relish it or else it is no fun.

That was the lone instruction from Rajiv Kumar, vice chairman of the DS Group for his R&D team working on the Pulse candy.

DSG spent no amount on advertising and promotions, and the candy gained popularity through word of mouth (probably because it’s a great product).

Many people referred the candy to their friends and relatives. People even went to the extent of making ‘Pulse – Fan Communities’ on FB. Some even called it ‘The Pulse of the Nation’.

This candy has surpassed all competition and beaten all the records by crossing the 100 crore mark in just 8 months! This figure equals the record for heavily advertised Coke Zero, Coca Cola’s diet drink!

Kaustav Dey,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"I really don’t remember where I heard this about, but this is truly an awesome hack that I have known and employ.

Life will always have competitions. A life without competitions is actually quite boring. As you all probably know, you cannot always win . Life isn’t that optimistic and fair.

Most of the time, our competitor is one who enjoys our defeat more than the prize at hand . The best way to rob them of this ‘sinister’ joy is to smile at them after losing. Yes, you read it right. I am asking you to show a sign of happiness after you lose. But trust me, this will totaly wreck your opponent's pride and ego after winning, and if you are lucky you might just make a friend out of them.

This is not only a way to make a come back at your opponent, but is also a way to make you self realise that this is not the end. But rather a stepping stone for you to succeed.

Here is an image of two Olympic finalists after the match. The one in the left lost the match, but she doesn’t show any sign of anger and she made a friend out of her Spanish counterpart.

Don’t know if this qualifies as a smile.

Remember: “ The difference between a master and a novice is that a master has failed more times than the novice has tried.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8g7fcjrbkn65vlte', 'title': ""What is the most clever life hack you've learned?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I really don’t remember where I heard this about, but this is truly an awesome hack that I have known and employ.\n\nLife will always have competitions.

Eric Leow Yu Quan,Updated 5y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"How to cut any queue.

A social experiment conducted by a university showed some unprecedented results.

In this experiment, three men were tasked to cut into a long queue of customers waiting to buy some food. Each of the men were given one line to say -

May I go first?
May I go first, because I have a family emergency?
May I go first, because I need to get some food?

It turned out that the first option led to only about 40% of customers who agreed to let him cut. The second and third options saw a resounding 94% and 89% respectively.

However, if you take a look at the third option, you'll realize that the reason provided is rather nonsensical. After all, everyone is there to buy food right? At least the second option provided a more legitimate reason.

It showed that so long as you provide a reason, any reason, people will tend to let you go first, without asking too much.

I tried this when I wanted to use the lift today after walking my dog - usually, I don't share lifts with others since no one actually likes being in a confined area with a smelly dog.

However this time, I wasn't in a mood to wait. I simply wanted to go home fast and rest, so I told the people waiting, “Sorry, can I go up first, because I'm in a hurry to wash my printer?”

True, it was gibberish, but spoken confidently, vanquished even the slightest doubts. They were probably confused, but let me use the lift nonetheless.

This trick works really well if you're not going to be seeing the very people you're using it on anymore.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/e16hj3b7ponufwkr', 'title': ""What is the most clever life hack you've learned?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9805, 'ai': 0.0195}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""How to cut any queue.\n\nA social experiment conducted by a university showed some unprecedented results.\n\nIn this experiment, three men were tasked to cut into a long queue of customers waiting to buy some food.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am born third daughter in indian middleclass family. My parents were dying to have a son. My mother had sex determination tests done at second and third pregnancy, she wanted to abort but my father convinced her otherwise. When I was born she went into shock, refusing to feed me.

In my teens I remember her saying that she did not care much if we as kids were crying, she said slapping our faces made us stop crying.

Me and my sisters grew up confused, trying to put up a happy front, pleasing her. She was not very generous with her approvals. Appreciation from her was beyond our reach.

Her wardrobe was full of clothes she bought left and right. We got one dress every year. The two younger sisters would wear the handed down dress from the oldest. Needless to say, till the time I graduated, I have worn my elder sisters clothes.

After many abortions, my brother was born. We were finally relieved of the guilt of being born as girls. Now every thing was about him. Three of us were made to look after him at nights when he cried while she slept. The movie chandani was going hit that time. Sridevi dancing on the “9 choodiyan ” song was very famous. Two of us went to a choodi shop and bought the same 9 red choodi. Our giggling and laughter made the monster awake. Infront of my dad and few servants she called us “whores”.

Two of us did well acedemicaly, she would then compare our scores trying to make us fight. This was later about salaries.

Gifting her branded clothes, shoes, purses, mobiles did not make her happy. She would make faces. She would tell her friends that she bought all those. Always demeaning us infront of them.

I wanted to buy an apartment, I had saved some but was falling short of 1.5 lakhs for the down payment. I believed my parents would loan me that, and would also be my garantor. She created such drama instead of simply saying “no”. She refused after two days. Later a school friend told me my mother had loaned her 1 lakh for some renovation of her house. I did not know what to say.

When my daughter was two weeks, she was crying non stop. My mother was about to slap her when I stopped her. This made the monster inside her awake. Gossiping, spreading lies, making things difficult for me was the least, she went ahead with starving me in the name of weight gain, I was only 60 kgs!!!!

My father has been a silent spectator. Usually agreeing with her or then staying quiet.Like us he must also be confused.

I am 38 years old. I do not talk with my mother or my sisters. Sometimes I weep at nights. I am very good at maintaining a happy face. I am still trying to figure out why she did not help me with the loan. I try to forget about it.

My kids are awesome. I love them. I do not know how a mother should be. But I know how a mother should NOT be.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sypbm6fznx74l5v3', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.51865, 'ai': 0.48135}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am born third daughter in indian middleclass family.

Vicki Barnes,6y,What has been the lowest point in your life?,"I was 38 and my marriage was on the rocks. Although my husband and I both had graduated at the top of our class with AA and BA degrees, he found a good job right away and all I could find was temporary secretarial work.

I had supported him when he was jobless, but he seemed to lose all respect for me when I didn't find a well-paying job like his right away.

He moved into our spare bedroom down the hall and wouldn't talk about it. We owned one car, so he would take me to work in the morning, pick me up in the evening, drop me off at home, and then head right back to his office to do “volunteer computer work.”

We had $10,000 in credit card debt from struggling through school and jobless periods. We were paying the mortgage on a big old house that needed lots of repair.

I would have been okay with us splitting up and each taking half of the debt, but he refused to discuss it, and pretended that nothing was wrong.

One day I was in between temp jobs and my husband left his briefcase at home when he went to work. Inside it were travel-size bottles of shampoo. He never traveled for work, so I knew something was going on.

When I confronted him about it, all he would say was, “Are you afraid I'm going to leave you? I'm not going to leave.”

The situation was making me crazy. I had a dream about killing him with a kitchen knife, then finding his tombstone, which said, “Rest in Pieces.”

I started seeing a therapist every week, but when my husband had a single session, he told me that “There was nothing to talk about,"" so he wouldn't be going back. I started to dream about killing myself.

Every night I was stuck home alone while my husband was out with the car. Finally I told him I wanted to use the car after work to do some shopping. He didn't come home that night until 9:30.

I yelled at him and said the car belonged to both of us and he had it all the time. He ignored me. I tried to grab the car keys away from him, but he jerked them back, got in the car, and drove away. He didn't come home that night at all.

I took the bus to work and when I got back he still hadn't come home. I emptied the cat box onto his bed, I was so angry.

All our bills were due the next day. I used the rest of the money in our account to pay them, the way I did every month. His payday was in 2 days and I knew we’d have some money then.

But he never came back, and never put another cent into our bank account. But he did sneak back one day while I was at work and took his electric razor, some videos, and his clothes. I had to clean up the cat box mess on his bed by myself. I changed the locks.

When I saw my therapist, all he said was, ""Well, it looks like you have some decisions to make about your life."" When our session was over he drove off in his car and left me to walk home alone in the dark. I never went back to him again.

My husband kept the car, which was in both our names. I rented an auto for a few days with my paycheck and found our car a few blocks from his office. It wouldn't start, and when I tried to look under the hood I found he had somehow chained or wired it closed.

The bills were all in both our names as well, and since my husband had disappeared, all the collection companies came after me.

There was no hope of my making the credit card payments by myself. We had barely been keeping our heads above water with both our paychecks. Now my credit was ruined overnight.

I tried calling the credit card companies and offering to make low monthly payments until things got better. The first man I spoke to said, ""Don't even bother."" I didn't speak to anyone else after that.

I was making $9 an hour at a temporary job, which ended a week after he left. I got another temp job, and had to ride the bus to and from work. I'd spend my breaks and lunch hours crying in the bathroom, so despite my having good skills, the jobs never lasted long.

I sold my wedding ring and a lot of our possessions to keep the house from going into foreclosure. I was raiding the dumpsters behind grocery stores in order to eat, and was terrified I'd be caught and arrested.

All our friends disappeared. They knew things had ended badly, and they didn't want to get involved, so they just stayed away.

There was one friend who had been out of town. He called and told me he'd gone out for pizza with my husband. I yelled at him, ""Do you have any idea how long it's been since I've been able to afford a PIZZA?"" He hung up and I never heard from him again.

I cashed in our life insurance policy, and spent the $800 on a junker car that broke down every week or so. That car was towed so many times I was canceled by the auto club. I spent over $1400 on car repairs that first year.

I had no money to hire a lawyer or to file for bankruptcy. I was also afraid that I would lose the house in a bankruptcy situation, since I'd heard you were only allowed $10,000 equity in your home, and we had assumed our mortgage loan with $8000 three years earlier.

One morning as I was getting ready for work, I heard a loud crash upstairs. The wall of tiles above our bathtub had fallen in, and the tub was full of debris and broken tiles.

I'm pretty sure that was my lowest point. I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt I was in hell, and I didn't see anything ahead but blackness.

I'd like to say I got a good job and all my problems disappeared, but it didn't happen that way. It took me years to crawl out of the financial and psychological hole I was in.

I'm 64 now, and I've never considered marrying again. Somehow I paid off the house, which I now own free and clear. I'm debt free, and no longer have dreams about death and dying. But it took a long, long time. I hope no one else ever has to go through something like that.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sefplr70vh1b9jqo', 'title': 'What has been the lowest point in your life?', 'score': {'original': 0.072633333333333, 'ai': 0.92736666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I was 38 and my marriage was on the rocks.

Asim Qureshi,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"About 15 years ago I’m visiting my mother’s cousin after not seeing him for a long time.

A few hours into our meeting he stares at me and says “Asim son… why do you always smile at me when I look at you?”

Do I? I don’t know. And I tell him that.

I soon realise that I do smile a lot, and several years later I come to the view that it has played a key role in achieving the success I have attained at work and in business.

Smiling breaks down barriers, it makes tense situations into more comfortable ones, it makes you more attractive, it gives a sense of energy, it makes people want to be around you, it makes you more likeable, it makes people feel that you want to be around them, it makes people trust you.

Smiling is very powerful, massively underestimated.

And I semi-consciously knew it all along. Which is why I did it.

It also makes everyone happier, including you.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I was gential mutilated (Infibulation) by my parents when I was 9 years old.

For those who don't know the Infibulation… its a pharaonic mutilation, which is done through cutting the girl’s external genitalia.

I live in Sudan. I was 9. One day morning, my sister and I were taken to a woman who used to do this surgery. I remember the room, it was meesy and untidy.There was no privacy, lot’s of women were in the room looking, and some kids (who I don't remember where the hell did they come from!), were on the windows sneaking the glances and laughing, while I was crying. On the small table, there were cotton, water, razors and other stuff. I was terrified, loudly screaming and flinging. Two or three women held me so I can't move. I was begging. The womon took the razor and killed me.

At house People were celebrating, food and songs. I had to stay in the bed for several weeks. Visitors came to congratulate and give me money and gifts! the suffer didn't stop here. It was extremely hard to move, or sit for several weeks. Bathroom was always a catastrophe, the pain was untolerable lots of scream, blood, and tears.

Many years after, I questioned my mother. Why did she do it? As I was taught at school how devirly it is. She answered “to make you clean. It's our tradition, my mother did it. I did it, and you should do it to your future daughter, as well”. By the time I realized that my mom doesn't like to speak about it at all, I don't know was it because of the guilt or for she was avoiding her bad memories from her childhood.

I mean, to make me clean of what!? They never tell the reason, and I doubt if they know the reason in the first place! People where I belong have fear of thinking, they rather choose to follow, for its easier.

Finally, and thank for education, I got answers. old practices related to purity, for maintaining us virgin, to not bring the shame to our families. “you have no clitor..difficult to get lust.. you stay virgin!. And when you get married, your feeling doesn't matter, you are almost like a sex doll”

I wish no more girls will go through what I went through. although the law prevents it now, but it's still happening secretly.

I have a freind who comes from an educated family, and didn't have to go through it. She asked once “ what is it feel?”

I answered “ I don't feel”.

Sorry for my bad English and poor narrating. I needed a vent.

EDIT:

Thank you so much for your kind words, and support, it really means a lot.

Just to make things clear…

Some people in the comments considered me to be a Muslim, and started attacking Islam although, I didn't mention my religious background!. I am not defending any religion here, it's just that Sudan is a divers country, these practices aren't done by Muslims only, Coptic Christian and some animist groups are known with it, as well.

Hector Quintanilla,5y,What was the biggest missed opportunity in business?,"The biggest missed opportunity in business is NOT learning from McDonald’s!

“What? You meant learn from McDonald’s how to make burgers?”

No! I mean to learn from their strategies!

McDonald’s success is no accident! It’s a marvelously planned business with proven marketing and sales strategies.

One of those strategies is how they lure their customers into the restaurant with very low prices.

Example: The dollar menu campaign.

They attract you into the restaurant with an irresistible deal. They may sell you a burger for $2 and they will ONLY make a few cents in profit.

Definitely not a good business; right?

Well, this is one of the most common mistakes small businesses make. They attract customers with their BEST deals to sell them something cheap. True?

So, what happens with this weak strategy?

They suffer from the marketing “rat-race” — chasing customers endlessly with expensive marketing plus ultimately they don’t make enough profits.

Why?

Again, let’s learn from McDonald’s.

When you buy the cheap burger, they will upsell you fries and a drink for $2.50 more. With this upsell they more than doubled the sales ticket and most importantly this is most of their profit.

So, to answer your question, learn from McDonald’s.

Now, when you meet/interact with that person next, just read the 'Notes' section before that and subtly refer to a couple of such details/observations while interacting with him/her.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,"Entrepreneurship life is not for everyone, do you agree and why?","Why is the lion considered the King of the Jungle?

He’s not the tallest … giraffes are taller.
He’s not the biggest … elephants are bigger.
He’s not the heaviest … hippos are heavier.
He’s not the smartest … hyenas are smarter.
He’s not the most intelligent … Chimpanzees are more intelligent.

When an elephant sees a lion, he runs, even though he’s bigger, stronger, smarter, and more powerful than the cat.

The elephant is a VICTIM of how he thinks!

Now, when the lion sees an elephant, he charges towards the elephant because he believes he can eat the elephant.

What’s wrong here?

The lion is the King of the Jungle because he has a different attitude. A lion's actions reflect the way he thinks. This attitude makes all the animal kingdom respect the lion more than any other animal.

Now to answer your question, the entrepreneurial life is not for everyone, do you agree and why?

I disagree.

Picture this: Two persons, same skills, same degrees, same economic conditions, same location, same problem identified by both. One thinks “lunch” while the other thinks “danger.”

Difference? Attitude.

Attitude is the result of beliefs. Our actions reflect what we believe. We become what we believe. We limit ourselves by what we believe.

No one can live beyond the limits of their beliefs.

No degrees, no training, no titles, no money, no networking, no people … can substitute your belief system.

So, stop thinking “I can't do this.” Stop making excuses. Change your belief system. Your ability to become an entrepreneur is trapped by traditions and your culture …

… and of course our broken Industrial Age educational system.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mq1uj9g7z2fokywp', 'title': 'Entrepreneurship life is not for everyone, do you agree and why?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Why is the lion considered the King of the Jungle?\n\nHe’s not the tallest … giraffes are taller.\nHe’s not the biggest … elephants are bigger.\nHe’s not the heaviest … hippos are heavier.\nHe’s not the smartest … hyenas are smarter.\nHe’s not the most intelligent … Chimpanzees are more intelligent.\n\nWhen an elephant sees a lion, he runs, even though he’s bigger, stronger, smarter, and more powerful than the cat.\n\nThe elephant is a VICTIM of how he thinks!\n\nNow, when the lion sees an elephant, he charges towards the elephant because he believes he can eat the elephant.\n\nWhat’s wrong here?\n\nThe lion is the King of the Jungle because he has a different attitude.

Hannah Yang,5y,How can we make the world a better place?,"Last month, right after we graduated from Yale, my boyfriend and I spent two weeks working on a small organic farm in France.

The owner of our farm turned out to be a tall, wiry man named Emmanuel, with a gruff smile and an easy laugh. He spoke French with his wife and kids, but he’d explain our work to us in English, occasionally pausing in the middle of a word to remember the proper pronunciation.

One time, he took us to the greenhouse and showed us spots of brown mold that had begun creeping over the leaves on the tomato plants. “Ze tomatoes get sick sometimes,” he said. “It’s a big…how do you say…a big pr…”

A problem? I suggested in my mind, assuming that was the word he was looking for.

But then Emmanuel smiled and said, “Ah, project. It’s a big project.”

With that, he gave us clippers and buckets, and showed us how to clip off certain leaves from infected tomato plants to prevent the mold from spreading.

Where I saw a problem, Emmanuel saw a project. This attitude was one he carried with him everywhere, no matter how big the problem or how difficult the solution. He worked from dawn to dusk - often heavy, backbreaking work - fixing the things that other people saw as problems.

On my last day working for him, I asked Emmanuel why he decided to become a farmer, and he just shook his head and said, “Ah, zere are lots of people in the world these days, and zat makes a lot of hunger. It’s a big project.”

It’s a simple thing, just a casual switch of words - but at the same time, it’s kind of profound.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am BSF jawan posted at Punjab Frontier, FHQ Jalandhar, Ferozepur Sector. Here I would like to open up my heart.

It's really cold out here during especially winters. We find our warmth in the very little calls we make to our dear ones.
If you see any army man just pass a smile. You never know how much great it feels out there.
Sometimes we sleep just 3 hours but we never regret because it's after all we who chose to live this life.
It feels kind of demeaning and discouraging when our own people suspect our bravery.
We go by the thought 'Everyone's got to die one day so why not die worthy'.
It makes every army jawan sad when the people who we try to protect themselves are behind our death.
Guns seem quite amazing in a virtual world but in reality it's a 3kg burden we carry.
We live the ‘present’ at its fullest because there is no assurance of a ‘tomorrow’.
When such headlines and pictures pop up

Kirti Chakra awardee beaten up in road rage

It hurts more than any metal bullets.

We do celebrate Diwali and Eid with everyone where one's religion doesn't matter. It's among some of our joyful moments.
We have some pesky neighbours but in the end, we all sail the same boat to safeguard our nation.

But it's an amazing life with your friends, sharing thoughts and working together. Afterall, it's the thinking that even if we struggle, there are millions out there who live peacefully and that's what drives us.

A life of an army jawan.

Have a nice day!

Anonymous,Updated 4y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I screwed my high paying career!

I am a 34 year old, MALE. IIT. Computer Science. I got placed in a top MNC in Bangalore.

As soon as I got the job I got comfortable in the project. It was a maintenance kind of project and I was happy to work over there because I didn’t want to work hard(That was my attitude! That too in my initial years of career). Years passed and somehow I managed “not to get” low performer. I just worked that much so that I don’t get LP and don’t get fired. That was my goal. Company decided to close that project after 4 years and I moved to another project and as I was good at maintaining the project. The manager put me again on one more maintenance project and as the work was in my comfort zone. I agreed to take that. I was 4 year experienced that time and I could have asked for more challenging work! but No!! I didn’t care that time. that year I got blessed with my daughter so I wanted to spend time with her and I thought this is the time I should give time to my family than working hard in office.

Honey does not go bad; if it has gone solid it has just crystallized and can become liquid again with just a little heat.

Aled Jenkins,4y,Which business ideas failed because they were ahead of their time?,"How do you fail with the best idea?

Be too early

“Within five years I predict it will be the most popular form of PC sold in America”

The year is 2001, and Microsoft releases a tablet (9 years before the iPad). At the time, Microsoft could not lose. Anything that Microsoft touched turned to gold. So what happened?

Gates was at a press release where he described the tablet.

The tablet was a flawless piece of technology combining the operating power of a computer with the portability of a phone. It seemed to be a gift from the heavens. Pages flowed effortlessly from one to the next.

However…

The press was not convinced saying

Why would anybody want to have such a large portable device? We have a computer at home and a phone for portability. Would people buy this?

Gates’ reply

“within five years I predict it will be the most popular form of PC sold in America.”

And Microsoft pushed hard for this outcome. They advertised the smooth-as-silk design and the unimaginable power for running applications.

And NOBODY BOUGHT.

There were a few purchases but nowhere near enough to make a profit. Why?

Microsoft believed that everybody loved computers. This was true but Microsoft failed to realise that people who used the tablets had different wants to those who used computers. The tablet needed different features to a computer. Also, the tablet was too expensive at over $2,000 because it was so costly to make.

Microsoft did make a mistake and they learned from it. They adapted their product range and created their successful Surface line but…

As Microsoft was struggling; panicking on how to save themselves from this disaster, there was a company watching. They had watched everything. Seen everything. They had become successful to fund their tablet which they believed would be better. Their name was Apple. The Apple iPad came out in 2010 and transformed the industry.

Rushikesh Kirtikar,1y,Why do so many startups fail?,"Back in 2012, I was participating in a competition of young startups and entrepreneurs who were presenting their ideas before a panel. There was this very enthusiastic and smart guy amongst us who seemed very excited and confident about his product. He had made a shoe which could charge your mobile battery. It produced electricity using the pressure created below your feet while walking. A mobile battery could be fitted near the foot sole which then you can later put in your phone.

Image only for reference.

It was truly a remarkable product for that time especially for people like travellers, trekkers, salesman, etc. who wouldn't find a power source often and needed to charge their phones. He had all the estimates ready of how much market it would capture and how many people it would impact. Most importantly he claimed that there is no competition for his product as it is the only of its kind in the market. He was truly impressive in his presentation and undoubtedly won the competition and a lot of praise from the judges. It was clear that the guy had put a lot of hard work on his product.

Today it is 2022 and it wouldn't take us much thought to realise why the product is useless. Most people use smartphones today which do not have replaceable batteries. That was not the case so much in 2012. Secondly, power banks have now captured the market which addresses the problem with charging phones having limited power sources. Plus the battery capacity has also been increasing.

So where did the guy fail?

In Entrepreneurship, it is generally said that one should not fall in love with the solution. But rather with the problem. Or else you would be overwhelmed by your solution and miss out other ways of looking at the problem.

So when the above guy believed that there was no competition for his product, he believed that his solution is the only solution available. He could not imagine that the problem can be solved in other ways or his solution will become redundant due to external factors. So technically a power bank manufacturer, or any mobile battery manufacturers attempting to increase its power capacity, were his potential competitors even when the products were different.

So while it is good to love your idea and your solution, a startup might fail if the ‘problem’ is not the first love. A love for the solution might close your mind, but loving the problem might just open it up.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xb92m4jwy6na0euz', 'title': 'Why do so many startups fail?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Back in 2012, I was participating in a competition of young startups and entrepreneurs who were presenting their ideas before a panel.

Eric Garcia,5y,Has there ever been a person that was lazy but ended up being really successful?,"Once that comes to mind for me is this guy

That’s not Starlord, it’s the actor who plays him, Chris Pratt. Chris happened to wrestle in high school, and he wasn’t half-bad considering he placed 5th in a state tournament in Washington. His coach asked him what his goals were after high school, to which Chris responded, ""'I don't know, but I know I'll be famous and I know I'll make a shit ton of money.' He elaborated in a later interview, “I had no idea how. I'd done nothing proactive.""

-Pratt dropped out of community college halfway through the first semester and, after working as a discount ticket salesman and daytime stripper, he ended up homeless in Maui, Hawaii, sleeping in a van and a tent on the beach. He told The Independent, ""It's a pretty awesome place to be homeless. We just drank and smoked weed and worked minimal hours, just enough to cover gas, food, and fishing supplies.""

At 19 years old, Pratt was waiting tables at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurant in Maui when he was discovered by actress and director Rae Dawn Chong. She cast him in her directorial debut, the short horror film Cursed Part 3, which was filmed in LA.-

- quoted from his Wikipedia page.

He kept picking up parts, notably in the hit sitcom, Parks and Recreation, to supporting roles in feature films.

Divya Sharma,2y,What are the best ideas of yours?,"I have recently introduced three little changes in my life. I am glad because they make me feel better.

Getting a set of steel straws.

I have coconut water every day after office along with its malai. It is my favourite evening snack. I realised I was generating a lot of waste, using one plastic straw everyday. So, I switched to this. I have got myself and my family a set of straws (straight and bent ones) that can be reused. I keep two in my bag all the time. I can use these straws while going for shakes or juices at cafeterias as well. It is a little step but I am doing my bit :)

2. Started reading again

Out of all things I stopped doing while my preparation for government exams phase, I missed reading the most. I still don’t get a lot of time to read per se, considering my job and other projects I’m involved in, I use my travelling time in metro everyday to read a book. This consistency in reading has helped me a lot. It is way better than listening to music. I enjoy my metro rides more and look forward to them everyday.

3. Using time limits for apps

I realised I was wasting a lot of my time on these two apps. I have set limits and I stick to these limits now. First few days were weird but now my days feel longer and better.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/69vipesrmw85od3u', 'title': 'What are the best ideas of yours?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I have recently introduced three little changes in my life.

Geetendra Abhinav,Updated 6y,What are some interesting facts about Bill Gates?,"Bill Gates once released mosquitoes on people during a presentation on Malaria and said, “There’s no reason why only the poor should have this experience”

In his TED 2009 speech on malaria, he literally released mosquitoes on his audience. Though he later confirmed that the mosquitoes did not carry malaria.

When Bill Gates distributed Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex hammer worth $ 30 million dollars for free

He purchased the codex at an auction in 1994 for $30 million.

He then distributed them for free as desktop wallpapers, themes. He made it openly available on Windows Vista.

In 1997, a comprehensive CD was released.

Gates admits the command ‘ctrl + alt + delete’ was supposed to be a single button

He confessed this in 2013, and said the command was invented to prevent applications from generating fake logins and stealing the user’s password.

He makes $ 250 per second. If he were a separate country, he would be the 37th richest country in the world

According to him, by 2035, there will be no poor countries in the world. He has promised to donate 95% of his wealth to charity, leaving 5% for his family, “Leaving kids a massive amount of money is not a favour to them”.

He was anything but innocent

He hacked his school computers and wrote the class scheduling program himself.

He added a feature in it that always placed his seating with female students.

He wrote a letter to Steve Jobs when Jobs was dying, which Jobs kept by his bedside

He praised him in the letter, underlining the importance of everything Jobs had achieved

I met with an accident. No, I didn't jump in front of the milk truck that hit me. It was an accident. The last thing I remember was the crimson of my blood dripping from god knows where into my eyes. I hoped it was going to be fatal. I couldn't feel my left arm, there

There is no pause button in life, it has to go on no matter what. A small part of me wanted to carry on no matter what happened, I'm sure you have that part in you as well. Nothing in this world is impossible mate.

He self-taught himself to code using a bunch of used books, and overcame enormous personal odds before he ever started WhatsApp. His story, which began on the outskirts of Kiev, Ukraine, is a truly rags to riches tale.

When Jan was growing up in Ukraine, his home had no hot water and little connection to the outside world. It did have a telephone, but his mother was afraid to use the phone because their family was Jewish, and Ukraine's secret police had a long history of antisemitic actions toward the jewish population.

In 1992, Jan immigrated with his mother and grandmother to Mountain View, California. He was 16 at the time, and the family stayed in a government sponsored two-bedroom apartment. Today Mountain View is a booming tech center, but in those days housing was still low-cost and somewhat prevalent.

To put together enough money to survive, Jan's mother babysat and Jan swept supermarket floors. It was a hard life in a new country, but things would only get more difficult from there...

Jan's father - who was planning to join the family - fell ill before he could make the trip. He eventually died in 1997. Then Jan's mother was diagnosed with cancer (to which she would eventually succumb in 2000). The family was forced to rely on food stamps just to survive.

Few people could fault Jan if his life began to unravel at this point. Immigrating to a new culture and country is hard enough, but when you lose your two parents in the span of 5 years, and you lift your head up and notice a world around you that doesn't add up... that's an unconceivable kind of pain.

But Jan took the lumps as they came. When he was still in high school, he began to buy books from a used book store, and teach himself networking engineering. When he finished with the books, he'd return them and got his money back. He used his self-taught skills to land himself a job at Ernst & Young while still in university.

One of his first clients was then-fledgling but soon-to-be Internet search giant, Yahoo. After a short time with Jan, their team was so impressed by him, that they too offered him a job. And before he knew it, he was working with - among other Yahoo stars - Brian Acton, one of Yahoo's earliest employees.

Brian's earliest recollections of Jan impressed him the most: whereas Ernst & Young employees tended to be flowery speakers who knew how to tell you what you wanted to hear, Jan was blunt. He didn't have a penchant for bullsh**. He said it like it was and expected the same kind of bluntness back to him.

For nine years Jan worked at Yahoo, through the enormous rise... and then through the slow, stuttering fall of the Internet giant. Eventually in 2007, he took a year off and travelled through south and central America. During this time, he applied for jobs both to Facebook and Twitter... and he was rejected.

So he used about $400k in savings from Yahoo to start on a new Project: a messaging app that he called WhatsApp. He chose the name because he believed it was similar to the popular greeting, ""What's up!"" After building a base of about 250,000 active users, he brought old friend and colleague Brian Acton aboard as a cofounder.

Together they took the journey to grow what is now one of the most captivating startup stories ever. Between 2009 and 2015 WhatsApp went from nonexistent to having over 900 million active users, and becoming the largest messaging app in the world. Additionally, it sold to Facebook for $22 billion in 2014.

When Jan signed the papers that would make him one of the richest men in the world, he didn't do it in the Four Seasons or at Facebook Headquarters, and he didn't have camera lights glaring. Instead, he returned to the nondescript building where he once stood for hours waiting with his mother for food stamps.

There, out of the limelight, Jan penned his signature. In that moment he completed a circle that was about so much more than teaching himself computer networking skills from used books or even building a successful business: it was about turning the tables in his life and offering purpose and meaning to even the hardest of times.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ni5e8my03otc6hjv', 'title': ""Who are the most successful self-taught tech founders?

Alisha Talks,Updated 3y,Which businesses took an unexpected hit because of covid-19?,"My father's business has taken a turn for the worst. Up to 70% of regular customers have vanished in the last week, and our profit has plummeted by a large margin.

I know many takeaways and restaurants are facing the same problem too. Some have already gone bust…

Yesterday evening I patiently waited for orders to come through. On a typical Sunday, we would rake up to 40 orders. This Sunday we barely reached 10.

Watching my dad on the verge of tears and frustration was difficult. It was the first Sunday in years where I simply sat for an hour, praying that the phone would ring or the chimes placed above the door would make a ting noise.

It's understandable — people are afraid of the unknown. We've become cautious and super vigilant about germs and contamination. Customers do not know the health of the person handling the dishes, so cooking at home appears to be a safer option.

I know it's only going to get worse as the weeks go by, but we are struggling and I'm stressed. My father and I are the only earners in a seven person household.

Tough and terrifying is what it's been and I know you're afraid, but please, if you can help your small, local businesses, you'd be helping us live.

Thank you.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/aw97shtqkibye0m2', 'title': 'Which businesses took an unexpected hit because of covid-19?', 'score': {'original': 0.9904, 'ai': 0.0096}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""My father's business has taken a turn for the worst.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am 25 years old girl from Nagpur. I lost my father when I was 16 years old. He left me with my mom and an elder brother who is schizophrenic. After his demise, I was the only one to take care of my family. He left us with a home and minimal savings on which we had survive hardly two months . I was a very pampered kid when he was around. Every day after his loss I realized I am not a kid anymore. After completing my 12th, I started searching for part time jobs. I worked in an hospital as a computer operator and since then my struggle started. I scored moderate marks in 12th and was lucky enough to get admission in one of top engineering colleges in Nagpur. Since then I knew I have responsibility of my mom and brother and I just have to work hard to make things better at home. We had survived on Roti and Salt for years. Those were the days when we were unable to pay even electric bill and we had to survive on a candle light. This is when I sensed poverty at my home every day. We started providing tiffin services to working people. I used to help my mom in cooking food, my brother used to deliver them. Somehow I managed to live like this for four more years till final year. I got placed in a MNC and shifted to Pune. Things got better as I started earning. After working for 2years in Pune, I got an offer from an IT Company in Nagpur with a decent package. I accepted the offer as I wanted to stay with my family. My brother's condition is also improving now. Till now I have witnessed a lot of appreciation from people for being a responsible daughter. I stood up for my family every time and will always do. In this meantime, I realized I am just working hard to make things better not realising I have my own dreams. I want to do MS but I am afraid of the fact that I have to stop working and stay very far from my mom and brother. I feel they will be alone again and I don't want those poor days to come back again in our lives. This feeling of responsibility has made me strong enough to face the world but weak enough to leave my family alone. This scares me alot.

I know my father would be very proud of me. I miss him a lot when I see my friends with their fathers coming with them in every special moment. I feel lonely at times just because I have to do everything on my own like getting admission to college, shifting to Pune, boarding on a train alone and many more. I miss that fatherly support in my life when I needed him the most.

I just wish I could have spend some more time with him.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/78w0l6edh4fxy5b2', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am 25 years old girl from Nagpur.

Asim Qureshi,5y,What advice would you give to new graduates?,"Get a job abroad. You'll learn a lot more than job skills. You'll learn life skills. You'll learn perspective.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am a food inspector at a very reputable country of India. I have to work overnight, i would go to work at 10 PM in the night and return by 8 in the morning. By the time i come home, my shirt gets drenched with sweat, my bones start shaking and the only thing i want to do is sleep.

Now, one time i had to work till 11 AM, I was too tired to even speak. but somehow i reached the bus stop and waited for my bus in the extremely hot sun. I was standing with the help of a pole nearby.

The bus arrived.

I stepped into it.

And luckily there were 3 empty seats.

I just sat down and tried to control my sleep as i don’t want to miss my stop. My stop came 5 stops later. After 2 stops the bus got a little crowded. On the third stop, an old man approached me asking for a seat, he looked at my face and understood that i was not in a condition. a young man seated nearby stood up and gave his seat to the old man. We exchanged smiles.

now on the fourth stop, your typical “DELHI GIRL” enters.

you must have guessed by now what happens next.

She asked me to vacate the seat. I gave that same look to that girl which i gave to the old man. but she won’t move. she was not a human, she was a cyborg.

I had to tell her that i did not sleep the last night and i am way too tired to even speak. But she was unmoved. I knew if i kept standing for the nest 90 minutes, i won’t be able to walk up to my home. BUT NO.

I had to give up my seat, everyone in the bus started staring, some nosy aunty said

“O bhaiya, aap itni der se toh baithe hai, usko seat de dijiye na, thak gayi hogi woh”

“O mister, you have the seat from a long time, give her that seat she must be TIRED”

I had no other option, i had to give my seat to that girl.

I kept standing for an hour and a half, I then i walked about a kilometre, to reach my home, and before you know it, i was asleep WITH MY DOOR OPEN FOR STRAIGHT 21 HOURS.

I could not go to work the other day, BOSS screamed like hell.

Even after waking up i was too tired for anything.

MY BOSS AND THAT GIRL TOGETHER TOOK ME THROUGH HELL.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lm7w425xnkz0g9ht', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am a food inspector at a very reputable country of India.

Aman Goel,Updated 2y,What can you tell me about your entrepreneurship journey? How was/is your life as an entrepreneur?,"I started my company AllinCall almost 3 years ago. We got formally incorporated on 21st April 2017. My friend Soham and I were the initial co-founders.

It was the month of August 2016. My 3rd-year summer internship had just ended. I had a great time in the Bay Area, working at this amazing startup called Rubrik. I enjoyed the work and the people at Rubrik. There was 1 little problem - I realized that I could not work for someone else. Coming from a Marwadi family, I have hardly seen people who are employed somewhere.

When I came back to India after my internship, I decided to pursue something of my own. The college courses were almost completed. I had to take a few electives. I was talking to a friend of mine about my entrepreneurship desire. That’s when he told me about DSCE - Desai Sethi Center for Entrepreneurship, a teaching body that had been a part of IIT Bombay for almost 3 years. I was completely unaware of such a thing - IIT Bombay is huge and there are so many things always going on. It is impossible to know everything!

I decided to enroll in a few courses at DSCE - Introduction to Entrepreneurship, Technology Venture Creation, Marketing for Entrepreneurs, and Intellectual Property for Entrepreneurs. While typical IIT courses may be focused on assignments, quizzes, and exams, the Entrepreneurship courses at DSCE were different. The Professors were mostly Industry veterans themselves and so, they didn’t care about pen-paper exams and assignments. They were keener on practical work - find a problem statement, build an MVP, get feedback from customers, etc.

As a part of the course, we were supposed to partner with someone and build a team. I partnered with Soham, my friend from IIT Bombay. Soham and I iterated on a bunch of ideas - building a Quora-like platform for JEE aspirants, a web development agency, a mentorship platform where IITians could mentor JEE aspirants, etc. Most problems revolved around the difficulties we ourselves faced.

Later, we were instructed to boil down on 1 single idea. So, we decided to develop something interesting - a voice-enabled platform wherein, people like our parents who are not too tech-savvy can just call and talk to a virtual assistant to book a cab, order items from Amazon, etc. The idea was that parents are usually not able to use mobile apps even though they have a smartphone and internet connection. So, why not give them a number wherein they can just call and get things done? “All-in-Call”.

As the course demanded, we went to talk to various potential customers. Here is me, talking to my dad’s office employees on how they avail such services, trying to get their feedback.

We roamed around across malls and other public areas of Mumbai to get feedback from people.

We presented some of the ideas to our Professors. Here is a slide from one of the presentations we created.

One of the Professors suggested that rather than exploring the B2C concept, we should try and see if we can sell such a solution to large enterprises. The idea was that Banks and other large enterprises would already have multiple such customers and so, we can ride on the Banks for customer acquisition rather than doing it ourselves.

We pivoted to the B2B idea - sell solutions to enterprises that will help their customers get banking services at their fingertips. Now, we had a new customer persona - a Bank’s head of Customer Support. So, with the help of an advisor’s network, we met some of the Bank officials - HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, YES Bank.

We met the Bank’s Digital Team at the HDFC Bank office at Peninsula Business Park, Lower Parel, Mumbai. The idea was to not sell anything and just get their feedback and explore the gaps.

We also went to their Kamla Mills Branch in Lower Parel to see one of their latest Technology Initiative - the IRA Robot which helps customers navigate within the Branch.

Based on our discussion with the HDFC Bank officials, we realized that they are quite keen to develop solutions on voice-based technologies like Voice recognition, Voice biometrics, etc.

Later, we met a couple of other Banks - YES Bank and Axis Bank to get their feedback. We were fortunate to get support from our advisor who helped us get those meetings. Nobody knew us, but people knew him. He was an ex-Vice President of South Asia at one of the largest logistics company and so, he stayed in a society where many such senior corporate executives lived. That’s how he knew them.

He advised us to sell before we build. Basically, he told us to find a way to first get a pilot/POC (proof-of-concept) from a large enterprise and then build the actual product. We started working on the same. Here is one of the old videos I found.

The video has been recorded in my hostel room (Hostel 3, Room 347) at IIT Bombay. Remember, this is during the 4th year of college. I had not graduated by that time.

I was quite excited about the meetings with senior Bank officials and told my parents about them. Obviously they were not happy because I had a couple of high-paying job offers in my hand. While my dad is a small business owner himself, my annual salary was more than what we could earn in 10 years.

This is another of my offer letters at a large Indian company.

We were extremely naive at that time. Both of us were Software Engineers, with bare minimum knowledge of Business. Soham was a Gujarati and I was a Marwadi, but deep within, we were hardcore programmers and so, these meetings, presentations, discussions, were all quite a new thing for us. Here is an excerpt from the PPT that we showed to Axis Bank.

We were so naive back then that we put “Finish Graduation” as a part of the PPT. No wonder we never got a contract from Axis Bank!

Here is a part of the video we showed to Axis Bank. Obviously, the product is hard-coded. The entire video is hard-coded. The goal was to sell before building and that’s what we were trying. We had learned so many things by this time - making presentations, recording videos, editing videos, etc.

Later, we started working on a basic Product. We showed it to our Professors who were mentoring us and they helped us get incubated at SINE, the IIT Bombay startup incubator. SINE had a huge network of large enterprises, investors, mentors, etc. With the help of SINE, we approached the giant - State Bank of India.

SBI had recently started a Startup Engagement Program wherein, they would buy certain technology-based solutions without the tendering process. We met their DGM of Startup Engagement in March 2017. We had all the learnings of HDFC Bank, YES Bank, and Axis Bank and we made a great presentation to SBI. The DGM was quite impressed with our background and capabilities and told us to incorporate a company.

My cousin was a CA in Delhi and we approached him for help for the company incorporation. We had suggested the name “CX Research and Solutions Pvt Ltd” (CX = Customer Experience). He asked us for an alternate name in case that name is unavailable. We suggested “AllinCall Research and Solutions Pvt Ltd”. We were quite sure we will get the name CX Research and Solutions. However, the CA without informing us registered the company with AllinCall, because the name CX required some Rs. 5,000 extra.

Anyway, we were happy that the company was incorporated. So, we went back to SBI. In the meanwhile, we had significant progress on the product side. On 15th May, SBI told us to initiate a POC (proof-of-concept) for a simple FAQ ChatBot. The DGM lead the POC. We were given 2 weeks of time. We developed it in 1 week and showed it to him. He was impressed by our speed and the final output. He told us that on 1st July 2017, its the Bank’s foundation day and he would like to deploy our solution in the Bank.

Therefore, he told us to proceed forward with further development of SIA ChatBot (SBI Intelligent Assistant) which could answer the most common customer queries. Obviously, there were multiple internal approvals required - Commercial approval, Legal approval, IT approval and most importantly, Information Security approval.

We barely knew about all of these things. Thanks to the DGM, he helped us understand the process. We shared an ad-hoc Commercial Proposal document which was obviously rejected by their committee. It took us almost 8 - 10 days to get SBI to agree on our proposal document. For Legal approval, the DGM helped us with the NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement), SLA (Service Level Agreement), etc. IT Approval was something we could ourselves manage given that we came from a tech background. There were many new things to learn - Web Server, App Server, Database Server, etc., but we managed to pick those things quickly.

The last one, Information Security Approval was a big challenge for us. We had almost ZERO knowledge about Enterprise-grade Information Security. SBI gave us a long list of vulnerabilities in the Application/Software we developed. Thankfully, we could take help from Google Search and close most of the points. For some left-out points, they took internal exceptional approval.

We went live with SBI SIA ChatBot on 1st July 2017. On 2nd July, their CIO and CTO felicitated us in the Bank’s Foundation day ceremony in front of their 1,200 employees (I am 3rd from the right).

Here is the photograph of us receiving our purchase order from SBI.

Right to left: Me, Our Advisor, Soham, DGM Sir (I would not want to mention his name), DGM Sir’s wife. SBI gave us a memento which is still kept in my office.

In August 2017, I had my graduation ceremony at IIT Bombay. Yes, we had our first customer as the giant SBI, before we even graduated!

SBI was so impressed with us, they asked us to take a workshop in Programming, Machine Learning and ChatBot development for some of their employees.

SBI was a huge launchpad for us and I would like to sincerely thank them for their support in helping us start AllinCall. Without them, it would have been a far more difficult journey. Special thanks to DGM Sir for helping us navigate within the giant SBI and get relevant approvals without any enterprise knowledge.

SBI referred us to their sister companies and SBI Life Insurance also purchased our solution in no time (Nov 2017). They remain our client even today. Things were going well so far. However, Soham somehow felt that the ChatBot solution was too shallow and we had to do something bigger.

I was of the view that we should focus on selling what’s working and as we build relations with enterprises, we will learn more about the other problems that they may be facing. However, we could not come to a mutual agreement on the same.

By March 2018, we had barely onboarded any new customer. We just had 2 clients - SBI and SBI Life Insurance. Soham and I, therefore, started to think of some other ideas. I was of the view that we should stay persistent and focus on what was working. However, I also had to support my co-founder and so, I also spent time with him, searching for new ideas.

This is where things started going South. As complete freshers, we barely had any knowledge of Enterprise problems and so, we could not think of any ideas whatsoever. Soham felt that the enterprise sales process is tough and we should find out startup ideas where we can avoid such long sales cycles.

One such idea that he was exploring was around Algorithmic trading - building algorithms that can automatically buy/sell assets and make money. Crypto was at its peak at that time and he suggested that we should try algorithmic trading of cryptocurrencies. I was not really convinced about it, but then I agreed to what he suggested.

Fast forward August 2018, he suddenly decided to leave the company and pursue algorithmic trading full-time himself.

I was stuck in a terrible situation. By that time, we had also started working with ICICI Bank and SBI Mutual Fund and now, suddenly, my co-founder who was managing SBI and SBI Life Insurance decided to leave. I was left alone with a full-time Software Engineer and a newly hired Software intern. I was in deep shit at that time. I did not know how to manage the situation. My parents were extremely worried about what happened.

A bunch of problems arose:

Soham was managing SBI and SBI Life Insurance. Now, the load was on me, without much context. Payment for these projects was planned to come in a month or so but it got delayed because the projects slowed down.
I was managing ICICI Bank and SBI Mutual Fund. The load of handling these clients also fell on me.
He had gone to his home town. So, a lot of places where his signature was required got stuck. For instance, SBI used to pay in our SBI Current Account. Since we did not have an Online Banking facility for that account, we used to depend on the branch. The branch guys refused to help me without Soham’s signature.

So, I was in trouble from all sides - new money from projects got delayed and existing money got frozen in the bank accounts. I had to pay September/October salaries to the 2 team members as well and the company had no money since I had paid some amount to Soham on his exit. In this desperate situation, I had to put in some of my own money in the company to pay salaries. Remember, I was just 22 years old at that time and I myself did not have a lot of money.

It was at this time, I partnered with a friend, Harshita and explained to her the entire situation at my end. I told her how screwed up I was and how desperately I needed someone to help me. She kindly agreed to leave her job and help me with my business (Edit: as someone has asked, there is a whole long story behind how I convinced her. It could be as big as another Quora answer and so, I have skipped it). I assured her of decent equity and also a decent pay when things were under control. She was kind enough to not take a penny of salary till December 2018, when things started to improve.

We divided our roles very clearly - I would work on sales and customer management and she will work on projects and technology. That worked really well for us. I told her about each and every mistake that Soham and I made and we sat down to find a solution for each of them.

At this time, I should mention that ICICI Bank’s Startup Engagement team helped us a lot. They knew that Soham had abruptly left the company. They knew that we were in deep shit. Being such a large institution, they could have kicked us out and taken away our projects. However, their Head of Startup Engagement and their CTO called us and offered any help we needed to keep the company afloat. We borrowed just 2 weeks of time from them which they kindly agreed.

We went back to them after hiring a couple of more Software Engineering Interns and guess what they did? They gave us a couple of more contracts. We were extremely happy with the bank’s gesture. They helped us get business when we were in the worst of our situation. ICICI Bank has a completely different culture as compared to any organization we have ever seen. We will forever remain indebted to them for the help they did to us at that time.

In November 2018, things started looking better and we moved to a small 8 seater office in Powai (Mumbai). The rent was a smallish Rs. 25k per month, but it was not a small amount for us at that time. Nevertheless, contracts from our customers helped us maintain cashflows.

Gradually, from there, things started improving. We had divided our work and so, we gradually started to specialize in our respective domains. On 20th April 2019, we celebrated the 2nd birthday of AllinCall (21st April was a Sunday).

We had a small 8 member team at that time, comprising of 2 co-founders, 2 full-time Software Engineers, 3 SDE Interns, and 1 Sales guy. During all of our thick-and-thins, another of our advisors really helped us. He was from the private equity industry and he had a lot of contacts. He used all his network to help us get more business. We are really grateful to him for the help he did during our bad times.

With the help of his network, we gradually started onboarding more and more clients. We continued working hard on our ChatBot product and also launched a couple of new Enterprise solutions around Customer Experience and Customer Engagement.

On 15th May 2019, we shifted to a bigger office.

We worked really hard during the last financial year (April 2019 to March 2020) and onboarded multiple large clients, getting repeated contracts and revenues from them. We also stayed Bootstrapped, not raising money from any investors. Today, we boast of several large companies as our clients.

We did 4x growth in Financial Year 2019–20 as compared to Financial Year 2018–19. Today, I am glad to mention that multiple investors have reached out to us for equity investment in AllinCall.

We also recently won the prestigious Technoviti 2020 Award by Mr. Satej Patil, Minister of Information Technology, Government of Maharashtra.

ICICI Bank also honored us for the work we did for them.

I love Business and I enjoy working with large Enterprises. We have a team of 20+ smart people working with us across Technology, Operations and Sales functions. We have happy customers who have extended multiple contracts to us, helping us build recurring revenues.

We have followed just 1 simple principle - focus on the customer and rest everything else will fall in place. We never chased any investor. We just remained focus on doing the best for our customers and everything else automatically improved.

Today, the business has stabilized quite well and we are growing rapidly. The names of existing customers are enough to onboard new customers.

To end this answer, I would like to mention 2 things:

I would like to sincerely thank our customers, our advisors and all the team members of AllinCall, especially Harshita who trusted me and helped me during the entire roller coaster ride. I will always remain indebted to all of the people who helped me during the worst of my times.
Do not give up, come what may. There is always a solution. You just need to be persistent enough to find it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8mu2x4ks6woq0icl', 'title': 'What can you tell me about your entrepreneurship journey?

We were fortunate to get support from our advisor who helped us get those meetings. Nobody knew us, but people knew him. He was an ex-Vice President of South Asia at one of the largest logistics company and so, he stayed in a society where many such senior corporate executives lived. That’s how he knew them.\n\nHe advised us to sell before we build. Basically, he told us to find a way to first get a pilot/POC (proof-of-concept) from a large enterprise and then build the actual product. We started working on the same. Here is one of the old videos I found.\n\nThe video has been recorded in my hostel room (Hostel 3, Room 347) at IIT Bombay. Remember, this is during the 4th year of college. I had not graduated by that time.\n\nI was quite excited about the meetings with senior Bank officials and told my parents about them. Obviously they were not happy because I had a couple of high-paying job offers in my hand. While my dad is a small business owner himself, my annual salary was more than what we could earn in 10 years.\n\nThis is another of my offer letters at a large Indian company.\n\nWe were extremely naive at that time. Both of us were Software Engineers, with bare minimum knowledge of Business. Soham was a Gujarati and I was a Marwadi, but deep within, we were hardcore programmers and so, these meetings, presentations, discussions, were all quite a new thing for us. Here is an excerpt from the PPT that we showed to Axis Bank.\n\nWe were so naive back then that we put “Finish Graduation” as a part of the PPT. No wonder we never got a contract from Axis Bank!\n\nHere is a part of the video we showed to Axis Bank. Obviously, the product is hard-coded. The entire video is hard-coded. The goal was to sell before building and that’s', 'result': {'fake': 0.9746, 'real': 0.0254}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'what we were trying. We had learned so many things by this time - making presentations, recording videos, editing videos, etc.\n\nLater, we started working on a basic Product. We showed it to our Professors who were mentoring us and they helped us get incubated at SINE, the IIT Bombay startup incubator. SINE had a huge network of large enterprises, investors, mentors, etc. With the help of SINE, we approached the giant - State Bank of India.\n\nSBI had recently started a Startup Engagement Program wherein, they would buy certain technology-based solutions without the tendering process. We met their DGM of Startup Engagement in March 2017. We had all the learnings of HDFC Bank, YES Bank, and Axis Bank and we made a great presentation to SBI. The DGM was quite impressed with our background and capabilities and told us to incorporate a company.\n\nMy cousin was a CA in Delhi and we approached him for help for the company incorporation. We had suggested the name “CX Research and Solutions Pvt Ltd” (CX = Customer Experience). He asked us for an alternate name in case that name is unavailable. We suggested “AllinCall Research and Solutions Pvt Ltd”. We were quite sure we will get the name CX Research and Solutions. However, the CA without informing us registered the company with AllinCall, because the name CX required some Rs. 5,000 extra.\n\nAnyway, we were happy that the company was incorporated. So, we went back to SBI. In the meanwhile, we had significant progress on the product side. On 15th May, SBI told us to initiate a POC (proof-of-concept) for a simple FAQ ChatBot. The DGM lead the POC. We were given 2 weeks of time. We developed it in 1 week and showed it to him. He was impressed by our speed and the final output. He told us that on 1st July 2017, its the Bank’s foundation day and he would like to deploy our solution in the Bank.\n\nTherefore, he told us to proceed forward with further development of SIA ChatBot (SBI Intelligent Assistant) which could answer the most common customer queries. Obviously, there were multiple internal approvals required - Commercial approval, Legal approval, IT approval and most importantly, Information Security approval.\n\nWe barely knew about all of these things. Thanks to the DGM, he helped us understand the process. We shared an ad-hoc Commercial Proposal document which was obviously rejected by their committee. It took us almost 8 - 10 days to get SBI to agree on our proposal document. For Legal approval, the DGM helped us with the NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement), SLA (Service Level Agreement), etc. IT Approval was something we could ourselves manage given that we came from a tech background. There were many new things to learn - Web Server, App Server, Database Server, etc., but we managed to pick those things quickly.\n\nThe last one, Information Security Approval was a big challenge for us. We had almost ZERO knowledge about Enterprise-grade Information Security. SBI gave us a long list of vulnerabilities in the Application/Software we developed. Thankfully, we could take help from Google', 'result': {'fake': 0.7546, 'real': 0.2454}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'Search and close most of the points. For some left-out points, they took internal exceptional approval.\n\nWe went live with SBI SIA ChatBot on 1st July 2017. On 2nd July, their CIO and CTO felicitated us in the Bank’s Foundation day ceremony in front of their 1,200 employees (I am 3rd from the right).\n\nHere is the photograph of us receiving our purchase order from SBI.\n\nRight to left: Me, Our Advisor, Soham, DGM Sir (I would not want to mention his name), DGM Sir’s wife. SBI gave us a memento which is still kept in my office.\n\nIn August 2017, I had my graduation ceremony at IIT Bombay. Yes, we had our first customer as the giant SBI, before we even graduated!\n\nSBI was so impressed with us, they asked us to take a workshop in Programming, Machine Learning and ChatBot development for some of their employees.\n\nSBI was a huge launchpad for us and I would like to sincerely thank them for their support in helping us start AllinCall. Without them, it would have been a far more difficult journey. Special thanks to DGM Sir for helping us navigate within the giant SBI and get relevant approvals without any enterprise knowledge.\n\nSBI referred us to their sister companies and SBI Life Insurance also purchased our solution in no time (Nov 2017). They remain our client even today. Things were going well so far. However, Soham somehow felt that the ChatBot solution was too shallow and we had to do something bigger.\n\nI was of the view that we should focus on selling what’s working and as we build relations with enterprises, we will learn more about the other problems that they may be facing. However, we could not come to a mutual agreement on the same.\n\nBy March 2018, we had barely onboarded any new customer. We just had 2 clients - SBI and SBI Life Insurance. Soham and I, therefore, started to think of some other ideas. I was of the view that we should stay persistent and focus on what was working. However, I also had to support my co-founder and so, I also spent time with him, searching for new ideas.\n\nThis is where things started going South. As complete freshers, we barely had any knowledge of Enterprise problems and so, we could not think of any ideas whatsoever. Soham felt that the enterprise sales process is tough and we should find out startup ideas where we can avoid such long sales cycles.\n\nOne such idea that he was exploring was around Algorithmic trading - building algorithms that can automatically buy/sell assets and make money. Crypto was at its peak at that time and he suggested that we should try algorithmic trading of cryptocurrencies. I was not really convinced about it, but then I agreed to what he suggested.\n\nFast forward August 2018, he suddenly decided to leave the company and pursue algorithmic trading full-time himself.\n\nI was stuck in a terrible situation. By that time, we had also started working with ICICI Bank and SBI Mutual Fund and now, suddenly, my co-founder who was managing SBI and SBI Life', 'result': {'fake': 0.9064, 'real': 0.0936}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'Insurance decided to leave.

I had to pay September/October salaries to the 2 team members as well and the company had no money since I had paid some amount to Soham on his exit. In this desperate situation, I had to put in some of my own money in the company to pay salaries. Remember, I was just 22 years old at that time and I myself did not have a lot of money.\n\nIt was at this time, I partnered with a friend, Harshita and explained to her the entire situation at my end. I told her how screwed up I was and how desperately I needed someone to help me. She kindly agreed to leave her job and help me with my business (Edit: as someone has asked, there is a whole long story behind how I convinced her. It could be as big as another Quora answer and so, I have skipped it). I assured her of decent equity and also a decent pay when things were under control.

We got formally incorporated on 21st April 2017. My friend Soham and I were the initial co-founders.\n\nIt was the month of August 2016. My 3rd-year summer internship had just ended. I had a great time in the Bay Area, working at this amazing startup called Rubrik. I enjoyed the work and the people at Rubrik. There was 1 little problem - I realized that I could not work for someone else. Coming from a Marwadi family, I have hardly seen people who are employed somewhere.\n\nWhen I came back to India after my internship, I decided to pursue something of my own. The college courses were almost completed. I had to take a few electives. I was talking to a friend of mine about my entrepreneurship desire. That’s when he told me about DSCE - Desai Sethi Center for Entrepreneurship, a teaching body that had been a part of IIT Bombay for almost 3 years. I was completely unaware of such a thing - IIT Bombay is huge and there are so many things always going on. It is impossible to know everything!\n\nI decided to enroll in a few courses at DSCE - Introduction to Entrepreneurship, Technology Venture Creation, Marketing for Entrepreneurs, and Intellectual Property for Entrepreneurs. While typical IIT courses may be focused on assignments, quizzes, and exams, the Entrepreneurship courses at DSCE were different. The Professors were mostly Industry veterans themselves and so, they didn’t care about pen-paper exams and assignments. They were keener on practical work - find a problem statement, build an MVP, get feedback from customers, etc.\n\nAs a part of the course, we were supposed to partner with someone and build a team. I partnered with Soham, my friend from IIT Bombay. Soham and I iterated on a bunch of ideas - building a Quora-like platform for JEE aspirants, a web development agency, a mentorship platform where IITians could mentor JEE aspirants, etc. Most problems revolved around the difficulties we ourselves faced.\n\nLater, we were instructed to boil down on 1 single idea. So, we decided to develop something interesting - a voice-enabled platform wherein, people like our parents who are not too tech-savvy can just call and talk to a virtual assistant to book a cab, order items from Amazon, etc. The idea was that parents are usually not able to use mobile apps even though they have a smartphone and internet connection. So, why not give them a number wherein they can just call and get things done? “All-in-Call”.\n\nAs the course demanded, we went to talk to various potential customers. Here is me, talking to my dad’s office employees on how they avail such services, trying to get their feedback.\n\nWe roamed around across malls and other public areas of Mumbai to get feedback from people.\n\nWe presented some of the ideas to our Professors. Here is a slide from one of the presentations we created.\n\nOne of the Professors suggested that rather than exploring the B2C concept, we should try and see if we can sell such a solution to large enterprises. The idea was that Banks and other large enterprises would already have multiple such customers and so, we can ride on the Banks for customer acquisition rather than doing it ourselves.\n\nWe pivoted to the B2B idea - sell solutions to enterprises that will help their customers get banking services at their fingertips. Now, we had a new customer persona - a Bank’s head of Customer Support. So, with the help of an advisor’s network, we met some of the Bank officials - HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, YES Bank.\n\nWe met the Bank’s Digital Team at the HDFC Bank office at Peninsula Business Park, Lower Parel, Mumbai. The idea was to not sell anything and just get their feedback and explore the gaps.\n\nWe also went to their Kamla Mills Branch in Lower Parel to see one of their latest Technology Initiative - the IRA Robot which helps customers navigate within the Branch.\n\nBased on our discussion with the HDFC Bank officials, we realized that they are quite keen to develop solutions on voice-based technologies like Voice recognition, Voice biometrics, etc.\n\nLater, we met a couple of other Banks - YES Bank and Axis Bank to get their feedback.

Hector Quintanilla,6y,What are some unknown failures of today's highly successful entrepreneurs?,"Jeff Bezos biggest failures:

Amazon’s Fire Smartphone: Even at $0.99 the phone wouldn’t sell. This is possibly Amazon’s biggest failure.
Amazon’s Destinations: Amazon tried to get selling travel deals. Failed and was shut down after a few weeks.
Amazon Local: The idea is similar to Groupon and LivingSocial. It didn’t work. Failed.
Amazon Wallet: Failed after a few months in the market.
Amazon Local Register: The product was similar to Square's and PayPal's, but never quite took off. Failed.
Amazon’s Music Importer: Prime Music quickly made obsolete the service. Failed.
Amazon’s Askville: This is service like Quora and Yahoo Answers was introduced by Amazon in 2006 and failed by 2013.

But here’s the most important thing to remember:

These are NOT considered failures for Bezos!

Failure is part of an innovative strategy![1]

“At Amazon, we have to grow the size of our failures as the size of our company grows,” he said on Saturday. “We have to make bigger and bigger failures — otherwise none of our failures will be needle movers. It’s a very bad sign over the long run if Amazon wasn’t making larger and larger failures.” — Jeff Bezos [2]

Rakesh Jilla,6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Back in Jersey, I used to get my food delivered from an Indian restaurant every other day. This restaurant had its own free delivery service and since I ordered so regularly, I know the delivery guys personally (there were 3 different people who delivered the food) and the owner of the restaurant. To the restaurant’s credit they offered good food and I left a good tip every time I ordered.

I used to take a bus ride for work and the restaurant was near my office. I missed my bus one day and decided to walk to my apartment. As I was walking, I passed by this Indian restaurant and I thought to order food to-go. I went in and introduced myself to the restaurant owner. As it has been months that I was ordering food from this restaurant, the owner immediately recognized me and greeted me warmly.

As I was ordering the food, I suddenly remembered a funny little idea that I read somewhere before. I thought why not I apply it here? I felt that I am going to wait for the food anyway, why not experiment? So I stopped my order and went aside. I then called the restaurant and said I wanted to place an order for delivery. The restaurant owner laughed and said why do I want to do that? He mentioned he saw me just now. I laughingly said I changed my mind and decided I want an order for delivery and not a pickup.

He was confused for a minute, but he took my order anyway. I then hang up and waited for about 10 minutes before entering the restaurant again. The owner was surprised to see me and asked what am I doing here. He asked does he need to cancel the delivery and make it a pick-up instead. I said that is not required and requested to let me know when the food was ready. He gave me a weird look and mentioned he would. After some time he said the food is ready and he asked his worker to get the food delivered.

The delivery guy knows me as well. We greeted each other before the owner, while the owner was handing over the delivery bag. Now, I asked them whether it would be okay if I can ride in his car to my apartment?

The owner paused a second, and then laughed. He said “I knew something was up when you didn’t want the pick-up but I wasn’t expecting this. Of course you can take a ride.” I thanked him and got into the car. I got a free ride to my apartment.

I did this a few times when I missed my bus. Since I was a regular, both the delivery guy and the owner never minded giving me a free ride to my apartment. It was fun for sometime.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ulwo6rg2qf3nixs5', 'title': ""What is the most clever life hack you've learned?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Back in Jersey, I used to get my food delivered from an Indian restaurant every other day.

Asim Qureshi,4y,What's one simple tip for becoming successful?,"A friend of mine has huge feet - sized UK 13.

A few years ago I was strolling through a high-end departmental store in Malaysia with him.

He saw a shoe he liked, asked for it in his size, tried it on, went to the cashier to pay with his credit card.

The odd thing was that the price wasn't written on the shoe, he hadn't asked the price, and he wasn't particularly wealthy - he was in the early stages of a startup.

I asked him, ""Why didn't you even ask for the price of the shoe before buying?""

He explained, ""Asim, the shoes could cost anything from US$200 to $1k, I liked them, and my shoe size is pretty difficult to find in Malaysia. If I spend 2 hours finding a shoe at the lowest end of that scale I'd save up to $800 but my 2 hours is worth way more than that to me.""

The shoes ended up costing around $300.

This guy is now worth more than $10m.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"So I completed my bachelors back in 2015 from one of the NIT's. I belong to a middle class family and I had a alcoholic father. After clearing AIEEE I thought my life would get better but life had planned something else for me. So after counselling for 2nd round was over I got a seat in NIT Surat(Civil).But my father refused to let me go. He said if you want to study you can study in the NIT which is my hometown otherwise he wont pay the fees. So I ended getting admitted in the NIT which was situated in my hometown.(which was not a bad option).

I started studying there but being a day scholar I had to witness his abuse and bad behaviour towards my mother everyday. Which took a toll on my mental health and for the first time in my life I failed. I tried to study more harder but to no avail.

This continued till second year and I somehow barely passed subjects. My morale was at an all time low and one day I had a panic attack while I was performing practicals in my department and I fainted. The profs called the heath center and an ambulance came to take me. I was brought back to consciousness but something strange happened. I was not able to speak no matter how much I tried. A psychiatrist was called who asked me to relax and after some breathing exercises I was able to speak again. I told the psychiatrist everything . He gave me a questionnaire and asked me to fill it up. After that he counseled me and told me that I have characteristics of pure OCD(obsessive compulsive disorder) and severe depression and I need to be treated. The medicines he gave me stopped my excessive thinking but my cognitive performance reduced even further and I needed more sleep.(the medicine contained sertraline hydrochloride). Because of this I flunked few subjects and my course got extended by one semester.

I could not sit for placements since I had one extra semester. Meanwhile all my batchmates got placed and started the happy phase of their life which I dreamt about. After I finished my degree I applied for jobs at various places but my academic record was so bad that most people never even called me for interviews, and few of them who called me asked me about my bad grades. When I told them the truth they were sympathetic about what I have been through but nobody offered me any job. My dad used to beat me because I was a failure and psychotic. After sometime I totally gave up on my life and I felt like I had no purpose. I had even stopped looking for jobs.

Since I had a lot of free time I started teaching kids in my colony for free. In the beginning parents were reluctant to send their kids because of my fathers behaviour but then a uncle asked me to teach his kids. Soon he could see improvement in his kids and asked others to send their kids too. I started teaching 10 kids and now parents paid me 500 rs per month for teaching them. My mother was very happy and literally cried in happiness when I gave her my salary of 5000 Rs. That was the best moment of my life and I could finally see some hope.

But my father learnt about me taking tuiton classes in his absence and said that you should stop this or I will throw both of you out of my house as I was ruining his reputation in society which was true to some extent. People used to make fun of me that I was a NIT graduate but I was still doing such a petty job. I stopped taking tutions and started studying chemistry which I liked since my JEE days. After 2 months of pouring myself into chemistry I went to a local coaching institute and was offered a job on trial basis. I had never taught so many kids at once so initially I got scared but after a few days I became comfortable.

After teaching 11th standard kids for over 1 year there at a meagre salary of 25k I wanted to leave the coaching. Now here comes the twist , the senior teacher who was supposed to teach 12th standard chemistry had a very monotonous way of teaching and my students didn't like it so they requested the owner to let me take their classes instead. The owner called me and told me the situation and offered to pay me 35k per month. I bargained with him since he was giving the senior teacher over a lakh rupees per month. He finally agreed at 60k per month and told me if my students cleared JEE mains he will give me bonus over and above my base salary. I was on cloud 7 that day.

I worked really hard after that and made my students work harder. And finally it paid off. My students got good ranks in Jee mains and advanced this year and I was paid 7 lakh as bonus recently.

I admitted my dad forcefully into a rehab program a few months ago and he has finally stopped drinking. He is not a bad guy but when he drinks alcohol he can't control himself and starts taking out his frustration over others.

My life is better now. I have everything that I could want from life. But it took patience and efforts. So believe in yourself and remember that “you haven't lost the battle if you can still stand”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cy3ozlrua1h68dpj', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.5308, 'ai': 0.4692}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""So I completed my bachelors back in 2015 from one of the NIT's.

John Cate,1y,Can Sears recover?,"If you mean Sears as the department store retailer, no. According to Wikipedia, there are just 23 Sears stores left standing in the USA, not including their small specialty stores. There is very little left, and the only reason those stores exist is so its corporate (mis)management can squeeze every last dime of value before filing Chapter 7 to liquidate anything that is left.

Sears’ department store model is dead and it will never return. People don’t like shopping at malls anymore and they don’t enjoy shopping in stores full of overpriced merchandise which they try to sell at a premium based on convenience. I watched Sears slowly decline from the mid-1980s onward, until they just disappeared from view altogether. The quality of the merchandise declined and so did their customer service. I still remember my father going into Sears around 1987 when a Craftsman tool broke and he went there to get them to honor the “lifetime warranty.” They tried to argue with him for half an hour before the manager honored it. Dad never bought another tool at Sears again.

(A funny side note: In the early 1980s, Sears had a computer section and I had learned just enough BASIC on the computer at school to write a program on Sears’ display model. Dad once got mischievous and told me to make their computer display “Shop at JCPenney’s” on an endless loop. After that, I did it every time I went into that Sears! One time I got caught and even the sales clerk laughed.)

I don’t think I have set foot in a Sears for like 10 years. There is a “Sears Hometown” just a few miles away, selling appliances, but I don’t need any, so there’s no reason for me to go there. There are only two remaining full-size Sears stores in the entire state of North Carolina. They are entirely gone from Charlotte, the state’s largest city.

I think the Sears brand will survive the death of the company, though. There is still value in the brand itself, and it will be one of the last things sold off in liquidation. This happened when Montgomery Ward died in 2001 for a lot of the same reasons Sears will. The brand was sold off, and since 2004, it lives again as an online retailer
, selling the same sorts of goods as the original.

The same, I suspect, will happen to Sears. And it will be sort of ironic, since Sears became a popular, successful brand at the turn of the last century because of its catalog sales. Sears called itself “The Cheapest Supply House on Earth,” and would sell you just about anything, even a prefabricated house! Sears was literally to 1905 what Amazon was to 2005.

Very impressive design work for 1909. Sears was a first-class operation then and continued to be all the way into my childhood, but the last time I was in one, I felt like I was in an overpriced Ollie’s or Big Lots. (Nothing against those stores, but Sears claimed to be in a different tier.)

Sears itself made moves to revive its old business model in the early years of the Internet, but never fully embraced it and instead chose to ride its 1960s business model right into the commode. There was still time. They were the largest retailer in the US until 1990, were profitable until 2010, and were still acquiring smaller retailers as late as 1997.

If they had someone with the vision of Jeff Bezos in the late 1990s, they could have transitioned to that model, while leaving their appliance specialty stores open. The problem is that it’s hard for a company so old and set in its ways to re-configure in such a way. A company like Sears is what it is, it’s not going to be agile. They never would have foreseen consumers using the Internet to bring into being a modern-day version of catalog shopping.

Bezos himself has said that someday, a new business model will put Amazon under. And he’s probably right. Every business has its moment in the sun, and when that sun sets, it’s over. Sears has been dying for almost 40 years. They should be grateful for the long twilight.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dajrp7z1fnegst08', 'title': 'Can Sears recover?', 'score': {'original': 0.4903, 'ai': 0.5097}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'If you mean Sears as the department store retailer, no.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I made my husband cry and I feel like I am the worst person on earth for having done so.

My husband is a jolly and fun loving guy. He is my pillar of strength. He has always been supportive of me when I needed him. We have been married for 5 years and I have cried like a hundred times in front of him even for small things but he has always treated me like his own daughter and consoled me.

Like most couples we too engage in deep conversations late at night. One night he revealed his darkest secret to me. He had been sexually abused by an older girl when he was 12 years old. It had continued for months.

I, like the stupid girl I am, couldn't understand the gravity of the situation and started laughing at him. I thought he might have enjoyed it. But I was wrong. He started crying silently. I have never seen him cry before. I was confused and surprised. Then I realized what a grave mistake I had done. I too started crying. He didn't console me. He himself stopped crying and went to bed. That night he didn't talk to me.

Next day he acted like nothing had happened. He was again the happy guy like he was. It has been few days since then. He never mentioned it again and I am afraid to ask about it. I feel I let him down when he needed me the most.

Sometimes the happiest people hold the darkest secrets inside them. Boys and men also get raped. And they certainly don't enjoy it. The mental trauma is same as that of a girl. I feel there is much less awareness about crimes against men than women. I would urge ladies reading my answer to be more empathizing and understanding of the problems that their husbands or sons face in life.

Ayan Srivastava,Updated 8mo,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"[NOTE]: If you find this answer behind a paywall, do not pay for it. You can read it directly from my profile ; I haven’t monetized anything!

If you're a nerd like me, chances are you buy lots of pens!

Purchasing them in bulk, it may happen 2 out of 10 just don't work properly later , and you’ll feel duped! :(

But you're at the shop right now! You ain't got time to write essays with each pen.

Here is a simple test to rapidly check if they work or not.

Ask the shopkeeper for a piece of paper & rapidly make an “8″ (eight) on paper(clean the paper of any dust first)

Notice the region the arrow indicates. The pen is not working properly when a stroke at that angle(or tangent) is made. Hence the line isn’t as thick ; in fact if you specifically make a line along that direction(with speed) the pen might not even work!

Note: It may work perfectly fine in other directions. Also, speed is crucial!

For those of you who are interested in why this works, we’ll have jump into circles and tangents. Tangent is just a line you draw at a point on circle.

A circle can be said to made up of infinite tangents. Each tangent is a line.

(I know I know, I am an artist🤣)

Red = Tangent(with arrow, indicating direction)
Black = Circle
Blue dot = points where tangents are made

Concept: Note that drawing this circle makes sure your pen covers the “entire range of motions possible”, because you cover all possible tangents/lines when you draw a circle.

When you draw an “8” (or infinity symbol), you are actually drawing two circles(one anticlockwise and one clockwise). Not only do you cover entire range of motion, you do the same in other direction too(this time tangent direction will be reversed)

(upper anticlockwise ; lower clockwise)

Hence, instead of furiously scribbling on a pad the next time you’re at the stationery shop, try this. Works like a charm!

EDIT: Well, my 1st answer and >250 upvotes. I feel like a star 😂😂(Won’t lie, this will indeed motivated me to write more, this being one of my first proper answers)

Now for another bonus tip:

(WARNING: This may permanently tilt/damage the nib. But don’t worry its very easy. Do it with some practice on a cheap pen first)

If you ever find your pen suddenly stop working(say its very irregular) use this trick. This happens a lot with cheap ball point pens ; gel pens are usually sufficiently fluid so no problem with them.

Light up a match. wait for 1 second .
Take your pen’s tip(and be EXTREMELY PRECISE here) and put the tip over the flame of the matchstick. Make sure the point where the tip and the plastic of the pen meet is sufficiently far away from the flame else that part will melt. It should be neither too close nor too far.
Rotate the pen as the tip is heating tip. FINISH THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WITHIN 1.5 SECOND. This is because as the metal heats up the junction between the tip and plastic may melt and tip will start to droop. But if you keep rotating it will heat uniformly and won’t droop down. Again, don’t bring it too close to the flame.

4. Remove the tip from the flame, let it fully cool down in air. Then write on paper.(Apply “a little” extra force initially). The pen should work fine.

EDIT 1: Today I wrote an answer on dust 😂. You might want to check it out.

Sean Kernan,2y,Who were some of the most ruthless founders in history?,"Anyone who has studied McDonald's' founder for more than five minutes knows he was ruthless, especially in his early days. He famously said that if he saw a competitor drowning, he would put a hose down their throat.

The McDonald’s brothers were forced to change the name of their restaurant to ""The Big M"". Ray was concerned about them being a competitor. So he opened a McDonald’s next door to their establishment to undercut their business. It worked.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 6y,Is it pointless to try and become a successful entrepreneur with an average IQ?,"WAIT!

That is a big lie!

Such lies can destroy your life!

STOP everything you’re doing and learn from my mistakes!

I grew up thinking that I wasn't good enough.

I was a terrible student. I hated school. The system was a bully in my life. Those standardized evaluations said that I was bellow average. ALWAYS!

Result?

This disrupted, old, broken, antique, Industrial Age educational system is telling kids with different brains or emotional struggles:
“You don’t meet the standard!”
“You’re below average!”
“You can’t achieve what’s expected in this world!”
“You’re a loser!”
“You belong to the group of the laggers!”

Keep reading!

Whether you’ve been IQ tested or not, forget that idea or “standardized test!” These results are comparing you to a “batch” of people.

DON’T LET THIS MAN-MADE ASSESSMENT DEFINE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!

Know this:

We’re all different.

We all have different abilities that makes us unique in different ways. Whether you have an average IQ, are an average student, or an average individual, forget about that and now YOUR job is to find those UNIQUE gifts and talents that you have!

Don’t tell me you don’t have any talents because you DO have them!

Success in life starts the moment we identify those unique talents we all have!

Which are they? That’s the challenge! That’s our personal battle.

Since we’re born everyone tells us what we should do and what we can't do. Parents, friends, school, culture, religion, everything around us is trying to make us “fit in” and NOT STAND OUT!

Is entrepreneurship your gift? Maybe!

Experimentation should be in your mind daily until you find those gifts!

Try entrepreneurship, give it all you can, do it with all your heart and be humble. If it works out, great! If it doesn't, work, great, now go and test new areas.

Explore, be hungry, be open, enjoy the process and get all that learned mediocre crap in your mind out of there!

Remember this powerful truth:

Where the mind goes, the man follows.

You don’t need a high IQ to succeed.
You need FREEDOM to succeed!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/c0x1a57u9sbd2eg6', 'title': 'Is it pointless to try and become a successful entrepreneur with an average IQ?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""WAIT!\n\nThat is a big lie!\n\nSuch lies can destroy your life!\n\nSTOP everything you’re doing and learn from my mistakes!\n\nI grew up thinking that I wasn't good enough.\n\nI was a terrible student.

Vaishnavi Kushwaha,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Have you ever faced problem in getting up early..? I'm asking this because getting up early is not my thing. I put my alarm on as..

6 am ~ 6:15 am ~ 6:30 am ~ 6:45 am ~ 7 am ~ 7:15 am till 9'o clock. But this never helped me.

But what if you have Important submissions, seminars, events..??

Unconsciously we stop the alarm and enjoy our sleep. You know if your mind get conscious, you'll find it difficult to sleep again.

So here is a useful app for all those who are in love with their sleep.. ALARMY..!!

You can get this from play store. There are many options to stop the alarm like you have to do some basic mathematics calculation. This will help your mind to get conscious. Or to take a predecided picture.

Edit- It wouldn't let you switch off your phone or uninstall the app if you tick the “prevent from turn off” and “prevent app uninstall” checkboxes in settings.

Hope you'll all enjoy your sunrise tomorrow. :-P

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"You know, that kind of girl who isn't the most pretty one or the sexiest but is still sooo damn attractive that you don't want to look away?

The first time I saw her at orientation class, she looked like she came to class straight from bed. She had sneaked into the hall but then caught the eyes of professor, she was called on stage. She flirted in the most subtle way you would imagine, everyone in the hall was enjoying their que-ans round? Her interrogation? Needless to say, she became popular.

I knew she was someone I wanted to get to know, but so did, rest of the college. Her reputation builded up as one of the ‘hard to get chicks'. She was, still is so private about her life, even though she has accounts everywhere you wouldn't figure out what she does, where she goes, who she hangs out with, nothing!

Someone, one of the guys, got so damn curious that he hacked into her account. Half of the hostel was there, but nothing except some quickly ended conversations. (He later did apologise.)

College was about to end, exams, things were getting stressful, I had given up the thoughts of going out with her and even friendship. She kept everyone at arm's length. She didn't even mix up with girls. She was friendly yet cold, rude yet sweet, I don't know how to explain how she was exactly while we were strangers, but if there was some grey area where you could place someone's personality, she would fall in the greyest place. Okay, yeah, exams were coming and I was staying in library all the time. She happened to seat next to me and started talking, I couldn't figure out whether she was talking to herself or me but I wanted to say something. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to say something funny to the context or something intelligent, what I blurted out instead was ‘ummm'. Inside my head, I was like dude, you're so cool, I don't know why.

She was like, am I disturbing you? ‘No, how about we grab some coffee and talk? We can talk freely.’ She said yes right away. I was like, ‘hard to go out with'? What? (She did go out with 2 guys, things didn't turn serious)

We were talking about this and that when she blurred out, hey, I'm hungry, lets go … place, my treat. I was like, yaaaaaaaay! Why would I say no?

Before I could even realize it, we were hanging out daily. We became friends, but still I knew almost nothing about her. I was expecting something mysterious but she was just a normal person, with normal background, nothing out of place, except HER.

She always seemed out of place.

I wanted to know if I was something else other than a friend to her but I was scared if she'll grow distant afterwards. There were rumors everywhere. She was teased with my name everywhere, she would turn deaf to them. I too did the same.

It had already been 1 year of us being the way we were and 5 years of crush from my side. I did go out with other girls in my college days, had some flings, but she never left my mind.

I wanted more but I was getting more hopeless. I did build up some courage and asked her to hangout at my place. (by that time,we were comfortable enough to show up at the others place unannounced.) She came in as usual, I thought I would confess , let her know how much she means to me, before I could even utter a single word, she kissed me gently and told me, (something along these lines)

‘I love you too. I know you've liked me for a long time. I think for me it was when you had that fever and you looked at me with those puppy eyes, or the time you were praying for me, I'm hopelessly in love with you, my impossible fucktard, I love you too.’

I had never realized it until then, that she can tell what's going on in my mind.

I was about to cry then she kissed me again. Rest of the evening is blur. It felt like a dream. I might have asked her to pinch me,maybe a little more than 100 times that evening.

I love her. And, she loves me too. My life is like a fairytale right now. Even when things are not working out, I tell myself, dude, she loves you too, everything feels perfect then.

P.S. We might be, might be, getting married by the end of this year. :)

Hector Quintanilla,4y,What is the reality of startup life?,"“Who wants to go to Disney World?” I asked my kids.

Immediately they reacted shouting, “Me! Me! Me!”

I turned to my wife and whispered in her ear, “Project sold. We have our ‘startup team’ onboard!”

“Okay, okay! Calm down, kids. Don’t get too excited yet,” I said in a loud voice, “This will be a long trip. Florida is very far away. It will take two days to get there.”

“Only two days? Ohh, come on, dad, that’s nothing! We can take it.”

“Kids, I’m telling you this won't be easy. I can assure you this will challenge every one of us,” I said.

“No worries, Dad. We can take it. We’re ready!” my girl said confidently.

So we started planning our trip.

We did some research, paperwork, and finally packed our luggage to make this ‘project’ a reality. The motivation and excitement were enough to lift every one of us into taking care of all the details.

The day finally came. No more planning. It was time to take action! “Hop into the car,” I said, “And don’t forget your luggage!”

That day we woke up at 5:00 AM. Everyone energetically jumped out of their beds. The goal was clear: Get to Disney World! Our plan was to drive to New Orleans, sleep there and continue to Orlando the following day.

Easy, right? That’s what we thought …

As soon as we took action, reality kicked in.

“Dad, I need a restroom!”

We stopped.

Then we hit the U.S. border with two long hours of car line.

We stopped.

“Mom, I’m hungry!”

We stopped.

“Dad, are we there yet?”

“No, we still have several hours ahead of us,” I answered patiently.

Then, internal problems began to emerge, “Keep your hands to yourself!” one said.

“I didn't do anything!” the other said.

“Yes, you did!”

We stopped for a break before the conflict escalated.

Then, our resources started to become scarce. We needed gasoline but found no gas stations nearby. Patience. Uncertainty. More patience. Nerves. Uncertainty.

It took time, but we finally found one.

We stopped.

Then we bumped into an accident in the middle of the highway blocking the road. We had to use a different road to avoid all the traffic.

It took us much, much longer than expected to get to our first destination, but, finally, hotel and dinner for everyone!

Tough day, full of unexpected issues, but we successfully solved one at a time. Day one … OVER.

Early the next day, I woke up to motivate the team. “Who wants to go to Disney World?”

“Me! Me! Me!” They shouted jumping out of their beds.

“Quickly,” I said. “We have another long day ahead of us,” I told my ‘partners.’

Everyone was excited. Off we went …

A couple of hours later, problems started to happen again, “Mom?”

“Yes?” my wife asked.

“I’m dizzy!” one of our children said, followed by a long pause.

“Mom? I want to …” my kid said with his eyes popping out while holding his mouth tightly.

“HECTOR,” my wife shouted, “PUT DOWN THE WINDOW AND STOP THE CAR!”

We stopped.

Then a restroom.

We stopped.

Then gasoline.

We stopped.

A few hours later, “Dad, I’m hungry!”

We stopped.

“Mom, are we there yet?”

“Not yet, we still have a few hours ahead of us,” my wife patiently said.

Then a yellow warning light appeared on my dashboard. “CHECK ENGINE.”

I found the nearest Honda dealer. We deviated from our route, again. A few hours later, success. Issue solved. We continued.

Then emotions started to overtake us.

“Dad, I want to get out. I don’t feel like going to Orlando anymore,” my girl said impatiently.

“We’re almost there,” I said.

Emotions turned into desperation …

“DAD, ARE WE THERE YET? WILL WE EVER GET THERE?”

“Yes, we’re just a few minutes away.”

Minutes felt like hours, until FINALLY … we got there.

This is an exemplification of “the startup life.”

Expect a journey full of emotions. You will experience good days and bad days. You will work hard with little-to-no progress and multiple unexpected roadblocks along the way.

That’s okay. That’s the road everyone goes through on their way to “Disney World.”

We all start with a dream. We plan. That’s easy!

The real adventure starts the moment we get moving, and like on any road trip, your PATIENCE will be tested.

But, hey! Cheer up! Remember that “Disney World” awaits you at your destination!

My advice: Control your attitude!

Remember that the “adventure” that leads to your destination is also part of your overall “Disney Trip” experience!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yhw1lnqemt270riz', 'title': 'What is the reality of startup life?', 'score': {'original': 0.9336, 'ai': 0.0664}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""“Who wants to go to Disney World?” I asked my kids.\n\nImmediately they reacted shouting, “Me!

Anonymous,6y,What has been the lowest point in your life?,"My wife went to work one day in my car and never came home. The finances had somehow been mismanaged to the point that her car had miraculously been repossessed.

She took all the money from the bank account, and put a password on it, I couldn't even figure out for a while what happened. I lost my job. No car, no help watching my infant son. Our electric was shut off. She said she'd paid it, but she lied. Then our water went. We lived off several cases of bottled water. Then we got an eviction notice. We nearly ran out of food. At its worst, we ate canned green beans for breakfast, cold, and again for lunch. She even took the vacuum, so dog hair piled up, and we got a flea infestation in the carpet. Every night, it was “I'll be back tomorrow, promise.”

One night, after begging her to come back, and asking her where she was, I was sitting on the porch with my boy, watching the stars. I was so depressed I was totally numb. A meteorite shot across my vision, and my son pointed at it. He asks me if he can make a wish. I told him of course he can. He was silent for so long that I assumed he'd forgotten, when he heaved a sigh and said “Daddy? I wished that Mommy would come back.”

I held him and sobbed so hard. I tried to stifle the sound, and the shaking, I didn't want to worry him further.

That is it. I've never been so low.

It's been about a year. We've nearly recovered. She never came back, and has nothing to do with her boy.

Edit: Since a few people have expressed concern, yes we are doing well. He is happy and has plenty of friends, and doesnt mention her much. I have my own business that I operate on the side, and have returned to my career after a bumpy time. I've also begun talking to a woman, and she pursued me!

Ausaf Ahmad,Updated 4y,What has been the lowest point in your life?,"(Apologies for such a long answer, I’d be obliged if you read till the end. I have tried to make it as short as possible.)

I rose from death thrice and was still lucky enough to get what I wanted to achieve in my life at the same time!!

Okay, quite dramatic I guess, but let me take you through my journey.

Brief history - I’ve always wanted to become a doctor, and I was supposed to be appearing for medical entrance exam in the month of May. Everything was going very well, and I was able to complete my course by the end of January. Three months still left for NEET, I had ample of time for revision. I had still not missed a single test and was constantly within 1100 AIR in all the tests. Things were going pretty good.

Fast Forward to 15th April 2019 :

I suddenly started to have petechiae on my limbs and neck, in which I would bleed spontaneously even with gentle pressure to an area on the skin. I guess here’s when having both parents as doctors creates undue tension and stress. The first and foremost diagnosis by my parents was that I was maybe suffering from Vasculitis
. I was pretty scared, but once finding out that the treatment was pretty straightforward, I didn’t worry too much. But the spots continued to grow, even to the extent that squeezing my skin between my fingers would lead to free flow of blood. My studies had already taken a standstill by now, and more than that, due to lack of revision, things had started slipping out of my mind.

The medications having no effect, I was taken for a skin biopsy. My father works in SGPGI Lucknow, so I could get it easily done there. For those of you who have ever had a biopsy, or even watched one happening, you would know it is one of the most painful procedures. I guess after a trauma and a delivery room, you’d hear the most excruciating cries from a biopsy room. As expected, it hurt a lot, especially after the effect of the local anaesthetic had worn off. Much to my plight, it pained so much that I wasn’t even able to lift a book or even turn page, forget practicing with a pen and paper.

Things had planned to go totally against me. The biopsy report came back absolutely negative, but to our surprise, the spots had now become less frequent, so in the end it was believed that the medicines were finally working. My studies had already gone down the toilet.

The dreaded night of 3rd May, 2019 :

3 AM in the darkest of the night : I woke up from my sleep and found myself shivering even when the room temperature had been around 32 degrees. The thermometer read ‘103.4 F’. My exam was 48 hours away. I woke up my parents. They thought the fever was due to exam stress and anxiety. I too believed the same and tried going back to sleep. Two hours later, I was still awake and was feeling even worse. Took my temperature again. The fever had risen to 104.4 F by now.

Seeing such high a temperature, my parents had started to worry. Even after repeated doses of paracetamol and other antipyretics, my fever didn’t go down even a bit. By the afternoon, it was decided that I should be put on a drip and given paracetamol intravenously in combination with several other antibiotics.

4th May 2019 : It had been almost 24 hours and my fever had not gone down even for an hour. I was completely exhausted, and it was apparent by now that I’ll never be able to appear for NEET the next day. IV meds continued through the day, and even after trying my level best I wasn’t able to sleep that night.

5th May 2019 : Fever still at 104 F, I don’t know what struck me or gave me strength that I decided to sit for the exam even with an IV and a bottle attached to my arm. My parents were just not ready to let me go. After an hour of constant crying and cursing on my side, my parents succumbed and let me go, with the assurance from my side that they would be waiting outside and I will contact them if I felt dizzy or unwell.

On my way to the centre, the sun was at its peak, and in the scorching heat I felt extremely unwell and dizzy, to the point I thought I’ll fall dead even before reaching the centre. I had still an IV running, with the bottle in my father’s hand. At a place where there’s an inspection stricter that an airport, it was obvious that the security personnel wouldn’t just let me go with all the stuff I had brought along with me. I waited till the the last drop of the IV had coursed its journey from the bottle into my arm. I still had to carry my meds and water into the class, even though instructions were clearly against it. After much persuasion, with sharp five minutes left to Two o’ Clock, I was allowed to go in with a handkerchief and my medicines, the water was to be provided by the school authorities.

One final shot before I went for my exam

I did whatever I could have done under the effect of 3 grams of paracetamol and a handful of other tranquilizers, and I was constantly cursing God and my luck. The paper was quite easy, but instead of giving me hope, I felt that everyone would score extremely well and I would definitely be way out of the race when the results would come. I wrongly filled many bubbles, left many super simple questions, messed up other ones and just waited for the exam to be over. All the stress, heat, fever and pain had drained me completely, and on my way out of the building I fell unconscious. I was rushed to ICU-Critical Care Medicine, SGPGI Lucknow. I was lucky enough that my father was a professor there, else the chance of getting an empty bed was second to none. Not to exaggerate, but the chance of coming out of an ICU-CCM is one in twenty, and even then, it would be too considerate an estimate.

I don’t know what my parents went through in those 4 days during which I lay unconscious on an ICU bed, I could only imagine them cursing themselves, praying to God to save their son and asking for forgiveness even for the mistakes they couldn’t have committed in their dreams.

9th May 2019 : I slowly came back to my senses, only to find myself surrounded by IV pumps, ventilator, infusers and several machines whose names I can’t even recall now with several leads glued to my chest. The first thing I saw was my mother sobbing at one corner of the room, and even before I could utter a complete word, she came and held my hand only to burst into complete tears. As I learnt through the course of the day, I had went into hyperthermia and my enzyme machinery had started to shut off, leading to a dozen of complications including electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, anaemia, seizures and loss of some reflexes. I had dodged death once already by now.

Opening eyes in a new environment

I was surrounded by a dozen of IV pumps, ventilator, infusers and several machines whose names I can’t even recall now.

My fever had not gone down even by then, even after being kept in a cold blanket for three days at a stretch. I was being given even stronger drugs to bring my fever down with a combination of drugs for malaria, dengue, cold, etc. The freezing blanket was replaced with sponges with ice cold water, which later led to bilateral lung consolidation, which basically meant that water had started accumulating in my lungs due to constant cold and supinate position.

An endless array of tests were conducted on me ranging from CBC to gene profiling to repeated bacterial cultures, most of which came back absolutely clean. My platelets counts had fallen below 80k, my haemoglobin had gone down from 15.4 to 6.1, but these two things had no relation to my illness, atleast that was that was apparent at that moment.

Being admitted into CCM comes with another set of challenges. Most of the patients around you are terminally ill, and often have dreaded bacterial, viral and fungal infections that have an almost 100% fatality rate. Once into CCM, I was being pumped full of high grades antibiotics and antifungals like meropenem and amphotericin (each dose costing around 18k).A ray of hope appeared as my fever began responding to the medicines finally, even if it went down for an hour although after a full gram of paracetamol. The result was that my liver took a toll and my S-ALT/AST were already 50 times the normal levels. Keeping in mind that the liver heals remarkably well, my parents thought I’ll be out of the ICU in a couple of days.

16th May 2019 : Severe lung collapse, severe hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, severe hypoxia, dizziness culminating into seizures. Followed by atrial fibrillation, I was shocked thrice before I came back to life for the second time. Immediately afterwards I was put on a ventilator (NIV – Non- Invasive Ventilation). I had already two venflons on either of my hands, and even those were falling inadequate to transfuse all the medications into me. I was still under NIV when a need for a Central Line was put up.

Venflons vs Central Line

I was consistently going in and out of consciousness. I couldn’t eat or drink water or go to the bathroom. I had to be given water by squeezing a sponge in my mouth. I never felt so pathetic in my life. Thanks to the profuse sweating and almost zero food intake for over a week, I had lost a lot of fluids and blood proteins (albumin) which maintain the normal BP. My BP had gone down to 60/88, and was no longer high enough to be measured by NIBP (non-invasive BP - cuff measurement). Then came another extremely painful procedure in which I was put on an arterial line to monitor my BP directly through the radial artery.

Still having not found the focus of infection, I was put through another very painful procedure of bone marrow biopsy. I won’t feel ashamed to admit that I cried at the top of my voice through the entire procedure.

Drugs kept getting added and slowly spilled over to two pages. Every thirty minutes, I was being transfused some or the other medicine, ranging from NORAD to Human Albumin to a dozen of antibiotics and antifungals.

Sure enough, even the biopsy report came back negative. This has been probably the lowest point in my life till now. I was so distraught, depressed and fragile that I was more than happy to accept death than going through all this for even one other day. I cried the entire night. Had I been able to move my hands or lift myself up, I would have disconnected the ventilators and all the machines at that very moment.

The doctor under whom I was being treated also happened to be my father’s best friend from his college times. In the beginning he often said to me that all this was due to stress but in the course of the treatment, I saw fear and hesitation in his eyes. Once when I was conscious, I heard him telling my father that how hard it is for him to treat me as he had seen me like his own son and he just risk taking drastic steps. He placed his hand on my head and said(I still remember those words clearly), “Jis bhi bhagwan ko maante ho, bass uska naam le lo.” (Take the name of whichever God you believe in.) At this point, I felt it is over for me.

The following evening, a blood test and an echo confirmed I was going into acute multi organ failure involving the heart, lungs, bone marrow, liver and kidneys. I had an enlarged spleen, enlarged right atrium, missed beats and loss of awareness about my situation and surroundings.The news of me being extremely (read terminally) ill had spread like fire across the entire hospital, and even to my coaching. Almost everyone in the hospital started visiting me, talking to me as if I wouldn’t be able to see the next morning. Due to the lung collapse, I had almost lost my voice. I felt like shouting but just couldn’t.I hit rock bottom, when the Director of the Institute, Dr. Rakesh Kapoor (who is also the HOD of Urology, in which my father is a Professor) came to visit me. I had known him since I was a child, and to see him pity my condition was beyond what I could handle. Only tears rolled from my eyes. Also, he came to visit me every day, gave his precious time to me till I was out of Critical Care.

I was being looked after a team of doctors from every field, cardiology, immunology, nephrology, oncology, endocrine, neurology, haematology, urology, you just name the field and the doctor was present, yet no one could discern what I had. Amidst a sea of suggestions was to shift me to AIIMS, Delhi. I was already being treated under doctors who had studied from AIIMS, and was at a place with facilities as good as AIIMS-D, risking a journey through no man’s land was unimaginable and unreasonable.

From nurses to CCM doctors, I was termed as the all-rounder-patient, the mystery disease boy. The place had started to feel like home, and I’d spend my day chatting the sisters and doctors up !

Since I had signs of vasculitis, the popular belief was that I was suffering from some autoimmune disorder (maybe even sarcoidosis). The normal course of action would have been steroids, but because of the unusual presentation of the disease, it would have certainly lead to a point of no return.It was finally decided that I would be given IVIG for 7 days to basically shut my entire immune system down so atleast the fever would go down.

Day 2 of IVIG Therapy (21/05) : Since my CT and MRI had already come clean, the doctors devised a clever plan to find the focus of the infection. PET-CT is one such procedure in which you are injected with a radioactive glucose substitute (FDG) and then you’re put through a special CT scanner. This test is usually used to diagnose and locate cancers because cancer cells are very active metabolically hence the corresponding areas light up on the screen. It was found that one of my cervical lymph node had increased in size. The need for biopsy was felt again but due to the location of the node (right over carotid), it was not possible. (Thank God). I was put through a slightly less painful procedure of FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology).

Day 7 : The IVIG had slowly started to show it’s effect and my fever came well down to 100F, but the temperature still was far from normal.

30th May 2019 : In the evening I developed a sharp pain in my head and all of a sudden things started to look blurry. An emergency consult was called, which revealed that I had developed Uveitis, which would have led to blindness if not treated immediately.The only treatment was with steroids, which was the only one thing I was being kept far far away from since the start. Nevertheless, I was started on 300 mg hydrocortisone to be continued with 60 mg prednisolone with the known danger that this would backfire rather quickly and quite lethally. By luck, or otherwise, I didn’t develop any further complications, and even my fever went away completely.

3rd June 2019: I was brought home to be put in isolation. Sadly, the same night my BP plummeted again, and back was I into the CCM one again.

5th June,2019: I was still admitted when the NEET 2019 result came. I was not expecting them to be even good, I had not for once checked with the answer key and I didn’t even know what I’d done in the exam anyways. Around 7 PM, I received a call from my brother that I had scored 623 and secured an All India Rank of 3614. After days of despair, hopelessness, darkness, pain, misery, and discomfort, this was the first ray of sunshine to fall on me. At least now I knew I would be able to pursue my dream.

I was kept there for a another week on NORAD and Albumin before I was discharged finally on 7th June 2019.

Me walking after over 30 days of lying in the bed, (Clicked by my father, for him these were my new-old baby steps ! ) I had lost so much strength that I was even unable to stand straight for even 20 seconds. I even had trouble balancing myself for the first few days.

The journey from there on hasn’t been easy either, but now I feel strong, confident and happy than ever before. I’m still on a high dose of steroids and I’m still facing a lot of consequences that come with it (hypertension, breathlessness, decreased immunity, hot flashes, etc.)

After several low points including two drop years, I’m in my dream college, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow.

WHAT I LEARNT :

Probably the best message I’d like to give is that God Helps Those who Help Themselves. Had I lost hope of getting better, had I lost courage and strength to give the exam, or had I been satisfied with my destiny, I would have never been able to realize my dream. You should be determined enough that even mishaps should not throw you off the track, you should be confident enough that even stress should not be able to able to belittle your efforts.

We all die. The goal isn’t to live forever, the goal is to create something that will.

That it will never come again is what makes life so sweet. This experience has made me confident and fearless about life. Now when an endeavour seems too daunting and stressful, I retrospect could it be worse? Whatever you want to do, do it now. There are only so many tomorrows.

I still remain undiagnosed, and a legend tells me let the unknown be unknown. I live in SGPGI Campus itself, and I meet all the doctors who had treated me all the time. A concrete diagnosis hasn’t been formed yet, and to them I still remain the miracle child !","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/talhvp3y8w94mr2x', 'title': 'What has been the lowest point in your life?', 'score': {'original': 0.65838571428571, 'ai': 0.34161428571429}, 'blocks': [{'text': '(Apologies for such a long answer, I’d be obliged if you read till the end.

Everything was going very well, and I was able to complete my course by the end of January. Three months still left for NEET, I had ample of time for revision. I had still not missed a single test and was constantly within 1100 AIR in all the tests. Things were going pretty good.\n\nFast Forward to 15th April 2019 :\n\nI suddenly started to have petechiae on my limbs and neck, in which I would bleed spontaneously even with gentle pressure to an area on the skin. I guess here’s when having both parents as doctors creates undue tension and stress. The first and foremost diagnosis by my parents was that I was maybe suffering from Vasculitis\n. I was pretty scared, but once finding out that the treatment was pretty straightforward, I didn’t worry too much. But the spots continued to grow, even to the extent that squeezing my skin between my fingers would lead to free flow of blood. My studies had already taken a standstill by now, and more than that, due to lack of revision, things had started slipping out of my mind.\n\nThe medications having no effect, I was taken for a skin biopsy. My father works in SGPGI Lucknow, so I could get it easily done there. For those of you who have ever had a biopsy, or even watched one happening, you would know it is one of the most painful procedures. I guess after a trauma and a delivery room, you’d hear the most excruciating cries from a biopsy room. As expected, it hurt a lot, especially after the effect of the local anaesthetic had worn off.

The biopsy report came back absolutely negative, but to our surprise, the spots had now become less frequent, so in the end it was believed that the medicines were finally working. My studies had already gone down the toilet.\n\nThe dreaded night of 3rd May, 2019 :\n\n3 AM in the darkest of the night : I woke up from my sleep and found myself shivering even when the room temperature had been around 32 degrees. The thermometer read ‘103.4 F’. My exam was 48 hours away. I woke up my parents. They thought the fever was due to exam stress and anxiety. I too believed the same and tried going back to sleep. Two hours later, I was still awake and', 'result': {'fake': 0.2681, 'real': 0.7319}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'was feeling even worse. Took my temperature again. The fever had risen to 104.4 F by now.\n\nSeeing such high a temperature, my parents had started to worry. Even after repeated doses of paracetamol and other antipyretics, my fever didn’t go down even a bit. By the afternoon, it was decided that I should be put on a drip and given paracetamol intravenously in combination with several other antibiotics.\n\n4th May 2019 : It had been almost 24 hours and my fever had not gone down even for an hour. I was completely exhausted, and it was apparent by now that I’ll never be able to appear for NEET the next day. IV meds continued through the day, and even after trying my level best I wasn’t able to sleep that night.\n\n5th May 2019 : Fever still at 104 F, I don’t know what struck me or gave me strength that I decided to sit for the exam even with an IV and a bottle attached to my arm. My parents were just not ready to let me go. After an hour of constant crying and cursing on my side, my parents succumbed and let me go, with the assurance from my side that they would be waiting outside and I will contact them if I felt dizzy or unwell.\n\nOn my way to the centre, the sun was at its peak, and in the scorching heat I felt extremely unwell and dizzy, to the point I thought I’ll fall dead even before reaching the centre. I had still an IV running, with the bottle in my father’s hand. At a place where there’s an inspection stricter that an airport, it was obvious that the security personnel wouldn’t just let me go with all the stuff I had brought along with me. I waited till the the last drop of the IV had coursed its journey from the bottle into my arm. I still had to carry my meds and water into the class, even though instructions were clearly against it. After much persuasion, with sharp five minutes left to Two o’ Clock, I was allowed to go in with a handkerchief and my medicines, the water was to be provided by the school authorities.\n\nOne final shot before I went for my exam\n\nI did whatever I could have done under the effect of 3 grams of paracetamol and a handful of other tranquilizers, and I was constantly cursing God and my luck. The paper was quite easy, but instead of giving me hope, I felt that everyone would score extremely well and I would definitely be way out of the race when the results would come.

The thermometer read ‘103.4 F’. My exam was 48 hours away. I woke up my parents. They thought the fever was due to exam stress and anxiety. I too believed the same and tried going back to sleep. Two hours later, I was still awake and was feeling even worse. Took my temperature again. The fever had risen to 104.4 F by now.\n\nSeeing such high a temperature, my parents had started to worry. Even after repeated doses of paracetamol and other antipyretics, my fever didn’t go down even a bit. By the afternoon, it was decided that I should be put on a drip and given paracetamol intravenously in combination with several other antibiotics.\n\n4th May 2019 : It had been almost 24 hours and my fever had not gone down even for an hour. I was completely exhausted, and it was apparent by now that I’ll never be able to appear for NEET the next day. IV meds continued through the day, and even after trying my level best I wasn’t able to sleep that night.\n\n5th May 2019 : Fever still at 104 F, I don’t know what struck me or gave me strength that I decided to sit for the exam even with an IV and a bottle attached to my arm. My parents were just not ready to let me go. After an hour of constant crying and cursing on my side, my parents succumbed and let me go, with the assurance from my side that they would be waiting outside and I will contact them if I felt dizzy or unwell.\n\nOn my way to the centre, the sun was at its peak, and in the scorching heat I felt extremely unwell and dizzy, to the point I thought I’ll fall dead even before reaching the centre. I had still an IV running, with the bottle in my father’s hand. At a place where there’s an inspection stricter that an airport, it was obvious that the security personnel wouldn’t just let me go with all the stuff I had brought along with me. I waited till the the last drop of the IV had coursed its journey from the bottle into my arm. I still had to carry my meds and water into the class, even though instructions were clearly against it. After much persuasion, with sharp five minutes left to Two o’ Clock, I was allowed to go in with a handkerchief and my medicines, the water was to be provided by the school authorities.\n\nOne final shot before I went for my exam\n\nI did whatever I could have done under the effect of 3 grams of paracetamol and a handful of other tranquilizers, and I was constantly cursing God and my luck. The paper was quite easy, but instead of giving me hope, I felt that everyone would score extremely well and I would definitely be way out of the race when the results would come. I wrongly filled many bubbles, left many super simple questions, messed up other ones and just waited for the exam to be over. All the stress, heat, fever and pain had drained me completely, and on my way out of the building I fell unconscious. I was rushed to ICU-Critical Care Medicine, SGPGI Lucknow. I was lucky enough that my father was a professor there, else the chance of getting an empty bed was second to none. Not to exaggerate, but the chance of coming out of an ICU-CCM is one in twenty, and even then, it would be too considerate an estimate.\n\nI don’t know what my parents went through in those 4 days during which I lay unconscious on an ICU bed, I could only imagine them cursing themselves, praying to God to save their son and asking for forgiveness even for the mistakes they couldn’t have committed in their dreams.\n\n9th May 2019 : I slowly came back to my senses, only to find myself surrounded by IV pumps, ventilator, infusers and several machines whose names I can’t even recall now with several leads glued to my chest. The first thing I saw was my mother sobbing at one corner of the room, and even before I could utter a complete word, she came and held my hand only to burst into complete tears. As I learnt through the course of the day, I had went into hyperthermia and my enzyme machinery had started to shut off, leading to a dozen of complications including electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, anaemia, seizures and loss of some reflexes. I had dodged death once already by now.\n\nOpening eyes in a new environment\n\nI was surrounded by a dozen of IV pumps, ventilator, infusers and several machines whose names I can’t even recall now.\n\nMy fever had not gone down even by then, even after being kept in a cold blanket for three days at a stretch. I was being given even stronger drugs to bring my fever down with a combination of drugs for malaria, dengue, cold, etc. The freezing blanket was replaced with sponges with ice cold water, which later led to bilateral lung consolidation, which basically meant that water had started accumulating in my lungs due to constant cold and supinate position.\n\nAn endless array of tests were conducted on me ranging from CBC to gene profiling to repeated bacterial cultures, most of which came back absolutely clean. My platelets counts had fallen below 80k, my haemoglobin had gone down from 15.4 to 6.1, but these two things had no relation to my illness, atleast that was that was apparent at that moment.\n\nBeing admitted into CCM comes with another set of challenges. Most of the patients around you are terminally ill, and often have dreaded bacterial, viral and fungal infections that have an almost 100% fatality rate. Once into CCM, I was being pumped full of high grades antibiotics and antifungals like meropenem and amphotericin (each dose costing around 18k).A ray of hope appeared as my fever began responding to the medicines finally, even if it went down for an hour although after a full gram of paracetamol. The result was that my liver took a toll and my S-ALT/AST were already 50 times the normal levels. Keeping in mind that the liver heals remarkably well, my parents thought I’ll be out of the ICU in a couple of days.\n\n16th May 2019 : Severe lung collapse, severe hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, severe hypoxia, dizziness culminating into seizures. Followed by atrial fibrillation, I was shocked thrice before I came back to life for the second time. Immediately afterwards I was put on a ventilator (NIV – Non- Invasive Ventilation). I had already two venflons on either of my hands, and even those were falling inadequate to transfuse all the medications into me. I was still under NIV when a need for a Central Line was put up.\n\nVenflons vs Central Line\n\nI was consistently going in and out of consciousness. I couldn’t eat or drink water or go to the bathroom. I had to be given water by squeezing a sponge in my mouth. I never felt so pathetic in my life. Thanks to the profuse sweating and almost zero food intake for over a week, I had lost a lot of fluids and blood proteins (albumin) which maintain the normal BP. My BP had gone down to 60/88, and was no longer high enough to be measured by NIBP (non-invasive BP - cuff measurement). Then came another extremely painful procedure in which I was put on an arterial line to monitor my BP directly through the radial artery.\n\nStill having not found the focus of infection, I was put through another very painful procedure of bone marrow biopsy. I won’t feel ashamed to admit that I cried at the top of my voice through the entire procedure.\n\nDrugs kept getting added and slowly spilled over to two pages. Every thirty minutes, I was being transfused some or the other medicine, ranging from NORAD to Human Albumin to a dozen of antibiotics and antifungals.\n\nSure enough, even the biopsy report came back negative. This has been probably the lowest point in my life till now. I was so distraught, depressed and fragile that I was more than happy to accept death than going through all this for even one other day. I cried the entire night. Had I been able to move my hands or lift myself up, I would have disconnected the ventilators and all the machines at that very moment.\n\nThe doctor under whom I was being treated also happened to be my father’s best friend from his college times. In the beginning he often said to me that all this was due to stress but in the course of the treatment, I saw fear and hesitation in his eyes. Once when I was conscious, I heard him telling my father that how hard it is for him to treat me as he had seen me like his own son and he just risk taking drastic steps. He placed his hand on my head and said(I still remember those words clearly), “Jis bhi bhagwan ko maante ho, bass uska naam le lo.” (Take the name of whichever God you believe in.) At this point, I felt it is over for me.\n\nThe following evening, a blood test and an echo confirmed I was going into acute multi organ failure involving the heart, lungs, bone marrow, liver and kidneys. I had an enlarged spleen, enlarged right atrium, missed beats and loss of awareness about my situation and surroundings.The news of me being extremely (read terminally) ill had spread like fire across the entire hospital, and even to my coaching. Almost everyone in the hospital started visiting me, talking to me as if I wouldn’t be able to see the next morning. Due to the lung collapse, I had almost lost my voice. I felt like shouting but just couldn’t.I hit rock bottom, when the Director of the Institute, Dr. Rakesh Kapoor (who is also the HOD of Urology, in which my father is a Professor) came to visit me. I had known him since I was a child, and to see him pity my condition was beyond what I could handle. Only tears rolled from my eyes. Also, he came to visit me every day, gave his precious time to me till I was out of Critical Care.\n\nI was being looked after a team of doctors from every field, cardiology, immunology, nephrology, oncology, endocrine, neurology, haematology, urology, you just name the field and the doctor was present, yet no one could discern what I had. Amidst a sea of suggestions was to shift me to AIIMS, Delhi. I was already being treated under doctors who had studied from AIIMS, and was at a place with facilities as good as AIIMS-D, risking a journey through no man’s land was unimaginable and unreasonable.\n\nFrom nurses to CCM doctors, I was termed as the all-rounder-patient, the mystery disease boy. The place had started to feel like home, and I’d spend my day chatting the sisters and doctors up !\n\nSince I had signs of vasculitis, the popular belief was that I was suffering from some autoimmune disorder (maybe even sarcoidosis). The normal course of action would have been steroids, but because of the unusual presentation of the disease, it would have certainly lead to a point of no return.It was finally decided that I would be given IVIG for 7 days to basically shut my entire immune system down so atleast the fever would go down.\n\nDay 2 of IVIG Therapy (21/05) : Since my CT and MRI had already come clean, the doctors devised a clever plan to find the focus of the infection. PET-CT is one such procedure in which you are injected with a radioactive glucose substitute (FDG) and then you’re put through a special CT scanner. This test is usually used to diagnose and locate cancers because cancer cells are very active metabolically hence the corresponding areas light up on the screen. It was found that one of my cervical lymph node had increased in size. The need for biopsy was felt again but due to the location of the node (right over carotid), it was not possible. (Thank God). I was put through a slightly less painful procedure of FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology).\n\nDay 7 : The IVIG had slowly started to show it’s effect and my fever came well down to 100F, but the temperature still was far from normal.\n\n30th May 2019 : In the evening I developed a sharp pain in my head and all of a sudden things started to look blurry. An emergency consult was called, which revealed that I had developed Uveitis, which would have led to blindness if not treated immediately.The only treatment was with steroids, which was the only one thing I was being kept far far away from since the start. Nevertheless, I was started on 300 mg hydrocortisone to be continued with 60 mg prednisolone with the known danger that this would backfire rather quickly and quite lethally. By luck, or otherwise, I didn’t develop any further complications, and even my fever went away completely.\n\n3rd June 2019: I was brought home to be put in isolation. Sadly, the same night my BP plummeted again, and back was I into the CCM one again.\n\n5th June,2019: I was still admitted when the NEET 2019 result came. I was not expecting them to be even good, I had not for once checked with the answer key and I didn’t even know what I’d done in the exam anyways. Around 7 PM, I received a call from my brother that I had scored 623 and secured an All India Rank of 3614. After days of despair, hopelessness, darkness, pain, misery, and discomfort, this was the first ray of sunshine to fall on me. At least now I knew I would be able to pursue my dream.\n\nI was kept there for a another week on NORAD and Albumin before I was discharged finally on 7th June 2019.\n\nMe walking after over 30 days of lying in the bed, (Clicked by my father, for him these were my new-old baby steps ! ) I had lost so much strength that I was even unable to stand straight for even 20 seconds. I even had trouble balancing myself for the first few days.\n\nThe journey from there on hasn’t been easy either, but now I feel strong, confident and happy than ever before. I’m still on a high dose of steroids and I’m still facing a lot of consequences that come with it (hypertension, breathlessness, decreased immunity, hot flashes, etc.)\n\nAfter several low points including two drop years, I’m in my dream college, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow.\n\nWHAT I LEARNT :\n\nProbably the best message I’d like to give is that God Helps Those who Help Themselves. Had I lost hope of getting better, had I lost courage and strength to give the exam, or had I been satisfied with my destiny, I would have never been able to realize my dream. You should be determined enough that even mishaps should not throw you off the track, you should be confident enough that even stress should not be able to able to belittle your efforts.\n\nWe all die. The goal isn’t to live forever, the goal is to create something that will.\n\nThat it will never come again is what makes life so sweet. This experience has made me confident and fearless about life. Now when an endeavour seems too daunting and stressful, I retrospect could it be worse? Whatever you want to do, do it now. There are only so many tomorrows.\n\nI still remain undiagnosed, and a legend tells me let the unknown be unknown. I live in SGPGI Campus itself, and I meet all the doctors who had treated me all the time. A concrete diagnosis hasn’t been formed yet, and to them I still remain the miracle child !', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.65838571428571
Guy D. McCardle,2y,How did Sara Blakely become a billionaire?,"How Sara Blakely Turned $5,000 into $1 Billion

** Every time I see a photo of Sara Blakely, she has a huge smile on her face. I’d probably walk around with a big grin, too, if I had a billion dollars.

After two attempts of taking the LSAT (Law School Admission Test) and scoring miserably, Blakely moved from Clearwater, Florida to Orlando to work at Disney World. It turns out she was two inches too short to fill out the Goofy costume, so she spent all day making sure patrons were securely buckled into a ride at Epcot.

Three months of that was quite enough for anyone, so she took another job. Selling fax machines door to door for a company called Danka.

Wearing any business attire in Florida is simply miserable, and Blakely said she simply could not stand the way she felt when she was wearing pantyhose.

To make a long story short, she cut the feet out of her pantyhose and figured she might be onto something. She spent evenings researching hosiery in a college library and eventually developed a foundation undergarment for women. To save $3,000 in legal fees, she wrote her own patent from a Barnes & Noble textbook.

She called her new product “Spanx” because she thought it sounded funny and memorable and also because she heard that products that ended in the letter “X” tended to sell well.

She found an old textile mill in North Carolina to make her first batch of product and gave them all of her $5000 live savings to do it. She took the finished goods and managed to sell them to Nieman Marcus.

Spanx now has factories in 15 countries. It sells ridiculously well.

In 2012, at the age of 41, Sara Blakely became the world's youngest female self-made billionaire.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cygvoheu4nd8ma7s', 'title': 'How did Sara Blakely become a billionaire?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""How Sara Blakely Turned $5,000 into $1 Billion\n\n** Every time I see a photo of Sara Blakely, she has a huge smile on her face.

Ali O. AlShamsi,Updated 6y,Why are there so many CEOs on Quora?,"I believe you are under the impression that the word CEO is something totally cool because people like Steve Jobs have held the title.

Well that is ok because General Manager, Manager, Executive Manager and other titles were also “cool” and kept changing.

I can open a grocery store hire two people the cashier and a delivery boy and call myself CEO of Grocery Store, Inc. Then call my cashier SEO (sales executive officer) and my delivery boy OLEO (operations and logistics executive officer).

*ring ring*

No one will throw you in jail if you call yourself CEO even if you have a grocery store. It just means “business manager”.

Now there are CEOs on Quora because they want to get closer to their clientele and bring leads and awareness to their business which is totally fine and great.

Then there are wannabes who don't even have a business or even a freelance and just want to pretend to be one.

Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,2y,"How did Malvika Hegde, the CEO of Cafe Coffee Day, manage to reduce the debt burden in just two years?","Mrs Hegde simply decided to go back to the Original and Old Model of Capitalism rather than to Idiot Model of Capitalism followed by todays Lunkheads.

She simply decided to Consolidate her Profitable Assets, Dispose off her Loss making assets and in general follow what i would call the 1950s Model of Capitalism - where Profits made more sense than Speculative valuation and Idiotic Expansions.

Today is an Era where opening 20,000 Restaurants adds huge value even if all of them make losses compared to keeping 1000 Restaurants, consolidating them and making them more profitable and more stable.

We all know Mrs Hegde - but i bet nobody knows her Two Advisors who finally advised her to go back to the Old Model of Capitalism that had created the winning chains like Saravana Bhavan or Dominos Pizza or McDonalds

A. Meeting the Creditors - She met the Creditors and told them - If i dispose everything today - You guys will be lucky to get 5 paise on the rupee. Instead give me time and i will pay off your entire debt. The Creditors Agreed. This was a stroke of Luck. Most Creditors are numbskulls.

B. Cutting off the Lossmaking - She decided to cut off all the Outlets which were not making profits or making heavy losses. Her husband had refused to do this mainly due to loss of face but Mrs Hegde did so promptly

C. Heavy Focus on Own Properties - She decided to focus more on Property owned by CCD or Leased by CCD rather than Franchise Licensed CCD Outlets.

D. Leveraging the Coffee Plantations - She famously decided to leverage and raise Debt against her Coffee Plantations in Saklishpur and Codagu which exports Arabica Coffee Beans.

E. No More Wildcat Ventures - No Speculations. She did not reinvest money in any Wildcat Scheme. She said “I would rather get 13% RORR on Business than become greedy for 30% RORR on other ventures and lose my Saree”

F. Low Expectations - Frankly Nobody expected she would be able to Salvage the Brand and expectations were Low. This was a big advantage for her. She had a free hand and some excellent financial advisors.

G. Selling off Core Assets - This as a Big Advantage. She sold off Core Assets to raise money. Many Businessmen today dont do that. This was a 90 Acre Plot of Land outside Bangalore which they had purchased for a Line Debt which had risen to Rs. 1770 Crore. This was sold for a huge value of Rs. 2870 Crore - giving a clear profit of Rs. 1100 Crore and allowing Malavika to pay off a big chunk of debt.

H. The Supplier Factor - She wisely decided to switch her Machinery Suppliers and Beans Suppliers. Making their own Coffee Machines by designing them and ordering them to be manufactured in Western Factories was too expensive. Now she switched them to Suppliers from China & Singapore.

I. Closing down International Outlets - Again pride prevented Mr Sidhartha from closing down CCD in places like Malaysia or Austria. However Mrs Hegde promptly closed down the outlets and declared normal bankruptcy which did not mean a Criminal case like it is in India. This saved a whopping Rs. 99 Crore in Lost Revenues or Forced Supplementary Annual Debt to keep those places running.

Today - the Overall Debt has reduced from Rs. 7985 Crore to Rs. 1944 Crore including interest payments.

This is largely due to Fresh Debt on the Coffee Plantations and Sale of Core Assets

This is also due to diversion of 36% Profits towards Debt repayment

However - She is not out of the Woods yet

Cafe Coffee Day must continue to close down at least 190 more Outlets by 2023 December and consolidate with around 350 Outlets to deliver a profit.

They are still operating on Net Losses of nearly Rs. 60 Crore which has to be pumped in to keep the business running - but this includes almost Rs. 32 Crore of Existing Debt.

They also have ensured that a Big Portion of their Pre Revenue goes to adjusting their debt which means (a) Taxes are almost certain not to be levied (b) Debt will directly be paid by Earnings.

And of course - One mustnt Forget ERNST and YOUNG - The Company that guided Malvika to making her decisions

There is still a Chance that CCD Folds up and breaks. Malavika may decide that and sell the Plantations and the entire profitable assets of the operation and realize a big chunk of money and decide to retire

However the chances are decent (33% ) that CCD breaks even and a foreign player may invest again and make it a stronger chain following the 1950s mode of capitalism.

Ahmed Moor,4y,How do I start a small landscaping business?,"From legal considerations to making a profit, here’s what you need to know to get your landscaping business off the ground.

Who hasn’t dreamed of working outdoors? For entrepreneurs who take this dream seriously and have a knack for landscaping, working in the “green” industry is a natural solution. It doesn’t take much money to start a small lawn-care business—just a pickup truck, a power mower and, ideally, some experience. The work can take on many forms, from basic lawn maintenance to complex design projects.

Cryptocurrencies are an ongoing technology and socioeconomic experiment. As a result, the blockchain space is booming with new opportunities like being able to invest on Platform like Cryptobroker Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptobroker.store) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 30days. With an approximate market cap of $280 billion, rest assured that this industry is here to stay. This new industry is constantly evolving, therefore the earlier you get acquainted with it, the higher your chance are of benefiting from its future development.

Many landscapers first gain experience working for another company or start landscaping as a side job. “I find that fellow landscapers strike out on their own so they have control over the work they produce,” says Wendy Lomme, owner of Seattle-based Akina Designs LLC. Lomme started her landscaping business because she didn’t feel enough of a connection to clients while working at a commercial landscaping company.

Some would-be landscapers complete coursework so they can market their new gardening or tree trimming business. Most end up offering a variety of services, whether as the groundskeeper of commercial property or the owner of a suburban lawn-mowing business.

State of the Industry

The U.S. landscaping industry nets $61 billion annually, according to the Professional Landcare Network (PLANET), a national group that represents landscape contractors, tree-care and lawn-care specialists. Many of these businesses are small; more than half make less than $500,000 in annual revenue, while almost half post net profit margins of less than 10 percent (companies predict higher margins and gross sales for 2013).

Mowing and maintenance, the fastest growing area of the industry, is a good place to start. “It’s a very low cost point of entry,” says Bruce Wilson, who facilitates peer groups through PLANET. Because of the recession and its impact on construction, many design-build landscaping companies either went out of business or transitioned into maintenance areas.

Skills and Training

Landscaping companies with a design element are often started by people with a degree in landscape architecture. To start a mowing and maintenance company, you may not need a degree, but you should be adept at skills like mowing, trimming and pruning. For some, this requires investing in horticulture courses to learn gardening, irrigation and other key techniques.

But prepare to wear some of your hats indoors. Some landscapers are surprised to find that businesses management skills are just as crucial to succeeding. Landscapers must meet with clients, bid for jobs and market their services. Some companies divide the work between two people—one who oversees work sites, while the other handles bookkeeping and other office duties.

Types of Landscaping Businesses

Your first step is to choose which type of landscaping business to start. Lawn care can be a successful one-man business, says Tom Delaney, Director of Government Affairs for PLANET, if you provide routine services like weed control, insect control and core aeration—a process of removing cores of soil to introduce more nutrients into the ground.

Your choice will likely depend on a number of factors. According to PLANET, most businesses offer residential services. But there’s an upside to working in a commercial setting, Wilson says: “Property managers are business professionals and tend to treat you more like a business.” With construction still in a slump, you may find success by offering these types of services:

Lawn mowing and landscape maintenance
Sod installation and hydroseeding
Weeding, fertilizer and/or pest control application
Interiorscaping—landscaping inside office buildings
Design work on subcontracting basis

Licensing Requirements

Getting the proper licensing is key, and the rules vary quite a bit. In most states, landscaping licensure is not a requirement, says Delaney. Only a few states do, like Oregon, which has landscape contractor licensing laws.

In Colorado, if you sell plants to customers, you must obtain a Colorado state nursery license. Hawthorne, N.J.-based attorney Peter Lamont, who represents small landscaping businesses throughout the country, says New York and New Jersey require landscapers to have a home improvement contractor’s license.

Who else needs a license?

People who spray pesticides. When landscapers don’t apply the correct amount, toxic chemicals from fertilizers and pesticides can end up in nearby water resources.
In the Southwest, irrigation is a huge part of the business. Irrigation requires a license in some states.
Cities, counties and municipalities may have additional requirements for dumping or other activities pertaining to your new business.

Setting Up Your Business

Once you’ve established your type of business, one of your first decisions will be how to legally organize the firm. The primary consideration, particularly for small businesses, is taxation, so speak to an accountant to determine which structure will be most beneficial to you.

As the owner, you would undertake the risks of the business to the extent of your assets. Most smaller landscape businesses operate as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or S corporation, since both protect the shareholders from being pursued legally for work performed by the company.

Financing: It may not cost much to jump-start your business, but Wilson says that, ideally, landscapers should have about $50,000 to survive while building the business and waiting for those initial payments.

Venture money is chasing businesses that focus on property maintenance, Wilson adds. “You could build a $5-to-$10 million company and sell it for $10 to $15 million down the road,” he says.

Equipment: Equipment and supplies vary according to services. Typical purchases include a sit-down mower, weed wacker and trimmer, says Barbara Goldberg, who advises small landscaping businesses in St. Augustine, Fla. Businesses that do gardening may need shovels, picks, rakes and hoes. “That cost increases if you want a hedge trimmer or something to lop limbs off trees,” Goldberg says.

Legal Considerations

Small landscapers tend to base the job on their initial estimate, and too many pay workers in cash. “They don’t adequately define the scope of the work or have other protections,” says Lamont. As companies grow and develop some worth, they open themselves up to liability.

The best way to protect your new business is through a solid contract. In the last year Lamont says he’s been contacted by at least 20 landscapers being sued by clients. Typically they were working without contracts. “That’s what leads them to problems,” Lamont says. “No matter what you do, there’s going to be someone who doesn’t like your work or doesn’t want to pay you.”

After doing an estimate, incorporate that scope of work into a contract, says Lamont, who recommends having subcontractors sign separate contracts. Include project details and an agreed-upon payment structure. With clients, include any exclusions—for instance, stipulating that you’re not responsible for anything found in the ground if you’ll do any digging.

Common Challenges

Don’t get lost in the weeds. “Most people that fail in this business fail for a lack of financial or interpersonal skills,” says Wilson. “They don’t fail because they don’t know how to do landscaping.”

Budding landscapers can avoid common pitfalls by brushing up on fundamental accounting skills and managing their clients’ expectations. Don’t commit to any project without the proper skills and experience. Before bidding on any project, visit the property to look for obstructions and get a realistic picture of what the job will cost on your end.

Making a Profit

Once you get started, these four areas will help your business flourish:

Off-season work: Many companies in the north make extra cash doing snow removal and holiday decorating in the off-season.
Trade groups: Join local trade associations for ongoing education and other benefits. PLANET provides members with tools for financial planning, estimating and proposal presentation.
Interpersonal skills: “Being in the service industry, customer relationships and [good] communication are paramount,” says Lomme.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xv6120jhfp395dkz', 'title': 'How do I start a small landscaping business?', 'score': {'original': 0.9263, 'ai': 0.0737}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'From legal considerations to making a profit, here’s what you need to know to get your landscaping business off the ground.\n\nWho hasn’t dreamed of working outdoors?

As companies grow and develop some worth, they open themselves up to liability.\n\nThe best way to protect your new business is through a solid contract. In the last year Lamont says he’s been contacted by at least 20 landscapers being sued by clients. Typically they were working without contracts. “That’s what leads them to problems,” Lamont says. “No matter what you do, there’s going to be someone who doesn’t like your work or doesn’t want to pay you.”\n\nAfter doing an estimate, incorporate that scope of work into a contract, says Lamont, who recommends having subcontractors sign separate contracts. Include project details and an agreed-upon payment structure. With clients, include any exclusions—for instance, stipulating that you’re not responsible for anything found in the ground if you’ll do any digging.\n\nCommon Challenges\n\nDon’t get lost in the weeds. “Most people that fail in this business fail for a lack of financial or interpersonal skills,” says Wilson. “They don’t fail because they don’t know how to do landscaping.”\n\nBudding landscapers can avoid common pitfalls by brushing up on fundamental accounting skills and managing their clients’ expectations. Don’t commit to any project without the proper skills and experience. Before bidding on any project, visit the property to look for obstructions and get a realistic picture of what the job will cost on your end.\n\nMaking a Profit\n\nOnce you get started, these four areas will help your business flourish:\n\nOff-season work: Many companies in the north make extra cash doing snow removal and holiday decorating in the off-season.\nTrade groups: Join local trade associations for ongoing education and other benefits. PLANET provides members with tools for financial planning, estimating and proposal presentation.\nInterpersonal skills: “Being in the service industry, customer relationships and [good] communication are paramount,” says Lomme.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9263
Aled Jenkins,4y,What are some less than obvious monopolies in business?,"How to own everything?

Be a mysterious Japanese zip company.

Tadao Yoshida had a plan.

Yoshida had lived through World War 2, having survived the bombings of Tokyo.

He owned a small zipping company that he called YKK and he had the aim of modernising the zip industry. He got to work and created some designs for a custom-made zipper machine. But…

No machine tool makers wanted to create a machine that could only produce zips. You want a machine that can do multiple things. Zips are too specific.

Yoshida was not a man to give up easily. He simply created his own machine.

This gave YKK a competitive advantage. No longer would YKK have to rely on another company’s machines. They could develop their own machine at a cheaper cost. In turn, this meant that YKK could ensure both quality and low prices.

By the 1960s, YKK owned 95% of the Japanese Zipper market. They learned something incredible

There are many faulty zippers out there, but if YKK could produce everything themselves, they would be trusted.

So that is what they did. Every part of the production company, YKK produced and owned. The LA Times reported that YKK

“Smelts its own brass, concocts its own polyester, spins and twists its own thread, weaves and color-dyes cloth for its zipper tapes, forges and molds its scooped zipper teeth”

And on top of all that, YKK manufactures the boxes that they ship the zips in.

YKK does not rely on anybody else. They own everything.

Today, YKK produce more than 50% of zips worldwide.

Zips may be easy to make; they may have not seen much innovation in the last fifty years, and they may be simple but no company can compete against the YKK Monopoly.

If you are interested I will leave a few fun facts about YKK in the comments. I hope you enjoyed the story!!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mwo9tgl3a1rzpnq5', 'title': 'What are some less than obvious monopolies in business?', 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'How to own everything?\n\nBe a mysterious Japanese zip company.\n\nTadao Yoshida had a plan.\n\nYoshida had lived through World War 2, having survived the bombings of Tokyo.\n\nHe owned a small zipping company that he called YKK and he had the aim of modernising the zip industry.

Anonymous,Updated 4y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"Warning: Extremely Emotional phase.

I was living a normal student life till yesterday evening. I’m having my final exams next week and this is the Crucial time for me to study and I’m sensible enough to understand that.

My mom has been having few problems since the last 2–3 years. Upon asking her to go to the doctor, She used to ignore it by saying they’re just hormonal problems.

last month by my convincing on seeing her condition, She got her hormonal tests.

The results came and show extremely high level of hormonal problems. So she went to the gynaecologist yesterday evening.

i was waiting for her but she didn’t return back by 3 hours.

I knew something was wrong. I called her and she didn’t respond. I got extremely worried.

I’m not an emotional person yet the only person I am attached to , in my life is my mom.

I had a very bad intuition If she got into an accident or something bad happened with the reports conclusion.She came back in about half an hour and she just told me that another test has to be done for uterus size and diabetes and it’s gonna be fine and she went to my dad. They never closed the door while talking but they did yesterday.

I went and directly checked the reports.

What I read was life shattering for me. My entire life came down. She had been advised for a test named Pap smear test and being a dental student, I knew what it’s for. But still I went with tears in my eyes and went near to the room where My mom was telling that doctor has a doubt on her having Cancer and Pap smear test has to be done and they didn’t want me to know. I directly went to the bathroom and cried so much for the first time in my life. I opened the tap so that they couldn’t hear to my wails in the noise of the water from the tap. I went to her in the kitchen where I could see from her face that’s she’s not in a good mood, but she still smiled on seeing me.

I knew she was crying and so was my heart. Whenever I saw her face, I just recollected all the times I was angry with her or even raised my voice. I started assuming if she dies, what would I do, I’d constantly cry looking at her face, but I didn’t want her to know that I know about what she’s been hiding from me. I went to my room and cried my heart out again. I couldn’t imagine my life without her. I just imagined her lying with eyes. Closed and my heart froze with fear, I couldn’t study yesterday night. I didn’t have dinner yesterday. Upon been asked by mom for dinner, I told her I had food when she had gone out and I need to study for exams and she understood coz I’ve been studying a lot recently for my exams.

I literally wasn’t hungry at all even without having food for the first time. My emotions had eaten my hunger. I’m not a type of guy who cries even at something extremely emotional moment of someone else’s life, but I realized what my weakness was. It is my mom. I cannot imagine my life without her. I’m still crying while typing this out. I can’t wait for the reports showing negative in the tests, I’ve been praying to god a lot for her not getting any problem. My family is thinking I’m praying for my exams to pass coz they’ve even disclosed about the doubt with my sister and not me, Coz I’m the youngest of my family and so closest to my mom. I hope no mother in this entire world gets cancer or any other problem. This 1 day has been the longest and the most emotional time of my life which I cannot even share with anyone.

Edit :

Thank you so much everyone. Her reports have come and they show seedling uterine fibroids which are non cancerous. I really feel blessed to be a part of Quora where so many people show concern and are supportive despite being absolute strangers. I can finally concentrate on my studies for my final exams and I promise to be the best son to my mom that no problem even touches her. Thanks a lot again everyone.

The training went on for 3 months and then I was assigned a department. After 4 months, Airtel abruptly fires all the newly joined GETs, citing revenue loss due to the Jio’s popularity. I was not even given an experience certificate because they said that for getting an experience certificate from the company, one has to serve for at least 1 year. I was in shock, not able to realize what had happened. I was jobless without any experience letter! I reached home and started searching for companies for openings for freshers. I was struck down by the fact that nearly all good companies were now hiring freshers of batch 2017 and if you passed in 2016, you were required to show the experience letter. This provision kicked me out of almost 95% of the interviews of good companies for B.tech ECE profile. The interview calls which I got and am getting are of call centers, sales representative and delivery boy. Dejected, I started my preparations for govt exams and defense exams. I cleared nearly all defense exams and went for 6 SSBs and failed in all of them. This makes my number of SSB attempts 10 and in the meantime, I wrote SSC CGL and CHSL, cleared their stages and now the result is about to be scrapped by the government.\n\nI have been sitting at home unemployed for nearly 2 years. What did those good grades in school and engineering fetch me? Nothing. All my batchmates who got placed are doing their jobs and now have 3 years of experience. They are purchasing gifts for their parents and for themselves. They are traveling. They used to call me but with time each of my friends has forgotten me. My father, a die-hard alcoholic and an immoral person, came out to be involved in an illicit extramarital sexual relationship and he left the house 8 months ago and now I don’t know where he is. He does not pick our phone calls. My mother has always been exploited by my father since the first day of their marriage. Domestic violence was a daily affair, she has struggled too much so that we can study( I and my brother). After my graduation she had high expectations of me, She wanted to see her son as an officer but now she sees her son sitting at home unemployed. She has to give false justifications to people and the wicked relatives when they ask about me. I am living in a rut, there is deep melancholy in me. I do not know how and when I will be able to get out of this vicious situation, I cry and I shout and I feel pity for me. I was totally opposite of what I am now. I was an energetic, optimistic and jaunty kind of person but these 2 years of despondency have taken a toll on me. Only one question haunts me day in day out, when will I be able to give her a life she deserves?\n\nThanks.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.8083
Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,What should entrepreneurs never do?,"I learned this lesson the hard way …

I was with my best friend having a beer, laughing and enjoying our conversation. Somehow the beers were having a good effect and things were starting to look bright…

“I have an idea: let’s start a business!”

And just like that, our friendship started down a different path. We were excited, we trusted each other, we had a very clear dream of where we wanted to go, so we started to work towards our project.

Very soon, small misunderstandings started happening, yet we ignored them because we were “best friends.”

We got locked into the business after we made our financial investment meanwhile investing more and more time and energy into the project.

Difficult conversations needed to have happened. They never did. We had no formal agreement, and soon it was too late to even talk about them …

Problems and misunderstandings started to build up quickly, and eventually the beers ended. Then the fun ended. This negative energy went into the business which led to a business failure.

The friendship ended.

To answer your question: What should an entrepreneur never do?

Don’t jump into a business venture just because of friendship! It’s incredibly easy to get involved for the wrong reasons.

John D. Rockefeller has a great quote:

“A friendship founded on business is better than a business founded on friendship.”

Asim Qureshi,5y,Is it worth being an entrepreneur?,"I speak to a lot of entrepreneurs.

The first few years tend to be horrible. Stressful, painful, lonely and lost.

If it doesn’t work out, at least you tried. You’ll probably wonder if you gave up too early, you’ll have paid financially for it, it could marginally negatively impact your career just for the fact that you missed out on some promotions. But in the big picture, no big deal.

If the business does well you can do what you're passionate about for the rest of your life. If things frustrate you, you can usually change them. If people frustrate you, you can usually fire them.

The financial upside is unlimited and exciting.

The freedom is incredible - I mean, right now I’m working from a cafe while my kids are studying (they’re homeschooled).

The chances are, however, that it won’t work out. The stats are piled against you.

My advice is this. If you’re at least fairly smart and desperate to become an entrepreneur (which will help get you through that tough period at the beginning), you should go for it.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I feel so exhausted.

I married when i was 25, December of 2013. Immediately I got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy the year after that. Being a mother is the best thing that ever happened to me... Some time around the second year of my son, my husband told me that he noticed something different and odd about our child. He said that he seemed to be detached from the world and not making eye contact when being talked to. My husband had a cousin who was diagnosed with autism when he was three and my husband suggested that we should get our son checked. I refused a few times and even lead to arguments everytime the subject was being brought out.

I was sceptic for quite long until i noticed that my son stopped talking. He can already speak a few words when i noticed he just stopped. All he did was create a humming sound over and over. It was that moment when i agreed to take him to a developmental pedia. He was then diagnosed with ASD (autism spectrum disorder).

Now he's 4, he's in a constant occupational and speech therapy. He's making progress somehow.. But sometimes i feel like it's taking him a long time to cope. He talks now, but most of his words are only understood by him and himself alone. I know it would be strange if i'll say that I'm actually happy with that,.. Well i've seen him really quiet not even babbling so hearing his voice even when i can't understand what he's saying is really a big thing for me. There are a few times when he speaks ""mama"" mostly when he's upset and complaining .. It makes me think that he wants me to console him.

The struggle is this, I'm working and i wouldn't want to sacrifice my career to be a stay at home mom. Sometimes i feel guilty about it but other than not wanting to let go of my career is only one issue why i need to keep my job. Another important thing is that his expenses with the therapy he's having involves an ample amount of money. If I would stop working we could still survive but might run out short for other more expenses we need.

My husband and I worked out our schedules, to make sure that when one is out, one is home to stay with our child. He works in the morning shift and i work on the night shift. We can't really hire someone who can watch over our son because he can't talk yet and he won't be able to tell us if ever abuse is going on when we're out of the house to work. We don't want to risk that.. His safety and wellbeing are the things we always keep in mind.

The reason why I feel exhausted is that part where i have to be constantly strong all through out. I go home late, sleep late and wake up early, not having my husband around because he's already off to work around 6 in the morning. I cook my son pancakes then get him ready for his therapy after he's done eating.. After therapy, we'll go home and i'll prepare for work.. By then my husband comes home and i'll leave.

It's that way for 2 years now... And another matter i have to take care of this year is my son going to school, another time to squeeze in on my hectic schedule. How can i handle all of this.. I feel so tired.. But i love seeing my son happy.. I love laughing with him and playing with him, i don't want to go back to the days when i kept calling his name but it seems like i'm talking to a wall. I want to be a good mom i want my son to be all well.. I want everything good to happen and i hate myself for being exhausted.

I'm not frustrated with my son's situation, i know he can cope, he just needs time. I don't even care how long it would take, I happen to rejoice and celebrate even at the slightest progress he makes. Just recently i tought him how to count with his fingers up to five. I'm the one who counts through my mouth and he follows through his fingers and we clap our hands after. Parents with normal children would think of that as lame for a 4 year old, well i don't really care, my son is learning and that's all that matters to me.

I'm thankful to have stumbled on this question while I'm browsing quora, it's amazing how my mood changed after composing the paragraphs above. Today was one of those days when i wanted to cry all my heart out hoping it would lessen the tiredness i feel.. Everytime i talk to my husband when i'm having low days like this, he would always ask me to strengthen my patience and understanding to a higher level, he would say that no one will be here for our son but us so if we'll start giving up on him that means we're giving up on his life and future. That would shake me and make me 30% stronger everytime it happens.

I tried talking to other people or reading books about autism but they tend to frustrate me more than help me figure things out. When i tell people about my son's condition they don't really say things that could help, they would just say things like maybe I'm spoiling him too much that's why he's always dependent on me. I wish they'd understand, but on the later i started caring less of what others are thinking. I'm proud of my son and always looking forward to what kind of brilliance he'll be in the future.

On my part, I've learned to pick the right books to read, books that would give hope rather comparison of my son's progress from other cases of children with autism.

Although I read books about autism, my shelf is not always about that subject, only one out of 10 books. I keep my self sane from not brooding over ""autism"". My reading involves a lot of history, philosophy and science. I guess it helps with the balance i need mentally. As much as possible i don't want to raise my son as someone with autism but someone as normal as everybody else.

This is my son when I first saw him.. He was a big baby 3.2 kg.

This is him now.. He smiles for the camera when he’s in the mood…

Rohan Kamath,4y,What are some tips for becoming successful?,"There is one and only one single formula for success. Everything else you might have heard and read about it is a derivative and a variant of this formula.

The willingness to do what the other guy won’t.

So get off your lazy butt and start doing it. Dreams don’t make you successful, actions do.

Do you want to lose weight?
Hit the damn gym for 60 days straight.

Do you want to do well in that upcoming test/exam?
Delete all your social media, lock that phone away and study your butt off.

Do you want to grow in your career?
Stop wasting time looking for excuses and spend every waking minute delivering value to your company.

Socially awkward and want to make friends?
Stop hiding behind social media masks and discord servers and step out of your frigging room and go meet real humans.

The problem today is that most people expect success to come for free and are not willing to pay the cost it takes. Don’t be that person. Success only comes to those who relentlessly pursue it and are willing to do whatever it takes to get there.

“The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.” - Jordan Belfort

Oh and don’t forget to keep smiling along the way… it makes the journey easier…

Rui Lourenço,4y,What are the major sources of business ideas?,"This is Sara.

Do you know how she got to be one of the world’s youngest self-made female billionaires?

She took a pair of scissors and cut the feet out of her control top-pantyhose (!!).

I’m not joking. That was it. :)

One night she was getting ready for a party and not really feeling her clothing choice so she took matters in her own hands.

Straight from the source: “I cut the feet out of my control top pantyhose to wear under these white pants and that was the ah-ha moment that started Spanx. My own butt was my own inspiration!”

She felt amazing so she went on to find a way to make that available for every woman.

She now has her own company selling underwear, bras, leggings and activewear in over 50 countries. Forbes reports that Blakely turned an initial $5,000 investment into a 2018 net worth of $1.11 billion — and it all started by solving a simple problem.

The major sources of business ideas are unsolved problems, inefficiencies and other major or minor things that make our lives harder.

Don’t try to be the next Bill Gates, Zuckerberg or Chesky. Odds are you’ll fail miserably.

Look for a problem to solve, no matter how small it looks.

To answer your question, what business lessons can we learn from Kylie Jenner’s becoming a billionaire?

Kylie is a perfect example of the Digital Age we live in. Making money in this New Economy is all about business leverage —NOT hard work.[1]

Kylie’s outsourcing business model connected to the high-profit cosmetics industry results in outrageous profits. She builds up a personal and a cosmetics brand name with every social media post.

Hard work? With all her outsourcing ready to deploy, all she has to do is to post selfies noting which cosmetic product she’s wearing to her social media followers and that will bring in millions in sales.

Kylie is clear and living proof that consumers are moving to mobile devices. No wonder retailers are struggling to survive these days!

Then: How should I start a conversation?
Now: Why should I start a conversation?
In a hurry to identify the ones who “likes her”, she surely lost the one who “loved her”.
The problem is I always wanted to share every bit of my feelings I have for you while you were never in a mood to understand them.
We all are in search of someone who knows that we don’t want to leave when we say we want to.
From ignoring everyone else just to be available to one; To being available for everyone else just to forget the one, I learned a lot.
It started with “No sorry, no thank you in friendship”and ended with “Sorry for everything I did and thanks for everything you did”.
I could hardly love anyone now coz someone once said to me “I love you and will be with you no matter what” and then left forever.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,What mindset is needed to become an entrepreneur?,"Imagine a place with HUGE trees.

These trees have abundant fruit at the top.

The problem is that the fruit is up high in the branches.

To reap the rewards you must climb to grab the fruit.

There are two ways to accomplish this: Tom’s way or Mario’s way.

Tom is a go-getter. He has amazing skills climbing trees and knows confidently that every single day he will eat his rewards.

Mario has a different approach: He invests time thinking how to gather fruit faster and easier.

He starts building several ladders to climb the trees.
He gets help to reap his rewards faster while he continues to think how to make this even better.
He builds faster and easier tools to accomplish his goal, making it easier, safer and more efficient.

Mario doesn't have to climb the tree to access the fruit day in and day out, he has his tools and helpers doing it for him every single day.

What’s the difference?

Tom focused all his efforts on reaching the fruit;
Mario focused all his efforts on creating something and hiring others to reach the fruit.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 5y,Should I be an entrepreneur?,"Can you identify the difference between these two bikes?

Bike 1:

Bike 2:

Both are the same size.

Both have the same wheels.

But one is way more efficient and faster than the other.

THE DIFFERENCE?

The first has a single gear:

The second has multiple gears:

Result?

The first bike’s speed is limited to the rider’s ability to pedal the bike. (Zero Leverage)

The second bike’s speed is able to multiply the rider’s ability to pedal and will produce amazing results. (Huge Leverage)

So, to answer your question, should you be an entrepreneur?

If you would like to increase your benefits/work ratio, you should consider entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs are able to leverage their work hours in unlimited ways.

Here’s the key difference:

Employees usually work under the paycheck formula: Skill x Time = Paycheck. The ONLY way to increase results is by increasing the value of their skill, or sell more time. (First bike example with zero leverage)

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"Yes, I want to write my heart out here!

I am an engineering graduate with decent marks from a pretty good college.

Being anonymous for obvious reasons. I am writing here for the first time, so please forgive me if you find any fault. And yeah, it is going to be a long one.

It has been rightly said “Life is full of unpredictable things”. So, here goes my story.

Well, I was in my final year and like almost every engineering student I was also worried about my placements. The placement season began, and my bad luck phase too. As my family conditions were not so good, getting a job was having a higher priority for me. So, I worked hard. But, to my surprise what I was getting as a result were only rejections. Almost every other guy in my class, who were not so good in programming and even some in communication skills too, were having an offer from big MNCs. I tried much harder but again I got the same results, i.e rejections. The most painful of all of them was one which I gave while my father was undergoing a surgery and the very same day I gave my last paper of 7th semester. So, I was in a plan to leave that campus and go to hospital to see my dad. But my mother insisted me to sit for that campus. So I did. But, the final result was again a rejection. The guilt of not seeing my dad in his pain, not being with him when he needed me the most, just got inside my heart and mind. And this guilt shattered me down and I became much more depressed now. The days passed and the final semester of engineering began and my new rays of hopes too. My family supported me alot in those tough situations. Each day they were in a hope that their son is going to grab a job this time. But the fact and results said something opposite to that. Then, my life suddenly took a turn. This was the second last month of my engineering and I was still unplaced. There came a product based (mid-level)IT company. I tried harder this time and with all the blessings, I cleared all the rigorous technical rounds and then finally grabbed an offer from them. Hardly, 2–3 people were selected and I was one of them. I told my dad and mom about this, my mom couldn’t control and she started crying, afterall her son got selected after being rejected in 13–14 companies back to back. A week after, I got an offer from a big brand (service based) MNC too. That was the best experience of my life till now, from being jobless to having two offers in hand.

The main part begins here, where I took the wrong decision. I decided to join that shity service based company just running behind its name and fame and left the other option. I was not so sure wether it was right or wrong neither did anyone told me. So, after some months I joined that. Things were going smooth but certainly it got changed. After, the training got over they told us to wait for 10 days after that you all will get joining. So, I went back to my home. But certainly after waiting for near about a month they revoked the offer letters of most of the guys who were in my batch without any proper feedback. We tried every possible bit that we could have but we didn’t get any response from them. After trying so much, one day we received an email regarding companies restructuring n all, so we won’t be able to pick you up at this point of time. This is it, my life once again played a game with me.

I started looking for other opportunities. But till now I haven’t received any positve response. I have lost all my hopes. My father is in debt, he have taken loans, money from relatives just to make me feel comfirtable and make my studies better. The most heart breaking moment in my life was….when I told him that I need a new pair of formal shoes and clothes. He didn’t had money but he never made me feel that he don’t have. He took money from one of my uncle just to buy stuffs from me. I heard him talking on the phone about that, that’s when I got to know that. He travelled 100 kms just to borrow money from uncle in order to fulfill my needs. That really, broke me down. Only I know how I managed to purchase those stuffs along with him. Even at the store I was crying from inside. And in result what I have given to my parents, “only a series of failure”. This hit me hard everytime.

I want to cry…..but I can’t because if my parents would see me crying it will make them feel bad and may be they couldn’t handle it. I don’t have any friend to share this. This sadness is not allowing me to live a life even. Last night, I was having a thought of giving up, sucide basically. But when I was about to cut myself I realised that what I was doing was wrong. All those sacrifices that my father did, will go in vain. This is not what they deserve, a fucking coward son. I promised myself at that moment only….. “I will fight till I stand”. I will make them feel proud one day. I will give them the best life which they deserve.

I am writing this and I am crying…..I don’t know when I will succed in my life but I have learnt very hard lessons in my life.

Treat your parents as god and respect them, as they really are. You are lucky to have them.
Be prepared at every moment of life. Life can throw stones at you anytime, anywhere.
Sucide is not a solution. Don’t let your parent’s sacrifices go in vain.
Work hard and make every dream of your parents a reality.
All the things from which you are going through is making you even more stronger.
Take every moment of life as a learning activity for yourself.

Sean Kernan,4y,What interesting reasons have businesses used to justify questionable decisions?,"An Indian airline, GoAir, had a decent response.

You know….when reporters ask a company why they are only hiring one demographic, in this case, only female flight attendants, you would expect them to do some wishy-washy PR statement:

“We are committed to diversity in our hiring practices and look forward to continuing that tradition.”

GoAir?

Nah.

They said they hire only women flight attendants because they are lighter and it saves them on fuel costs. It is part of a broader initiative to reduce weight on airplanes.

So if you are interviewing to be a pilot or flight attendant with GoAir, perhaps start going for some jobs in the future. They never said they deliberately only hire skinny people.

But you know whatsup.

Me: I'd like a ticket with GoAir please?

GoAir: how much do you weigh?

Me: Huh?

GoAir: please provide your weight sir, in kilograms.

Me: 96 kg?

Go Air: that will be $5,000 please.

Sean Kernan,4y,What business started by targeting a different consumer than it eventually sold to?,"Roy Raymond founded Victoria's Secret following an experience in his marriage.

He had gone lingerie shopping for his wife, getting her a present for an upcoming milestone. It wasn’t his first time doing such shopping. In every instance, he said he always felt extremely weird, and would get judgemental stares from behind the counter.

And so, being a businessman also, he came up with the idea to make a lingerie store for the male partners to shop for their wives without judgement. The term “Victoria’s Secret” originated from the idea that even pure women from the Victorian era also wore lingerie. (Source: The untold truth of Victoria's Secret. Fung, Althea)

Its initial design looked very much like a brothel, and its initial customer base did indeed attract men.

But they quickly began to pivot, as more women kept flocking to the store.

The founder, a Stanford MBA, continued to evolve the business, weathering near-bankruptcy, and eventually built the empire that it became today.

But the big takeaway here was that, Victoria’s Secret was originally a store for men. Which I found interesting.",{'message': 'Server Error'},
Hector Quintanilla,4y,Why aren’t more people encouraged to become entrepreneurs?,"How is it possible that Steve Jobs, with no college education, transformed our world in such a massive way?

What made Steve so creative?

How did Steve manage to “Think Different?”

Steve was a dropout, a rebel, but most importantly, Steve was FREE!

Steve enjoyed complete self-governance, total independence to be himself, and would never conform to or follow the crowd.

Steve was not a people pleaser; he believed in his vision.

When his team members told him something was impossible, he would NOT accept that answer, and would push his team’s boundaries.

Steve was driven by his passion and clear vision, NOT by other people’s opinions.

Now, to answer your question, why aren’t more people encouraged to become entrepreneurs?

Steve was FREE from indoctrination!

Our Industrial Age educational system has one mission to accomplish:

STANDARDIZE!

The educational system tells us what to think, NOT how to think.

Indoctrination is oppressive, it kills creativity and innovation. Indoctrination has been an effective way to mold people to fit into the “status quo” and NOT challenge it.

Why aren’t more people encouraged to become entrepreneurs?
Because we’re trained to follow the crowd.

Why doesn't the world see more creative geniuses? 
Because we’re expected to follow the crowd.

Entrepreneurship is an art, not an exact science. It can be learned — yet standardization is NOT the way to teach an “art!”

Real education provides freedom!

Real education is powerful!

Real education is liberating!

Real education teaches you how to solve problems, how to create things, and most importantly, how to THINK DIFFERENT!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tlnijbr6zvdx0qac', 'title': 'Why aren’t more people encouraged to become entrepreneurs?', 'score': {'original': 0.5845, 'ai': 0.4155}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""How is it possible that Steve Jobs, with no college education, transformed our world in such a massive way?\n\nWhat made Steve so creative?\n\nHow did Steve manage to “Think Different?”\n\nSteve was a dropout, a rebel, but most importantly, Steve was FREE!\n\nSteve enjoyed complete self-governance, total independence to be himself, and would never conform to or follow the crowd.\n\nSteve was not a people pleaser; he believed in his vision.\n\nWhen his team members told him something was impossible, he would NOT accept that answer, and would push his team’s boundaries.\n\nSteve was driven by his passion and clear vision, NOT by other people’s opinions.\n\nNow, to answer your question, why aren’t more people encouraged to become entrepreneurs?\n\nSteve was FREE from indoctrination!\n\nOur Industrial Age educational system has one mission to accomplish:\n\nSTANDARDIZE!\n\nThe educational system tells us what to think, NOT how to think.\n\nIndoctrination is oppressive, it kills creativity and innovation.

Steve Baker,3y,"If Elon Musk were to successfully release Neuralink, what will be some of the potential negative consequences?","The kinds of thing that Neuralink might ultimately be able to do could be incredible:

Being able to telepathically access a web site or do a Google search. You’d think of a question - and the answer would immediately come to you - or perhaps be added as a memory of just having read the article or watched the video.
Having perfect quality video inserted into your retinal input - so you could see virtual and augmented reality without a headset or goggles. Watch and listen to TV with PERFECT clarity - play computer games that are indistinguishable from reality with full multi-sensory input.
Have pleasant memories injected into your dreams (ohhh…the porn industry are going to LOVE that!)
Adjusting your behavior away from bad things - curing people of addiction, perhaps by instantly turning off the desire for some particular thing.
Make healthy foods and a glass of water taste like the best steak and a good wine. Make you feel comfortably full after eating a small salad.
Be able to edit out horrific memories - cure PTSD, get rid of traumatic events from your childhood. Maybe like in the movie “Total Recall” - where they can insert a vacation memory into your brain without you having to go there and do that.

WHAT COULD *POSSIBLY* GO WRONG?

Mostly it’s privacy…but it could be VERY bad.

We have enough trouble as it is with the likes of Facebook and TikTok collecting data on us. Suppose Neuralink were to be bought out by a social media company?

Imagine if Facebook extended it’s reach to listening in on your thoughts? You’d have literally no privacy whatever. This isn’t like a cellphone where you can turn it off or leave it at home…it’s wired deeply into your head.
Suppose advertisers started inserting adverts directly into your visual cortex? Adverts that you couldn’t look away from or turn off - you can’t even close your eyes to them!
Suppose adverts get inserted into your dreams?
Suppose they can more subtly adjust your behavior - so you keep on wanting just one more can of Pepsi every day?
Suppose they could make their competitors brand of soda taste like vinegar?
Maybe they could change your memories to recall all of those great moments in your life where you drank a Pepsi?

The trouble is that all of those BAD things could be just abuse of the GOOD things.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,What is the best way to validate your idea?,"Want to sell online?

I will show you how to validate your online business idea with ZERO cost!

This is simple math, but most people ignore these numbers.

Will your product make a profit or not?

Okay, let’s be business partners!
Let’s consider this very simple example:

We want to sell a beautiful shirt at $25 each
(Our cost $3, amazing margin!)
We offer free shipping
(Our cost $5 postal service)
We do this from home. (Zero extra expenses)
We need a website. Let’s suppose we do it ourselves.
(Zero extra expense)
We purchase 100 shirts; our total investment is:
$3 (cost) x 100 (units) = $300

Sounds good?

How much profit will we make each time we sell a shirt?
$25 (sell) - $3 (cost of shirt) - $5 (shipping cost) = $17 profit/shirt

Now, let's sell it online!

Is the website ready? YES!
We are live! Yay!
High five!
crickets…
crickets…
Ohh! Surprise, we need to attract traffic to our website!

Okay, let's get traffic:

The easiest way to get traffic?
Advertising!
Google
Facebook
Quora
Etc
Good news! We pay only for those who visit our website.
That’s right, these companies who “own” the traffic, use a term CPC (cost per click) on advertisements.
Bellow is the average cost per click for Google Adwords on different categories:
As we can see, every time someone clicks on our Google Ad, we will pay Google on average between $1.35 and $3.40
Let’s make a good deal for our shirt business:
We will pay only $1 (one dollar CPC)

Okay, now we’re getting visitors to our website! Cool!

Now we need them to add the product to the shopping cart.
Studies show that the average add-to-cart rate is 8.7%[1]
Let’s say we have an amazing website…
We’ll use an add-to-cart rate of 15%!

Great! Now we have the visitors to our website, we also have them interested in the product and they have added it to the shopping cart! Amazing!

Now let’s check out!
Studies show that a typical shopping cart abandonment rate for online retailers varies between 60% and 80%, with an average of 67.91%[2]
Let’s use the average for our numbers: 67.91%

So, how much is each customer costing us?

Below I did the numbers for us:

Starting from the top left corner on the image below:

We have the traffic source
We will pay $1 for each click
People get to our website and only 15% will add the shirt to cart!
This means that every 100 visitors we have to our website, 15 will add to cart
We pay $100 for 100 visitors at $1 each and only 15 add to cart
The cost of that 15 add-to-cart was $100
How much per customer?
$100 cost /15 add to cart = $6.67 per add to cart
Now we need to check out
Average 67.9% of customers leave the item in the shopping cart and don’t check out.
For every 100 add-to-cart shoppers, 67.9 leave, that means that only 32.1 people check out.
Remember our cost-per-add to cart customer was $6.67?
The real cost for each checkout is ($6.67 *100 people / 32.1) = $20.77!

In summary:

We paid $1,000 for Google to send us 1,000 customers at $1 each
15% added the shirt to the shopping cart = 150 customers
32.1% of these 150 customers paid $25 per shirt = (150 x 32.1%) = We closed 48.15 sales x $25 dlls each = $1,203.75 total income!
Expense: we paid $1,000 for traffic.
Expense: we bought 48 shirts at $3 our cost each = $144 total cost of product sold
Expense: we paid 48 shipments of $5 each = $240 total cost of shipping costs

HOW MUCH PROFIT DID WE MAKE?

$1,203.75 (sales) - $1,000 CPC Ads - $144 cost of shirts - $240 shipping =
Negative $180.25

OH NO! WE LOST $180.25 PARTNER!

To answer your question:

To validate your idea it's critical to KNOW YOUR NUMBERS and strategize your sales before you get too excited!

Hector Quintanilla,5y,What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?,"“GOLD! GOLD! I FOUND GOLD!” shouted Francisco Lopez, a native Californian in early 1842. Francisco couldn't believe his luck. He wanted more!

He looked around the river.

“Wow! More gold!”

He moved some rocks and found even more. “There’s gold everywhere!” he jumped up and down with excitement. He became a millionaire in a few weeks.

Francisco is recognized as one of the first people to find gold in Northern California.

The word spread slowly at first. Then, a few years later, a San Francisco newspaper confirmed the opportunity and the word spread like wildfire.

By 1849, the news had spread around the world. An overwhelming number of gold-seekers began to arrive from every continent.

The famous name ""forty-niners"" originated from the approximately 90,000 people who arrived in California during this year, 1849.

Once the news spread, everything happened very quickly. There was no easy way to get to California. Forty-niners faced hardship and often death on their way to get there. Almost overnight, opportunities became abundant everywhere.

—

Now, to answer your question, what are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?

During the California Gold Rush, there were two types of people:

Those who wanted to get rich quick and those who were in for the long run.

Those who wanted to strike it rich quickly, were searching for a shortcut. They lacked patience, were highly emotional dreamers who lacked discipline.

These people were basically gambling with their lives. Hoping and wishing for the good luck to strike it rich in a few days.

On the other hand, those who wanted to get rich slowly were completely opposed to the shortcut seekers. They knew what they wanted. They were searching for long-term opportunities, not after an emotional dream.

These men were smart. They were NOT distracted, going after the “gold-gamble,” they were entrepreneurs who were there to make a huge business out of the gold that everyone else was after.

These entrepreneurs got into shipping to transport people and supply goods for the growing population. They built hotels, restaurants, sold the tools needed for miners.

Hundreds of ships were abandoned after their crews deserted them right after they got to land. Gold diggers would run as fast as possible to the goldfields to start searching for the precious metal.

Meanwhile, entrepreneurs were known to convert these boats into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and even into jails.

Opportunities were massive. While the “get rich quick” gold diggers were risking their lives in the mountains, the unending demand of needs raised the prices of all the goods to unimaginable levels.

There are reports of bakeries charging one dollar for a slice of bread, two dollars if it was buttered, the equivalent of about $56 in today’s money.

A dozen eggs might cost you $90 at today’s prices. A pick axe would cost the equivalent of $1,500! Coffee $1,200 a pound and a pair of boots up to $3,000!

Two famous examples of slow-growth entrepreneurs who bloomed in this era are:

- Levi Strauss, founder of the American clothing company who supplied jeans to the miners.

Think about this, where are all the gold diggers? GONE!

Where is Levi Strauss & Co. 165 years later? Correct!

- Henry Wells and William Fargo started a transportation business in 1852. Later, they found the opportunity to get into financial services. In 1954, Wells Fargo & Union Trust shortened its name to Wells Fargo Bank.

Tell me, where are the gold diggers today? Don't get distracted by gold’s glitter!

Slow, smart, hard work is by far the best way to succeed!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7186aiwbun3xomh9', 'title': 'What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?', 'score': {'original': 0.3497, 'ai': 0.6503}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“GOLD!

Coffee $1,200 a pound and a pair of boots up to $3,000!\n\nTwo famous examples of slow-growth entrepreneurs who bloomed in this era are:\n\n- Levi Strauss, founder of the American clothing company who supplied jeans to the miners.\n\nThink about this, where are all the gold diggers? GONE!\n\nWhere is Levi Strauss & Co. 165 years later? Correct!\n\n- Henry Wells and William Fargo started a transportation business in 1852. Later, they found the opportunity to get into financial services. In 1954, Wells Fargo & Union Trust shortened its name to Wells Fargo Bank.\n\nTell me, where are the gold diggers today? Don\'t get distracted by gold’s glitter!\n\nSlow, smart, hard work is by far the best way to succeed!', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.3497

Matthew Bates,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I took my dog to the vet yesterday for a regular checkup and because she had an ear infection. She gets ear infections a lot. That’s a “thing” with floppy-eared dogs. The only appointment they had was right after school, so my children and I had to rush home to get our dog, and rush to the vet. If you’ve ever tried to rush anywhere with children right after school, you know it can be stressful.

The exam went well and, after an 8-hour workday and 45 minutes in the vet’s office, I was eager to get home and relax. By “relax,” I mean “spend an hour alone, while my kids watch TV and my dog plays by herself in the backyard.”

There was a 10-minute delay between the end of the exam and them having the bill ready for me to pay. While I sat there, in the waiting room, with my two younger children and my dog, an elderly man came in with his German shepherd.

His very old German shepherd.

It was clearly in pain as it walked. Through the front window, I saw it walking slowly on the concrete sidewalk and, once it came through the door, it couldn’t get much traction on the hardwood floor of the waiting room.

The dog’s back legs slid out from under it. It struggled to lift its back side and walk a little more, but it was yelping in pain. Finally, tearfully, the man picked it up. The dog was pretty big, and the man was pretty old, and it looked like he was struggling to carry his dog. He sat down in the first seat he could find, still holding his dog.

I was tempted to offer to help or strike up a conversation with the man. There are normal things dog owners talk about when they encounter each other: what kind of dog is that, how old is it, etc…

But something stopped me from talking to the man.

He didn’t have to sit there long. The vet came out immediately (usually they don’t come out at all… a tech calls you back to the exam room), said something quietly to the man, and then led the man and his dog, still cradled in his arms, back to the very same exam room where my dog had been just minutes before.

Along the way, both receptionists told the man that they were sorry.

That’s when my suspicions were confirmed. This elderly man was bringing in his elderly dog to be euthanized.

There I was, with my overly-energetic two-year-old dog, my equally-energetic young children, full of stress and eager to get home, where my dog and children would leave me alone while I relaxed for a while.

As I watched this man carry his friend for the last time, I thought to myself: “One day, I’m going to miss all of this… the young, energetic dog, the school-aged kids who never seem to stop talking, the running errands after a hard day at work… all of it. Perhaps I should stop stressing over it, and instead enjoy it while it lasts.

I was also glad I did not talk to the guy. I’m glad I didn’t interrupt his last moments with his friend.

When I finally got home yesterday, instead of parking my kids in front of the TV and letting my dog out in the yard, I asked my kids if they’d like to play with our dog with me in the yard. They did, and we had a lot of fun.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/21nlgq03i8ysthpj', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.4973, 'ai': 0.5027}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I took my dog to the vet yesterday for a regular checkup and because she had an ear infection.

Asim Qureshi,6y,What was the best business deal ever made?,"It is November 1980 and IBM is twice as large as every other computer company in the world combined.

They are making an agreement with an upstart, Microsoft, a company with 40 staff, to create an operating system (OS), the software that a computer runs off. This OS would later be called IBM PC-DOS.

But the young CEO of Microsoft, Bill Gates, sees something that IBM doesn’t. He pushes for the agreement to allow Microsoft to license the OS to other manufacturers, and IBM agree.

Microsoft come up with a really original name for this OS - they call it MS-DOS.

And the rest is history…

Microsoft ends up supplying the OS to over 1.4bn PC’s and counting because of the deal Gates had struck.

Many say this was the best business deal ever.

But there was a problem. Microsoft didn’t even own the OS!

Microsoft only managed to purchase a non-exclusive agreement for the OS in December 1980 for a reported US$25k from Seattle Computer Products.

But in July 1981, Microsoft finally purchased the full rights to the OS for US$50k, a month before it started getting shipped out onto PCs.

Biman Dua,7y,"I am curious to know that in a country, where Ambanis and Tatas are household names, are there businessmen that are doing great work but not many people know about them? Who are some of the successful but not well-known Indian businessmen?","Darshan Patel, founder of FOGG deodorant.

He is the person behind FOGG’s astonishing success in last 3–4 years.

Darshan N Patel, one of the three Patel brothers who took Paras Pharmaceuticals (creator of pain relief gel Moov) towards marketing glory, is repeating the act with his Vini Cosmetics pvt. Ltd. Three years after inception, and about two years after big-bang entry into the world of deodorants, Patel’s Fogg has dethroned the likes of Axe — the brand that can rightfully claim credit for carving out the deo category in India. Fogg, now Vini’s flagship product, leads the country’s ₹2,000-crore deodorant market with a 13 per cent share since its launching December 2011.

Businesses are successful if they prioritize consumer behavior and innovation. When all the Deodorants brands were coming with the same type of product, Patel came up with a different type of product, a liquid based deo instead of gas. The people of India have a common mindset of getting more for less capital. Fogg understood this human behavior and delivered a product in Indian market with demonstrating this product with only liquid and no gas.Lots of people raised doubt over success of Fogg in India. But Patel’s brilliant marketing strategy has changed the Deo Industry in India and FOGG is the most successful and most selling deo in India right now, giving Hindustan Unilever's (HUL) AXE, Park Avenue, Wild stone a run for its money.

Patel successfully launched brands like Krack cream, Itchguard, Moov, Livon and Dermicool, which created a dissonance in the marketplace. Patel appears to be following a similar strategy with Vini Cosmetics as well.

Patel expects to close FY16 with a turnover of Rs 600 crore, which would be a near 18% jump over FY15. In FY14 turnover was 350 crore.

Besides Fogg Vini has White Tone, Glam Up,18+ deo and NUFeel brands.

Sagnik Misra,Updated 3y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Most of the times, I used to stay in hostel before the lockdown. Now, due to everyday morning classes, my daily breakfast used to get skipped.

Besides, I was kind of getting sick due to the unhealthy oily foods of my hostel in the morning. My classes used to take between 8a.m - 2p.m with almost no breaks.

So, instead of eating outside foods and wasting money, I came up with something different.

Most of our older generation is familiar with this healthy flour.

We call it Chatu in Bengali (Sattu). I first noticed my parents to make a juice of it and drink in the morning/ mix with puffed rice and eat. This gave their stomach full boost without any feelings of hunger before 1pm. It also energized them.

So, I thought of adapting this old technique of quenching hunger with healthy diet. I bought a packet of it.

In the morning, I mixed 3/4 spoons of Sattu with water along with sugar and salt of my choice. Then I drink it. It usually takes a minute or so to prepare.

It worked like a magic and provided me enough energies to continue my studies with no intention of distractions towards food before my lunch hours.
