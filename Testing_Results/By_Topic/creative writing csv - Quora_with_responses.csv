Asad Zuberi,6y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"What is this?

07:45

What are you thinking now?

AM or PM

What if I tell you that this is nothing but 4 digits separated by a colon. Remove this colon.

0745

It doesn't mean anything now.

These are just 4 digits created by us.

Years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds are all our own creations.

What are you worried about?

Dates? Years? Age? Time? Deadlines?

These are created by you.

The concept of time is created by you.

So you are worried about some things that you have created yourself?

Quite amazing. And surprising.

You are afraid of these digits and you are deciding your productivity on their basis.

“I won't work now, it's too late”

“How can I do this? I am too old for this”

These expressions will lose their meaning and credibility once I take away some digits from you.

Nana Bello Shehu,Updated 4y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"“Till Death Do Us Part”

Two Selfless Souls.

WARNING: HEART-RENDING CONTENT AHEAD.

Jake Coates and Emmy Collett, childhood Sweethearts. They dated for years before they got separated after college but eventually, they reunited.

Finally, in 2016, this couple took a bold step created time out of their busy schedule (Emmy, a teacher in London and Jake, a medical Doctor in Sydney) to move their relationship to the next phase, and planned to spend time together for the first time after a long time. What can really go wrong?

But one fateful morning everything came crashing down when they found out Emmy had terminal thyroid cancer. Unknown to Emmy, Jake had planned to propose to her during this vacation. But to Jake nothing in life can hinder him from his plan, instead, he proposed to her with a cup of tea on a sick bed. So sweet and romantic yet quite sad.

She agreed of course.

Emmy cried throughout their whole process of marriage, even to the moment “till death do us part.” because she knows literary what those words really meant.

Her beautiful smile almost hides the fact that this moment is just but for a bit.

She had her dream just like she'd imagined but she knew it would only to be for just a moment. She never allowed pain to steal away her precious time, She tried to enjoy life to the fullest, with the little time she had left.

At the time, she said: ""Although all of this news has been a shock and challenging at times, it has also made me realize how important and precious every day is and to enjoy and treasure every moment.”

And so she did. Living her life like there's no tomorrow, which is for certain.

They got matching tattoos.

At a Coldplay concert.

Does she look like someone that has but a few months to live? The illness may try to take everything from her but not her cheerful outlook.

When this selfless lady sees that if she can't have Jake’s child, she feels that it was her duty, just as she put it on a sad note, “As his wife, I should be able to give him one and I can’t.”

Thank God for surrogacy.

Emmy and Jake's old school friend, Liz, steps in to help this couple when she heard about their plan.

Three weeks later, Liz conceives. It's the best moment of their lives but Emmy’s health is gradually failing.

Even in extreme pain and to her very last moments, she always blessed the world with her beautiful smile.

Emmy succumbed to the illness in June 2017, but her bravery and smile throughout her battle are one of the things she will always be remembered for.

After her death, Liz's pregnancy got complicated and she later lost the child. To many, it might seem that Jake suffered a second loss, but to him, it wasn't so:

""Emmy will be up there with her little baby Emmy, always be watching over us and be wanting us all to continue her legacy - to keep smiling, loving and being kind.""

Although their story has a tragic ending, Their bravery, the Love and commitment they shared will always be a legacy to remember.

And finally in Jake's words:

“You have inspired so many and given so many people the hope and strength they have needed to continue on in the darkest of times. You are and always will be the biggest inspiration to me. I love you, angel. Now and always,” he wrote in a Facebook post.

Jake, a selfless and kind soul, gave her love and happiness and smoothed her journey.

She left a legacy: Smile, Love, Kindness and always live like there is no tomorrow, even when literary there's no tomorrow for you. ❤

This gave me hope in humanity.

Thanks for reading. ❤

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am born third daughter in indian middleclass family. My parents were dying to have a son. My mother had sex determination tests done at second and third pregnancy, she wanted to abort but my father convinced her otherwise. When I was born she went into shock, refusing to feed me.

In my teens I remember her saying that she did not care much if we as kids were crying, she said slapping our faces made us stop crying.

Me and my sisters grew up confused, trying to put up a happy front, pleasing her. She was not very generous with her approvals. Appreciation from her was beyond our reach.

Her wardrobe was full of clothes she bought left and right. We got one dress every year. The two younger sisters would wear the handed down dress from the oldest. Needless to say, till the time I graduated, I have worn my elder sisters clothes.

After many abortions, my brother was born. We were finally relieved of the guilt of being born as girls. Now every thing was about him. Three of us were made to look after him at nights when he cried while she slept. The movie chandani was going hit that time. Sridevi dancing on the “9 choodiyan ” song was very famous. Two of us went to a choodi shop and bought the same 9 red choodi. Our giggling and laughter made the monster awake. Infront of my dad and few servants she called us “whores”.

Two of us did well acedemicaly, she would then compare our scores trying to make us fight. This was later about salaries.

Gifting her branded clothes, shoes, purses, mobiles did not make her happy. She would make faces. She would tell her friends that she bought all those. Always demeaning us infront of them.

I wanted to buy an apartment, I had saved some but was falling short of 1.5 lakhs for the down payment. I believed my parents would loan me that, and would also be my garantor. She created such drama instead of simply saying “no”. She refused after two days. Later a school friend told me my mother had loaned her 1 lakh for some renovation of her house. I did not know what to say.

When my daughter was two weeks, she was crying non stop. My mother was about to slap her when I stopped her. This made the monster inside her awake. Gossiping, spreading lies, making things difficult for me was the least, she went ahead with starving me in the name of weight gain, I was only 60 kgs!!!!

My father has been a silent spectator. Usually agreeing with her or then staying quiet.Like us he must also be confused.

I am 38 years old. I do not talk with my mother or my sisters. Sometimes I weep at nights. I am very good at maintaining a happy face. I am still trying to figure out why she did not help me with the loan. I try to forget about it.

My kids are awesome. I love them. I do not know how a mother should be. But I know how a mother should NOT be.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lizy3p9w7j0vs2gx', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.51865, 'ai': 0.48135}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am born third daughter in indian middleclass family.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I was gential mutilated (Infibulation) by my parents when I was 9 years old.

For those who don't know the Infibulation… its a pharaonic mutilation, which is done through cutting the girl’s external genitalia.

I live in Sudan. I was 9. One day morning, my sister and I were taken to a woman who used to do this surgery. I remember the room, it was meesy and untidy.There was no privacy, lot’s of women were in the room looking, and some kids (who I don't remember where the hell did they come from!), were on the windows sneaking the glances and laughing, while I was crying. On the small table, there were cotton, water, razors and other stuff. I was terrified, loudly screaming and flinging. Two or three women held me so I can't move. I was begging. The womon took the razor and killed me.

At house People were celebrating, food and songs. I had to stay in the bed for several weeks. Visitors came to congratulate and give me money and gifts! the suffer didn't stop here. It was extremely hard to move, or sit for several weeks. Bathroom was always a catastrophe, the pain was untolerable lots of scream, blood, and tears.

Many years after, I questioned my mother. Why did she do it? As I was taught at school how devirly it is. She answered “to make you clean. It's our tradition, my mother did it. I did it, and you should do it to your future daughter, as well”. By the time I realized that my mom doesn't like to speak about it at all, I don't know was it because of the guilt or for she was avoiding her bad memories from her childhood.

I mean, to make me clean of what!? They never tell the reason, and I doubt if they know the reason in the first place! People where I belong have fear of thinking, they rather choose to follow, for its easier.

Finally, and thank for education, I got answers. old practices related to purity, for maintaining us virgin, to not bring the shame to our families. “you have no clitor..difficult to get lust.. you stay virgin!. And when you get married, your feeling doesn't matter, you are almost like a sex doll”

I wish no more girls will go through what I went through. although the law prevents it now, but it's still happening secretly.

I have a freind who comes from an educated family, and didn't have to go through it. She asked once “ what is it feel?”

I answered “ I don't feel”.

Sorry for my bad English and poor narrating. I needed a vent.

EDIT:

Thank you so much for your kind words, and support, it really means a lot.

Just to make things clear…

Some people in the comments considered me to be a Muslim, and started attacking Islam although, I didn't mention my religious background!. I am not defending any religion here, it's just that Sudan is a divers country, these practices aren't done by Muslims only, Coptic Christian and some animist groups are known with it, as well.

Yes, there are some organizations in Sudan fighting to stop it. It's less now than in the past .

I was 9. One day morning, my sister and I were taken to a woman who used to do this surgery. I remember the room, it was meesy and untidy.There was no privacy, lot’s of women were in the room looking, and some kids (who I don't remember where the hell did they come from!), were on the windows sneaking the glances and laughing, while I was crying. On the small table, there were cotton, water, razors and other stuff. I was terrified, loudly screaming and flinging. Two or three women held me so I can't move. I was begging. The womon took the razor and killed me.\n\nAt house People were celebrating, food and songs. I had to stay in the bed for several weeks. Visitors came to congratulate and give me money and gifts! the suffer didn't stop here. It was extremely hard to move, or sit for several weeks. Bathroom was always a catastrophe, the pain was untolerable lots of scream, blood, and tears.\n\nMany years after, I questioned my mother. Why did she do it? As I was taught at school how devirly it is. She answered “to make you clean. It's our tradition, my mother did it. I did it, and you should do it to your future daughter, as well”. By the time I realized that my mom doesn't like to speak about it at all, I don't know was it because of the guilt or for she was avoiding her bad memories from her childhood.\n\nI mean, to make me clean of what!? They never tell the reason, and I doubt if they know the reason in the first place! People where I belong have fear of thinking, they rather choose to follow, for its easier.\n\nFinally, and thank for education, I got answers. old practices related to purity, for maintaining us virgin, to not bring the shame to our families. “you have no clitor..difficult to get lust.. you stay virgin!. And when you get married, your feeling doesn't matter, you are almost like a sex doll”\n\nI wish no more girls will go through what I went through. although the law prevents it now, but it's still happening secretly.\n\nI have a freind who comes from an educated family, and didn't have to go through it.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am BSF jawan posted at Punjab Frontier, FHQ Jalandhar, Ferozepur Sector. Here I would like to open up my heart.

It's really cold out here during especially winters. We find our warmth in the very little calls we make to our dear ones.
If you see any army man just pass a smile. You never know how much great it feels out there.
Sometimes we sleep just 3 hours but we never regret because it's after all we who chose to live this life.
It feels kind of demeaning and discouraging when our own people suspect our bravery.
We go by the thought 'Everyone's got to die one day so why not die worthy'.
It makes every army jawan sad when the people who we try to protect themselves are behind our death.
Guns seem quite amazing in a virtual world but in reality it's a 3kg burden we carry.
We live the ‘present’ at its fullest because there is no assurance of a ‘tomorrow’.
When such headlines and pictures pop up

Kirti Chakra awardee beaten up in road rage

It hurts more than any metal bullets.

We do celebrate Diwali and Eid with everyone where one's religion doesn't matter. It's among some of our joyful moments.
We have some pesky neighbours but in the end, we all sail the same boat to safeguard our nation.

But it's an amazing life with your friends, sharing thoughts and working together. Afterall, it's the thinking that even if we struggle, there are millions out there who live peacefully and that's what drives us.

A life of an army jawan.

Have a nice day!

Anonymous,Updated 4y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I screwed my high paying career!

I am a 34 year old, MALE. IIT. Computer Science. I got placed in a top MNC in Bangalore.

As soon as I got the job I got comfortable in the project. It was a maintenance kind of project and I was happy to work over there because I didn’t want to work hard(That was my attitude! That too in my initial years of career). Years passed and somehow I managed “not to get” low performer. I just worked that much so that I don’t get LP and don’t get fired. That was my goal. Company decided to close that project after 4 years and I moved to another project and as I was good at maintaining the project. The manager put me again on one more maintenance project and as the work was in my comfort zone. I agreed to take that. I was 4 year experienced that time and I could have asked for more challenging work! but No!! I didn’t care that time. that year I got blessed with my daughter so I wanted to spend time with her and I thought this is the time I should give time to my family than working hard in office.

5 more years passed!! few bug fixes!! few feature implementation! but no technical skill improvement. I am almost 10 year experienced now and my technical skill are like a 2 year experienced person. I always escaped taking interview too!! because I was not confident about my skills and I was scared of giving and taking interviews. I avoided challenging technical discussions with peers. In June 2018, I decided to change my company and then I realized how much time I wasted working on a maintenance projects. How casually I took my career which I could have made great! Wherever I am giving interview, I am getting rejection saying your skills are not sufficient for this level. Its been 5 months already and I got 7 rejections!! My situation is depressing! I am working on my coding skills. Reading tech blogs. and regretting everyday about my past casual attitude!

I hope I catch up soon!

Edit 1: Thanks for overwhelming response from all of you guys! Didn't expect that! Update from my side is finally I managed to find a job in the US.

Shreyas Chavhan,4y,Can you write something inspiring so that I can be inspired?,"Have you recognised the man sitting on the back seat of the bike?

By his appearance, you must be thinking that he might be a boy from lower middle class family, working in a grocery to earn money and support his family.

But no, that's not the truth.

He is Dhravya Dholakia, son of a billionaire Savji Dholakia.

( Image Credit - Google Images)

Surat diamond magnate Savji Dholakia caught the world’s attention two years ago when he rewarded 1200 employees with apartments and cars as Diwali bonus.

For teaching his son how challenging life is, he decided to ask his son Dhravya Dholakia to go to an unfamiliar place and earn livelihood through odd work.

(Image Credit- Google Images)

Dhravya Dholakia accepted his father's challenge and left for Kochi with Rs 7000, a pair of clothes and nothing else.

Condition of his challenge

First Dharvya needed to find some work but wherever he joins, he should not stay there for more than a week.
He should not use his father’s identity
He should not use those Rs 7000 until an emergency.

Dhravya accepted the challenge and went to Kochi where Hindi would not help him.

What difficulties he had faced?

For 5 days, Dhravya did not have any proper place to stay nor did he have any job. He was rejected from 60 places, he lied that he was from a very poor family and wanted to earn money to help his family. At last he got a job in a bakery. He kept switching jobs. Do you know how much he earned? He earned Rs 4000.

( Image Credit- Google Images)

Dhravya Dholakia said

I never worried about money and here I was struggling to get a one time meal worth Rs 40 and I needed another Rs 250 per day to stay in a lodge.

What do you think? Wasn't that inspiring?

Every father (whether from rich or middle class family) should do this experiment with his son/daughter to teach them true values of life.

Thanks for Reading!

Shefali Naidu,6y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"I am not a typical Indian mother.

I do not forgo my wishes for my daughter.

I cannot magically find things in the cupboard. I look for them with the family in tow.

I cannot make delicious dishes all the time.

I readily agree to have a meal outside.

My house isn't spick and span all the time.

I can't cook a meal in a jiffy for uninvited guests.

I love having time for myself.

I look forward for a date alone with my husband.

I left my daughter and husband and went on an all girls trip.

I cook food which I like and don't feel guilty about it.

I have never forced my daughter to have green veggies, because I have never given her a choice. We all have our meals together and she eats what we eat.

Sounds harsh? Unmotherly?

Maybe it is. But does that make me a less of a mother?

No.

I still love my daughter to the core. I am a new generation parent and I don't fit the bill of the age-old stereotyped mother who is an epitome of sacrifice. An unselfish person.

It is high time we stop stereotyping moms out there.

A question I read the other day,

“My mom didn't prepare hot food for me when I returned home last night. How can I show my anger without pissing her off?”

This is what it has come to. A mother is taken for granted without blinking an eye. And because this trend is so prevalent, mothers like me who do not fit the bill are frowned upon.

Please don't give me the Mothers-are-unselfish-That's-how-they-show-love bullshit.

They are like this because they have seen their mother and had it ingrained in them to behave in a certain way. If given a chance, no mother wants to stay hungry till their kid has eaten. No mother wants to eat only what their kids like all the time.

The society and the unnecessary hammering about a certain way a mother is perceived are the real reason behind it.

Such sacrifices are one of the reasons youth out there are scared of getting married and becoming parents.

Break the stereotypes. Your love for your kids isn't in any way related to the sacrifices you make.

Unconditional love sure is a thing. But not at the cost of the mother’s happiness.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2msy89ueqjdntwfc', 'title': 'Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am not a typical Indian mother.\n\nI do not forgo my wishes for my daughter.\n\nI cannot magically find things in the cupboard.

Leon Brennan,5y,How do you know if writing is your thing?,"Homework is for nerds.

That's exactly what Mom's boyfriend used to say. In hindsight, I can see why he used to say that. It gave him the whole evening to hang out, get high and try to get laid, as opposed to helping my brother and me with our schoolwork.

The good thing about homework being for nerds was when I brought home my report card I didn't get in trouble. This is my 7th-grade report card from Ephrata Junior High.

Phys Ed had no homework, obviously.

Over the years, my grades never really improved. The ten or so people who were my classmates, who now follow me on Quora, I'm sure would attest to that fact.

When I started answering questions on Quora, my ability to write and communicate was, well, worse than awful. I’d read the question, I thought I knew the answer, but I had no idea how to get there.

At the beginning of 2018, I started really studying other people’s answers. I noticed a flow in the way they answered questions. I followed them (and still follow them) because I admired how great they were at communicating.

I ask(ed) people for direction and advice all the time. I take suggestions seriously.

Instead of telling people what to do and writing answers like a confused know-it-all ass hole, I started writing about personal experience. I stopped advising because really, who the hell am I?

I found that by sharing what happened to me, the amount of enjoyment I got from writing went up immensely.

When I share some of those experiences it also helps me learn things about myself. Writing from experience allows me to reflect on how I handled a situation and look for ways to improve.

I think that writing is for me because it helps me focus, which is something I’m always trying to work on. It has also improved my ability to communicate with my family.

But I know for sure that writing is for me because it has opened doors that I never even knew existed.

And as far as homework being for nerds, that was one of the biggest lies I was ever told in my life.

Murphy Barrett,Updated 5y,What is a sign of amateur fiction writing?,"90% of all fanfiction is utter crap. Including the fanfiction I used to write. But it’s a great place to get started. It’s a good initial outlet for creativity, and a decent crucible to craft better stories.

What sticks out as amateur?

Poor spelling, syntax, and grammar. This is a fairly reliable giveaway. However, all is not lost. You may have a wonderful story, you just need to work on communicating it clearly.

Perfect Heroes. The hero is the best at everything, everyone loves him, and nothing is a challenge. Your hero is boring as hell. Struggle, strife, and complexity are what make characters interesting. Give your hero flaws. Some, he may overcome. Others he never will. Humans are not perfect.

Furthermore, if nothing is a struggle, and he always wins, there’s no tension. This is why I dislike Superman as a character. He’s too perfect, and the only way to give him a challenge, is either to face him against another physical god, or pull some technicolor kyrptonite b*******. God battles are boring, because we cannot relate to gods.

Of course, it can be done, but a skillful author makes the reader empathize with the hero, man or god.

Villains out for EVIL. Villains are good. Good villains are great! But too many amateur writers make their villains EVIL! and have them do stupid and ridiculous things just to showcase how evil the villain is. Kicking puppies, eating babies, etc. Things that just make no sense. EVIL is not a cause people pursue, unless we’re dealing with Demons. Villains should pursue real causes. Those causes may be truly evil, like making Germany Judenfrei, but it’s not evil for the sake of EVIL. There’s an actual reason for this vile plan.

Furthermore, no villain should ever exist for the hero to defeat. Of course, narratively, that’s exactly what villains are there for. But within the plot itself, the villain should be the hero of her own story. She should have her own goals, her own motivations. She should be a real person, with as much effort invested, or more, than the hero. Good heroes need good villains.

Always the Villain, never the Antagonist. Amateur writers often only have villains. They don’t realize you can have a character oppose the protagonist without being “evil”. The rival trying to win the track-meet, the principal suspending the hero, the jock who’s dating the hero’s crush, these characters don’t need to be villains. They can simply be antagonists, people with whom the hero comes into conflict. There’s no malice, no desire to do harm. Just opposition.

Always the Hero, never the Protagonist. Which leads us to the reverse problem, protagonists don’t always have to be the HERO. Protagonists can just have stories, they don’t always need to be fighting the great evil.

The Chosen One. The Hero/Protagonist is always the subject of some prophecy, born under great portent, destined for victory. Super special. Usually visually distinct, with purple eyes and bright green hair, a tail, whatever. The hero then prevails, not on merit, but on author fiat. This of course feeds the everyman/teen fantasy of being the hero without actually putting in the blood, sweat, and tears necessary to build the skillset needed to be the hero.

Romance. Love, because reasons. Amateurs typically write just bog awful love stories resplendent with purple prose and overwrought genital metaphors. Look, if you can’t say Penis and Vagina without giggling, you’re probably not up to writing a quality love story. Don’t give up, just realize you have some way to go before your romance story is rivaling Jane Austen.

Narrative Flow. Things happen without logical progression. People do things that don’t really make sense, because PLOT. Crafting a plot that flows and makes sense is a challenge.

Worldbuilding. The world doesn’t make sense. There are myriad reasons why, far too many to detail. Worldbuilding is very difficult, and often the result of insufficient research. Worlds are systems. You can’t have an army of 100,000 if people are stuck at subsistence level farming. You can’t have knights in shiny 15th century armor if casting is still the predominant method of metal forming. Logistics matters.

Tone: The tone of the story is inconsistent. This one is subtle, and very difficult. Is your story mostly comedy, tragedy, or epic? Is it light-hearted, dark, or realistic? Amateurs have inconsistent or illogical tone-shifts. Or, the tone is relentlessly one thing.

Simple Mistakes born of Research Failure. A myriad little things that three minutes on Google would have prevented. Yes, some of it you simply cannot know. You lack the experience. We all do, in some regard. But research is your friend. You can learn damn near anything online, or by pestering your extremely patient and understanding friends about things that they know and you do not. You can even write to famous people or institutions for help. You might not get it, but you can try. But simple mistakes that are common knowledge to anybody experienced in the thing you’re writing about just show you have no idea what you’re talking about.

For example, nobody is going to bust your balls for not knowing that Fulton Armory makes good parts for historical military firearms, but if your character is buying her first gun from a store, and just walks out with it rather than filling out a 4473 and waiting for the phone call to clear, those of us in the know are going to call BS.

The thing to remember when writing is that there are rules, and they exist for a good reason. If you’re new to writing, you’d be well served to learn the rules and follow them. Not because you don’t have a great idea, but because you’re new, and you don’t know what you’re doing. The rules help you avoid the worst mistakes.

Then, once you have some more experience, once you understand the rules, why they’re there, what they do, you can start to break them. Breaking the rules when you don’t know what you’re doing leads to terrible stories. Breaking them when you understand the ramifications of your actions, and you break that rule with purpose, to achieve a specific effect, can lead to fantastic stories.

Because once you have experience, you realize the rules are more like guidelines.

This is why I dislike Superman as a character. He’s too perfect, and the only way to give him a challenge, is either to face him against another physical god, or pull some technicolor kyrptonite b*******. God battles are boring, because we cannot relate to gods.\n\nOf course, it can be done, but a skillful author makes the reader empathize with the hero, man or god.\n\nVillains out for EVIL. Villains are good. Good villains are great! But too many amateur writers make their villains EVIL! and have them do stupid and ridiculous things just to showcase how evil the villain is. Kicking puppies, eating babies, etc. Things that just make no sense. EVIL is not a cause people pursue, unless we’re dealing with Demons. Villains should pursue real causes. Those causes may be truly evil, like making Germany Judenfrei, but it’s not evil for the sake of EVIL. There’s an actual reason for this vile plan.\n\nFurthermore, no villain should ever exist for the hero to defeat. Of course, narratively, that’s exactly what villains are there for. But within the plot itself, the villain should be the hero of her own story. She should have her own goals, her own motivations. She should be a real person, with as much effort invested, or more, than the hero. Good heroes need good villains.\n\nAlways the Villain, never the Antagonist. Amateur writers often only have villains. They don’t realize you can have a character oppose the protagonist without being “evil”. The rival trying to win the track-meet, the principal suspending the hero, the jock who’s dating the hero’s crush, these characters don’t need to be villains. They can simply be antagonists, people with whom the hero comes into conflict. There’s no malice, no desire to do harm. Just opposition.\n\nAlways the Hero, never the Protagonist. Which leads us to the reverse problem, protagonists don’t always have to be the HERO. Protagonists can just have stories, they don’t always need to be fighting the great evil.\n\nThe Chosen One. The Hero/Protagonist is always the subject of some prophecy, born under great portent, destined for victory. Super special. Usually visually distinct, with purple eyes and bright green hair, a tail, whatever. The hero then prevails, not on merit, but on author fiat. This of course feeds the everyman/teen fantasy of being the hero without actually putting in the blood, sweat, and tears necessary to build the skillset needed to be the hero.\n\nRomance. Love, because reasons. Amateurs typically write just bog awful love stories resplendent with purple prose and overwrought genital metaphors. Look, if you can’t say Penis and Vagina without giggling, you’re probably not up to writing a quality love story. Don’t give up, just realize you have some way to go before your romance story is rivaling Jane Austen.\n\nNarrative Flow. Things happen without logical progression. People do things that don’t really make sense, because PLOT. Crafting a plot that flows and makes sense is a challenge.\n\nWorldbuilding. The world doesn’t make sense. There are myriad reasons why, far too many to detail. Worldbuilding is very difficult, and often the result of insufficient research. Worlds are systems. You can’t have an army of 100,000 if people are stuck at subsistence level farming. You can’t have knights in shiny 15th century armor if casting is still the predominant method of metal forming. Logistics matters.\n\nTone: The tone of the story is inconsistent. This one is subtle, and very difficult. Is your story mostly comedy, tragedy, or epic? Is it light-hearted, dark, or realistic? Amateurs have inconsistent or illogical tone-shifts. Or, the tone is relentlessly one thing.\n\nSimple Mistakes born of Research Failure. A myriad little things that three minutes on Google would have prevented. Yes, some of it you simply cannot know. You lack the experience. We all do, in some regard. But research is your friend. You can learn damn near anything online, or by pestering your extremely patient and understanding friends about things that they know and you do not. You can even write to famous people or institutions for help. You might not get it, but you can try. But simple mistakes that are common knowledge to anybody experienced in the thing you’re writing about just show you have no idea what you’re talking about.\n\nFor example, nobody is going to bust your balls for not knowing that Fulton Armory makes good parts for historical military firearms, but if your character is buying her first gun from a store, and just walks out with it rather than filling out a 4473 and waiting for the phone call to clear, those of us in the know are going to call BS.\n\nThe thing to remember when writing is that there are rules, and they exist for a good reason. If you’re new to writing, you’d be well served to learn the rules and follow them. Not because you don’t have a great idea, but because you’re new, and you don’t know what you’re doing. The rules help you avoid the worst mistakes.\n\nThen, once you have some more experience, once you understand the rules, why they’re there, what they do, you can start to break them. Breaking the rules when you don’t know what you’re doing leads to terrible stories. Breaking them when you understand the ramifications of your actions, and you break that rule with purpose, to achieve a specific effect, can lead to fantastic stories.\n\nBecause once you have experience, you realize the rules are more like guidelines.\n\nFor more, read Quill and Ink\n\nOriginal question-What is a sign of amateur fiction writing?', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.83786666666667

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am 25 years old girl from Nagpur. I lost my father when I was 16 years old. He left me with my mom and an elder brother who is schizophrenic. After his demise, I was the only one to take care of my family. He left us with a home and minimal savings on which we had survive hardly two months . I was a very pampered kid when he was around. Every day after his loss I realized I am not a kid anymore. After completing my 12th, I started searching for part time jobs. I worked in an hospital as a computer operator and since then my struggle started. I scored moderate marks in 12th and was lucky enough to get admission in one of top engineering colleges in Nagpur. Since then I knew I have responsibility of my mom and brother and I just have to work hard to make things better at home. We had survived on Roti and Salt for years. Those were the days when we were unable to pay even electric bill and we had to survive on a candle light. This is when I sensed poverty at my home every day. We started providing tiffin services to working people. I used to help my mom in cooking food, my brother used to deliver them. Somehow I managed to live like this for four more years till final year. I got placed in a MNC and shifted to Pune. Things got better as I started earning. After working for 2years in Pune, I got an offer from an IT Company in Nagpur with a decent package. I accepted the offer as I wanted to stay with my family. My brother's condition is also improving now. Till now I have witnessed a lot of appreciation from people for being a responsible daughter. I stood up for my family every time and will always do. In this meantime, I realized I am just working hard to make things better not realising I have my own dreams. I want to do MS but I am afraid of the fact that I have to stop working and stay very far from my mom and brother. I feel they will be alone again and I don't want those poor days to come back again in our lives. This feeling of responsibility has made me strong enough to face the world but weak enough to leave my family alone. This scares me alot.

I know my father would be very proud of me. I miss him a lot when I see my friends with their fathers coming with them in every special moment. I feel lonely at times just because I have to do everything on my own like getting admission to college, shifting to Pune, boarding on a train alone and many more. I miss that fatherly support in my life when I needed him the most.

I just wish I could have spend some more time with him.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vl2tuw71rmfz6e0k', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am 25 years old girl from Nagpur.

I had to tell her that i did not sleep the last night and i am way too tired to even speak. But she was unmoved. I knew if i kept standing for the nest 90 minutes, i won’t be able to walk up to my home. BUT NO.

I had to give up my seat, everyone in the bus started staring, some nosy aunty said

“O bhaiya, aap itni der se toh baithe hai, usko seat de dijiye na, thak gayi hogi woh”

“O mister, you have the seat from a long time, give her that seat she must be TIRED”

I had no other option, i had to give my seat to that girl.

I kept standing for an hour and a half, I then i walked about a kilometre, to reach my home, and before you know it, i was asleep WITH MY DOOR OPEN FOR STRAIGHT 21 HOURS.

I was standing with the help of a pole nearby.\n\nThe bus arrived.\n\nI stepped into it.\n\nAnd luckily there were 3 empty seats.\n\nI just sat down and tried to control my sleep as i don’t want to miss my stop. My stop came 5 stops later. After 2 stops the bus got a little crowded. On the third stop, an old man approached me asking for a seat, he looked at my face and understood that i was not in a condition. a young man seated nearby stood up and gave his seat to the old man. We exchanged smiles.\n\nnow on the fourth stop, your typical “DELHI GIRL” enters.\n\nyou must have guessed by now what happens next.\n\nQid5a4x3yzlllabramkhaninshakalam\n\nShe asked me to vacate the seat. I gave that same look to that girl which i gave to the old man. but she won’t move. she was not a human, she was a cyborg.\n\nI had to tell her that i did not sleep the last night and i am way too tired to even speak. But she was unmoved. I knew if i kept standing for the nest 90 minutes, i won’t be able to walk up to my home. BUT NO.\n\nI had to give up my seat, everyone in the bus started staring, some nosy aunty said\n\n“O bhaiya, aap itni der se toh baithe hai, usko seat de dijiye na, thak gayi hogi woh”\n\n“O mister, you have the seat from a long time, give her that seat she must be TIRED”\n\nI had no other option, i had to give my seat to that girl.\n\nI kept standing for an hour and a half, I then i walked about a kilometre, to reach my home, and before you know it, i was asleep WITH MY DOOR OPEN FOR STRAIGHT 21 HOURS.\n\nI could not go to work the other day, BOSS screamed like hell.\n\nEven after waking up i was too tired for anything.\n\nMY BOSS AND THAT GIRL TOGETHER TOOK ME THROUGH HELL.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9999
Vidushi Gupta,Updated 6y,What is the best original romantic conversation you can write?,"*Five years of relationship. Both were settled in their life. Out on a dinner date for the fifth anniversary.

He- You booked the whole restaurant ?

She (mischeviously) - Nope. Probably no other person decided to come here this evening. Probably their food is bad.

He chuckles.

They both have dinner. Talks about random things. About orange bars, and chole bhature and black dogs, and selling pani-puri together in future. The waiter pours more wine after dinner.

He- Will you dance with me?

She (thoughtfully)- Let me think, I am wearing a saree, heels, am a terrible dancer. *Think some more* Definitely. (With a wide smile).

She take her heels off. They both start with naagin dance and then do some random steps. Then they settle down for slow dancing. She keeps her head on his chest.

He (his arms around her, his face on her head)- I love your perfume.

She (playfully) - I also love my perfume.

He smiles.

Just then, the projector starts playing a movie on the screen. A ten minute movie of their memories together. He is in awe of it. Five years of memories. Sweet, bitter, painful, lovely. The roller coaster ride. The smiles and the tears, the break ups and the patchups. The songs and the photos, the movie has it all. It ends. He turns around, pleasantly surprised on this lovely gift, and finds her sitting on her knees, in a red saree, with a ring in her hand, surrounded by the photographs he had taken over the years, her books, and some cookery books.

She - I can't promise to bring or buy stars for you, I am not that rich. But I can promise that together we will have two little stars of our own who'll make our life beautiful. I can't promise to be the best cook ever, but I can promise that together we will burn many chapatis. I can't promise that I will look stunning in every photograph you will take, but I can promise that I will always be beside you in each of them. I can't promise the world that I will write for it, but I can promise that you will wake up to my words every morning for the rest of your life. So Mr Handsome, will you marry me ?

He sits down on his knees too. Tears of joy in his eyes, a wide smile over his handsome face.

He- Shouldn't I be doing this ?

She (smilingly) - Stupid boy. Just say your signature hmm, acha, okay, vhi, Sahi hai. Just say yes, my knees are paining. Also I will make you wash this Saree. She pulls his nose.

He laughs out loud.

He- Yes, stupid girl, I will marry you !

They both kiss. The new chapter of their life had finally begun.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"So I completed my bachelors back in 2015 from one of the NIT's. I belong to a middle class family and I had a alcoholic father. After clearing AIEEE I thought my life would get better but life had planned something else for me. So after counselling for 2nd round was over I got a seat in NIT Surat(Civil).But my father refused to let me go. He said if you want to study you can study in the NIT which is my hometown otherwise he wont pay the fees. So I ended getting admitted in the NIT which was situated in my hometown.(which was not a bad option).

I started studying there but being a day scholar I had to witness his abuse and bad behaviour towards my mother everyday. Which took a toll on my mental health and for the first time in my life I failed. I tried to study more harder but to no avail.

This continued till second year and I somehow barely passed subjects. My morale was at an all time low and one day I had a panic attack while I was performing practicals in my department and I fainted. The profs called the heath center and an ambulance came to take me. I was brought back to consciousness but something strange happened. I was not able to speak no matter how much I tried. A psychiatrist was called who asked me to relax and after some breathing exercises I was able to speak again. I told the psychiatrist everything . He gave me a questionnaire and asked me to fill it up. After that he counseled me and told me that I have characteristics of pure OCD(obsessive compulsive disorder) and severe depression and I need to be treated. The medicines he gave me stopped my excessive thinking but my cognitive performance reduced even further and I needed more sleep.(the medicine contained sertraline hydrochloride). Because of this I flunked few subjects and my course got extended by one semester.

I could not sit for placements since I had one extra semester. Meanwhile all my batchmates got placed and started the happy phase of their life which I dreamt about. After I finished my degree I applied for jobs at various places but my academic record was so bad that most people never even called me for interviews, and few of them who called me asked me about my bad grades. When I told them the truth they were sympathetic about what I have been through but nobody offered me any job. My dad used to beat me because I was a failure and psychotic. After sometime I totally gave up on my life and I felt like I had no purpose. I had even stopped looking for jobs.

Since I had a lot of free time I started teaching kids in my colony for free. In the beginning parents were reluctant to send their kids because of my fathers behaviour but then a uncle asked me to teach his kids. Soon he could see improvement in his kids and asked others to send their kids too. I started teaching 10 kids and now parents paid me 500 rs per month for teaching them. My mother was very happy and literally cried in happiness when I gave her my salary of 5000 Rs. That was the best moment of my life and I could finally see some hope.

But my father learnt about me taking tuiton classes in his absence and said that you should stop this or I will throw both of you out of my house as I was ruining his reputation in society which was true to some extent. People used to make fun of me that I was a NIT graduate but I was still doing such a petty job. I stopped taking tutions and started studying chemistry which I liked since my JEE days. After 2 months of pouring myself into chemistry I went to a local coaching institute and was offered a job on trial basis. I had never taught so many kids at once so initially I got scared but after a few days I became comfortable.

After teaching 11th standard kids for over 1 year there at a meagre salary of 25k I wanted to leave the coaching. Now here comes the twist , the senior teacher who was supposed to teach 12th standard chemistry had a very monotonous way of teaching and my students didn't like it so they requested the owner to let me take their classes instead. The owner called me and told me the situation and offered to pay me 35k per month. I bargained with him since he was giving the senior teacher over a lakh rupees per month. He finally agreed at 60k per month and told me if my students cleared JEE mains he will give me bonus over and above my base salary. I was on cloud 7 that day.

I worked really hard after that and made my students work harder. And finally it paid off. My students got good ranks in Jee mains and advanced this year and I was paid 7 lakh as bonus recently.

I admitted my dad forcefully into a rehab program a few months ago and he has finally stopped drinking. He is not a bad guy but when he drinks alcohol he can't control himself and starts taking out his frustration over others.

My life is better now. I have everything that I could want from life. But it took patience and efforts. So believe in yourself and remember that “you haven't lost the battle if you can still stand”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vm0jltgzax4ipfck', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.5308, 'ai': 0.4692}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""So I completed my bachelors back in 2015 from one of the NIT's.

Next day he acted like nothing had happened. He was again the happy guy like he was. It has been few days since then. He never mentioned it again and I am afraid to ask about it. I feel I let him down when he needed me the most.

Awdhesh Singh,Updated 4y,What is some popular wrong advice that has been mistakenly considered good?,"The most popular wrong advice nowadays is: ‘Follow Your Passion’

‘Follow Your Passion’ is the most popular advice floating around. You would find many successful people speaking in favour of it. There are also many movies made on this subject nowadays all over the world.

The fact is that most people who follow their passion end up being a failure and lead a miserable life.

For every successful writer, there are thousands of unsuccessful and unknown writers
For every successful cricketer, there are several thousands who never make it to a national team
For every successful entrepreneur, there are hundreds of failed business ventures
For every successful filmstar, there are thousands who don’t progress beyond extras

However, no one talks about their failures but only talk about one in a million success stories.

Recently, a movie was released with the title ‘Secret Superstar’. This is a wonderful movie which is about following your passion. In this movie, the girl follows her passion of singing against the wishes to her father and ultimately succeeds. Millions of people around the world would be motivated to follow their passion after watching the movie, irrespective of their abilities and talents. They would not take into account the fact that the girl had immense talent in singing and she became a superstar by just one song uploaded on YouTube. Such successes are one in a million and yet these efforts bear fruits only if you have inborn talent.

I would also like to refer to another movie made by Aamir Khan with the title ‘Dangal’. This movie became a blockbuster all over the world. It is based on a real life story of a former wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat, who forcefully trained his young daughters Geeta and Babita in wrestling against their wishes. The girls had no passion for wrestling, but they had immense talent in it. Hence, even though they were actually forced into this profession against their wishes, they succeeded and later became national and international champions.

You must, therefore, follow your passion only in the area where you have some special talents.

Work on your skill. Sometimes great passion creates great work but sometimes great works create great passion and the consciously aroused passion in turn creates greater work. Moreover, know what passion actually means.

If you follow the passion in the area just because others are doing it, or that profession is highly valued or because you love doing it; without having any special talents in that area, you are most likely to fail.

You must first discover yourself before you dedicate your life for following your passion.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/htcsb37uzwfn5mir', 'title': 'What is some popular wrong advice that has been mistakenly considered good?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The most popular wrong advice nowadays is: ‘Follow Your Passion’\n\n‘Follow Your Passion’ is the most popular advice floating around.

Dhawal Barot,Updated 4y,Can you write a short story on silence?,"“Raj, where are you going?” Raj’s father asked.

“Office dad,” Raj answered.

“I heard in the news that the weather is not going to be good. Can’t you take a day off?” His father requested.

“I can’t, dad. I already took many leaves this month. Plus, the weather looks good to me.” Raj gazed out of the window and explained.

“Okay, at least, grab the raincoat son.” Raj’s father added.

“You’re impossible dad,” Raj said those words, but he took the raincoat with him.

He drove his bike for a few minutes and the rain started.

Raj was having the raincoat which helped him to reach his office safely without getting drenched.

He reached to his desk and texted, “Impossible dad, thanks. :p”

Years passed. Life played its games.

Raj woke up and opened the window. He found the weather was good. Thus, he got ready quickly.

He came out from his home, sat on his bike, put the helmet on his head and ignited the bike’s engine.

In ten minutes, out of blue, rain started.

He couldn’t stop the bike as he was running late for the office.

When he reached his office building, he was fully drenched.

He entered his office and sat on his desk. The AC was making him feel cold. Thus, he turned it off. He put out his wallet, hankie, and mobile on the desk.

While taking out the wallet, the wallet opened and he found his father’s photo inside the wallet.

He took the wallet in his hand, looked at his father’s photo for five seconds and smiled. He didn’t utter any word.

The silence of those five seconds had a story.

Rahul Sinha,8y,What are some short stories where you don't know whether to laugh or cry?,"Our 14 year old dog, Abbey, died last month. The day after she died, my 4 year old daughter Meredith was crying and talking about how much she missed Abbey.


She asked if we could write a letter to God so that when Abbey got to heaven, God would recognize her. I told her that I thought we could, so she dictated these words:

""Dear God,

Will you please take care of my dog? She died yesterday and is with you in heaven. I miss her very much. I am happy that you let me have her as my dog even though she got sick.

I hope you will play with her. She likes to play with balls and to swim. I am sending a picture of her so when you see her, You will know that she is my dog. I really miss her.

Love, Meredith.""



We put the letter in an envelope with a picture of Abbey and Meredith, and addressed it to God/Heaven. We put our return address on it.
Then Meredith pasted several stamps on the front of the envelope because she said it would take lots of stamps to get the letter all the way to heaven. That afternoon she dropped it into the letter box at the post office.
A few days later, she asked if God had gotten the letter yet. I told her that I thought He had.
Yesterday, there was a package wrapped in gold paper on our front porch addressed, ""To Meredith"" in an unfamiliar hand writing. Meredith opened it.
Inside was a book by Mr. Rogers called, ""When a Pet Dies"". Taped to the inside front cover was the letter we had written to God in its opened envelope.
On the opposite page was the picture of Abbey & Meredith and this note:

""Dear Meredith,

Abbey arrived safely in heaven.

Having the picture was a big help. I recognized Abbey right away. Abbey isn't sick anymore. Her spirit is here with me just like it stays in your heart.
Abbey loved being your dog.

Since we don't need our bodies in heaven, I don't have any pockets to keep your picture in, so I am sending it back to you in this little book for you to keep and have something to remember Abbey by.

Thank you for the beautiful letter and thank your mother for helping you write it and sending it to me. What a wonderful mother you have. I picked her especially for you.

I send my blessings every day and remember that I love you very much.
By the way, I'm easy to find, I am wherever there is love.

Love, God""

Dhawal Barot,6y,What is a story within 500 words on the theme of 'ignorance and waiting in love'?,"“Sorry, I don’t think things will work anymore between us. I can’t oppose my family.” The girl whatsapped.

The boy read it and replied, “Can we meet for the last time?”

“No.” The girl replied without giving it a second thought.

“Please?” The boy requested.

“Alright. It’s the last time. See you at the Brew cafe at 7 p.m.” Girl typed and pressed send.

The boy knew that brew cafe was the place where they had their first date. But, he avoided further thoughts and just answered, “Okay. I will be there.”

The boy reached the place at 6.30 p.m. He didn’t order anything, but walked near the waiter and gave him 500 INR to not disturb him on the table for that evening.

He chose the last table in the corner in silence and had a seat there. So many things were running through his mind. Time was running very slowly for him. Every tick-tack of his watch was killing him. Nervousness was besetting him slowly-slowly.

The clock showed that it was 7 p.m. He quickly looked at the entrance. He stood up and looked outside the door. The face he was looking for wasn’t visible so far. He got worried. He dialed a number but cut the call before it connected. He thought to wait.

The clock was running. He started hating time. The clock showed 7:30, 8, and 8:30 p.m. Loveless time was doing its duty very well. The time was passing. He felt himself like a silence in the city of voices.

Finally, he made a call to the last number he dialed. But, the number was unreachable. He understood the rest. A tear dropped on the clock. He took out the clock which was a gift from her, dropped it on the table. Somewhere inside his heart, all he knew that he just wanted to see her the last time, for the rest of his life.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"You know, that kind of girl who isn't the most pretty one or the sexiest but is still sooo damn attractive that you don't want to look away?

The first time I saw her at orientation class, she looked like she came to class straight from bed. She had sneaked into the hall but then caught the eyes of professor, she was called on stage. She flirted in the most subtle way you would imagine, everyone in the hall was enjoying their que-ans round? Her interrogation? Needless to say, she became popular.

I knew she was someone I wanted to get to know, but so did, rest of the college. Her reputation builded up as one of the ‘hard to get chicks'. She was, still is so private about her life, even though she has accounts everywhere you wouldn't figure out what she does, where she goes, who she hangs out with, nothing!

Someone, one of the guys, got so damn curious that he hacked into her account. Half of the hostel was there, but nothing except some quickly ended conversations. (He later did apologise.)

College was about to end, exams, things were getting stressful, I had given up the thoughts of going out with her and even friendship. She kept everyone at arm's length. She didn't even mix up with girls. She was friendly yet cold, rude yet sweet, I don't know how to explain how she was exactly while we were strangers, but if there was some grey area where you could place someone's personality, she would fall in the greyest place. Okay, yeah, exams were coming and I was staying in library all the time. She happened to seat next to me and started talking, I couldn't figure out whether she was talking to herself or me but I wanted to say something. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to say something funny to the context or something intelligent, what I blurted out instead was ‘ummm'. Inside my head, I was like dude, you're so cool, I don't know why.

She was like, am I disturbing you? ‘No, how about we grab some coffee and talk? We can talk freely.’ She said yes right away. I was like, ‘hard to go out with'? What? (She did go out with 2 guys, things didn't turn serious)

We were talking about this and that when she blurred out, hey, I'm hungry, lets go … place, my treat. I was like, yaaaaaaaay! Why would I say no?

Before I could even realize it, we were hanging out daily. We became friends, but still I knew almost nothing about her. I was expecting something mysterious but she was just a normal person, with normal background, nothing out of place, except HER.

She always seemed out of place.

I wanted to know if I was something else other than a friend to her but I was scared if she'll grow distant afterwards. There were rumors everywhere. She was teased with my name everywhere, she would turn deaf to them. I too did the same.

It had already been 1 year of us being the way we were and 5 years of crush from my side. I did go out with other girls in my college days, had some flings, but she never left my mind.

I wanted more but I was getting more hopeless. I did build up some courage and asked her to hangout at my place. (by that time,we were comfortable enough to show up at the others place unannounced.) She came in as usual, I thought I would confess , let her know how much she means to me, before I could even utter a single word, she kissed me gently and told me, (something along these lines)

‘I love you too. I know you've liked me for a long time. I think for me it was when you had that fever and you looked at me with those puppy eyes, or the time you were praying for me, I'm hopelessly in love with you, my impossible fucktard, I love you too.’

I had never realized it until then, that she can tell what's going on in my mind.

I was about to cry then she kissed me again. Rest of the evening is blur. It felt like a dream. I might have asked her to pinch me,maybe a little more than 100 times that evening.

I love her. And, she loves me too. My life is like a fairytale right now. Even when things are not working out, I tell myself, dude, she loves you too, everything feels perfect then.

P.S. We might be, might be, getting married by the end of this year. :)

Ayush Atreya,7mo,Can you write something dark and deep?,"Once I was watching an interview of shahrukh khan.

The interviewer asked him something about his struggles or how he reached where he is right now.

His reply struck to me so hard that I remember his exact wording till date.

If I say you that whatever I achieved, is because of my hardwork. I am either making a fool of you or of myself. Definitely, I worked hard.

But Much much more than my hardwork, these three thing played a major role. Being at the right place, with right people and at the right time.

Perhaps many won't agree with him. But we all know that there are thousands of people who are much more talented, smart. They are still roaming in mumbai with portfolio in thier hand or doing small work in serials.

So the question is, what exactly decides one's success?

Many successful people will say that they succeed just on their hardwork and persistence and whatnot. Deep down we all know there is something that is not in our control.

Perhaps that's what people call LUCK.

Alex Johnston,Updated 11mo,Does it make me homophobic to write a failing gay relationship in my novel?,"No.

What would be homophobic would be if you wrote it like this:

‘Gary, I… I think we should break up.’

‘But, Lance!’ Gary sat up, his eyes wide with alarm. ‘Why? I thought we were so happy!’

‘I did too, Gary,’ Lance said, sitting on the edge of the sofa where Gary sat, and looking sorrowfully at the floor. ‘I really did. But I’ve come to believe that… in the long run, we can’t ever be happy.’

‘Why not?’ Gary said, his face pale.

‘Because we’re gay, Gary,’ Lance said, raising his eyes to Gary’s and speaking in a soft, level voice. ‘We’re gay. And we both know that, well… that that’s just plain wrong. We might kid ourselves that we’re happy, but we’ll always know, deep down, that it’s just wrong to be gay. After all, it says so in the Bible.’

‘M-my God, Lance,’ Gary said, wonderingly. ‘You’re right. For all that we love each other and apparently make each other happy, our basic wrongness will always be there, won’t it.’

‘It sure will,’ Lance said.

Gary slumped back in his chair.

‘Aw, hell,’ he said. ‘Why did I have to be one of the gays? Why did God make us like this? Why couldn’t I have been straight, and married Debbie?’

‘God didn’t make you like that, Gary,’ Lance gently pointed out. ‘You decided to be one of the gays, when we had hot butt sex that night in your garage.’

‘Oh yeah,’ Gary said. ‘I did, didn’t I.’

‘Never mind,’ Lance said. ‘We’ve made our mistakes, and I’m sure that if we work hard we can become straight again, like God meant us to be. I’ve already bought a hat.’

Lance pulled a cap out of his pocket: a dark green feed cap. He put it on his head. It said on the front in large silver letters, GAY IS WRONG.

‘Wow,’ Gary said. ‘Cool hat.’

‘Thanks, man,’ Lance said. ‘I think if you get one too, and we wear them regularly, we’ll be okay.’

‘I sure hope so, buddy,’ Gary said, and he instinctively reached out to clutch Lance’s hand for support.

‘Uh, no touchsies, Gar,’ Lance said, standing up and backing sharply away from the sofa.

‘Sorry.’

Just don’t write it like that, in any way.

Edit: It has come to my attention that some people think that this is an actual book, or that it was a sincere attempt on my part to write an unintentionally homophobic piece of quality fiction.

Oh my God yes. In fact, please do.

I’m serious. I would strongly encourage people who haven’t read Tolkien to write novels based on elves.

Don’t misunderstand me, Tolkien is brilliant. The Silmarillion is one of my favorite books.

But the problem is, he’s a bit too brilliant. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have cast a very long shadow over the landscape of fantasy, and as a result, it’s almost impossible for novels about elves not to feel derivative.

Sean Kernan,Updated 5y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"Your name is Robert.

You’ve been working for 10 years as an accountant. Your hard work and sleepless nights have finally paid off: last week you landed the promotion you’ve been seeking for all these years.

Two days ago, you took your daughter to school for the first time. You tried not to get emotional. You summoned all of your manliest thoughts, but failed to defeat the feels-onslaught of a 5-year-old walking, with her Spongebob backpack, to class for the first time.

The next day, you got a call from your mother. She is sick; they’ve found “something” in a recent scan. It has you thinking and worried around the clock. It’s the first time one of your parents has gotten sick, and it has you reflecting a lot on your own mortality and the time you have with your parents and your daughter.

You’ve experienced a whirlwind of emotions: joy, sadness and fear.

And now here you are, in anticipation, walking to your office in the downtown New York, for your first day as a manager.

On the sidewalk walking towards you is a stranger.

Now you are the stranger.

You are looking at Robert. You know nothing about Robert or any of his trials and tribulations. To you, he is just another stranger who appears deep in thought.

This is everyday life. You are surrounded by people with complex thoughts, feelings, emotions, who are in the middle of a long journey of their own.

So be nice and try not to judge. Every stranger is on a unique high or low of that journey.

Anonymous,Updated 4y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"Warning: Extremely Emotional phase.

I was living a normal student life till yesterday evening. I’m having my final exams next week and this is the Crucial time for me to study and I’m sensible enough to understand that.

My mom has been having few problems since the last 2–3 years. Upon asking her to go to the doctor, She used to ignore it by saying they’re just hormonal problems.

last month by my convincing on seeing her condition, She got her hormonal tests.

The results came and show extremely high level of hormonal problems. So she went to the gynaecologist yesterday evening.

i was waiting for her but she didn’t return back by 3 hours.

I knew something was wrong. I called her and she didn’t respond. I got extremely worried.

I’m not an emotional person yet the only person I am attached to , in my life is my mom.

I had a very bad intuition If she got into an accident or something bad happened with the reports conclusion.She came back in about half an hour and she just told me that another test has to be done for uterus size and diabetes and it’s gonna be fine and she went to my dad. They never closed the door while talking but they did yesterday.

I went and directly checked the reports.

What I read was life shattering for me. My entire life came down. She had been advised for a test named Pap smear test and being a dental student, I knew what it’s for. But still I went with tears in my eyes and went near to the room where My mom was telling that doctor has a doubt on her having Cancer and Pap smear test has to be done and they didn’t want me to know. I directly went to the bathroom and cried so much for the first time in my life. I opened the tap so that they couldn’t hear to my wails in the noise of the water from the tap. I went to her in the kitchen where I could see from her face that’s she’s not in a good mood, but she still smiled on seeing me.

I knew she was crying and so was my heart. Whenever I saw her face, I just recollected all the times I was angry with her or even raised my voice. I started assuming if she dies, what would I do, I’d constantly cry looking at her face, but I didn’t want her to know that I know about what she’s been hiding from me. I went to my room and cried my heart out again. I couldn’t imagine my life without her. I just imagined her lying with eyes. Closed and my heart froze with fear, I couldn’t study yesterday night. I didn’t have dinner yesterday. Upon been asked by mom for dinner, I told her I had food when she had gone out and I need to study for exams and she understood coz I’ve been studying a lot recently for my exams.

I literally wasn’t hungry at all even without having food for the first time. My emotions had eaten my hunger. I’m not a type of guy who cries even at something extremely emotional moment of someone else’s life, but I realized what my weakness was. It is my mom. I cannot imagine my life without her. I’m still crying while typing this out. I can’t wait for the reports showing negative in the tests, I’ve been praying to god a lot for her not getting any problem. My family is thinking I’m praying for my exams to pass coz they’ve even disclosed about the doubt with my sister and not me, Coz I’m the youngest of my family and so closest to my mom. I hope no mother in this entire world gets cancer or any other problem. This 1 day has been the longest and the most emotional time of my life which I cannot even share with anyone.

Edit :

Thank you so much everyone. Her reports have come and they show seedling uterine fibroids which are non cancerous. I really feel blessed to be a part of Quora where so many people show concern and are supportive despite being absolute strangers. I can finally concentrate on my studies for my final exams and I promise to be the best son to my mom that no problem even touches her. Thanks a lot again everyone.

Dhawal Barot,Updated 5y,What are some short stories on the theme save the girl-child?,"“So, how was the life on earth?” God asked.

The old couple who was standing together answered, “The life was good. We thank you for giving us everything. But, there was a bad phase, which ruined our old age days.”

“Which was it?” God asked.

“Our son who moved us out from our home, God. I mean, everyone from our friends circle was blessed with a good son who took care of them. But, our son made us spend our last days in an old age home. Why didn’t you give us a son like Shravan
.” The old man asked.

God smiled and answered, “Shravan? I did give you. In fact, I gave you someone who was more caring than Shravan.”

“What?” The old man questioned.

“Yes. I blessed you with a baby girl who could serve you more than any Shravan. But, all that you both needed was a boy. That’s why you killed her in the womb.”

The old couple was awestruck. They weren’t able to speak anything. Suddenly, the spark light came from the face of the God and the man who was old woke up and found himself in bed. He realized that he was not old, but young enough. It was just a dream.

He woke up from the bed and started following his routine life.

After two hours, his wife asked, “When are we going to the hospital today?”

Her husband looked at her, and just said, “No. We’re not going to abort her.

During campus placements, I got placed in Cognizant, but 7 months had passed and Cognizant did not mail any call letter.

I decided to attend an off-campus interview being conducted by Airtel to recruit GETs ( Graduate Engineer Trainees). Being a core company for ECE, I put efforts and I got selected and called for training along with other 40 selected candidates to their Airtel NOC, Manesar, Gurgaon. The training went on for 3 months and then I was assigned a department. After 4 months, Airtel abruptly fires all the newly joined GETs, citing revenue loss due to the Jio’s popularity. I was not even given an experience certificate because they said that for getting an experience certificate from the company, one has to serve for at least 1 year. I was in shock, not able to realize what had happened. I was jobless without any experience letter! I reached home and started searching for companies for openings for freshers. I was struck down by the fact that nearly all good companies were now hiring freshers of batch 2017 and if you passed in 2016, you were required to show the experience letter. This provision kicked me out of almost 95% of the interviews of good companies for B.tech ECE profile. The interview calls which I got and am getting are of call centers, sales representative and delivery boy. Dejected, I started my preparations for govt exams and defense exams.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I feel so exhausted.

I married when i was 25, December of 2013. Immediately I got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy the year after that. Being a mother is the best thing that ever happened to me... Some time around the second year of my son, my husband told me that he noticed something different and odd about our child. He said that he seemed to be detached from the world and not making eye contact when being talked to. My husband had a cousin who was diagnosed with autism when he was three and my husband suggested that we should get our son checked. I refused a few times and even lead to arguments everytime the subject was being brought out.

I was sceptic for quite long until i noticed that my son stopped talking. He can already speak a few words when i noticed he just stopped. All he did was create a humming sound over and over. It was that moment when i agreed to take him to a developmental pedia. He was then diagnosed with ASD (autism spectrum disorder).

Now he's 4, he's in a constant occupational and speech therapy. He's making progress somehow.. But sometimes i feel like it's taking him a long time to cope. He talks now, but most of his words are only understood by him and himself alone. I know it would be strange if i'll say that I'm actually happy with that,.. Well i've seen him really quiet not even babbling so hearing his voice even when i can't understand what he's saying is really a big thing for me. There are a few times when he speaks ""mama"" mostly when he's upset and complaining .. It makes me think that he wants me to console him.

The struggle is this, I'm working and i wouldn't want to sacrifice my career to be a stay at home mom. Sometimes i feel guilty about it but other than not wanting to let go of my career is only one issue why i need to keep my job. Another important thing is that his expenses with the therapy he's having involves an ample amount of money. If I would stop working we could still survive but might run out short for other more expenses we need.

My husband and I worked out our schedules, to make sure that when one is out, one is home to stay with our child. He works in the morning shift and i work on the night shift. We can't really hire someone who can watch over our son because he can't talk yet and he won't be able to tell us if ever abuse is going on when we're out of the house to work. We don't want to risk that.. His safety and wellbeing are the things we always keep in mind.

The reason why I feel exhausted is that part where i have to be constantly strong all through out. I go home late, sleep late and wake up early, not having my husband around because he's already off to work around 6 in the morning. I cook my son pancakes then get him ready for his therapy after he's done eating.. After therapy, we'll go home and i'll prepare for work.. By then my husband comes home and i'll leave.

It's that way for 2 years now... And another matter i have to take care of this year is my son going to school, another time to squeeze in on my hectic schedule. How can i handle all of this.. I feel so tired.. But i love seeing my son happy.. I love laughing with him and playing with him, i don't want to go back to the days when i kept calling his name but it seems like i'm talking to a wall. I want to be a good mom i want my son to be all well.. I want everything good to happen and i hate myself for being exhausted.

I'm not frustrated with my son's situation, i know he can cope, he just needs time. I don't even care how long it would take, I happen to rejoice and celebrate even at the slightest progress he makes. Just recently i tought him how to count with his fingers up to five. I'm the one who counts through my mouth and he follows through his fingers and we clap our hands after. Parents with normal children would think of that as lame for a 4 year old, well i don't really care, my son is learning and that's all that matters to me.

I'm thankful to have stumbled on this question while I'm browsing quora, it's amazing how my mood changed after composing the paragraphs above. Today was one of those days when i wanted to cry all my heart out hoping it would lessen the tiredness i feel.. Everytime i talk to my husband when i'm having low days like this, he would always ask me to strengthen my patience and understanding to a higher level, he would say that no one will be here for our son but us so if we'll start giving up on him that means we're giving up on his life and future. That would shake me and make me 30% stronger everytime it happens.

I tried talking to other people or reading books about autism but they tend to frustrate me more than help me figure things out. When i tell people about my son's condition they don't really say things that could help, they would just say things like maybe I'm spoiling him too much that's why he's always dependent on me. I wish they'd understand, but on the later i started caring less of what others are thinking. I'm proud of my son and always looking forward to what kind of brilliance he'll be in the future.

On my part, I've learned to pick the right books to read, books that would give hope rather comparison of my son's progress from other cases of children with autism.

Although I read books about autism, my shelf is not always about that subject, only one out of 10 books. I keep my self sane from not brooding over ""autism"". My reading involves a lot of history, philosophy and science. I guess it helps with the balance i need mentally. As much as possible i don't want to raise my son as someone with autism but someone as normal as everybody else.

This is my son when I first saw him.. He was a big baby 3.2 kg.

This is him now.. He smiles for the camera when he’s in the mood…

Immediately I got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy the year after that. Being a mother is the best thing that ever happened to me... Some time around the second year of my son, my husband told me that he noticed something different and odd about our child. He said that he seemed to be detached from the world and not making eye contact when being talked to. My husband had a cousin who was diagnosed with autism when he was three and my husband suggested that we should get our son checked. I refused a few times and even lead to arguments everytime the subject was being brought out.\n\nI was sceptic for quite long until i noticed that my son stopped talking. He can already speak a few words when i noticed he just stopped. All he did was create a humming sound over and over. It was that moment when i agreed to take him to a developmental pedia. He was then diagnosed with ASD (autism spectrum disorder).\n\nNow he\'s 4, he\'s in a constant occupational and speech therapy. He\'s making progress somehow.. But sometimes i feel like it\'s taking him a long time to cope. He talks now, but most of his words are only understood by him and himself alone. I know it would be strange if i\'ll say that I\'m actually happy with that,.. Well i\'ve seen him really quiet not even babbling so hearing his voice even when i can\'t understand what he\'s saying is really a big thing for me. There are a few times when he speaks ""mama"" mostly when he\'s upset and complaining ..

Rakshith Akira,Updated 5y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"Scene#1

Rakshith was working as a software engineer in Bangalore. He's very punctual and dedicated towards his work.

One fine day, at 9:30 AM he was heading towards the office. That day was so important and hectic because he had his project deadline. He should deliver his project to UK clients at any cost that day. A project worth £5,00,000. When he was on the way, He called to his boss,

Prateek Mishra: Yes Rakshith.

Rakshith: I can't turn up to the office today.

Prateek Mishra: Wtf! Are you fucking kidding man? You know we should deliver the project to clients. Do you know the value of that project? It's £5, 00,000.

Rakshith: Yes, I know but I have stuck in something more important than that.

Prateek Mishra: I will make sure you will be fired soon.

Rakshith: I don't mind.

Prateek Mishra: You will face the consequences soon.

What happened to him? Why couldn't he turn up to office? When he was driving to office what made him to took a leave?

Will let you know soon.

Scene#2

There was an accident on the road. No one was ready to help that mother and her little angel.

Honda Activa met with an accident with Hyundai i20. That mother and her little angel were sunken in the blood pool.

That mother was dropping her little angel in school on a 2 wheeler, but suddenly they met with a brutal accident by a car. The owner/driver of the car didn't even step out to look what happened to mother and the daughter. He just escaped in a jiffy. Probably, he might be scared to handle the legal issues. Some old guy who was smoking a cigarette in a small tea stall which was nearby noted car number.

Even though the government has ordered, publicized and made the advertisement for people awareness no one was turning up that day to help that mother and daughter.

On what did the government issue an order?

“Reporting a road accident to police or taking a victim to the hospital will no longer be a harrowing experience for good Samaritans.”

Scene#3

Rakshith was also there in that crowd. He called the ambulance, but he was sure that in India pizza comes faster than an ambulance.

So, after a couple of calls and thoughts, he decided to help the duo. He took both of them into his newly bought car. His interior decorated again with the pool of blood.

While driving, he received a mail. It was from his employer, Prateek Mishra. Prateek Mishra sent a termination letter to Rakshith.

Rakshith was least bothered about that mail at that moment.

Scene#4

Blood pooled mother and daughter were taken to the operation theater. Rakshith was caught by hospital inquiry team. He started searching for an address in the ID card/ phone number of that little angel who met with the accident, so that he can inform her guardians.

Scene#5

At last, Rakshith found the address and phone number. He called to the number which was on ID card. Someone picked up the call on the other end.

That number he took from ID card belonged to Prateek Mishra.

So, that little angel is Prateek Mishra's daughter!

Aditi Mishra.P, daughter of Prateek Mishra.

P for Prateek.

He called back to his employer Prateek Mishra.

Prateek Mishra: I knew it, you lower middle-class people should come back to us to beg job. You know what, I already fired you, check your mail for the termination letter. I know you called me to apologize, but I don't need your fucking sorry Mr.

Rakshith: Sir, it's not the time for proving who is great. I have a bad news for you. Your wife and daughter met with an accident. Please come quickly to the hospital.

Scene#6

Prateek Mishra entered the hospital. Rakshith was sitting at the main entrance lobby. They both exchanged the gaze. Prateek couldn't gaze into Rakshith's eye. He felt shameless for his act in the morning.

The doctor came out from operation theatre.

Mr. Mishra rushed towards the doctor and begged the doctor to save his daughter and wife.

The doctor said that typical dialogue “We are trying our best, rest is up to God.”

After 2 hours of hectic operation, doctor came out and said to Mr. Mishra “ No need to worry, operation is successful. Both of them need six months of rest.”

Mishra with the great move said, “thank you, doctor.” and hugged.

Doctor in turn, said “There is no need to thank me. Thank that fellow sitting on the couch of front lobby. If he wouldn't have brought them on time, we could do nothing .”

Rakshith was observing all this from the main entrance lobby. He made sure that daughter and mother were alive and went back to parking slot.

He took out his car and drove off.

Mishra and Shetty never spoke in that 2 hour span in the hospital. Mishra didn't approach Rakshith because of guilt.

Scene#7

It's been 2 years, still Mishra is in search of Rakshith.

Rakshith's number is in switched off mode from past 2 years. He left his room. Mishra tried but couldn't find his whereabouts.

Even today Mishra tries to call Rakshith twice a day to thank him and apologize for his act, but the sweet voice on the other end says “The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off. Please try again later.”

THE END!

I know, I have abruptly ended the story. It's an open-ended climax. The judgment is left to readers. I know Questions are flooding your mind.

Why Rakshith left unnoticed?
Why he left?
What happened to that £5, 00,000 project?
Has humanity won over money that day?
Where is Rakshith now and what happened to him?

Some or the other day, You could be Mr. Mishra or Mr. Rakshith. Never speak without knowing person circumstances. We play according to circumstances rhythm.

Plot twist which makes you lost in thoughts

Probably, Mr. Mishra was right.

Just because he was so ethical and dedicated to his work. He used to sleep on footpath and had a hunger stomach in the past. £5,00,000 project was a lot to him. So, Mishra knew the value of money. He turned from rags to riches. So out of furiousness he terminated Mr. Rakshith.

Probably, Rakshith was right too. Just because he knew much about humanity. He lost his mother in accident so he might know the pain of losing a person and took a leave on D-day. So, out of furiousness he ignored Mr. Mishra.

We can't judge who is right and who is wrong. Just do what is more important to you. Never bother about Someone or something.

Person never move but circumstances make him to.

Both of them need six months of rest.”\n\nMishra with the great move said, “thank you, doctor.” and hugged.\n\nDoctor in turn, said “There is no need to thank me. Thank that fellow sitting on the couch of front lobby. If he wouldn't have brought them on time, we could do nothing .”\n\nRakshith was observing all this from the main entrance lobby. He made sure that daughter and mother were alive and went back to parking slot.\n\nHe took out his car and drove off.\n\nMishra and Shetty never spoke in that 2 hour span in the hospital. Mishra didn't approach Rakshith because of guilt.\n\nScene#7\n\nIt's been 2 years, still Mishra is in search of Rakshith.\n\nRakshith's number is in switched off mode from past 2 years. He left his room. Mishra tried but couldn't find his whereabouts.\n\nEven today Mishra tries to call Rakshith twice a day to thank him and apologize for his act, but the sweet voice on the other end says “The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off. Please try again later.”\n\nTHE END!\n\nI know, I have abruptly ended the story. It's an open-ended climax. The judgment is left to readers. I know Questions are flooding your mind.\n\nWhy Rakshith left unnoticed?\nWhy he left?\nWhat happened to that £5, 00,000 project?\nHas humanity won over money that day?\nWhere is Rakshith now and what happened to him?\n\nSome or the other day, You could be Mr. Mishra or Mr. Rakshith. Never speak without knowing person circumstances. We play according to circumstances rhythm.\n\nPlot twist which makes you lost in thoughts\n\nProbably, Mr. Mishra was right.\n\nJust because he was so ethical and dedicated to his work. He used to sleep on footpath and had a hunger stomach in the past. £5,00,000 project was a lot to him. So, Mishra knew the value of money. He turned from rags to riches. So out of furiousness he terminated Mr. Rakshith.\n\nProbably, Rakshith was right too. Just because he knew much about humanity. He lost his mother in accident so he might know the pain of losing a person and took a leave on D-day. So, out of furiousness he ignored Mr. Mishra.\n\nWe can't judge who is right and who is wrong. Just do what is more important to you. Never bother about Someone or something.\n\nPerson never move but circumstances make him to.\n\nImage Soure: Google Images\n\n(Your little appreciation and honest feedback makes me write even more. A person who feels appreciated will always do more than expected.)\n\nThanks for reading, Yours,\n\nRakshith Akira ✍"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.88476666666667
Dhawal Barot,7y,What is the best short war story you can come up with?,"Khan was injured and alone. Everyone from his team died with gunshots in that war. He lost his gun while doing the fight. But somehow, he managed to enter inside the building.

As he was gunless and injured, he left with the last option to blast the bomb. He thanked God and his country for everything. Finally, he pressed the self blast button and the building blasted with many lives.

The next day, newspaper headlines drafted. They were,

Khan Strikes Again. India Beat Pakistan.

'Zak is Back' - The left-arm paceman took five wickets to give Indian side a great start. Certainly, his tremendous bowling attack was unanswerable.

Adarsh Gupta,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"She cried on my shoulder for him and I was hiding ocean in my eyes consoling her.
I always wanted to be her Ron Weasley but I ended up being her Harry Potter.
We were really close just like two words in a same page. But she separated by a “full stop” so nobody read us together.
If there was a notification displaying the number of times who has viewed your DP, I would have topped it.
I was never in a relationship; I was only mistaken to be taken.
Fake people are easily accepted while the true ones are often misunderstood.
You finally came back not because “I needed you” but because “You needed someone”.
Us-
Then: How should I start a conversation?
Now: Why should I start a conversation?
In a hurry to identify the ones who “likes her”, she surely lost the one who “loved her”.
The problem is I always wanted to share every bit of my feelings I have for you while you were never in a mood to understand them.
We all are in search of someone who knows that we don’t want to leave when we say we want to.
From ignoring everyone else just to be available to one; To being available for everyone else just to forget the one, I learned a lot.
It started with “No sorry, no thank you in friendship”and ended with “Sorry for everything I did and thanks for everything you did”.
I could hardly love anyone now coz someone once said to me “I love you and will be with you no matter what” and then left forever.

Gayathri Ramesh,4y,Can you share a romantic/sad short story?,"‘He's crazy’, uttered the warden as he trespassed the wall separating our girls hostel and canteen. I gave out a squeaky laughter seeing the weird face he made looking at me, while I continued to provoke him using my ‘weird face making’ abilities and managed to drive him nuts.

I got ready, perfectly plaited my hair, put on that microscopic bindi and finally gave a pink gloss to my lips and walked to the school.

Knowingly or unknowingly, I don't know, but my eyes were searching for that familiar envisage who had been my best buddy for a whopping 14 years.

Suddenly my eyes stopped moving, pondering upon the tiny details of that eyes, yes the same eyes, that always makes me forget all my worries and miseries.

My cheeks curved, to make the most beautiful smile I could ever give, while my legs, even without my own coordination moved towards him.

‘You brought my record right?’, I yelled at him.

He pretended to be absorbed in fidgeting his Keychain, while I continued throwing my question daggers.

‘This is totally unfair, you do this every time, oh my God, Neela mam would kill me today. And listen, I will never give you my record again.’

My eyes welled up, thinking about loosing the ‘Topper’ tag, while he suddenly pulled my hair and said,

‘Miss drama queen, if your lecture is over let me tell you something, I already submitted both our records, after drawing the picture of the cockroach that you left out.’

I tried to cover up my embarrassing self by patting his shoulder while seriously hardworking to put up a cute face.

Interval times are the best part of the day, with the corridors buzzing with gossips, smell of home made snacks and the book and paper ball cricket matches of our fellow buddies.

‘Won't you be there for the match?’, he asked while eating those crispy pakodas from my hello kitty lunchbox.

‘Nope da, I have some works to complete, trust me I'll be sitting in the front row of the gallery, shouting your name, for the finals. So let me take a rain check today’, I uttered while he was imitating me.

‘Come on yaar, you already know you are my lucky charm, please stay back’.

That sounded innocent enough to change my fickle minded self.

‘Where's the match?’, I asked.

‘You just come to our basketball court, we'll together go, come sharp at 4.30 just after the extra classes’

I nodded.

The day went by just like any other boring school day.

The sky was all darkening. The kids were already busy making paper boats to float in the puddle.

I rushed to our basketball court. Even from the distance I could perfectly distinguish his silhouette from all those who were standing there.

‘The match is canceled, just the way you wished’, said him while he absent mindedly took those heavy books from my hands.

I unknowingly smiled seeing this gesture realizing how much he cared for me.

‘All right, so let me give you a special chai treat. ’

As the rain drops fell down one by one, he took my hands in his and hurried towards the tea stall. We got in and ordered our cup of teas and samoosas.

(Pic_credit:Pinterest)

We munched them on, sipping the spicy chai, splashing rain drops on each other and gossiping about the school stuffs.

And then we parted, but even now the sparkle of his smile is beaming in my heart.

Am I falling in love with him?

Good night diary”

I hurried from the kitchen hearing a roar of laughter from the bedroom. There he was standing, holding my most precious possession, my diary, that he sneaked from my cupboard while we were cleaning it the morning.

‘This is totally unfair, how dare you sneak into someone else's privacy, you are a bad person’, I shouted, and ran behind him to snatch it back. And he pulled me into his arms and said,

‘Oh Miss Drama queen, I mean Mrs, what is the problem even if I read that, most importantly when someone had written the whole thing describing the love for me’.

My cheeks were glowing just like the red tint on an over ripen cherry.

‘I know that all I did these years was just pulling your leg every time, even during our childhood, teenage and still after our marriage. And you know, that I'm the worst in expressing things. But let me tell you today, Apu, thanks for being there for me. I can't imagine a day without you. I love you so much.’

I could see tears in his eyes, while he said those words. We hugged, we cried, expressing the unsatiated love we had for each other.

We stood by the window, in each other's arms, feeling the cold drops of rain. I continued to blabber our old stories while he listened with the same sparkling smile.

Sean Kernan,2y,Does writing improve your thinking?,"It teaches you to consider more variables.

Everything about writing is achieving balance. I often think about sentences and ideas as sandwiched between two poles:

Confidence vs arrogance

Specific detail vs excess information

Logical flow vs being too predictable

Being original vs trying too hard to be original

Balancing complexity with simplicity

It’s a very analytical craft. This is what editing is all about. Catching typos is only 10% of the editing process.

And as you go out into the world, you catch yourself being more analytical and thoughtful about your conversations, ideas, and reflections on your own life.

Sean Kernan,2y,What is the secret to hitting your writing goals?,"The secret applies to essentially any goal: incrementality.

Divide the goal up into subgoals so you can feel like you're moving.

I’m starting my third year as a professional writer. But I’d been writing for years before that and did it each day. I set small goals and got excited about them, even if they were stupid things like getting 100 or 1000 followers.

Anything that gets you motivated towards your goal is a worthy source of motivation. You don’t have to tell anyone about it. You can use a secret rivalry as a way to push yourself. You can set candy rewards. As with anything in your imagination, there are no rules.

When I quit my job in my first year, my goal was just to prove that I could make a full-time living at writing and stay out of the cubicle (this part will never change). Writing in a competitive environment where money was on the line totally changed my view on writing and made me realize so much of my writing on Quora was trash. I learned so much and had to revamp everything.

In year two, I wanted to start ghostwriting for corporate clients and establish a business. That worked out well. I finished writing my first book but you won’t know I wrote it because it’s under someone else's name (the pay is higher when your name isn’t listed).

Year three is “Year of the Book”, as in my own book. It’s going to be in the self-improvement genre and will blend my “cool fact” style writing that I’ve done on Quora.

I’ve just started and am putting a lot of pressure on myself for this book to be good, not wishy-washy platitudes or a boring information dump. I’m comparing it to the most popular books in this genre and constantly reminding myself, “It needs to be THIS good.”

Starting a book is hard because it looks like you are staring at this giant mountain, that you can’t fully see because of clouds covering it.

The trick is to start somewhere in the middle and just start writing. Then, look for ways to segue ideas and transition to subsequent parts. I’ve had a few moments where I felt completely lost but I’m getting the hang of it. It’s all about chunking out the goals and aiming for them.

Anyways, wish me luck.",{'message': 'Server Error'},
Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"Yes, I want to write my heart out here!

I am an engineering graduate with decent marks from a pretty good college.

Being anonymous for obvious reasons. I am writing here for the first time, so please forgive me if you find any fault. And yeah, it is going to be a long one.

It has been rightly said “Life is full of unpredictable things”. So, here goes my story.

Well, I was in my final year and like almost every engineering student I was also worried about my placements. The placement season began, and my bad luck phase too. As my family conditions were not so good, getting a job was having a higher priority for me. So, I worked hard. But, to my surprise what I was getting as a result were only rejections. Almost every other guy in my class, who were not so good in programming and even some in communication skills too, were having an offer from big MNCs. I tried much harder but again I got the same results, i.e rejections. The most painful of all of them was one which I gave while my father was undergoing a surgery and the very same day I gave my last paper of 7th semester. So, I was in a plan to leave that campus and go to hospital to see my dad. But my mother insisted me to sit for that campus. So I did. But, the final result was again a rejection. The guilt of not seeing my dad in his pain, not being with him when he needed me the most, just got inside my heart and mind. And this guilt shattered me down and I became much more depressed now. The days passed and the final semester of engineering began and my new rays of hopes too. My family supported me alot in those tough situations. Each day they were in a hope that their son is going to grab a job this time. But the fact and results said something opposite to that. Then, my life suddenly took a turn. This was the second last month of my engineering and I was still unplaced. There came a product based (mid-level)IT company. I tried harder this time and with all the blessings, I cleared all the rigorous technical rounds and then finally grabbed an offer from them. Hardly, 2–3 people were selected and I was one of them. I told my dad and mom about this, my mom couldn’t control and she started crying, afterall her son got selected after being rejected in 13–14 companies back to back. A week after, I got an offer from a big brand (service based) MNC too. That was the best experience of my life till now, from being jobless to having two offers in hand.

The main part begins here, where I took the wrong decision. I decided to join that shity service based company just running behind its name and fame and left the other option. I was not so sure wether it was right or wrong neither did anyone told me. So, after some months I joined that. Things were going smooth but certainly it got changed. After, the training got over they told us to wait for 10 days after that you all will get joining. So, I went back to my home. But certainly after waiting for near about a month they revoked the offer letters of most of the guys who were in my batch without any proper feedback. We tried every possible bit that we could have but we didn’t get any response from them. After trying so much, one day we received an email regarding companies restructuring n all, so we won’t be able to pick you up at this point of time. This is it, my life once again played a game with me.

I started looking for other opportunities. But till now I haven’t received any positve response. I have lost all my hopes. My father is in debt, he have taken loans, money from relatives just to make me feel comfirtable and make my studies better. The most heart breaking moment in my life was….when I told him that I need a new pair of formal shoes and clothes. He didn’t had money but he never made me feel that he don’t have. He took money from one of my uncle just to buy stuffs from me. I heard him talking on the phone about that, that’s when I got to know that. He travelled 100 kms just to borrow money from uncle in order to fulfill my needs. That really, broke me down. Only I know how I managed to purchase those stuffs along with him. Even at the store I was crying from inside. And in result what I have given to my parents, “only a series of failure”. This hit me hard everytime.

I want to cry…..but I can’t because if my parents would see me crying it will make them feel bad and may be they couldn’t handle it. I don’t have any friend to share this. This sadness is not allowing me to live a life even. Last night, I was having a thought of giving up, sucide basically. But when I was about to cut myself I realised that what I was doing was wrong. All those sacrifices that my father did, will go in vain. This is not what they deserve, a fucking coward son. I promised myself at that moment only….. “I will fight till I stand”. I will make them feel proud one day. I will give them the best life which they deserve.

I am writing this and I am crying…..I don’t know when I will succed in my life but I have learnt very hard lessons in my life.

Treat your parents as god and respect them, as they really are. You are lucky to have them.
Be prepared at every moment of life. Life can throw stones at you anytime, anywhere.
Sucide is not a solution. Don’t let your parent’s sacrifices go in vain.
Work hard and make every dream of your parents a reality.
All the things from which you are going through is making you even more stronger.
Take every moment of life as a learning activity for yourself.

Sean Kernan,2y,Do we become what we think?,"How you feel and who you are is heavily shaped by the thoughts that flow through you. In theory, you can think yourself into the person you hope to be.

A trick I learned from cognitive behavior therapy—anytime you catch yourself thinking bad about yourself, interrupt it, count to three, then reflect on something positive in your life, a talent, a loved one, your good health—anything.

Doing this helps you unwind your downward spiral, elevates your awareness of the human negativity bias, and also makes you feel better.

Dhawal Barot,Updated 4y,Can you write a short friendship story?,"""... and then the hero and heroine hugged."" Raj said.

""Can I ask you something?"" Sanjay added.

""Yes, dost (friend)."" Raj permitted.

""Since last three stories, why hero and heroine give a hug to each other in the last scene? I never see my dad and mom hugging each other."" Sanjay revealed.

After hearing those words, Raj had a laugh and Sanjay joined him too.

After that day's storytelling session, it became a routine between both kids, Raj and Sanjay.

Raj used to watch a movie every day and he used to narrate a story to his little friend Sanjay.

Sanjay was not only poor, but blind too.

But, Sanjay had his own vision via Raj.

Every day, at 6 in the eve, both used to meet at the bench near the old school. It was the rare place of that village where rarely anyone used to visit.

Raj and Sanjay's communication always started with these two words of Sanjay, ""Kahaani sunayega? (translation: will you tell me a story?)""

Raj used to say yes. He never disappointed Sanjay ever. Sometimes, even if Raj failed to watch any new movie, he used to make-up a story and Sanjay used to believe it.

One fine day, when Sanjay was waiting for Raj at their regular meeting point, he didn't appear.

It wasn't usual thing. Thus Sanjay inquired. After digging further, he found that Raj left the village along with his family.

Sanjay was in shock. He felt like he lost his eyes. But, somehow, that kid managed himself.

After 15 years, Raj returned to his village. He visited Sanjay's place and realized things were changed. Sanjay got his vision. He was not blind anymore thanks to advance medical science.

As Sanjay was not at his home, his mother adviced Raj to wait for him. But, Raj scanned the wall clock and rushed for somewhere.

It was 6 when Raj reached to the bench near the old school. But, he didn't find anyone around. Thus, he thought maybe Sanjay forgot him.

Just when he was about to leave that place a voice came, ""Abey Kamine,” (translation: hey, you, idiot)

Raj turned around.

And he found a fimiliar face, who added, ""Kahaani sunayega?""

Raj smiled and both hugged each-other. Later, Raj asked him how he identified him after fifteen year?

""How can I forget my eyes?"" He answered. But, he didn't tell him that it was his mom who informed him about Raj's arrival via call. Because, after all, it didn't matter at all.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2awh6tix78ojdz0u', 'title': 'Can you write a short friendship story?', 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': '""... and then the hero and heroine hugged.""

She opened the door wondering who it could be at this hour of the night. There she saw him, standing there awkwardly, shuffling his feet, his shirt loosened from his worn out jeans, sleeves pulled back, his hair mussed up as if he'd been running his hand through it a lot.

Nisha: Are you okay?

He looked at her, and his eyes spoke what words couldn't say.

Nisha (in a resigned voice): It's her again, isn't it?

Rohan: I didn't know where else to go.

Nisha (sighing): Come on in.

He came in and hugged her tightly without saying a word. She held him close, until his body stopped shaking. She made him his favourite hot chocolate, and knowing that he wouldn't have eaten anything, she whipped up some sandwiches.

Rohan: But, I don't want to eat -

Nisha: Shush. Eat, you'll feel better. I have the whole night to listen to the problems of your love life!

He gave up, and started eating. He had never been able to win an argument against her. Half an hour later, she was settled on the couch watching a movie. He was sprawled next to her, and still chose not to utter a word, but just kept staring at her. After a few more minutes, finally fed up, she looked at him with raised eyebrows, asking a silent question. He just kept staring.

Nisha: Alright! Enough of this. Speak. You know I don't like it when you keep staring at me!

Rohan: I wasn't staring, I was thinking.

Nisha: You really think you can lie to me? I have known you for 7 years! So, listen to me because I'm gonna say this for the last time today! You need to stop doing this to yourself. This happens every time. You can't let it get to you so much!

Rohan: I know. But, why? Why couldn't things have worked out? Why couldn't she have loved me back? Is there something wrong with me? Did I not treat her well? Do I not deserve even a shot at happiness? Is that too much to ask for?

Nisha: I keep telling you, if she was the right girl for you things would have worked out. If they didn't, it means it isn't meant to be.

Rohan: Hmm! Can I stay here tonight?

Nisha: The couch is all yours.

Saying this, she made to get up, but he caught her arm.

Rohan: No, stay. Please. Just be here for sometime. Then go to sleep. Please, I don't want to be alone.

Nisha: I have to work tomorrow. And so do you. Just 10 more minutes, and then I'm off to bed.

She sat back down.

Rohan: Thank you so much.

He then rearranged himself in such a way, that his head rested in her lap. She looked down at him in exasperation.

Nisha (chuckling): This isn't what I signed up for, when I became your neighbour and best friend, all those years ago, Rohan! You're like a kid. I have to feed you, take care of you, and now this. You better start paying me for being your therapist cum babysitter!

Rohan (smiling reluctantly): You're the best. I love you.

Nisha (rolling her eyes): Of course you do! Now sleep.

And soon, he dozed off. And she left him there, and went to bed. Next morning, she woke up to find breakfast in bed, and with him standing near the door, with a smile on his face.

Rohan: Good morning! Hey, I'm so sorry for last night. It won't happen again.

Nisha: Morning! Wow, breakfast in bed. I'm impressed. Mm, this coffee tastes delicious!

Rohan: A dash of milk, 1 cube sugar, and lots of cream; yeah, unlike what you think, I do remember how you like your coffee.

Nisha (smiling into her cup): Alright, good to know.

Rohan: Why do you tolerate me?

Nisha: Best friends, right? It's part of the deal.

Rohan: That's all? That's the only reason?

Nisha: Yeah. What else would it be?

Rohan: I don't know. This says something else. Remember this?

Nisha paled as she saw what he was holding. This couldn't be happening. He couldn't have read that.

Nisha: Where did you find that? Give it to me.

Rohan: Why didn't you tell me?

Nisha: Rohan, this is not a joke. Give me that letter!

Rohan: You were never going to tell me, right? Why?? Why wouldn't you tell me?

Nisha: Because you were in love. You are in love. You love her. It doesn't matter how I feel.

Rohan: It matters to me. This changes everything.

Nisha: No, it doesn't. Just because I like you doesn't mean you're obligated to like me back. And plus, that was a long time ago. I don't feel that way now. I'm over you.

Rohan: So, you don't love me?

Nisha: Not anymore.

Rohan: Oh okay, then.

He left the door and walked slowly towards her, till he was sitting on the bed beside her.

Rohan: Because, you know, if you did love me, I'd tell you that you were the first person I ever fell for, 4 years ago, but was too scared to tell you. I would tell you that I didn't want to lose our friendship, so I never told you how I felt. I would tell you that even when I started dating her, I always had a soft corner for you. Yes, I loved her. I am sad that it didn't work out. But, that has been over for a long time. I need to accept that. I have just been holding onto a false hope. And now, this! It's you. My first love. And to know that you loved me back - I can't help it, I'm so happy. So, yes, I would tell you that I still love you. I never stopped loving you. I want to be with you always but as someone more than a best friend. But, all this doesn't matter now, right? Because you don't love me anymore.

She looked at him with moist eyes, the tears threatening to fall. She opened her mouth to speak, but words wouldn't come out. He spread his arms and she went in them. She hugged him tightly as he placed soft kisses in her hair. They stayed that way, lost in each other. After she finally withdrew from his embrace, he looked at her.

Rohan: So, I have officially seen you in your pyjamas, with tear stained eyes, a red nose, and a disheveled head, and I'm still here. So, now you know how much I love you.

Nisha (smacked him hard): Shut up, you doofus. I love you.

She ruffled his hair, and gave him a light peck on his cheek, and leaned her head against his chest. He wrapped his arms around her, and rested his chin on top of her head. He was finally content. He was with her. She felt like joy. She felt like peace. She felt like home.

Matthew Bates,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I took my dog to the vet yesterday for a regular checkup and because she had an ear infection. She gets ear infections a lot. That’s a “thing” with floppy-eared dogs. The only appointment they had was right after school, so my children and I had to rush home to get our dog, and rush to the vet. If you’ve ever tried to rush anywhere with children right after school, you know it can be stressful.

The exam went well and, after an 8-hour workday and 45 minutes in the vet’s office, I was eager to get home and relax. By “relax,” I mean “spend an hour alone, while my kids watch TV and my dog plays by herself in the backyard.”

There was a 10-minute delay between the end of the exam and them having the bill ready for me to pay. While I sat there, in the waiting room, with my two younger children and my dog, an elderly man came in with his German shepherd.

His very old German shepherd.

It was clearly in pain as it walked. Through the front window, I saw it walking slowly on the concrete sidewalk and, once it came through the door, it couldn’t get much traction on the hardwood floor of the waiting room.

The dog’s back legs slid out from under it. It struggled to lift its back side and walk a little more, but it was yelping in pain. Finally, tearfully, the man picked it up. The dog was pretty big, and the man was pretty old, and it looked like he was struggling to carry his dog. He sat down in the first seat he could find, still holding his dog.

I was tempted to offer to help or strike up a conversation with the man. There are normal things dog owners talk about when they encounter each other: what kind of dog is that, how old is it, etc…

But something stopped me from talking to the man.

He didn’t have to sit there long. The vet came out immediately (usually they don’t come out at all… a tech calls you back to the exam room), said something quietly to the man, and then led the man and his dog, still cradled in his arms, back to the very same exam room where my dog had been just minutes before.

Along the way, both receptionists told the man that they were sorry.

That’s when my suspicions were confirmed. This elderly man was bringing in his elderly dog to be euthanized.

There I was, with my overly-energetic two-year-old dog, my equally-energetic young children, full of stress and eager to get home, where my dog and children would leave me alone while I relaxed for a while.

As I watched this man carry his friend for the last time, I thought to myself: “One day, I’m going to miss all of this… the young, energetic dog, the school-aged kids who never seem to stop talking, the running errands after a hard day at work… all of it. Perhaps I should stop stressing over it, and instead enjoy it while it lasts.

I was also glad I did not talk to the guy. I’m glad I didn’t interrupt his last moments with his friend.

When I finally got home yesterday, instead of parking my kids in front of the TV and letting my dog out in the yard, I asked my kids if they’d like to play with our dog with me in the yard. They did, and we had a lot of fun.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vfcps4ornhj56yab', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.4973, 'ai': 0.5027}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I took my dog to the vet yesterday for a regular checkup and because she had an ear infection.

The vet came out immediately (usually they don’t come out at all… a tech calls you back to the exam room), said something quietly to the man, and then led the man and his dog, still cradled in his arms, back to the very same exam room where my dog had been just minutes before.\n\nAlong the way, both receptionists told the man that they were sorry.\n\nThat’s when my suspicions were confirmed. This elderly man was bringing in his elderly dog to be euthanized.\n\nThere I was, with my overly-energetic two-year-old dog, my equally-energetic young children, full of stress and eager to get home, where my dog and children would leave me alone while I relaxed for a while.\n\nAs I watched this man carry his friend for the last time, I thought to myself: “One day, I’m going to miss all of this… the young, energetic dog, the school-aged kids who never seem to stop talking, the running errands after a hard day at work… all of it. Perhaps I should stop stressing over it, and instead enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nI was also glad I did not talk to the guy. I’m glad I didn’t interrupt his last moments with his friend.\n\nWhen I finally got home yesterday, instead of parking my kids in front of the TV and letting my dog out in the yard, I asked my kids if they’d like to play with our dog with me in the yard. They did, and we had a lot of fun.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.4973

Rana Ashish,6y,Can you share a romantic/sad short story?,"“Why didn’t you come to class today?”, She asked a bit angrily.

“I had a fever in the morning.” I replied in a numb voice.

“And of course, you won’t visit a doctor. Because, you have no time and money.” I could sense her sarcastic tone over the voice call, because that is the only excuse I used to make, not to visit a doctor.

I smiled and replied, “Ok, don’t yell at me. I am already suffering. I will visit the doctor in the evening. I want to sleep now.”

“I will also come. Meet me at 7 pm.” Well, she was the boss. I agreed.

Call ended but the notion didn’t. I kept thinking while lying on the bed, I am lucky to have her. Well it was summer and I was not able to sleep under the fan. But, I didn’t know when I fell asleep thinking about her.

When I woke up, it was almost 6 pm. I still had one hour but what could be better then if I reach early and give her a surprise.

Unaware of the fact, that a surprise was waiting for me, where everything was going to be changed upside down.

It was a summer evening with a little darkness in the sky. I was roaming around in my college campus and there I saw a couple, holding their hands behind those trees. But I could recognize that suit in that darkness.

It was hers, may be they were kissing each other. I was curious and the feeling of betrayal was killing me with each passing moment. I froze, until they came out of that tree.

What happened next, read here: Have you ever had a dream that affected you in real life?

My whole world changed within few hours. I wish I would never had woken up from that dream. One moment, it was beautiful and then in another it turned ugly.

Do I curse love?

No, Love is always beautiful. It is the people who ruin it. Now, in my dictionary “Love” doesn’t exist anymore. People call me, I have a heart of stone and I am glad I have it.

So,did I cease to be the same person?

Yes. It changed me a lot.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I have to lie about my menstruation at home.

Please if you feel disgusted by the fact that women bleed,do not read further

I come from a well educated family. Yet my mother has enforced on us some very strict rules while menstruating.

● I cannot enter the kitchen,any temple etc. Its best if i stay in my room itself for 5 days.

● I cannot touch plants,they will die if i do so.

●I cannot touch pickle,it will spoil if i do so.

●I cannot touch anyone not bleeding,because they are pure and if i do,i make them impure and then they will have to take a bath immediately.

●No one eats the food i touched. So if i do not like something on my plate,i still have to eat it. Similarly,if i pass by the curtains,door mat,it all gets touched and impure.

●Everything i touch has to be dusted,washed after 5 days.

For 5 days i am treated like a nobody. I do not mind sitting away from my family in a corner for 5 days. But every month,when i tell my mom that i got my periods,she has a “Oh aa gaya firse!!” (Its back again??!) troubled look on her face.

I feel like a burden,i feel like my body has done something wrong.

There are occasions,festivals,at times at home,when my mom doesn't really want to welcome my inauspicious menstruation at that time. She coaxes me to have Norethisterone pills for those few days (they delay your periods). When i was a kid i used to listen to her obediently and pop them like candies. But,few months back it was the last time i had those pills.

I consumed the pill for 5 days,very obediently as my mother forced me to. But what happened next month?! My cycle got all messed up,my periods were delayed for 25 days. I was stressed as this never happened in my 12 years of bleeding.

A little research from google made me shook. NORETHISTERONE IS NOT COMPLETELY SAFE. i read hundreds of posts on one particular blog where people missed their dates for even months together due to this pill.

I promised myself that day that come what may,i will protect myself,if not my mom. I do not think it is right for me to mess up with my body.

And hence,whenever such festivals come up at home,i simply lie to my mom that my dates are far away (She never really remembers my exact date). I just want to skip eating that pill.

A little background about me. I am soon to turn 24,a doctor. I am going to pursue my masters soon. I have been working hard since 2 years to clear the entrance exam,since i come from a middle class family and i wanted a seat in a government college. I used to study for 17 hours a day,with very little rest. I already have a stressed life. Consuming such pills scares me a lot. I feel like i am harming my future.

Every month when i get my periods,i feel lucky,i thank God for them being so regular,for not having pcod or any other illness.

I just wish people from the older generation stop looking at menstruation like an impurity,a burden. I think we should focus more on menstrual hygiene rather than so many rules we have to follow.

Ps_ I used to stay in a hostel,and while i was there i never followed any such rules. I used to eat pickle,would pick flowers from my favourite plant too. And you know what?! Nothing happened to them!

If any one here,knows the scientific reasons behind those menstruation rules,then please do mention in the comment box.

Mercedes R. Lackey,5y,Does Stephen King have to be sick in the head in order to write such wretched material?,"Oh FFS.

Stephen is one of the sharpest, kindest people I know. For that matter so was Bob Bloch (who wrote Psycho).

The only person who could assume that you have to be deranged in order to write works that person finds uncomfortable, is someone who has no imagination. Not even enough imagination to be able to imagine that someone else can write dark subjects without being, himself, a seething mass of horror.

Was Agatha Christie a serial killer? Does Stephanie Meyer harbor vampires in her spare bedroom? Do I secretly have a herd of talking white horses on my property?

(The answers to all of these, since you clearly do not have the ability to understand when a question is rhetorical, is no.)

To confuse a writer’s work with the writer himself is like saying a truck driver is the same as the truck he drives.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nwcv9p0hrxfg3bl6', 'title': 'Does Stephen King have to be sick in the head in order to write such wretched material?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Oh FFS.\n\nStephen is one of the sharpest, kindest people I know.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am a 23 year old woman.

I was raped when I was 19 by one of my “friends”.

He had called me in his house. I had a boyfriend at that time with whom I later broke up. He had a girlfriend too.

I had always assumed that his intentions towards me were purely platonic.

He forced me to kiss him. He fondled my breasts. He forced me to give him a blowjob. And then he penetrated me for the first time.

He was my school classmate and an old family friend.

My grades tumbled down after that.I had unexplained fevers and seizures after that.

I started having nightmares and anxiety attacks. I might have untreated PTSD. Being from a conservative family I could never tell my parents about this incident. I could not tell my then boyfriend. I couldn’t confide in any of my friends. That incident stayed with me for more than 3 years.

In the darkness of night, I used to shiver in my sleep. The violation of everything I held sacred took a deep toll on me.

But there was one person I could confide. The person I am dating right now. The most beautiful kindhearted soul I ever met.

I remember telling him one day when I went too vulnerable. I thought he would judge me if I told him. He listened patiently without any questions asked. Then he hugged me tight and whispered in my ears “How could you ever think I will judge you for telling me the darkest secrets of your life?

The way he took care of me is unbelievable.

Sometimes I believe that he couldn’t be this perfect. I am so happy now.

Those nightmares still happens. When I squirm in my sleep, he is the one to press my hands and hugs me tight.

Those memories don’t trigger me anymore the way they used to.

He listened and understood me when I thought no one would.

Every woman deserves a man like him.

He has a beautiful soul.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o7ygetck6bn0vw23', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am a 23 year old woman.\n\nI was raped when I was 19 by one of my “friends”.\n\nHe had called me in his house.

Shubham KP,1y,What are some of the best moments/stories of a father-son relationship?,"My father and I have never talked for one hour straight.

Even half an hour seems impossible. I've tried many times but HE DOESN'T OPEN UP. This has caused all sorts of trouble for a guy who's very expressive about his feelings, me.

I often thought he didn't love me enough.

My father's mother was dead when he was in 12th grade. He was the eldest in his family. And he joined the paramilitary the very next year.

Maybe this caused him to keep things to himself.

I remember when he dropped me off to Kota. He didn't seem sad when he was leaving my hostel. He was cool. I thought he didn't care.

Two years back, my mother told me what happened when he came back from Kota.

He locked himself in a room. And when he came out, his cushion was soaked with tears.

I thought my mother was joking. It was unreal to think that a person who's nearly six feet, who has served his country for over twenty years, crying like a baby.

But, it was true.

Fathers are the underrated heroes of our families. The provider. The enigma. The person who's disguised themselves as a tough guy.

We still don't talk much. But things are very clear to me now. His talking less has no relation with what he has done for me and what he can still do for me.

Papa, I love you!

You know that, don't you?

With love.

Jay Bazzinotti,Updated 4y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"I have a friend who, in his younger days, went at life very hard. He was an expert skier; he loved to surf and kite-board; he was big into camping; he was a triathlete-class cyclist, he owned a Porche 911 that he raced constantly. He even liked to sled and toboggan and snowmobile down the steepest hills in winter. One summer he took his boat-like sled and went cliff-sledding from 100 feet up into the Saco River. It was one of the funniest, scariest things I ever saw. He loved adventure and he loved doing sports. He was absolutely fearless. He owned a famous bicycle sales/repair store and there was nothing he couldn’t fix or make, from bicycles to engines. He could skin a Cat or a backhoe; drive a dump truck or a cement mixer, weld, cut in gas pipes, fix any engine from a leaf blower to a tractor and a dozen other skills.

And then he caught his wife cheating on him.

He had married later in life and his wife was a beautiful, tempestuous woman fifteen years younger than he was, and after she bore him a child, the light of his life, she lost interest in the old man despite his incredible energy and ability to do everything well. Over night his world collapsed. In the messy ensuing divorce he lost the bike business that had been in his family for over a hundred years; he lost his Porche, he lost his camper, his water skiing boat, and nearly everything he loved. He ended up in a big cabin near mine, something he had purchased for him and his wife to use for vacation. It was about the only thing he got to keep. She even came for his Jeep and took it. He ended up with a broken down SUV. It wasn’t that he couldn’t have fought for those things. He no longer wanted to fight. He lost the will to live.

When I arrived in Maine he was already living like a hermit, alone, isolated, hating mankind. His house was filled with broken furniture his wife didn’t want, literally thousands of tools of every possible description and all first-quality sports equipment. He had a snowmobile she let him keep and a dozen bicycles, old machines he had fixed up and a dog he loved. Every day he got up at four AM and took the dog for a long walk to watch the sun come up over the mountains. At that point I began to know him little by little. He was angry and unpleasant and drank a great deal. More than one time I had to literally drag his dead weight back to his couch when I found him lying face down in his driveway. He never really liked me, but he tolerated me.

And because I had rental units in Maine I needed a fix-it man and manager to take care of the property. And I asked him to do it. At first he grumbled, but he did the work. As time went on he came to like the work and really got into it. His former “type A” personality began to re-assert itself. If a pipe broke, he was there with a torch. If a few inches of snow fell, he was moving it all night with his snowblower. When guests came, he showed them around and answered every question. He was a man who could do anything but who wanted to do nothing.

One day we went skiing. At the top of Attitash mountain he adjusted his goggles and his helmet. He looked expert and competent in the “ski patrol” jacket he wore from a previous life. And he flew down that mountain like an Olympic skier. Other skiers stopped to watch him blow through the glades and trees, making impossible jumps where there were no jumps and sliding to a stop at the bottom before I had skied a few hundred feet. By lunch time he was riding the pine at the clubhouse with a big drink in his hand, red-faced from the many skiing runs, gabbing with every woman who came in and charming the socks off them. But no matter how interested women were in him, and they often were, he never took a single one up on their offer to, “you know, go watch TV in my room… or something.” I watched in shocked awe as he just ordered another drink. Later I would have to help him stumble back to the car to get him home.

“Why didn’t you bang her?,” I asked him, “She was begging you to go with her.”

“She was a bitch,” he slurred, “Did you see she had the big ring and the big rock on her hand? She wanted to fuck. They all want to fuck. But they don’t want to fuck their husbands anymore. That’s what happened to me. I don’t want to do that to anyone else.” And he passed out.

The time passed. He never really recovered from losing his wife, his business, his previous active, fast paced life. Eventually his beloved dog died. It broke him in a way I had never seen previously. He tried to get another dog but it didn’t work for him and he gave it away. His body began to fail him at in increasing pace. Where before he hiked miles to watch the sunrise in the morning, now he barely walked across the street. He was doing more and more chores for the neighbors for money and we were glad to have him, because he was great at everything he turned his hand to, as long as he was sober. And his day of useful work ended earlier and earlier as time progressed. One day he passed out under my kitchen sink with a burning propane torch in his hand while we sweat in new pipes. I had to drag him out by his legs while I frantically looked for smoking wood in the walls, and doused the entire thing with buckets of water we had prepared for just this eventuality, just in case.

This is not a story where he dies. He’s still alive. This is not a story where someone gets enlightenment or redemption. There is none. This is a story of “lasts”. Not so long ago we were back at Attitash, preparing to blaze down the slopes. Only we were on the shortest, easiest beginner slope on the mountain. He looked up at the sky and gauged the weather, his breath pouring out of him like hot steam in the crisp cold, and he expertly tapped his skis together, made the turn and flew down the mountain. Only his former elan was gone and despite the ease of the course, I watched, mesmerized, as one might watch an impending car wreck until he slid into the turn at the bottom. His previous skill and elan was gone and when I got to the bottom after our first run he was unbuckling his helmet. He handed it to me.

“It’s yours,” he said, “I knew that would be my last ski run ever. I just wanted one more time. My knees are gone now and I won’t be able to walk tomorrow. You go ski. I’ll be at the bar.” And he abandoned his skis where they lay and stomped off to the bar. Since then his life has become a series of lasts. “This is the last time I’ll be running my skimobile,” he said recently after an exhilarating run across the lake at 70 miles an hour. “It’s too heavy for me to manage alone. And I really need the money. Do you want it?” Another time I watched with amused hilarity as he blew down the frozen street on his antique Flexible Flyer sled. He was laughing like an insane man as he blew past me while I stood on the side of the road until eventually he crashed into an ice mountain pushed up by the snowplow. He staggered back up, spit out a tooth and left a trail of blood as he came back towards me. “Well, that’s the last time for that,” he said, spitting red blood into the white snow. The abandoned sled remained where it lay til it was ground up by the snow plow. He never got the tooth fixed. Every day his world gets smaller and there is nothing anyone can do. The neighbors watch out for him. People either love him or hate him. He’s erratic, quick to anger and extremely judgemental, but he is also generous beyond measure, willing to help anyone, day or night, watches and cares for everyone and is always there, the person who is called for a baby sitter or when a pipe bursts or the grass needs cutting or something needs moving. He’s always there. Because he has no life. He’s given up. He is a man who can do anything but who chooses to do nothing. And we all stand around and watch him choose to fade away. He won’t accept help; won’t take advice; won’t see a doctor; won’t take a pill. It’s his life and this is how he’s chosen to live it.

Not so long ago we were watching a John Wayne Western. He loves the old movies, especially “Rio Bravo” and “The Cowboys”. He never misses them, no matter what time they are on TV. And while watching a movie once he asked me what kind of shotgun John Wayne was carrying. “It’s a coach gun,” I answered absently, “It’s the shortest legal shotgun they make. Hansen makes a good one.” And the movie continued. Not a few weeks later he brought out his brand new Hansen .12 Gauge shotgun. “It’s a beauty,” he beamed, “I tried it out on the Stop sign up the street. Blew a huge hole clear through it.” Sadly, shooting street signs is a typical pastime in Maine. “I have no intention of ‘Raging against the dying of the light’,” he said to me, restoring the gun to it’s cardboard box, “The light was extinguished long ago.”. I didn’t even know he knew Dylan Thomas or read poetry. But then, he is a man who can do anything.

He was an expert skier; he loved to surf and kite-board; he was big into camping; he was a triathlete-class cyclist, he owned a Porche 911 that he raced constantly. He even liked to sled and toboggan and snowmobile down the steepest hills in winter. One summer he took his boat-like sled and went cliff-sledding from 100 feet up into the Saco River. It was one of the funniest, scariest things I ever saw. He loved adventure and he loved doing sports. He was absolutely fearless. He owned a famous bicycle sales/repair store and there was nothing he couldn’t fix or make, from bicycles to engines. He could skin a Cat or a backhoe; drive a dump truck or a cement mixer, weld, cut in gas pipes, fix any engine from a leaf blower to a tractor and a dozen other skills.\n\nAnd then he caught his wife cheating on him.\n\nHe had married later in life and his wife was a beautiful, tempestuous woman fifteen years younger than he was, and after she bore him a child, the light of his life, she lost interest in the old man despite his incredible energy and ability to do everything well. Over night his world collapsed. In the messy ensuing divorce he lost the bike business that had been in his family for over a hundred years; he lost his Porche, he lost his camper, his water skiing boat, and nearly everything he loved. He ended up in a big cabin near mine, something he had purchased for him and his wife to use for vacation. It was about the only thing he got to keep. She even came for his Jeep and took it. He ended up with a broken down SUV. It wasn’t that he couldn’t have fought for those things. He no longer wanted to fight. He lost the will to live.\n\nWhen I arrived in Maine he was already living like a hermit, alone, isolated, hating mankind. His house was filled with broken furniture his wife didn’t want, literally thousands of tools of every possible description and all first-quality sports equipment. He had a snowmobile she let him keep and a dozen bicycles, old machines he had fixed up and a dog he loved. Every day he got up at four AM and took the dog for a long walk to watch the sun come up over the mountains. At that point I began to know him little by little. He was angry and unpleasant and drank a great deal. More than one time I had to literally drag his dead weight back to his couch when I found him lying face down in his driveway. He never really liked me, but he tolerated me.\n\nAnd because I had rental units in Maine I needed a fix-it man and manager to take care of the property. And I asked him to do it.

At the top of Attitash mountain he adjusted his goggles and his helmet. He looked expert and competent in the “ski patrol” jacket he wore from a previous life. And he flew down that mountain like an Olympic skier. Other skiers stopped to watch him blow through the glades and trees, making impossible jumps where there were no jumps and sliding to a stop at the bottom before I had skied a few hundred feet. By lunch time he was riding the pine at the clubhouse with a big drink in his hand, red-faced from the many skiing runs, gabbing with every woman who came in and charming the socks off them. But no matter how interested women were in him, and they often were, he never took a single one up on their offer to, “you know, go watch TV in my room… or something.” I watched in shocked awe as he just ordered another drink.

She wanted to fuck. They all want to fuck. But they don’t want to fuck their husbands anymore. That’s what happened to me. I don’t want to do that to anyone else.” And he passed out.\n\nThe time passed. He never really recovered from losing his wife, his business, his previous active, fast paced life.

His body began to fail him at in increasing pace. Where before he hiked miles to watch the sunrise in the morning, now he barely walked across the street. He was doing more and more chores for the neighbors for money and we were glad to have him, because he was great at everything he turned his hand to, as long as he was sober. And his day of useful work ended earlier and earlier as time progressed. One day he passed out under my kitchen sink with a burning propane torch in his hand while we sweat in new pipes.

Not so long ago we were back at Attitash, preparing to blaze down the slopes. Only we were on the shortest, easiest beginner slope on the mountain. He looked up at the sky and gauged the weather, his breath pouring out of him like hot steam in the crisp cold, and he expertly tapped his skis together, made the turn and flew down the mountain. Only his former elan was gone and despite the ease of the course, I watched, mesmerized, as one might watch an impending car wreck until he slid into the turn at the bottom.

Shovan Chowdhury,Updated 4y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"I was rejected after 2 years virtual relationship. When she was marrying a successful man, I was waiting in the interview waiting room to get rid of my 2.5 years unemployment life.

While She posted pictures on Instagram about her new house in London with her husband, my landlord was searching me because I did not pay my two months rent due to financial insolvency.

When she was getting taste of delicious food of world's one of the expensive restaurant in Italy, I was eating cheap street food in Bangladesh to save money.

When she was traveling and exploring the world with her husband, I was dealing with chronic depression, taking antidepressants and confined myself in a dark room for hours and hours.

While she was enjoying night concert of Bruno Mars at Vancouver with her husband and bunch of friends, I was waiting outside of operation theater of my mother with sleepless night, tensed mind, broken heart and empty pocket.

While she was busy to shop at Walmart owned Asda supermarket in UK, I was doing tuition to manage my pocket money and studying hard to get a good job.

She posted smiling picture in Facebook with her husband while driving their new BMW car, that time I was hanging in the crowdy bus with many people in suffocated situation.

While she was feeling proud and happy to join in a Fortune 500 company, I was working in a local NGO with poor salary.

When she was enjoying the motherhood of one adorable child, I was leading a single life and console my father that “Dad, don't worry. I will manage everything of our financial crisis in our family. Just give me some more times”. My dad touched my hand with firm belief.

I did not cry for many days. Now I hate virtual life, I focus more on real life. All of my rejections, shortcomings, grief, sufferings, failures, agony made a strong person what I am today…

          wretch!"" returned Grignr. A sweeping blade of flashing steel riveted from the massive
          barbarians hide enameled shield as his rippling right arm thrust
          forth, sending a steel shod blade to the hilt into the soldiers vital
          organs. The disemboweled mercenary crumpled from his saddle and sank
          to the clouded sward, sprinkling the parched dust with crimson
          droplets of escaping life fluid. The enthused barbarian swilveled about, his shock of fiery red hair
          tossing robustly in the humid air currents as he faced the attack of
          the defeated soldier's fellow in arms. ""Damn you, barbarian"" Shrieked the soldier as he observed
          his comrade in death. A gleaming scimitar smote a heavy blow against the renegade's spiked
          helmet, bringing a heavy cloud over the Ecordian's misting brain.
          Shaking off the effects of the pounding blow to his head, Grignr
          brought down his scarlet streaked edge against the soldier's crudely
          forged hauberk, clanging harmlessly to the left side of his opponent.
          The soldier's stead whinnied as he directed the horse back from the
          driving blade of the barbarian. Grignr leashed his mount forward as
          the hoarsely piercing battle cry of his wilderness bred race resounded
          from his grinding lungs. A twirling blade bounced harmlessly from the
          mighty thief's buckler as his rolling right arm cleft upward, sending
          a foot of blinding steel ripping through the Simarian's exposed
          gullet. A gasping gurgle from the soldier's writhing mouth as he
          tumbled to the golden sand at his feet, and wormed agonizingly in his
          death bed. Grignr's emerald green orbs glared lustfully at the wallowing
          soldier struggling before his chestnut swirled mount. His scowling

Neman Ashraf,Updated 4y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"Let me tell you the story of a child from our neighborhood.

He's a six years old boy.

I have seen him occasionally on a specific desolated spot right outside the entrance of our town's graveyard, where he's found playing at a corner with sticks & stones or sitting idle like a statue. I know nothing about him except that he's a burn victim as I see his partially hairless and burnt scalp and right side of the face too. My guess is that his family has moved here as tenants recently.

I do go to the graveyard regularly to say prayers on my parent's graves, my mother departed four months ago and I have grown this habit to going there for my peace of mind though I don't seem to find any. The damage is done for good. Anyway, not the topic of discussion here.

So I'd see the kid while coming out of the graveyard, but I have to say that after a few days... I couldn't help noticing the kid's interest in looking at me as he'd stop doing whatever he was doing and stare at me in what seemed to be like friendly invitation manners. I conveniently ignored him every single day and walked past him in a grieving and depressed state of mind over my mother's demise.

At least a month must have passed by like this.

But one day as I walked out of the graveyard, the kid was there standing still and prima facie; he was waiting for me. I stopped and smiled at him, in response to that... he took a step forward and offered his hand to shake.

May the Lord have mercy.

The child's hand was badly burnt and mutilated!

The palm was there but the fingers weren't, I mean the distal & middle phalanges to be exact, or in plain layman terms... 2/3 of each finger was mutilated. What kind of fire accident he must have gone through that had charred his bones too? I felt this wave of shock and pain traveling through my body for what I was witnessing.

Without revealing what I just had experienced, I leaned and shook his hand with a smile.

Hi, how are you doing today? Do you want to say something, son?

No, I want to shake hands with you.

Oh, it's a pleasure.

He nodded his head and ran away giggling.

We shook hands almost daily afterward and I learned the obvious from him that the kids abhor him, avoid playing or interacting with him at all. It has caused him to feel inferiority and sadness over the past few months.

And now this is just my assumption that he wanted to know if he is still good enough to be friends with. He wants a reason to be confident for and strives to gather courage if there's light ahead. If there's room for him. At least he wishes to try and seek instead of going down.

Folks, this half of his body from the right side was burned extremely badly, the accident, shock, suffering he has survived through... and now he's getting back on his feet to not only survive like a hero but also enjoy.

Now, this is the heartbreaking part.

He told me that he has tried the same friendly technique with nearly a dozen men and woman before, where he smiled at them and wished to engage in a conversation or at least a handshake but unfortunately nobody responded positively enough for him to be able to speak his heart out and help him get the lost confidence back.

Still, he didn't stop or lose hope until he found someone. To be specific... me! for that, I'm humbled and honored.

Though It's a concern that what the hell is wrong with his parents; whoever they are. I don't know them but why aren't they taking care of this almost down and out pupil, in such a state that he even at this incredibly young age is feeling left alone and abandoned but does not wish to give up.

I will talk to his parents, though it carries all sorts of risks of a dumb tussle... something like ""Who the hell are you"" for one. But oh we'll see about that. If the kid is not going to school, it’ll be arranged. Anything that can be done for him that comes within my powers….it’ll be done.

If he's courageous enough to survive and come back from the horrors nobody could even fathom being in and still wants something to hold on to for the sake of life and happiness.

I'll ensure he gets it!

I'm good for it!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sa6biqwfdouvg80m', 'title': 'Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?', 'score': {'original': 0.64655, 'ai': 0.35345}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Let me tell you the story of a child from our neighborhood.\n\nHe's a six years old boy.\n\nI have seen him occasionally on a specific desolated spot right outside the entrance of our town's graveyard, where he's found playing at a corner with sticks & stones or sitting idle like a statue.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"""I HIT MY FATHER TODAY""
Iam a 22 year old engineer working in a mnc as a fresher. I live in pune which is far away from my hometown. The journey by train takes almost 15 hours there. Day before yesterday i received a call at 3 a.m from my younger brother. His voice was shivering i knew something was wrong,he was crying and i could hear my father yelling and hitting my mother behind.
My father is an alcoholic, he gets drunk everyday and goes wild creating ruckass but hitting my mother was the new level to which he stooped low that day. I tried comforting my brother and said him to calm down and that i will be there as soon as possible. I could not sleep that night. I called my friend who lives in my hometown and told him to go immediately at my house. I received a call from him 15 minutes later saying that my father was heavily drunk and had been hitting heavily to my mother. My mother who always tries to hide all these scenes of my dad didn't utter a word and was receiving hits from him silently so that other society people don't get to know about my fathers deeds. I catched the first train which was available to my hometown. That 15 hours where the longest 15 hours of my life. All i could think of was only my mother and younger brother. Each and every second felt like an eternity.The moment i reached home i found my father lying on the floor heavily drunk and not in his senses, my mother had all those marks on her hands and face due to hits, my brothers eyes were swallowen up as he was awake from 48 hours continously due to my fathers scene.
I could not stop myself after looking the marks on my mothers body and my brothers crying face, the only thing i remember after that was my mother and brother stopping me from hitting my father with belt mercilessly. I cannot explain how hard is this for me typing this words. My whole family is in shattered state. Alcohol has ruined the happiness of my family, i just want to give an advice to all people reading this answer ALCOHOL MAY GIVE YOU TEMPORARY PLEASURE BUT IT WILL GIVE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY A LIFELONG SCAR.
Don't know what to do...

Edit 1:- Can't believe my answer reached so many people out there, after writing this answer i was unable to find it, just found it today and i grateful for all the positivity i received in comments from all the people.

An update on my dad’s condition, after the incident we took him for counselling and now his condition has improved a lot. The inital few days were very tough, his body was not in his control and we had to catch him and keep under our eyes so that he won't go out of house to get drunk. He is practising yoga nowadays and has joined a meditation group in our city. Counselling has shown it's effects.

My mother is also fine, she too has now realised that bearing my fathers deeds was not at all helping our family and has promised me that she will never ever suffer anything like that.

I feel blessed to have such a courageful and mature younger brother, the way he has stood with my mother all this days just shows how mature the situation has made him.

Finally i want to thank all the people out there for showing so much love and care…i can see something good happening in my family now.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/e87l9h3o0ajzckx4', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.96385, 'ai': 0.03615}, 'blocks': [{'text': '""I HIT MY FATHER TODAY""\nIam a 22 year old engineer working in a mnc as a fresher.

Abhimanyu Sood,Updated 5y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"If you meet one new person every day, then in your whole life, you would come in contact with 30,000 human beings. That’s 0.000004% of the earth’s population.

99% of these 30000 humans would be absolute strangers, making a brief appearance in the movie of your life - as the guy you talked to in the metro for a couple of minutes, or as the biker who gave you a lift, or as the cute girl you met at the mall. You’d meet, talk for a few minutes and drift apart on your own unique paths in the cosmos - paths that would never intersect again.

Remaining 300 would be the lucky ones, for they would unlock the next level. They would become what you call ‘acquaintances’. These are the 300 contacts that you have in your cell phone, but the call histories next to them are empty. You only realize they exist, when on a lonely two-thirty in the dead of the night, you are wishfully scrolling through your phonebook, desperately hoping to find a single number you could call, just to have someone to talk to - just to have someone to come home to.

As you count down from 300, the definitions start becoming a little fuzzy. You can never tell where the ‘acquaintances’ end and the ‘friends’ begin. But if I were to ask you to list all your friends, you’d come up with a list of about 20 names. It’s only then, that in a moment of sheer realization, you’d embark upon the truth — that out of seven and a half billion human beings on your planet, there are only 20 you can call ‘friends’.

And out of those twenty, there are perhaps only 3 or 4 who you can actually call at 2:30 in the night!

Correct me if I’m wrong, but on average, you’ll visit two new places every year. These may be random trips with friends, or family vacations or religious pilgrimages. Integrate that over eighty years of your life and you have around 150 destinations. 99% of these would, of course, be within your country.

Take a big globe. Or better still, imagine one! And since you’re imagining it, make it really big. Now take a very sharp pencil and put a small dot on all 150 of those locations. You have a big sphere, with an unimaginably enormous surface area, and about 150 sharp dots scattered randomly, most of them concentrated near a central and seemingly special dot that you call ‘home’. Those dots right there - that’s your footprint on earth.

On average, 2 million new books are published every year - novels, comics, sci-fi, autobiographies, criticisms, thrillers, drama, erotica - on every theme and topic imaginable. Integrate that over a century and you have more than 100 million books that you have access to. And at 4 books a year, you’ll perhaps read 300 in your lifetime.

Out of a million television series, you’ll watch about 20. Out of five hundred thousand movies ever produced, you’ll watch only about 100. Out of more than a hundred million songs ever sung, you’ll hear less than a thousand. Out of the trillion possible experiences that you could possibly have on this beautiful beautiful planet of ours, you’re going to have only an infinitesimal few.

You don’t live on earth!

You exist inside a very small subspace within it - confined by the spatial and temporal constraints that your own humanity puts upon you, but even more importantly, by the mental barriers that you bind yourself with.

This tiny subspace is your home.

It is your prison.

It is your Sphere of Existence.

In case we're meeting for the first time,

Peter Kruger,4y,How do I make readers hate the villain?,"Perhaps no literary villain is more loathed, more despised, more truly hated by readers than this one:

Admit it. You wanted her dead more than Voldemort, and you cheered when she was hauled off by the centaurs.

This is Dolores Umbridge. The very name strikes not so much fear into the reader so much as utter detestation. Stephen King described her as the greatest make-believe villain to come along since Hannibal Lecter. If Satan himself were to be accused of being like Dolores Umbridge, he would say, “Whoa, whoa now, let’s not be hasty here.”

What makes Umbridge one of the downright most despicable, repugnant characters in modern literature?

(1) She is smugly superior AF and it’s clear from minute one that she hasn’t earned a drop of it.

We’ve all had that one co-worker who just keeps failing upward, right? No matter how badly they fuck up, they keep getting promoted over better-qualified people. They take credit whenever someone else succeeds, and they pass the buck the second it goes wrong. They have all the answers, but if it goes wrong, it’s definitely someone else’s fault.

And yet, they strut around as though they are the pinnacle of the self-made person. They’re more than just arrogant. They actively tear down everyone around them, humiliate everyone they can, just to make sure that everyone knows they are in charge.

This is peak Umbridge.

Voldemort is a great wizard, and has genuinely earned his reputation for terror. Ollivander tells Harry right in the beginning that Voldy has done terrible, but great things. It’s not just that he thinks he’s the best wizard ever. He’s got some impressive credentials to lay claim to the title of GOAT. They might be completely shitty things, but I don’t think anyone’s going to argue that Voldemort is one short step above a squib.

Umbridge? She’s completely incompetent. She’s a mediocre witch, at best. She’s politically connected and that’s about it. She fails upward at every turn.

And yet, she has to make an example out of anyone she perceives as remotely threatening for no other reason than to boost her flagging ego.

And more than that, she cloaks it in a shitty caricature of propriety and faux politeness.

Umbridge doesn’t give any actual single, solitary, tiny fuck about respecting any other person. It doesn’t even cross her mind. But she goes bonkers if everyone else doesn’t bow and scrape and observe every obsequious nicety to her.

From just about the first minute we meet her, she’s starting off by interrupting Dumbledore, and in the most obnoxious way: hem, hem. Right in the middle of the headmaster’s speech and notices to the students. It’s juuuuust enough of an interruption to get through, but she might as well have run out in front of him and shoved both middle fingers into his eyeballs. She then proceeds to give her own speech like she’s already the headmaster.

Her first day on the job, five minutes in, and she’s already correcting everyone else, including her boss, in front of the staff and students. With zero experience, zero credibility built up, and a metric shit ton of unearned confidence.

(2) She is cruel to the point where she’s just a straight psychopath, while being sickeningly sweet about it.

Voldemort is cruel, but rarely pointlessly cruel. He doesn’t seem to revel in torture, and even chides his followers for getting too caught up in it at times and losing sight of the goals.

But more than that, he doesn’t make any effort to hide it. When he’s cruel, he’ll come straight out and tell you that he’s going to be cruel, and he straight out DGAF, mates. He makes no bones about who he is and what he does.

Umbridge, on the other hand, seems to delight in her cruelty, while simultaneously trying to act like she’s really everyone’s friend. Any small revenge she can exact on someone who crosses her makes her light up like a Christmas tree. Umbridge giggles with delight when students are punished, sometimes even for trivialities, because it demonstrates her superiority to them.

Another key difference between Voldy and Umbridge is the willingness to get their hands actually dirty. Voldemort has no qualms about killing someone or torturing them himself. He doesn’t require anyone else to do his dirty work.

Umbridge, on the other hand, never deigns to get her hands dirty personally. She forces or employs others to do it. Look at her in the books: she almost never casts a spell on anyone else. She gets others to do it.

She tortures students by forcing them to cut themselves with a savage magical quill that slices open the writer’s hands and eventually leads to magical scarring that can’t be healed. Over. And over. Until they admit they were wrong and she was right. This is probably one of the most horrific forms of torture out there: forcing people to hurt themselves until they mentally cave and agree with you.

She uses up Snape’s potion supplies to force the truth out of students. She ordered the Dementor attack on Harry because whether he had his soul sucked out or used underage magic worked out to her favor of discrediting him.

Even when Umbridge sits in judgment of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, which analyzed people’s ancestry to determine whether they had any magical blood in them and sent those who didn’t pass to Azkaban for “stealing” their magical abilities, she uses various Death Eaters to enforce any decrees.

But the whole time, she’s wearing a pink cardigan with a little velvet bow and surrounded by magical kitschy plates with kittens on them, trying to make deals with you if she thinks there’s anything you could give her.

(3) She is Ayn Rand-level selfish and ambitious along with it.

Umbridge is willing to throw anyone under the bus if it advances her career and keeps her at the top of the heap. And she will suck up like Devin Nunes on a Sunday trip to the White House if she thinks that she can curry favor with someone above her in the process.

Other people are nothing but props to her. If they get in her way, she has no qualms about crushing them utterly, drugging them, torturing them, a little Unforgivable Curse here or there if it helps. If they help her, fantastic, but it’s not like she actually cares about them.

Umbridge is the pure ends of the ethics of consequentialism: the ends justify the means. And for her, the only ends that matter are her own personal ends.

(4) She’s ruthlessly authoritarian.

Umbridge wants order more than anything else. A hierarchy, with her at the top. As long as everyone around her does precisely what she says, she’s fine with that.

To get it, she will use massive crackdowns, torture, rewards for people who turn in dissenters, any means at her disposal. This backfires hilariously for those involved, because again, she’s super incompetent and alienates everyone competent that can help her. (See the Weasleys’ swamp, etc.)

But later, when she’s given more power and more competent henchmen, she’s a force to be reckoned with in this regard. She controls the fate of Muggle-born wizards and has no issues cracking down on them at all.

Deriving from this, there’s a few things I think we can take away to make a villain truly detestable.

In general, readers dislike authoritarians, especially incompetent authoritarians. Implement lots of crackdowns and show how people slip through those cracks to continue to harass the authoritarian, and the reader will grow to increasingly hate the villain.

Ambition and selfishness are also traits that engender hatred of the antagonist, especially when coupled with a complete lack of empathy or even recognition of other people. Total narcissism is a good way to piss off readers.

Fake politeness and propriety, especially obsequiousness to those perceived as higher in social rank while simultaneously completely shitting on those perceived to be lower is a good way to rile up readers, as well. Bonus points if the villain is saccharine sweet when bootlicking and a total asshat when not.

An extreme superiority complex will also help, doubly so when it’s completely 100% unearned and the character vastly, vastly believes himself or herself to be far better at everything than he or she actually is.

Vice-chancellor asked, ""Who's the leader? Grab him to me.""

Peon informed Raj and arranged a meeting. Raj went to meet vice-chancellor.

Vice-chancellor asked him angrily, ""What do you guys want?""

Raj informed, ""Our private university is reservation free for years. We won't allow caste based reservation in our university. That's our one and only demand sir. Nothing else.""

Vice-chancellor informed, ""It's decision from our new trustee Mr. Anand. We can't pull it back. Name your exam percentages and price. Quit all these leadership. Think for your self Ram, sorry, what's your name?""

Raj replied, ""It's Raj, not Ram.""

The peon interfered and reminded vice chancellor that Raj's the one who topped the university last year.

Vice-chancellor asked, ""In that case, why you're destroying your career and study? I can fail you for next term. Do you know that?""

Raj moved the curtain from the window, showed the crowd of students to vice-chancellor and replied, ""As you can see, young India don't want caste based reservation. This crowd is more than my career. Who cares about the next result on the base of injustice?""

Meanwhile, Mr. Anand entered into the VC's cabin. He found Raj and VC in the cabin. Peon offered him a seat and said, ""Sir, this guy is a leader of the student union.""

Mr. Anand smirked and asked, ""Will you fight with your community too? After all, you're also reserved, right Raj?""

Raj smiled and replied, ""Let's remove my last name for a moment. Now, I can walk. I can talk. I can work. I'm good with economical level on my own. Am I still reserved?"", he added, ""By the way, that's the difference between you and me. You're a big businessman and I'm a leader, dad.""

After these words, Raj positively said bye to everyone and added, ""Student union's decision won't change ever! It's a promise.""

VC and Peon both were shocked. When they looked at Mr. Anand. He acknowledged, ""He's on his mom. Anyway, other trustees are not happy as well and the media is covering this case. After watching student's unity, I guess we should rethink on the proposal of reservation.""

Following to Mr. Anand's words the peon thought, ""When there will be a strong unity like this in my country?"". After all, peon's son also missed the admission in medical college because of the reservation.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/506rdgawiejc7u42', 'title': 'What is a good story you can come up with about the Indian reservation system in education?

Owen Core,5y,"If you woke up to find 99.99% of the population disappeared overnight, what would you do?","DAY 1

9:00 AM - I wake up and make my bed like I always do. I’m checking my phone and looking at my feed on Instagram. Strangely, none of my friends have posted anything (which is weird since some of them post at least once an hour). I go downstairs and don’t see my mother up, but her car is still here, so I assume she’s walking our dog. I sit down and turn on the TV. I watch some Netflix, thinking it’s just a normal day.
10:00 AM - I find it weird that my mother hasn’t come back yet, I then hear the sound of my dog barking in the basement. She obviously didn’t go on a walk. I go down the steps and notice my dog sitting on my brother’s bed, but he is missing. I go back upstairs and look out the window, and his car is still there. All I can think about is where did they go. Why would they leave without their cars? I then think about my sister, I go upstairs and open her door hoping she is still home. She’s gone. I text my mom, “Where did you guys go?” waiting for a response. That’s when I hear the buzz from her purse and I see that the phone is still in there. My nerves are getting at me, so I just pace around the house thinking about where they went. I calm myself down, saying everything’s probably fine and that I’m freaking out over nothing. I settle down and turn on the news. All I see is a message saying that billions of people have disappeared over the night and nothing else. I slowly start to cry realizing that I’m all alone.
11:00 AM - I finally dry up my tears and get up. I’m still having a mental breakdown and barely functioning, but I have to start doing something. I have no idea if the power is going to stay on, so I charge up my phone (just in case) and go on my computer. I check some message boards, talk to some people, but find no one from my area. Everyone else is just as confused and shocked as I am. Just yesterday, I ate at the dinner table with all of them there, but today, they are gone. That is when I decide to leave the house.
12:00 Noon - Being a teen, I decide to take our car and drive around looking for anyone else. The garage door opens and I’m off. Before I get on the highway, I go to my next door neighbor’s house and look to see if they are okay. They have a baby, so I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t see what happened to them. None of them are there. I felt relieved knowing that the baby wasn’t left behind with no one to take care of her. Driving down the road, our city looks completely deserted. Usually, I see dozens of cars on any given day, but now it is just me. Living near a city of 195,000 people, I should see only about 20 others left. I go to the gas station, look inside to find no one. I grab some snacks and drinks (it’s not like anyone will stop me) and start looking for the other 19 who are in the same situation as me.
1:00 PM - After an hour of driving, I see no one. I decide to just stop in the downtown and wait, hoping someone will come. There has got to be at least one person who is in downtown right now, right? I yell out waiting for a response. It never comes.
3:00 PM - I make the decision to just give up on searching. Driving home, utterly defeated, I sit down on our couch with my dog Miley at my side. I wait and hope that this is just a bad dream that I will wake up from at any moment. I’m only a teenager! I shouldn’t have to be alone like this! I think.

Utilizing the power still working, I print out the directions and charge my phone. I set my alarm for 6:00 am.

What if Moby Dick, but in space, with a crew of asteroid miners?
What if the Three Furies return as Webcam/Instagram models in Chicago?
What if Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as C-suite executives at a powerful Silicon Valley VC firm?
What if the residents of a town were infected with a parasite that increased empathy and compassion, promoted greater prosocial behavior, extended lifespan…but also made carriers infertile?

I can keep this up all day. Ideas are worthless. Nobody wants to steal your idea.

You want to turn these into a book? Knock yourself out! I guarantee that if you wrote a book and I wrote a book from the same idea, our books would be nothing alike.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am 21 year old Indian girl residing in Bangalore. I am a single child of my parents and they both are working.

Last week, I had been to a mall with my mom. A man around 50 with very good personality happened to meet us. My mom spoke to him briefly and later introduced me to him. He spoke to me in a very caring manner and asked me about my studies. While leaving, I could sense a moistness in his eyes. He came close to me and kissed me on my forehead and told us bye and left. I am not comfortable with some stranger touching me like that but with him it was a bit different. I could feel care and love in that expression. I asked mom who is he. My mom told me that he is an old college friend. I asked mom why did he kiss me to which mom replied that he might be having a daughter of my age. I wasn’t convinced though.

For 2 days, I was very disturbed. There was some emotions in his touch and talk which was different. I forced mom to tell me the truth. My mom replied me that he was her ex husband. I knew it was second marriage of my mom but that topic was never discussed in my family and there was no reason to discuss that. I came to know from her that he never married again. I could sense love in his eyes for my mom and me. I asked mom why did she got divorced him to which my mom replied that it was a very brief marriage of just few months and that they were not compatible and advised me to keep past in the past. I love my dad a lot and he is a true gentleman and I always admired my mom’s choice to marry my father. But since the day I met my mom’s ex husband, I am feeling very bad for him. It seems though my mom moved on with her life, he didn’t.

I wish, I could see that angel again in my life.

Edit: To answer some of the questions raised in the comments. Yes, when he was leaving I could sense emotions in my mom’s eyes too. I asked my mom and she told me that her ex is not my biological father and also the marriage was very brief. I feel some misunderstandings might have broken their relation.

Dhawal Barot,Updated 6y,What are some beautiful stories between a father and his son?,"Once again, Raj’s father scolded him for his another silly mistake.

Raj didn’t give any excuse and just stood speechless. His wife Meera noticed everything.

Later, when Raj’s father walked out of the home, Meera asked, “You’re 40. You’re very disciplined and an obedient manager in your office. Then, Why do you behave like an immature kid at home sometimes? What’s wrong?”

Raj took a gander at his late mother's photograph, then turned to Meera and said, “Dad never said this, but after mom’s death, he feels alone. Dad ‘n’ mom were like Tom ‘n’ Jerry. Advising mom all the time was like his favorite hobby. So, whenever mom made any mistake, dad immediately used to advise mom and then fight used to happen. I know, I can’t replace his Jerry. But, I don’t want Tom to feel alone and jobless. And maybe that’s the only way how I can make his Jerry happy, wherever she is.” Furthermore, with a tear in his eye, Raj added, “I know I’m being immature, but sometimes being mature is not enough.”

Meera came close, wiped Raj’s tear. Then she held Raj’s hand in her hand, put it on her womb and said, “Your son is truly proud of his dad. Thanks for giving me another reason to make him a person like you.”

Anshu Bharti,1y,Can you write something dark and deep?,"She was as bright as a star.

Since childhood, she was known for her wisdom, intelligence, kindness and strong willpower. Being a farmer's daughter, there didn't seem any future for her.

However, the king of Malwa was impressed with her intelligence and accepted her as his daughter-in-law when she was eight years old.

She moved to the palace. It seemed life was full of roses. But soon, she realised she was sitting on thorns. She was opposed and defamed by some family members which continued for her whole life.

She was admired for her good deeds and also, criticized brutally for no reason. Her own people were envious of her but gradually she proved herself as a great emperor and ruled the state of Malwa with a great gesture. The people of Malwa adored her.

Still, she had no peace in her personal life. Her enemies were right at home. She faced all kinds of difficulties and miseries in life. She suffered silently, however she placed herself in Indian history forever.

That's how the queen Ahilyabai had been.

So never consider yourself unfortunate while going through the devastating phase of your life. There are always some people who are suffering more than you, though they have all the success and prosperity in life.

Sometimes, while climbing the ladder, you might be denounced and defamed but you stay strong and stagnant. Believe in yourself and move on, making sure that the path you have chosen for yourself is right.

All the best to you all, dear readers!

Here is a picture of Ahilyabai Holkar.

Stay Calm!

Mercedes R. Lackey,3y,How can writing a novel be bad for your health? I saw a quote from a famous novelist who insisted that this is true.,"So that would be this:

When we set off to write a novel, when we use writing to create a story, like it or not a kind of toxin that lies deep down in all humanity rises to the surface.

— Haruki Murakami

I suggest you read this instead. Writing is Unhealthy, so be Healthy

Apparently this is a myth that is very popular among the Japanese. It’s akin to the old “struggling artist” myth perpetuated in the Sturm und Drang novels in the 19th century, that in order to create true art the artist must be suffering and unhappy.

And because an artist must be suffering and unhappy, that will make his body unhealthy.

Yeah, I call bullshit. But then, I’m just a hack writing fantasy so what do I know?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4jst09o5cvlf62zd', 'title': 'How can writing a novel be bad for your health?
