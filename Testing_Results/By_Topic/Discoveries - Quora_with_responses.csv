Ishtmeet Singh,Updated 4y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"This may change your life, or a part of it, for sure.

You must know this man, right?

For those who don’t know, this gentleman is Cristiano Ronaldo, born in Portugal, is one of the most popular and talented players in Football history.

One fine day, Cristiano Ronaldo dressed up as a homeless man, with moustache and beard - went out in Madrid City to show some Football skills anonymously.

His appearance? This is how he was looking in that make-up -

No one could’ve imagined Cristiano Ronaldo behind that make up. He picks up his football, ties his (borrowed) dog to a chair and starts doing kick-ups. The disguise works.

No-one gives him a second glance. To everyone else in the Plaza, he just looks like a homeless guy trying to earn a few euros from the locals.

Occasionally, passers-by will stop to watch the homeless man's impressive football skills, especially when he decides to replicate Ronaldo's trade-mark step-overs.

Several hours pass before the heart-warming pay-off finally happens. A kid decides to play with him and the two take part in a bit of one-on-one.

After few moments, Ronaldo gives him a hug (still dressed as a tramp), picks up the ball and signs it.

The little boy looks confused, wondering why this man has signed the football - that is until Ronaldo begins to peel off the disguise, leaving his new best friend in open-mouthed wonder and on the verge of (happy) tears.

And, no doubt, everyone else was shocked.

There’s a lesson :

No one gives a fuck to your football skills, unless you're Ronaldo.

What should you learn from this?

No one in this world cares who you are, what you are doing, and what you’re going to do unless you’re someone very famous.

If you’ve an aim in life, don’t be worried about - what will he/she think about it? If you have a doubt, raise your hand and ask your professor/teacher about it, because at the end, no one cares if you ask or you choose to remain silent. If you’re thinking about a startup, consider making it a reality without a thought of - what will he/she think if it fails.

There are 7.8 billion people in this world, you can’t expect everyone to appreciate what you’re doing. Instead, you need to appreciate what you’re doing, and continue doing it.

I’ve started applying this formula in my life, and I’ve become a very strong person, than I was an year ago.

This might be the secret mantra of success.

B. Duane Smith,6y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"Shocked, surprised, impressed would describe this one. We had two dogs, one a LARGE Golden Retriever and the other a golden mix rescue dog. Gabby and Rachel. One evening we got home and both were out of their crates. Naturally, we assumed one of our two daughters had not put them in their crates. Their crates were for big dogs, sat back to back, and kept Gabby and Rachel out of “trouble” when we were gone. The crates were collapsible and had different door latches.

We left again, later in the week, only to be greeted again by Gabby and Rachel at the door when we returned. This process continued for subsequent trips to church, the store, and so on, despite making sure the dogs were in their crates and the doors secured. One evening my wife and daughters left, and I hid away out of the dogs’ sight to see what was happening. Within seconds of the garage door closing, Gabby rolled onto her back and using her paws reached up hooking her claws into the lift-up door to her crate. She was strong, too. She lifted and pushed, successfully escaping. Impressive enough, but there’s more. She immediately went to Rachel’s crate. Rachel’s latch was a deadbolt style, with a pivoting handle to slide the bolt into a looped steel bar. Using her nose, Gabby pivoted the handle up, yes it took some work because it was stiff, then nosed it open. Using her paw, she hooked her claws into the now unlocked door, swinging it open for Rachel’s escape. They proceeded to jump and play until I made a noise. Neither showed any sign of contrition, but greeted me with the same enthusiasm as if I had just returned from a trip.

At this point, we decided to fold the crates and store them in the basement.

We lost Gabby (on the right) in 2013 to bone cancer. Rachel warmed our lives with her sweet nature until 2017.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1xzdqicw5alfb6o8', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Shocked, surprised, impressed would describe this one.

Kalyani Samoju,Updated 3y,What is something you've learned in the last month?,"I have learnt something new

here it goes “WHY WE MIX ASHES OF DEAD PEOPLE IN RIVERS?”

The scientific reason behind this is

Belief on immersing ashes of dead ones to the river that relates to science. The water from the holy Ganga river and the other holy rivers is used extremely to irrigate large area of land along the river.

Since the bones are rich in phosphates their ashes increase the phosphate level in the water. Phosphates are essential ingredients for irrigating lands and growing grains. Ultimately, the elements of the body return to nature after death is achieved.

This will enrich fields and fertility of soil and increases crop production level

Hannah Johnson,5y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"Sad story ahead -

We lost our beautiful golden retriever Betty on Christmas morning a couple months ago. She had just turned 10.

My dad is in his later stages of primary progressive aphasia/Alzheimer’s and this dog was his life. My dad couldn’t speak more than five words to us but he talked ALL the time to this dog and always remembered her name.

I live four hours from my parents now. Betty had been off and on sick, but had gotten better. The vet had given antibiotics, no signs of major concern though.

We had a great walk the day before and she had acted completely giddy and normal. The next morning she was coughing and couldn’t get off the ground.

We helped her inside to rest, and ten minutes later my mom was yelling that she was unconscious. One moment here, one moment gone.

As much as it hurts, I can’t help but think she waited until I was home, and all of us were there with her. My mom works a lot still, and generally a caretaker is there for my dad. I visit once a month. The timing of this always shocked me. It couldn’t have been a coincidence. I believe she had that much love.

It was Christmas morning with no vet to cremate her when she passed. Thank goodness my friend has a ranch with some land and we got to bury her peacefully. (We live in a gated community).

My dad understood her passing extraordinarily well, and at the grave he said how we were going to miss her so much.

He picked out a page from a Curious George book, when George visits the dog show, and said “maybe we can use this”, so I buried the page with her.

She was too good for this world.

She never got old, either. This is her and my dad the day before.

Still so heartbroken.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6zf5l1ujs3wynqog', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Sad story ahead -\n\nWe lost our beautiful golden retriever Betty on Christmas morning a couple months ago.

Kaustav Dey,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"I really don’t remember where I heard this about, but this is truly an awesome hack that I have known and employ.

Life will always have competitions. A life without competitions is actually quite boring. As you all probably know, you cannot always win . Life isn’t that optimistic and fair.

Most of the time, our competitor is one who enjoys our defeat more than the prize at hand . The best way to rob them of this ‘sinister’ joy is to smile at them after losing. Yes, you read it right.

But trust me, this will totaly wreck your opponent's pride and ego after winning, and if you are lucky you might just make a friend out of them.

This is not only a way to make a come back at your opponent, but is also a way to make you self realise that this is not the end. But rather a stepping stone for you to succeed.

Here is an image of two Olympic finalists after the match. The one in the left lost the match, but she doesn’t show any sign of anger and she made a friend out of her Spanish counterpart.

Eric Leow Yu Quan,Updated 5y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"How to cut any queue.

A social experiment conducted by a university showed some unprecedented results.

In this experiment, three men were tasked to cut into a long queue of customers waiting to buy some food. Each of the men were given one line to say -

May I go first?
May I go first, because I have a family emergency?
May I go first, because I need to get some food?

It turned out that the first option led to only about 40% of customers who agreed to let him cut. The second and third options saw a resounding 94% and 89% respectively.

However, if you take a look at the third option, you'll realize that the reason provided is rather nonsensical. After all, everyone is there to buy food right? At least the second option provided a more legitimate reason.

It showed that so long as you provide a reason, any reason, people will tend to let you go first, without asking too much.

I tried this when I wanted to use the lift today after walking my dog - usually, I don't share lifts with others since no one actually likes being in a confined area with a smelly dog.

However this time, I wasn't in a mood to wait. I simply wanted to go home fast and rest, so I told the people waiting, “Sorry, can I go up first, because I'm in a hurry to wash my printer?”

True, it was gibberish, but spoken confidently, vanquished even the slightest doubts. They were probably confused, but let me use the lift nonetheless.

At least the second option provided a more legitimate reason.\n\nIt showed that so long as you provide a reason, any reason, people will tend to let you go first, without asking too much.\n\nI tried this when I wanted to use the lift today after walking my dog - usually, I don't share lifts with others since no one actually likes being in a confined area with a smelly dog.\n\nHowever this time, I wasn't in a mood to wait. I simply wanted to go home fast and rest, so I told the people waiting, “Sorry, can I go up first, because I'm in a hurry to wash my printer?”\n\nTrue, it was gibberish, but spoken confidently, vanquished even the slightest doubts. They were probably confused, but let me use the lift nonetheless.\n\nThis trick works really well if you're not going to be seeing the very people you're using it on anymore."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9805
Asim Qureshi,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"About 15 years ago I’m visiting my mother’s cousin after not seeing him for a long time.

A few hours into our meeting he stares at me and says “Asim son… why do you always smile at me when I look at you?”

Do I? I don’t know. And I tell him that.

I soon realise that I do smile a lot, and several years later I come to the view that it has played a key role in achieving the success I have attained at work and in business.

Smiling breaks down barriers, it makes tense situations into more comfortable ones, it makes you more attractive, it gives a sense of energy, it makes people want to be around you, it makes you more likeable, it makes people feel that you want to be around them, it makes people trust you.

Smiling is very powerful, massively underestimated.

And I semi-consciously knew it all along. Which is why I did it.

It also makes everyone happier, including you.

Adam Smith,4y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"So this adorable little muffin is named Commander William T. Riker, AKA my Number 1.

This is the day I adopted him from the SPCA, I nearly fought an old lady. She heard me tell my friend this was the guy for me then she tried to adopt him right out from under me!

Although I’ve had a lot of cats in my life, and I would describe them all as happy and well adjusted, I don’t think I ever realized a cat could be so capable of loving a person back. We tend to think of dogs as loving, needy creatures who always want to be at your side while cats are more solitary and less social. Well, this little guy has completely changed my understanding of cats.

When he was a kitten he always needed to be on my chest or around my face and he would purr like crazy!

He was so desperate to be at my side all the time that I eventually caved and got him a leash so he could follow me out the door.

So I guess it’s not about learning something shocking about my pet, so much as he taught me something shocking about his entire species. I thought a cat would be a quiet companion sitting on the other side of the room but he loves me so much he never leaves my side. It took me a long time to teach him how to give me space while I’m sleeping (he would lie down so close to my face that his whiskers would tickle me while he waited for my eyes to open) but now if I leave town for a day or two he falls apart and when I come home he reverts completely back to that desperate-for-love little kitten who can’t stop needing me long enough to get some sleep.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6lv7d3yjgeps210k', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'So this adorable little muffin is named Commander William T.

Matthew Bates,6y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"She actually likes her crate.

When no one is home, my mini goldendoodle stays in a crate. It’s plenty big enough for her. We read that this is better than just letting her run free around the house, because so much space and freedom, coupled with loneliness, can lead to anxiety. I was against the crate at first, but decided to give it a try anyway. The crate is covered on all sides except the door, so it’s like a little den for her.

One day, I was looking for her so I could take her for a walk, and I couldn’t find her. I started to freak out, thinking that she was already outside, unsupervised. Finally, after about 10 minutes of searching, I found her, cuddled up in her crate, perfectly content, taking a nap. The door to the crate had been left open, and she went inside even though she didn’t have to.

Now, even when we’re home, we leave the door to her crate open, in case she wants to go into it. She often does.

Tracy Oliver,3y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"About three years ago, I wanted a cat. I love tuxedos; I really think they are something special.

Cue this guy.

His name is Othello. Apparently, he got into a fight in the county shelter one county up from us and was transferred to my county. That should have been my first warning he was trouble. He has a tiny triangle of his left ear that’s missing (it’s not even visible in this one.)

But he was warm, sweet, and cuddly. Just beautiful.

Two weeks in, we are at my mum’s house. I’m trying to bake, but Mr. Tux here decides he wants snacks from the plastic shelving where we kept the pet supplies. A two-hour battle ensues, where I pull him down and five minutes later, he’s back up there again. I finally pulled everything about 6 feet away from the shelving, thinking it will stop him jumping up there.

I go back to what I was doing, and then I hear a crash.

“Darn that cat…” as I walk over there to scold him for the 85th time.

He was hanging off the side of the pet shelf by both front feet, having leaped the 6 feet across the room. I asked him if he thought he was James Bond or something.

I have also discovered:

He can open flip lids with his nose or his paws. I made this crucial mistake when I got his adoptive brother, who was a kitten at the time. I bought kitten food for Mercury and after a half hour’s consideration, trying to outwit my cat again, bought a container with a flip lid. I mimed having paws when I bought the darn thing. I thought I was smart. I left for a night and came back in the morning. There’s the kitten food, spilled all over the floor. The two of them obviously thought I wasn’t coming back and decided to fend for themselves.

He will destroy any package left within reach. He destroyed all the dry soup packets my mother had downstairs in the basement. No idea on that one.

He has busted the screen on my porch TWICE in order to get out into the Great Wide Open. I don’t mean going through it - I mean prying it loose from the wood surrounding the bottom.

I cannot leave one gap in the lid of the food bucket (NOT a flip lid) I keep the kitty kibble and the snacks in, or he will pry the lid off in ten minutes or less. He checks every night. One night, my sister was over and I didn’t attach the lid properly. My sister and I were watching a movie and we heard the lid clatter to the floor. 10 minutes.

He has been known to eat puppy food and dog biscuits.

When angry, he hits things -the curtains, the side of the fridge, the wall, any paper bag that’s handy. Just beats his paws on whatever surface is nearby. He pitched a fit last summer when he broke the screen the first time and I would not let him out. A full on temper tantrum, beating on the door and howling like he was being tortured.

I don’t dare leave food out anywhere he can find it. Anything I make is put away in the fridge or weighted down under stuff he can’t shove off. I have been known to booby-trap stuff so I can hear lids falling if he attempts to knock them around!

He eats plants. We now have one. I experienced to strategize locations to put this one so he wouldn’t nibble it to demise. For his security, i'll n't have any toxic plants in the house.

He really loves everybody but me personally. Folks come to your house, and he’s Mr. Personality. Loves everyone. Leaps into laps, cuddles, nice little kitty. I will be mother, and clearly we’re caught with each other, so he doesn’t just like me all that much because We curb his widespread enthusiasm for destruction and mayhem.

I love him dearly and he tends to make life interesting, but oi.

If you have trouble choosing, flip a coin. While you're waiting to get the result, your mind automatically starts to wish for what it wants. Then you can choose easily.
Honey does not go bad; if it has gone solid it has just crystallized and can become liquid again with just a little heat.
If you put something down temporarily, say out loud ""I've put the screwdriver by the microwave"" or whatever.
Read the three and four star reviews for the most reliable information on Amazon items.
When moving house, always set up your bedroom/ make the bed first so when you’re exhausted and just had enough you can fall into bed. Nothing worse than being exhausted and having to make the bed before getting into it
If there's a jar or container you can't open, run the lid under hot water for about 30sec. Dry it so you can get a good grip, then open. It really works.
Secretaries, tech support, and janitors are the true power in an office. Make friends with them and you’ll be able to get anything you need!
When a friend is upset, ask him one simple question before saying anything else: “Do you want to talk about it or do you want to distract from it? ”
It is important to know when to stop arguing with people, and simply let them be wrong.
If someone offers you something you want, take it. Don't decline every kind of offer out of politeness.

Hope my answer is helpful.

Kristine Alden,Updated 4y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"I have a beautiful little Blue-fronted Amazon parrot names Sophie. She’s 6 years old and so bonded to me that she throws tantrums when I leave the room. She has also regurgitated food and tried to feed it to me, like she would if I was her baby.

Lately, she has been displaying what I consider to be incredibly considerate and conscientious behavior.

I’ve been recovering from radiation therapy for thyroid cancer, and as a result, taking a lot of naps. Most of the time, these naps occur in my recliner, which is in the living room, near her cage. I’ve noticed that, when I’m sleeping, she goes completely silent, and sometimes just whispers to herself. As soon as she sees my eyes open, she loudly says “Hiiii, pretty girl!”, then starts chattering away with all of her favorite words.

I know parrots are very intelligent, but her behavior describes an actual conscience, which, to me, suggests that they’re much more intelligent that we give them credit for. I would never have believed that an animal could actually show consideration and empathy like she does.

I love this little birdie with all my heart, and I know she loves me too.

Edit: I’ll attempt to attach a video, to show how talkative and sweet Sophie is ❤️","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pahrzd795kx21oen', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I have a beautiful little Blue-fronted Amazon parrot names Sophie.

Balmiki Ghosh (বাল্মীকি ঘোষ),Updated 4y,What have people discovered while doing their job?,"Radhanath Sikdar was working as the Chief Computer in the Great Trigonometric Survey office in Kolkata in 1851. Here, apart from his duties of the GTS, he also served as the Superintendent of the Meteorological department. Before joining the position, he had spent decades in the field, carrying out geological expeditions for measurement and data collection.

His superior, Colonel Waugh, had tasked him to perform calculations on the trigonometric measurement data collected for the snow-capped mountains near the Darjeeling region. One day, while working on the calculations for one of the peaks, the result struck him. A certain peak’s data, Peak XV, was throwing a result which he could not have thought of. He poured himself into analyzing the raw data and measurements, examined the hand-drawn maps, and was astonished to find that he had discovered something unique. As if suddenly, Peak XV was taking shape from the abstract measurements, emerging from the maps and calculations, growing larger and larger and larger, reaching for the heavens.

Radhanath burst into the office of his superior. He did not even bother to knock. Colonel Waugh was not pleased, as he was in a meeting.

“What is it Sikdar?” he asked.

“Sir,” said Radhanath, almost breathless. “I believe we have found the highest point on Earth.”

“Are you sure?” asked Waugh.

“Sir, I am very much certain. But I understand your concern. It is really hard to believe that these remarkable measurements were lying in our office unnoticed for all these years. But I am confident of my analysis,” said Sikdar resolutely.

Colonel Waugh had faith in Radhanath as well. He knew his subordinate was gifted in the mathematics required for trigonometric measurements. He also had extensive field experience. He took Radhanath’s claims very seriously.

For the next few days they went through the observations taken from six different locations. The conclusion was correct. Peak XV was without a doubt the tallest in the world. Radhanath gave a full report to Waugh, who was cautious enough not to announce this discovery before checking with other data. When, after some years, he was convinced, only then did he publicly announce it.

When it came to the question of naming the peak, the norm at the time was that while naming a peak, the local name should be preferred. Some suggested that the peak be named after the then British Monarch and Empress of India, Queen Victoria.

“Sir, I propose the peak be named after George Everest. He was pioneer in our field in India and instrumental in setting up the Great Trigonometric Survey. He took many like me under his wing and taught us what we know. By naming the peak after him we will be a honoring his contributions.” suggested Radhanath to Colonel Waugh.

“Hmm!” said Waugh, who had also worked under George Everest and held him in high regard. “I like the name. But let’s name the peak Everest and not George Everest. The word Everest has a ring to it and a gravity which will be absolutely suitable for the world’s tallest mountain peak. The name has a certain magnanimity befitting such a giant. Peak XV will indeed be named as Mount Everest.”

And that is the story of how someone discovered Mount Everest while doing his job in a government office in Kolkata.

When the news got published, it caused great celebrations. It was an age of discovery, when explorers and scholars were discovering many unknown cultures, landmarks, history and geography of the planet. Unfortunately, most of the major newspapers conveniently forgot to publish the name of the non-white Indian officer, Radhanath Sikdar, or give him the due credit for his contributions. Only a couple printed his name as the clerk working in the GTS office who stumbled upon the discovery.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0z8tdryopu2wvmkl', 'title': 'What have people discovered while doing their job?', 'score': {'original': 0.6889, 'ai': 0.3111}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Radhanath Sikdar was working as the Chief Computer in the Great Trigonometric Survey office in Kolkata in 1851.

Bec Koshak,5y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"About three years ago, I wanted a cat. I love tuxedos; I really think they are something special.

Cue this guy.

His name is Othello. Apparently, he got into a fight in the county shelter one county up from us and was transferred to my county. That should have been my first warning he was trouble. He has a tiny triangle of his left ear that’s missing (it’s not even visible in this one.)

But he was warm, sweet, and cuddly. Just beautiful.

Two weeks in, we are at my mum’s house. I’m trying to bake, but Mr. Tux here decides he wants snacks from the plastic shelving where we kept the pet supplies. A two-hour battle ensues, where I pull him down and five minutes later, he’s back up there again. I finally pulled everything about 6 feet away from the shelving, thinking it will stop him jumping up there.

I go back to what I was doing, and then I hear a crash.

“Darn that cat…” as I walk over there to scold him for the 85th time.

He was hanging off the side of the pet shelf by both front feet, having leaped the 6 feet across the room. I asked him if he thought he was James Bond or something.

I have also discovered:

He can open flip lids with his nose or his paws. I made this crucial mistake when I got his adoptive brother, who was a kitten at the time. I bought kitten food for Mercury and after a half hour’s consideration, trying to outwit my cat again, bought a container with a flip lid. I mimed having paws when I bought the darn thing. I thought I was smart. I left for a night and came back in the morning. There’s the kitten food, spilled all over the floor. The two of them obviously thought I wasn’t coming back and decided to fend for themselves.

He will destroy any package left within reach. He destroyed all the dry soup packets my mother had downstairs in the basement. No idea on that one.

He has busted the screen on my porch TWICE in order to get out into the Great Wide Open. I don’t mean going through it - I mean prying it loose from the wood surrounding the bottom.

I cannot leave one gap in the lid of the food bucket (NOT a flip lid) I keep the kitty kibble and the snacks in, or he will pry the lid off in ten minutes or less. He checks every night. One night, my sister was over and I didn’t attach the lid properly. My sister and I were watching a movie and we heard the lid clatter to the floor. 10 minutes.

He has been known to eat puppy food and dog biscuits.

When angry, he hits things -the curtains, the side of the fridge, the wall, any paper bag that’s handy. Just beats his paws on whatever surface is nearby. He pitched a fit last summer when he broke the screen the first time and I would not let him out. A full on temper tantrum, beating on the door and howling like he was being tortured.

I don’t dare leave food out anywhere he can find it. Anything I make is put away in the fridge or weighted down under stuff he can’t shove off. I have been known to booby-trap stuff so I can hear lids falling if he attempts to knock them around!

He eats plants. I currently have one. I had to strategize where to put this one so he wouldn’t nibble it to death. For his safety, I will not have any poisonous plants in the house.

He loves everybody but me. People come to the house, and he’s Mr. Personality. Loves everyone. Leaps into laps, cuddles, sweet little kitty. I am Mom, and obviously we’re stuck with each other, so he doesn’t like me all that much because I curb his rampant enthusiasm for destruction and mayhem.

I love him dearly and he makes life interesting, but oi. I spend half my life outwitting him. It’s exhausting.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pt7galewkym5zs61', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.8917, 'ai': 0.1083}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'About three years ago, I wanted a cat.

He checks every night. One night, my sister was over and I didn’t attach the lid properly. My sister and I were watching a movie and we heard the lid clatter to the floor. 10 minutes.\n\nHe has been known to eat puppy food and dog biscuits.\n\nWhen angry, he hits things -the curtains, the side of the fridge, the wall, any paper bag that’s handy. Just beats his paws on whatever surface is nearby. He pitched a fit last summer when he broke the screen the first time and I would not let him out. A full on temper tantrum, beating on the door and howling like he was being tortured.\n\nI don’t dare leave food out anywhere he can find it. Anything I make is put away in the fridge or weighted down under stuff he can’t shove off. I have been known to booby-trap stuff so I can hear lids falling if he attempts to knock them around!\n\nHe eats plants. I currently have one. I had to strategize where to put this one so he wouldn’t nibble it to death. For his safety, I will not have any poisonous plants in the house.\n\nHe loves everybody but me. People come to the house, and he’s Mr. Personality. Loves everyone. Leaps into laps, cuddles, sweet little kitty. I am Mom, and obviously we’re stuck with each other, so he doesn’t like me all that much because I curb his rampant enthusiasm for destruction and mayhem.\n\nI love him dearly and he makes life interesting, but oi. I spend half my life outwitting him. It’s exhausting.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.8917

Amelia Williams,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Asking someone’s name. We've all had that moment where you don't remember someone’s name and it's really embarrassing because you don't know what to do. I’m an awkward person with really bad memory so this has saved me so many times.

Ask the person, “Hey, what's your name again?” They’ll be sad that you forgot their name but they’ll tell you anyway. You then say, “No, your last name!” The person will be happy again and tell you their last name, thinking it’s just a casual question. So now you know their name (first and last) and it’s not totally embarrassing! Honestly, this has saved me multiple times.

Edit: A lot of people are asking what to do if the person tells you their first and last name when you ask. For me, I would say, “(Last name!) That’s right.

Anonymous,7y,What do you wish that you hadn't found out?,"When my husband died it was very sudden. I was in shock and left with children and mounds of paperwork to sort through. When I was on his computer I found he was on several dating sites. There were pictures of one woman in particular. She was gorgeous. There were even pictures of her with a child I can only assume was her son. My husband had been traveling extensively to another state for business purposes for about a year before he died.

I started to read one of the emails they had exchanged. Then I stopped.

After I thought about it for a few days I went back and deleted it all.

I had a long marriage to this man and I didn’t want to think of him and this woman. It wasn’t that I was in denial. She was not a part of our marriage. I thought focusing on her wasn’t necessary. I just want to remember us together without a third person.

I don’t regret this. If I had read the emails I’d remember all of it, all their words to each other, what he may or may not have said about me. Did I need that? No.

Rakesh Jilla,6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Back in Jersey, I used to get my food delivered from an Indian restaurant every other day. This restaurant had its own free delivery service and since I ordered so regularly, I know the delivery guys personally (there were 3 different people who delivered the food) and the owner of the restaurant. To the restaurant’s credit they offered good food and I left a good tip every time I ordered.

I used to take a bus ride for work and the restaurant was near my office. I missed my bus one day and decided to walk to my apartment. As I was walking, I passed by this Indian restaurant and I thought to order food to-go. I went in and introduced myself to the restaurant owner. As it has been months that I was ordering food from this restaurant, the owner immediately recognized me and greeted me warmly.

As I was ordering the food, I suddenly remembered a funny little idea that I read somewhere before. I thought why not I apply it here? I felt that I am going to wait for the food anyway, why not experiment? So I stopped my order and went aside. I then called the restaurant and said I wanted to place an order for delivery. The restaurant owner laughed and said why do I want to do that? He mentioned he saw me just now. I laughingly said I changed my mind and decided I want an order for delivery and not a pickup.

He was confused for a minute, but he took my order anyway. I then hang up and waited for about 10 minutes before entering the restaurant again. The owner was surprised to see me and asked what am I doing here. He asked does he need to cancel the delivery and make it a pick-up instead. I said that is not required and requested to let me know when the food was ready. He gave me a weird look and mentioned he would. After some time he said the food is ready and he asked his worker to get the food delivered.

The delivery guy knows me as well. We greeted each other before the owner, while the owner was handing over the delivery bag. Now, I asked them whether it would be okay if I can ride in his car to my apartment?

The owner paused a second, and then laughed. He said “I knew something was up when you didn’t want the pick-up but I wasn’t expecting this. Of course you can take a ride.” I thanked him and got into the car. I got a free ride to my apartment.

I did this a few times when I missed my bus. Since I was a regular, both the delivery guy and the owner never minded giving me a free ride to my apartment. It was fun for sometime.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6s1p3fxm0a5z8eiy', 'title': ""What is the most clever life hack you've learned?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Back in Jersey, I used to get my food delivered from an Indian restaurant every other day.

Tim Mapp,6y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"I have already answered this question but I’ve got more. A similar escape artist story reminded me about Ellie.

She met me at the door of my travel trailer one day, but she was supposed to be in her kennel. How did she get out?? The first time she pulled and one of the hooks of the collapsible kennel came unhooked. This gave her a gap to squeeze through. So I bought some stainless steel zip ties and made the kennel un collapsible. Problem solved. So I thought.

Yep. This sweet little girl did that.

She simply would not be contained. I even bought a Kong brand kennel. It was tough enough she couldn’t break the wires like on the other one, but she had another trick up her sleeve. She figured out that if she pulled really hard on the top panel that it would pop the latch, one that had to be lifted before the door could open, then she could pick up on the door and get out. It’s kind of hard to explain, but if you have a Kong kennel then you know what latch I’m talking about. I was actually impressed by her determination lol.

I don’t know that this one really shocked me, but it sure was a helluva deal. I rescued a dog one time that I found on the side of the road. It was on my job site out in the middle of nowhere. There are some houses around but they are pretty spread out. So I took her around to each one but no one would claim her. A local even put her on Facebook so I waited a couple days.

No one claimed her so I took her to the vet for a check up and to get all her shots. The vet said she appeared to be pretty healthy and would likely be a pretty good dog. He said to bring her back in a couple weeks after she settled in and he would spay her. So I did.

When I went to get her he said..we need to talk. Uh oh. He said no no no she’s fine. But. I tried and tried but I just could not find her uterus. He said he was 99.99% sure she was already spayed. He then said if she comes into heat just bring her back and He’d spay her for free. Then. He charged me $185 and sent us on our way. Thanks for nothing, doc!

I had all intentions of rehoming her. But I got attached. I just couldn’t handle letting her go. Not sure what breed she is. It doesn’t matter but I am curious. I’d say she’s mixed. Resembles a Jack Russell in her markings but I don’t think her face does.

The day I found her.

How could I rehome her??","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r1gvao6wfb3jlsk2', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I have already answered this question but I’ve got more.

Henrey Bradley,2y,What are some amazing accidental archaeological discoveries?,"One of the most important archaeological finds of all time, the key that unlocked the secrets of an ancient civilisation, and gave birth to an entire field of Archaeology, was found by accident.

The rather peculiar series of events surrounding this accidental find occurred when a rather famous vertically challenged Corsican genius named Napoleon, hatched a cunning plan and commanded a campaign to conquer Egypt and the Levant between 1798–1801.

At first, Napoleon knew nothing but victory, the French army annihilated the Mamluk forces at the Battle of the Pyramids, 21 July 1798.

After securing his stunning victory, Napoleon had effectively cemented the French conquest of Ottoman Egypt, his glorious campaign seemed all but unstoppable.

Then another vertically challenged genius rocked up, this time from Britain, and sank Napoleon's entire Navy at the Battle of the Nile [ https://www.quora.com/Who-defeated-Napoleon-in-the-Battle-of-the-Nile/answer/Henrey-Bradley-1 ] and ruined all of Napoleon’s glorious plans.

With the British sailing indomitable warships around with impunity, pissing Napoleon off, blocking the Corsican from withdrawing his massive French Army, and threatening to launch a counter-invasion of Egypt, Napoleon was forced to begin strengthening the neglected Egyptian coastal defences.

This is where we get to the Archaeological find, you see dear reader, one of the forts that defended the mouth of the Nile was in ruins, this Fort Julien had originally been built around 1470 by a Mamluk Sultan, and desperately required repairs and updating.

A detachment of French soldiers and engineers set about rebuilding and expanding the fort, old walls were knocked down and the stone reused to strengthen and build gun emplacements.

While digging foundations to expand the fort, an ancient stone wall was found, and on the 15 of July 1799, the French soldiers discovered a large black basalt slab, built into the ancient wall.

This irregular shaped black slab had clearly been broken by extreme force long ago, but its unusual colour and shape paled in comparison to what made it stand out, for the face of the slab was inscribed from top to bottom with a script which was written in three different languages.

A great deal of recognition should go to the officer in charge who realised that this slab was special, his name was Pierre-François Bouchard, and he recognised even while in an ancient land surrounded by old stuff he didn't understand, that this strange piece of broken masonry was important.

He had discovered the Rosetta Stone.

The three scripts inscribed on the ancient slab are Greek, Egyptian hieroglyphics and Egyptian demotic. The ancient Greek script told archaeologists that it was inscribed by priests to honour the king of Egypt, Ptolemy V, in 196 B.C.

More importantly, the Greek passage declared that the three scripts were all identical in meaning. For 20...

Karmanya Singh,7y,What is the most interesting scientific fact?,"Our brain thinks on the Logarithmic Scale, instead of the additive scale. This means that our brain thinks in proportions instead of differences.

Thus, we subconsciously believe that the difference between 2 and 1 is greater than the difference between 3 and 2 and so on...

The first scale here is the logarithmic scale while the second one is the commonly used additive scale.

It comes in handy in most practical life situations but sometimes, it causes some problems too.

Take a look at the following scenarios

Case 1: There is one tiger in front of you.
Case 2: There are two tigers in front of you.

Obviously, you are more scared in case 2 than you are scared in case 1.

Case 3: There are 100 tigers in front of you.
Case 4: There are 101 tigers in front of you.

Now in cases 3 and 4, even though the difference in the number of tigers is the same, the difference in the fear you feel in case 4 is negligible to the fear in case 3, whereas this difference is quite substantial in cases 1 and 2.

This is because, in cases 1 and 2, the no. of tigers gets doubled. Hence the proportion is comparatively larger, than in cases 3 and 4.

Thus, logarithmic thinking helps our survival instincts and judge cases practically and comes in handy.

But in some cases, logarithmic thinking causes problems too. You wouldn't be as happy on getting a $5 discount on a $2000 object as you would be on getting a $5 discount on a $10 object.

This is because, in the first case, you are getting a lower proportion of discount whereas in the other case, the proportion of discount is greater. Although, the amount of the discount is the same i.e. 5 dollars.

Hence, even though we learn to count on the additive scale, our brains were wired to count on the logarithmic one.

Credits: Vsauce I saw this on a video by Vsauce on Youtube and then found it to be true on various websites. I wanted this fact to be available to the people on Quora too, a platform where various people find such facts to be interesting and new.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dhnoyuwlzvpb91f6', 'title': 'What is the most interesting scientific fact?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Our brain thinks on the Logarithmic Scale, instead of the additive scale.

Janin Micklechefski,Updated 4y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"I never knew or understood the love of a dog until there was Little Girl.

I never understood why people got so bent out of shape over their dogs. I hate to admit that now but I just didn't get it. I never disliked dogs nor have I ever mistreated an animal; I always felt like I could live without them.

Until Little Girl.

One night on the side of a highway, leaving a casino three little puppies followed me to my car. They were obviously infested with worms, fleas and ticks. They were skinny with very bloated bellies.

I thought, oh, I'll take one fix it up and give it to my son. He'd like a dog. Wow, I'm such a nice person helping this dog.

I picked what I thought was the cutest puppy. I carried the puppy to my car and what I then would have described as the not so cutest little brown mutt of a puppy, followed me to my car. As I put her brother in my car I saw her little face looking up at me, literally pleading with me to take her too.

I tried to ignore her, and went back inside the casino to find my friend. We came back out to leave and there was that not so cute brown little mutt waiting for me, following me to car. E wasn't crying or begging but looking up at me with those eyes. Little did I know, that little puppy girl would steal my heart and completely change my understanding of dogs and pets!

I realized how cruel that would be to only take one of the puppies and leave the others, sick in the cold. I brought all three puppies with me, my intention was to get them healthy and find them homes. I still only planned on keeping the first one I picked out.

I brought them home and fixed them all up; dewormed them, got rid of ear mites, fleas and ticks and gave them their first shots.

I began to fall in love with the little brown not so cute little mutt puppy. She was the sweetest most enduring dog. She loved to make you happy, and she loved it when you loved her back. I began to see how beautiful she was, how deserving she was. I found myself vowing to protect her, to love her always.

I found her brothers good homes, but Little Girl was endured to me forever!

Little Girl went everywhere with me, she loved to jump up in the bed and know you loved her too. She loved when I sang special songs to her in the car about her name! ( “ She's a little girl, she's a sweet little girl, she's a fun little girl, she's a pretty little girl, she's my little girl”) she would try to sing and howl back. She loved being warm and wearing sweaters. She was very smart, she would go to and stay on her blanket upon command. She was easily potty trained. She never ran away, because she loved us. And she knew we loved her.

I never thought I would love a dog, until Little Girl showed me how much I could be loved by her!

Sadly, Little Girl was stolen by the people we rented a room from in December of 2018.

**EDIT**I rented a room from a woman i didn't really know because we were getting ready to move out of state. The woman I rented a room from took Little Girl from our room in the middle of the night in an attempt to get us to move out. This happened just days after I paid her a full months rent for the room. It's a long story, and a sad one. But my car was towed in the middle of the night from the driveway without my knowledge just days after Little Girl went missing, in it was most of our belongings. The police did nothing, they said they would not make an arrest because it was a misdemeanor.**

My son wants to rescue animals now, and we both have a newfound passion for animals, and finding a way to make sure they are loved and cared for, just as they love and care for us!

Alex Cooper,4y,What are the most fascinating science facts?,"Tree-Induced Desiccation of a Deceased Doggo

When someone says “tree bark,” what comes to mind? Probably not this:

But yes — it’s exactly what it looks like — a mummified dog stuck up a tree.

Sorry for the morbid nature of this one, but it is an interesting, albeit a bit of a sad and gruesome story.

Loggers found the petrified pooch when they cut the top off a chestnut oak tree to load it into their truck. He must have shimmied 28 feet up, through a hole in the trunk.

As it’s a hunting dog, it’s assumed that he was chasing something up the tree, but got stuck when the tree narrowed. There evidently wasn’t anyone there to help him, either, so there he remained, until the loggers found him.

Why didn’t the doggo decompose?

Normally when a person or an animal dies, the microbes in the body are left unchecked by biological processes that keep them under control in living creatures. Without the usual guardians in place, they begin to eat the body, and then the microorganisms in the gut start the process of putrefaction. ""They grow, they reproduce, and they start taking over the body,"" Killgrove told Newsweek. ""That's the disgusting part."" The body bloats and decays, and bacteria, fungi, insects and other animals come to eat the remains.

But this isn't what happened with (the dog) in that chestnut oak that would become his coffin. Chestnut oaks contain tannin, which is used to tan animal pelts and prevent decay. Tannin is a natural ""desiccant,"" or material that absorbs moisture and dries out its surroundings.

The low-moisture environment stopped the microbial activity, Killgrove explained. And no microbial activity means no decay.[1]

He wasn’t eaten in the subsequent years, because the shape and position of the tree also made it hard for anything to smell him.

He’s now on display in Southern Forest World, locked in a perpetual struggle to catch whatever it was that caused his predicament.

Good boys deserve better than this.

At least he’s treated with the respect he deserves…

His name? Stuckie.

He must have shimmied 28 feet up, through a hole in the trunk.\n\nAs it’s a hunting dog, it’s assumed that he was chasing something up the tree, but got stuck when the tree narrowed.

Without the usual guardians in place, they begin to eat the body, and then the microorganisms in the gut start the process of putrefaction. ""They grow, they reproduce, and they start taking over the body,"" Killgrove told Newsweek. ""That\'s the disgusting part."" The body bloats and decays, and bacteria, fungi, insects and other animals come to eat the remains.\n\nBut this isn\'t what happened with (the dog) in that chestnut oak that would become his coffin.

Ayan Srivastava,Updated 8mo,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"[NOTE]: If you find this answer behind a paywall, do not pay for it. You can read it directly from my profile ; I haven’t monetized anything!

If you're a nerd like me, chances are you buy lots of pens!

Purchasing them in bulk, it may happen 2 out of 10 just don't work properly later , and you’ll feel duped! :(

But you're at the shop right now! You ain't got time to write essays with each pen.

Here is a simple test to rapidly check if they work or not.

Ask the shopkeeper for a piece of paper & rapidly make an “8″ (eight) on paper(clean the paper of any dust first)

Notice the region the arrow indicates. The pen is not working properly when a stroke at that angle(or tangent) is made. Hence the line isn’t as thick ; in fact if you specifically make a line along that direction(with speed) the pen might not even work!

Note: It may work perfectly fine in other directions. Also, speed is crucial!

For those of you who are interested in why this works, we’ll have jump into circles and tangents. Tangent is just a line you draw at a point on circle.

A circle can be said to made up of infinite tangents. Each tangent is a line.

(I know I know, I am an artist🤣)

Red = Tangent(with arrow, indicating direction)
Black = Circle
Blue dot = points where tangents are made

Concept: Note that drawing this circle makes sure your pen covers the “entire range of motions possible”, because you cover all possible tangents/lines when you draw a circle.

When you draw an “8” (or infinity symbol), you are actually drawing two circles(one anticlockwise and one clockwise). Not only do you cover entire range of motion, you do the same in other direction too(this time tangent direction will be reversed)

(upper anticlockwise ; lower clockwise)

Hence, instead of furiously scribbling on a pad the next time you’re at the stationery shop, try this. Works like a charm!

EDIT: Well, my 1st answer and >250 upvotes. I feel like a star 😂😂(Won’t lie, this will indeed motivated me to write more, this being one of my first proper answers)

Now for another bonus tip:

(WARNING: This may permanently tilt/damage the nib. But don’t worry its very easy. Do it with some practice on a cheap pen first)

If you ever find your pen suddenly stop working(say its very irregular) use this trick. This happens a lot with cheap ball point pens ; gel pens are usually sufficiently fluid so no problem with them.

Light up a match. wait for 1 second .
Take your pen’s tip(and be EXTREMELY PRECISE here) and put the tip over the flame of the matchstick. Make sure the point where the tip and the plastic of the pen meet is sufficiently far away from the flame else that part will melt. It should be neither too close nor too far.
Rotate the pen as the tip is heating tip. FINISH THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WITHIN 1.5 SECOND. This is because as the metal heats up the junction between the tip and plastic may melt and tip will start to droop. But if you keep rotating it will heat uniformly and won’t droop down. Again, don’t bring it too close to the flame.

4. Remove the tip from the flame, let it fully cool down in air. Then write on paper.(Apply “a little” extra force initially). The pen should work fine.

Tamara Jessup,Updated 4y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"I was between homes, staying in what I'll charitably call a budget motel, when I learned that my 16-lb. miniature schnoodle, Schatzi, has the courage of a dog ten times his size and loves me enough that when I'm truly threatened, he'll display it for all it's worth.

About midnight I was awakened by a sound I'd never heard before and haven't heard since: my fuzzy sidekick growlng loudly enough to awaken me (I'm NOT a light sleeper, either!). As I blinked myself awake to figure out why on Earth he was doing this, I realized that the door was open and a nervous young man was silhouetted in the doorway, his eyes riveted on my dog. Schatzi was standing beside me on the bed between me and the door, legs stiff, hackles raised, making that unbelievably LOUD sound non-stop. I wasn't willing to just leap out of bed to repulse the intruder because I slept au naturel then and, of course, it was possible he was armed. His eyes darted around the room for a few seconds and he spotted the only thing of value in the room, my prized possession - my cell phone, charging on the dresser beside the door. He reached for it, actually had it in his hand, when, with Schatzi STILL growling in the background, I quietly said, “Put down my phone and get the Hell out of my room.” I'll never be sure why, but he did, and sprinted away. Only then did my small hero fall silent.

I closed the door, wedged a chair under the knob, moved my phone and charger into the bathroom, then probably petted Schatzi for an hour before I could go back to sleep.

The next day, I bought that dog a hamburger!

This happened about 5 years ago, less than 2 years after my late husband and I sprung him from a neighboring city's municipal shelter. He's my first dog, and may well be my only one. Schatzi will be an IMPOSSIBLE act to follow.

Here's a recent photo of Schatzi:

Christopher Stanton,3y,What is the most shocking thing you discovered your favorite food contains?,"My absolute favorite hot dog is the Danish røde pølser (red sausage). They have never been available in America due to food coloring issues. I always presumed that this meant the presence of red dye № 5.

After being Editor-in-Chief for a newsletter circulated to over 10,000 people, part of my duties was reviewing the science writing of my colleague, Mika. She wrote an excellent piece about cochineal, the brilliant red dye extracted from cactus-eating bugs in Mexico. This dye was so powerful that it became an important trade item.

Only in the last few months did it dawn upon me that Denmark’s use of carmine lake food coloring (which includes cochineal as a colorant) was the most probable reason for røde pølser not being available in America.

And wouldn’t you know it. A quick search today turned up that Danish røde pølser, indeed, do use natural red 4, which contains cochineal. So, it is likely that the American restrictions on insect matter in food are preventing the importation of my beloved røde pølser.

Those who have never tasted these skinny little tube steaks will never understand their addictiveness. People, literally, race off the plane and head straight to the nearest pølsevogn (hot dog wagon) to get their fix.

Jennifer McGrath,5y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"My rescue kitten (okay, she’s 9 now, but she’s tiny) from Japan is crazy for baked goods.

In my prefecture, there was a bakery that made a bread they called Fondue Bread. It was a round loaf, soft and chewy, filled with a gooey cheese. I adored it, but the bakery was over an hour away by train and then a long walk. I bought it very rarely. The first time I left one unattended, I came back to the bag ripped open and chunks of the bread and cheese gobbled up by my sweet feline.

When we moved to Seoul, my husband made a mincemeat pie for Thanksgiving. We left it to cool on top of the range while we saw a movie. We came home to a cat-head shaped hole in the top of the pie.

She will stalk me for donuts, cake, cookies, pizza. She has dragged XL sized pizza boxes around the house, trying to open them. She once even locked me out of my apartment when I contrived to stash one of her coveted delicacies on the long arm of my door’s soft close apparatus.

She has zero interest in conventional cat treats, but if I like it, then she has to have it. She even stole a bite out of my Krispy Kreme glazed donut once when I was distracted by my toddler.

I’ve owned a number of cats, but she’s the first I’ve met with such a powerful sweet tooth.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o098t25n3q1urs67', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My rescue kitten (okay, she’s 9 now, but she’s tiny) from Japan is crazy for baked goods.\n\nIn my prefecture, there was a bakery that made a bread they called Fondue Bread.

Silk Road,Sep 25,Which is the first metal to be discovered by man?,"Definitely copper.

That shiny reddish-brown metal that you see in wires, pipes, coins, and statues was the first metal that humans discovered.

Copper was probably the first metal mined and crafted by humans. It was originally obtained as a native metal and later from the smelting of ores.

Earliest estimates of the discovery of copper suggest around 9000 BC in the Middle East.

A copper pendant discovered in what is now northern Iraq has been dated about 8700 BC.

For nearly five millennia, copper was the only metal known to man, and thus had all the metal applications.

People used copper for everything from cutting to cooking to decorating.

Some ancient civilizations also believed that copper had magical or sacred properties.

For example, the ancient Egyptians used copper to heal wounds, sterilize water, and make ornaments.

They also thought that copper gave them special powers if they wore it.

The ancient Indians used copper as part of their surgical instruments.

Copper is still very useful and important today. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity, which makes it ideal for many electronic devices and appliances.

It is also part of our diet, as it helps our body function properly and stay healthy.

Copper is truly a remarkable metal, don't you agree?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0xg4pwtfo9368dby', 'title': 'Which is the first metal to be discovered by man?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Definitely copper.\n\nThat shiny reddish-brown metal that you see in wires, pipes, coins, and statues was the first metal that humans discovered.\n\nCopper was probably the first metal mined and crafted by humans.

Iva Izabela Miholic,Updated 6y,What 'family secret' did you learn that totally shocked you?,"This is a story about how a strange love of one man saved many lives, including mine.

When my mom was a teenager, she started living with her uncle and his family in a beautiful watermill town that she loved. She began high school there, so it was convenient to live with family.

Her life there got very hard very quickly.

She was a modern city girl, pretty and smart, and the town she moved to was old-fashioned and slow. The girls in school were jealous of her and gave her a hard time.

Living at her uncle’s home wasn’t great either. He was a strict man, a disciplinarian, with an obedient wife, and a daughter my mom’s age, plain, slow and envious.

My mom did her school duties, and then ran to the mills and waterfalls of the town. She wandered around in nature, close to the beautiful. green, river Korana.

She spent her days there, away from the stiff atmosphere of her temporary home, and the bullying of the kids in her school.

Even though my mom stayed away from them, they wouldn’t leave her alone. They spread rumors about her, making sure she heard about them, and making sure her uncle heard about them, too.

They said my mother was a cheap girl, ran around with many boys, and had sex with them in the mills. They added many humiliating details, too.

My mom’s uncle punished her harshly for even the smallest mistakes, like being five minutes late or not arranging bed covers perfectly. He grounded her and followed her, but no one could ever find proof of what was not true.

My mom walked by the river and lay in the grass, listening to the sounds of waterfalls and animals. She counted days until she could return home to her city.

One day my mom’s cousin smoked in the bathroom and did not dispose of the cigarette butt successfully. To her immense horror, her father found it. She said that my mother smoked in the bathroom, and added that she saw her smoke a lot: after school, in the bathroom, everywhere.

Uncle believed his daughter completely, and punished my mom severely.

He beat her and grounded her, preventing her from ever going to the river and having time away from everything, time that she learned to love and needed. He said to her that if she made another mistake, she would never forget it.

Then money and jewellery started disappearing from the house, little by little. A coin here, a banknote there, and then more and more.

One day the uncle sold something and brought home quite a lot of cash. By morning the money was gone. There was a huge uproar in the house, and everyone searched for the money.

They found it very quickly. It was neatly stored in my mother's cupboard, alongside my aunt’s jewelry and other things that were missing.

Uncle did nothing. He kept completely silent. No one spoke to my mom and they would not let her speak. When the evening came, he told my mother they would speak in the morning.

My mom waited until everyone was asleep.

Then she snuck out of her room and scavenged through the house for her uncle’s and aunt’s pills and medications.

After collecting a bag-full of pills, she went into her room and sat on her bed. She told me that moonlight was pouring onto her bed, and she found it quite beautiful.

Then she took all the different pills she found, and lay on that bed, closing her eyes, covered by moonlight.

Under that same moonlight, in her real home in the city she was from, her father woke up. He jumped out of bed, yelling through the house that something was wrong with my mom.

My grandma and my mom’s sisters all came to the living room to find him frantically dialling the phone.

He woke the uncle up and told him to urgently go to my mom’s room and wake her up.

Then he threw on clothes, and ran to his car to drive a couple of hours to the uncle’s house.

It was a time without cell phones, so he knew nothing until he got to the house. He found my mom’s aunt and cousin sitting in the kitchen. The cousin was crying hysterically. She had told her mother the truth. She was the one who stolen the money in hopes that they would send my mother home.

From their house my grandpa drove to the hospital.

My mom was in and out of consciousness. They had pumped her stomach, but she was in very bad shape. He stayed in the hospital the entire night, until the morning came and my mom was better. He came to her and they had a long talk.

A few days later, he took her home, never to return to that house again.

This is such an unbelievable story that I would have a hard time believing it had there not been so many people who witnessed the events and later spoke about them to me.

My grandfather’s love and connection to my mother woke him up that night. If he had continued sleeping, my mom would have been dead by the next morning.

My grandfather saved my mom’s life but, as a butterfly effect, he also saved mine, as well as the lives of my children. If my mom had died that night, I would not be here to tell you this story.

If my grandfather had not woken up, there would not be two children, sleeping in their rooms, a few meters away, exhausted from the excitement of Christmas.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tj0fu2dh9ks3e1v5', 'title': ""What 'family secret' did you learn that totally shocked you?"", 'score': {'original': 0.90665, 'ai': 0.09335}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This is a story about how a strange love of one man saved many lives, including mine.\n\nWhen my mom was a teenager, she started living with her uncle and his family in a beautiful watermill town that she loved.

Steven Haddock,2y,What scientific discoveries changed the world?,"Isaac Asimov argued that the only really important scientific discovery was made in 1752 when Benjamin Franklin published his paper that showed lightning was an electrical phenomenon.

This, as they say, changed everything. Prior to this, scientific discoveries were only of importance to other scientists. They had no real relationship to people as a whole. Sure, the church might object when Galileo published his work about a heliocentric universe, but it didn’t make an impression on the public as a whole.

But Franklin’s discovery led to a very practical use

This is one of Franklin’s “lightning rods”. It was a device that, get this, stopped lightning from striking buildings.

It spread like…. oh, I don’t know… lightning maybe? Within a decade only churches weren’t using them because, you know, they thought lighting was divine and specific retribution from god. However, after lightning struck a church where gunpowder was being stored (because, you know, god LIKES churches) even they started adopting the darn things.

The idea that science could solve practical problems started with the lightning rod and before long, that weird phenomenon called “electricity” turned out to have all kinds of uses:

Like motors that didn’t need flames

Bright, cheap, safe lighting

Blazingly fast calculating machines","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3my2sefd5klnj8zg', 'title': 'What scientific discoveries changed the world?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Isaac Asimov argued that the only really important scientific discovery was made in 1752 when Benjamin Franklin published his paper that showed lightning was an electrical phenomenon.\n\nThis, as they say, changed everything.

Cathy Franck,5y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"Yes, and in the most wonderful way!

My Great Dane's morning constitution runs on a very strict schedule. On three occasions when I slept late, I woke up to find Seamus, my Dane, with a very guilty look on his face. He was acting so ashamed and wouldn't meet my eyes.

When I walked into the bathroom I was assaulted with the strong smell of urine. After searching the floor and closet, I found that he had peed in the shower. He had peed in the shower!!!

AB,Updated 6y,What 'family secret' did you learn that totally shocked you?,"When I was 15, I learned that the old man who lived in the apartment next door, with his wife and adult kids, was in reality my maternal grandfather.

When grandma was pregnant with my mom, she once came home to find her husband, my grandfather, in bed with another woman. She kicked him out of the house and never let him have any contact with my mother.

My mom grew up thinking her father had died and, eventually, was told the truth, but since she never had a father, she didn’t care and went on with her life.

When she and my dad decided to get married, they started to look for an apartment where they would live once once married. So they found this very nice place, with a huge living room, huge kitchen and two bedrooms in newly built building in a nice neighborhood in Mexico City, and they could afford the rent.

Before they signed the contract, they asked for my grandma’s opinion, so they took her to see the apartment. When the 3 of them were in the lobby of the building, waiting for the elevator to go up to the apartment, a neighbor came in and joined them. He greeted them with a “good afternoon”, and my mom and dad greeted him back, but my grandma remained silent.

One the elevator arrived it turned out that my parents and grandma were going to the fifth floor and the neighbor was also going to the same floor (the neighbor to apartment 5A and my parents to apartment 5B).

As they were going up, an awkward silence invaded the elevator, and once they arrived to the fifth floor my parents and grandma went right and the neighbor went left.

Once in the apartment, my mom asked my grandma (her mother) why she was so rude to the neighbor and didn’t say hello to him. The answer my grandma gave her was: “Because, baby, that man is your father…”

In the end, my parents took the apartment (where I was born 10 months later), and it was by pure chance and coincidence that my mom and my grandfather were neighbors, living next to each other, for about 16 years. When they saw each other, they were civil to each other and say hello or had small talk, but the biological bond between them was never discussed.

As I mentioned in the beginning, my grandfather had a new family. A wife, 2 sons and one daughter. Once, when I was 15, the whole family moved to a new home and we never heard again from our old “neighbors”.

EPILOGUE: About 7 years ago, my mom was contacted through Facebook by my grandfather’s oldest son (technically, my mom’s half brother). He remembered her from the time they were neighbors. They exchanged phone numbers and a few weeks later had a phone conversation.

In that phone call, not sure exactly how, they discussed their blood ties and, since then, my mom reconnected with her half brother and half sister (the other half brother had passed away).

I know, this sounds like a story taken out of a cheesy soap opera (“That man, baby, is your father…”), but this is a true story, and one of those where reality beats fiction.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nrf3q0ab2o7vwytp', 'title': ""What 'family secret' did you learn that totally shocked you?"", 'score': {'original': 0.487, 'ai': 0.513}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'When I was 15, I learned that the old man who lived in the apartment next door, with his wife and adult kids, was in reality my maternal grandfather.\n\nWhen grandma was pregnant with my mom, she once came home to find her husband, my grandfather, in bed with another woman.

Lewis Waldman,6y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"Yes, when I was a kid (I’m 65), my first cat, Snowball, was in the middle of our large backyard. He was a tough cat whom my parents failed to neuter. One day a neighbor was walking his huge German shepherd. The dog saw Snowball sitting in the backyard from maybe 50 yards away. He broke free of his master and started running full speed right at Snowball. Snowball didn’t flinch. Snowball didn’t even display the usual fight response, thickened, raised tail. He just sat there looking rather relaxed. The dog got within about 6 inches of Snowball. Snowball simply raised one paw with extended nails and planted it right in that dog’s nose. It really was extraordinary! That dog started crying, howling, doing the both paws on snout routine and took off running back to the master. I gave Snowball his favorite treat, some tuna.

Snowball basically had a wife, a nice grey feline. They lived together in the attic of a neighbor’s stand-alone garage right next to the big backyard. Snowball was solid white. One day, a little white kitten came running from the garage to our backdoor. That cat was solid white just like his Dad, so he also became one of our cats. We named him Snowflake. My parents did get Snowflake neutered, but I’ll have to say that he never had the personality of his Dad, the king of the neighborhood, whom all cats feared until he got too old and beat up to fight anymore.

I’m in tight traffic, and nobody will let me in to change lanes. They ignore my blinking turn signal. So I open the window and stick out my arm. Invariably, the car in the next lane slows and makes a spot for me to move into.

I think the human appendage signal turns car into a person. It is no longer a blinking car that wants to change lanes, but a human. That triggers empathy and politeness.

This hack can be used elsewhere. The gay liberation movement made its greatest strides when gays came out of the closet, and people realized that they knew such people. They were no longer abstractions, but people, friends, and it created a phase transition.

Kasey Tross,Updated 4y,What made you realize your boring parents were actually badasses when they were young?,"This photo of my mom.

This is Mom atop her horse, Dena, when she was in her teens/early twenties. A few things to note about this photo:

This horse is going very fast. As you can see from the blurred background, my mom’s position on Dena, and the way my mom’s hair is blowing back from her face, she’s at a full-on gallop.
There is no saddle on this horse. My mom is riding this horse at a full gallop bareback.
Dena was a thoroughbred/quarter horse cross. That means she was bred to run. Fast. She was unbroken when my mom got her. As a teenager, Mom singlehandedly trained her to be ridden, and she did it all bareback.
See that smile on my mom’s face? She was a total adrenaline junkie!

My mom is still just as passionate about horses today, and I guess this might be a slightly misleading answer to this question, because I’ve never really thought of her as boring. But I didn’t really know this side of her all that well, because I never saw her do this. We didn’t have horses for a long time when I was growing up, but once I moved out of the house and she got horses again, this side of her started showing up again.

Mom is now in her 70s, and she’ll still gallop her horse across a field. I tell her I don’t like the idea of her just taking off like that at her age, and she says, “Kasey, I’d rather die galloping my horse across a field than wasting away in some nursing home. I’m going to gallop my horse across a field.” So I just say, “Just tell someone before you go, okay? So they know where to look for you if you don’t show up back at the barn?” She has reluctantly agreed to my condition. ;-)

Other stories that have come out about my mom once she decided I was old enough to know?

The time she got lost in Hong Kong in the middle of the night because she couldn’t sleep and she felt like going shopping, and she came precariously close to getting mugged.
How she wore different wigs on every flight as a Pan Am stewardess to see which passengers she could trick into flirting with her twice thinking she was someone different.
How her fiancé tried to use her as an unwitting mule in his intercontinental jewel smuggling operation by hiding jewels in the lining of her suitcase– and how when she found out she took off her engagement ring and threw it at him.

One of my mom’s odd habits is mentioning something offhand that is completely shocking to me, and then saying, “Oh, didn’t I ever tell you about that?”

Yep. Definitely not boring.

ETA: Just for fun, I thought I’d include a second photo of her I took just a couple of years ago. No galloping this time, but also still no saddle– just a bareback pad. And still the same big goofy grin.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wn4670rslc1ijb25', 'title': 'What made you realize your boring parents were actually badasses when they were young?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This photo of my mom.\n\nThis is Mom atop her horse, Dena, when she was in her teens/early twenties.

Terry Assael,5y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"I had a poodle-terrier name “Nicholas” for 16 years. It happened several times that I tried to redirect his behavior to later find that he knew better than me. In one instance, we were on a road trip, sitting in the back seat.

He also had inexplicable intuition. At the end of his life when he was suffering from heart disease, the time came when he was having more bad days than good. I realized that I had to put him down. The vet agreed and said she would euthanize him at my house instead of the clinic. The night before she came, Nicholas woke me twice during the night.

Linda Mack,10mo,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"Our German Shepherd, Jennie, had a telepathic bond with my husband. Scoff all you like, buy it manifested time and time again. The most startling occurrence was one afternoon when my husband had driven to a business meeting in Portsmouth from our home in Bedfordshire.

I was working from home and our two dogs, Jennie and Jasmine, were next to me waiting patiently for 4:00pm and their afternoon walk. (I don't know about other people's dogs, but ours can tell time too!)

Suddenly, at 3:29pm (by my computer clock) Jennie leaped up and started pawing at my hands, whining, barking, running in circles, going to the front door and scratching. I tried to discover what was wrong, but there was literally nothing out of the ordinary. She did not want to go out in the garden…I couldn't understand what she wanted. However, after 5 minutes, she suddenly shook herself, yawned, and went back to lay beside my office chair.

I sat down, scratched my head, then began to finish an email. About 5 minutes later my husband unexpectedly phoned. His first words were, “Don't panic, I've been in a bad accident, the car is totalled, but I'm okay.” I burst out laughing (NOT what he expected!) and replied, “Your accident happened at 3:29pm, didn't it?” He had to look at his watch and figure backwards as he really didn't know the time. Then he said, slowly, “Yesss, that would have been the time…we've just had time to push the car to the side and call the police. Then I phoned you….so HOW did you know?!”

I explained Jennie's little performance. We had joked before about Jennie knowing what he was going to do before he did it, but this sealed the deal.

Telepathy? Quantum entanglement? An unknown bond between human and dog? We still don't know what it is, only that it very much IS.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3oaxdlv4uzwsnrpm', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Our German Shepherd, Jennie, had a telepathic bond with my husband.

Brent Meeker,1y,How did we first discover the speed of light? What experiments were conducted to determine its value?,"Galileo tried to measure the speed of light by having a servant take a lantern to a distant hill top. Galileo was to open his lantern and as soon as the servant saw the light he was to open his lantern. When Galileo saw his servants lantern he would have a measure of the round-trip-time. But of course Galileo could only conclude the light travel time was small compared to the servants reaction time…i.e. it was very fast.

The first real measurement of the speed of light was made in 1675 by the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer. He kept track of the times that moons of Jupiter were eclipsed.

When he compared these data to calculations assuming uniform orbital motion he saw the the eclipse intervals got a little longer as the Earth moved further from Jupiter and a little shorter then as Earth approached Jupiter in the Earth's annual orbit around the Sun. He realized this was due to the increasing travel time for light. So knowing the size of the Earth's orbit he calculated the speed of light to be 200,000 Km/s.

Roemer's result wasn't very accurate. The first reasonably accurate value was calculated in 1728 by an English physicist, James Bradley.

Because of the Earth's speed in orbit a telescope has to be tilted slightly in the direction of motion toward a star. This is called stellar abberation. By comparing the angles for observations of a star six months apart and knowing the Earth's speed in orbit, Bradley calculated the speed of light to be 301,000Km/s. Quite close to the current value.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a7kyh1t50pxw2nce', 'title': 'How did we first discover the speed of light?

Grant Corriveau,4y,What obscure invention changed the world?,"Float Glass

If you have ever looked through the original windows of a very old house, like a house that dates before 1950 you might notice something amiss. The glass in the window appears to be a little thicker in the bottom than the top as if the glass is slowly melting as the decades have progressed. The windows are so distorted that the images you see through the window also appear distorted.

The truth is the old glass in the window pane looked like that from when it was first made. The glass was made when a huge ball of glass was blown into a large sized cylinder then the cylinder was cut in half and flattened then allowed to cool down. The flattened glass would then be cut into smaller sections in order to be inserted into the multifaceted window frames such as the following:

When the sections were inserted, the builder tended to have the thicker ends facing down. Windows for houses were not as clear as eye glasses, telescopes, or microscopes because manufacturing very clear glass was expensive. Clear glass required intense polishing.

In the late 19th century molten glass was drawn through steel rollers. Glass windows were made in mass production using this method but there were irregularities in the final product and the glass was not very thick.

Then in the 1950s in Great Britain, the process of float glass was invented. The process involves pouring molten glass onto molten metal, usually tin. The glass floats on top of the metal then it cools in a very flat and clear shape. It also became possible to make clear glass sheets that were 25 mm thick. By 1960 the process was applied to mass production then all of the sudden houses were able to have large windows like this:

So if you see the glass windows on a very old house and they appear to be melting that is not the case. They were manufactured like this until window glass making improved.

Today practically all glass windows you see in buildings were made using the float process. Only specialized decorative windows such as stained or patterned glass would be the exception.

The invention of the float glass process became the standard process but not too many people today are aware how it revolutionized the industry.

I would like to thank Jan Krusat and Mike Hook for adding more information to include in my answer.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6ozyaw1px8u7v9le', 'title': 'What obscure invention changed the world?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Float Glass\n\nIf you have ever looked through the original windows of a very old house, like a house that dates before 1950 you might notice something amiss.

Use Amazon to buy basics (undershirts, panties, etc). A Prime account is well worth the money.
Get a French press and make your own coffee. It's much, much cheaper and tastes better.
Spend money on investment buys for quality/not needing to replace the item. This includes leather jackets (they can easily last 30+ years with proper care), mattresses, and flooring.
Always check out niche-specific review sites, like TripAdvisor for travel, Glassdoor for jobs, Capterra for software, RottenTomatoes for movies, Gamespot and IGN for games, and the New York Times for books.

Israel Ramirez,Updated 1y,"What are the most dramatic examples of major scientific advances which were discovered, forgotten or disregarded, then discovered again?","You may have read accounts of the discovery of the ability of citrus fruits to prevent and treat scurvy. What those accounts don’t usually mention is that this discovery was forgotten and recovered several times.

The problem

In the early days of long distance sailing, scurvy was a major problem. Humans, like other primates, lack the ability to create their own Vitamin C. That vitamin is present in many foods but tends to deteriorate during storage of dry food or when food is cooked. Sailors often used copper cooking vessels, not realizing that copper destroys this vitamin. As a result, sailors fed diets heavy in crackers and dried meat gradually lost the Vitamin C in their bodies, and became sick.

Scurvy, ""the plague of the sea,"" killed over an estimated two million sailors during the Age of Sail. Far more naval personnel died from scurvy than all other diseases combined, including deaths from combat, storms, disasters, and shipwrecks…. Scurvy is a gradually debilitating disease that destroys the body's connecting tissues, causing lethargy, blotchy skin, rotting gums and teeth, and reopening of old wounds or healed fractured bones. If not treated, scurvy leads to death. [1]

Ancient informal knowledge

Most accounts about Vitamin C start in the 1700’s but ancient people knew about it. The Ebers papyrus, from Egypt 1500 BC, described symptoms and prescribed onions which contain of vitamin C.[2] Later on:

Starting with Vasco de Gama’s crew in 1497, sailors have repeatedly discovered the curative power of citrus fruits, and the cure has just as frequently been forgotten or ignored by subsequent explorers.[3]

In 1614, the Englishman John Woodall, in his manual The Surgeon’s Mate recommended eating oranges, lemons, limes and tamarinds. Somehow, this knowledge got lost, and sailors were dying from scurvy all over again.

First formal discovery

Recovery of this knowledge began in 1734, when Johann Bachstrom claimed that scurvy was solely due to ‘a total abstinence from fresh vegetable food, and greens’. In 1747 James Lind conducted a formal experiment in which he fed two sailors oranges and limes. He published his findings in 1753. Lind continued to treat scurvy in his position of head of Haslar Hospital for the rest of his career. (Illustration from: [4] )

But nobody understood why fruit worked and attempts to concentrate the fruit never worked. Some of the equipment used to concentrate fruit contained copper which destroys Vitamin C. Eventually, wort of malt emerged as the preferred treatment. It was cheaper than citrus fruit though it didn’t work as well.

Rediscovery

Later on Captain Cook tried a variety of antiscorbutic foods and concluded that orange and lemon juice, as well as wort of malt, worked. He rediscovered Lind’s original finding. For that, the Royal Society awarded him the Copley Gold medal. But the navy didn’t change the way they fed sailors.

Second rediscovery

British sailors became limeys in 1790–1799. That’s when Sir Gilbert Blane, persuaded the Admiralty to issue a daily ration of three quarters of an ounce of lemon juice to all Royal Navy sailors. Blane had conducted, and published his own studies, and was aware of previous work by Lind and Cook. But the most important factor was Blane’s social standing. He was born to a prominent family and he knew all the right people.

Alternative sources of Vitamin C

Vitamin C is present in lots of fresh foods and it isn’t clear why the British focused on citrus fruits. Some physicians, including Shakespeare’s son-in-law, favored a plant called scurvy grass, which was apparently named for its ability to cure scurvy.[5] Captain Cook fed his sailors various foods including scurvy grass, wild celery, sauerkraut, and others but citrus is what he is remembered for.

Some authorities thought that acid or sourness was important and that might explain why the British focused on citrus. That’s another example of a forgotten discovery. Lind’s original study tried acids including cider, vinegar and sulphuric acid; none worked. The idea that acid was responsible caused problems later on.

The cure got forgotten again

By the time of Robert Falcon Scott's 1911 expedition to the South Pole, the ability of fruit to cure scurvy had been forgotten and his crew had all the symptoms:

The symptoms of scurvy do not necessarily occur in a regular order, but generally the first sign is an inflamed, swollen condition of the gums. The whitish pink tinge next the teeth is replaced by an angry red; as the disease gains ground the gums become more spongy and turn to a purplish colour, the teeth become loose and the gums sore. Spots appear on the legs, and pain is felt in old wounds and bruises; later, from a slight oedema, the legs, and then the arms, swell to a great size and become blackened behind the joints. After this the patient is soon incapacitated, and the last horrible stages of the disease set in, from which death is a merciful release.[6]

Scott knew about Lind’s discovery but was certain that citrus fruit couldn’t cure scurvy. In fact, citrus fruit wasn’t helping British sailors anymore.

The British thought that the agent which cured scurvy was acid. So, they thought that it made sense to switch from using lemons to limes which are more acidic. But despite having less acid, lemons have more vitamin C, so the switch reduced the amount of vitamin C the sailors were getting.

The British navy also began storing condensed juice in copper vessels instead of storing intact fruit. That was a big mistake because copper destroys Vitamin C. The condensation method also exposed the juice to air and heat which can also destroy Vitamin C.[7]

So, the British had been giving their sailors juice that doesn’t cure scurvy. They didn’t notice that because they also began offering sailors better food. That’s important because fresh foods of all kinds have Vitamin C. Also, voyages became shorter because steamships travel much faster than sail ships. That meant there was less time to get scurvy.

Sailors didn’t need to get as much citrus fruit, but nobody noticed that the juice they were getting was useless.

Then they began voyages into the Arctic and Antarctic. People on those expeditions got scurvy. Fortunately, they discovered that fresh meat, like polar bear, seal, and penguin, worked very well. Some people concluded that meat was a better cure for scurvy than fruit.

Scott wasn’t able to carry fresh meat on his trek to the South Pole. There’s a good chance that scurvy contributed to his death.

Modern era

The actual discovery of Vitamin C required an animal model. That happened in 1907 on account of pure luck:

C. Axel Holst and Theodor Frolich had been studying beriberi (another deficiency disease) in pigeons, and when they decided to switch to a mammal model, they serendipitously chose guinea pigs, the one animal besides human beings and monkeys that requires vitamin C in its diet. Fed a diet of pure grain, the animals showed no signs of beriberi, but quickly sickened and died of something that closely resembled human scurvy.

Szent-Györgyi used guinea pigs and, in 1932, definitively determined that Vitamin C is ascorbic acid.

People on those expeditions got scurvy. Fortunately, they discovered that fresh meat, like polar bear, seal, and penguin, worked very well. Some people concluded that meat was a better cure for scurvy than fruit.\n\nScott wasn’t able to carry fresh meat on his trek to the South Pole. There’s a good chance that scurvy contributed to his death.\n\nModern era\n\nThe actual discovery of Vitamin C required an animal model. That happened in 1907 on account of pure luck:\n\nC. Axel Holst and Theodor Frolich had been studying beriberi (another deficiency disease) in pigeons, and when they decided to switch to a mammal model, they serendipitously chose guinea pigs, the one animal besides human beings and monkeys that requires vitamin C in its diet. Fed a diet of pure grain, the animals showed no signs of beriberi, but quickly sickened and died of something that closely resembled human scurvy.\n\nSzent-Györgyi used guinea pigs and, in 1932, definitively determined that Vitamin C is ascorbic acid.\n\nMore reading\n\nYou can get a lot more detail from these wonderful articles:\n\nhttps://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/scurvy-how-a-surgeon-a-mariner-and-a-gentleman-solved-the-greatest-medical-mystery-of-the-age-of-sail-bown-stephen-r-2003\n\nForgotten Knowledge: The Discovery and Loss of a Cure to Scurvy\n\nScott And Scurvy (Idle Words)\n\nhttps://www.nzgeo.com/stories/a-scurvy-business/\n\nBonus answers\n\nHere’s some other, equally remarkable, advances that were made and forgotten:\n\nTHE MYSTERY OF DAMASCUS STEEL APPEARS SOLVED\n\nThe Antikythera mechanism is a 2,000-year-old computer\n\nScientists Figure Out How Ancient Rome\'s Concrete Has Survived 2,000 Years\n\nBonus, bonus, answer\n\nThe link in the question lists Mendel’s work as an example of a discovery that had been forgotten.

Audrey Vera Monroe,Updated 2y,What surprising discovery about a famous person completely changed the way you saw them?,"I grew up hearing Helen Keller jokes like everyone else. Fortunately, my mother was more in the know. She got tired of the jokes and handed me a book about the woman.

Helen Keller was a badass. Blind and deaf from an illness at a very young age, her parents did not know how to teach her. They let her run around like an animal until they hired a new teacher for her. The teacher taught how to feel American Sign Language letters spelled into her hand. At first, Helen didn’t understand what these hand games were. But eventually, it clicked.

After that, Helen could not be stopped. She learned to communicate. She learned Braille. She went to college and graduated with high honors. She used her celebrity to fight for social justice causes long before it was cool to do so. She even put herself at some risk by taking some of the stands she took; for example, speaking out about racism in the early 20th century as a wealthy white woman from the American South. She wrote books. She constantly traveled and gave lectures. She did learn to speak, although it was hard to understand her.

I have worked with deaf kids. I have worked with blind kids. I can’t even imagine what it would be like to have neither of those senses. Yet Ms. Keller not only rose above her disabilities, she became world famous for her achievements and still is.

Read or watch the movie “The Miracle Worker” to learn the amazing story of her early life. Then, to get a sense of her intelligence and insight, read some of her writings.

10 Major Achievements of Helen Keller
Helen Adams Keller (1880 – 1968) is renowned for defying all odds to accomplish great things despite being deaf and blind. After an illness in her childhood robbed her of her ability to see and hear , Helen was miraculously taught how to communicate by her instructor Anne Sullivan . She went on to become the first deaf blind person to earn a bachelor’s degree and during her years at college published her famous autobiography The Story of My Life . As an author she published 12 books apart from writing numerous articles. She co-founded Helen Keller International in 1915 and worked for the American Foundation for the Blind for more than 40 years. An inspiration to millions of people around the world, Helen Keller received numerous awards and honors including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Legion of Honor . Here are her 10 major achievements. #1 She WAS THE FIRST DEAF BLIND PERSON TO EARN A BACHELOR’S DEGREE Helen Keller made tremendous progress in learning to communicate due to the exceptional effort of her instructor Anne Sullivan , who evolved into her governess and later her companion. In 1888 , Keller entered the Perkins Institute for the Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts. In 1894, she began attending Wright-Humason School for the Deaf in New York City and in 1896 , she returned to Massachusetts to enter The Cambridge School for Young Ladies , a preparatory school for women. In 1900 , Keller gained admittance to the famous Radcliffe College in Cambridge and in 1904 , she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree . Helen Keller thus became the first deaf blind person to earn a bachelor’s degree . Portrait of Helen Keller at her Radcliffe Graduation, 1904 #2 SHE PUBLISHED HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN 1903 During her junior year at Radcliffe, Helen Keller wrote her autobiography The Story of My Life , in which she recounted her journey from a child with an extreme handicap to a 21 year old student at Radcliffe. Among other things, the book talks about her education with Anne Sullivan describing how Sullivan enabled her to communicate with the world. The Story of My Life was published in 1903 when Keller was 22 years old . It has since been widely published and is still in print in over fifty languages . It was adapted into the famous Tony award winning play The Miracle Worker by William Gibson which premiered on Broadway in 1959 and ran for 719 performances; and a 1962 Oscar winning Hollywood film also titled The Miracle Worker . Cover of Helen Keller’s autobiography The Story of My Life #3 SHE PUBLISHED 12 BOOKS IN HER WRITING CAREER Apart from The Story of My Life, Helen Keller published four other books on her personal experiences. In 1927, her book My Religion was published. It sold well and has remained in print ever since. The book focuses on and advocates the teachings of Swedish philosopher and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg . It is regarded as the spiritual autobiography of Helen Keller. In 1994, My Religion was revised and re-issued under t

Ernest W. Adams,5y,Stonehenge fascinates me. Has any new evidence been discovered as to how and why it exists?,"Well, we already know how. It was built over a very long period of time by people, initially digging with deer antlers. They also cut the stones by chipping holes in them, driving in wooden wedges, and then pouring water on them. The wedges expanded and cracked the stone.

As for the “why”—I don’t think there’s any particularly new evidence. It was clearly a burial place, a calendar, and a place for ceremonial processions. It evidently had some religious significance, like the many other standing stone monuments throughout Europe.

Vicki Mead,Updated 5y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"Yes, rather amazingly so.

We have Koi in a pond in our backyard. The first real hint that these fish were much more than just instinct driven vertebrates was when we introduced a new, young Koi into the pond. Sturgy, a Koi with coloration that made him look a bit like a sturgeon (and yes, they ALL have names) swam lazily down to the end of the pond where we had introduced the new young one. When Sturgy found the new Koi, he suddenly did a quick swim around, then darted back to the deeper end of the pond where all the other Koi were hanging out. In short order all of the other Koi came racing down to meet the new guy and check him out. I am not sure how Sturgy did it, but he ""told"" the other ones that there was something new and interesting to see.

The Koi have definite cliques. Certain ones hang out with other ones on a regular basis. One Koi that was originally name ""Grouchy"" because he never was with any other Koi everntually was renamed ""Lonely"" after we decided he was the rejectee rather than a rejector. You will be happy to learn that eventually Lonely got one friend, albeit of another species. ""Blackie"" is a goldfish that is decidedly not gold, but very black. He is extremely hard to see in the dark waters of the pond so Lonely still looks like he is mostly alone. You have to look closely to see his little buddy by his side.

Here is a photo of Lonely in the center (orange head with lots of white on the bottom half) and you can just barely see Blackie at about 5 o'clock of the upper right Koi (named Cruiser). You can only see Blackie because his black body is swimming over the lighter colored sandstone in the pond.

Currently we have a large Koi named Graby in our makeshift Koi hospital. When we first got Graby over 13 years ago he always hung out with a white Koi. Our younger son named them ""Mashed Potatoes"" and ""Graby."" (He didn't pronounce Gravy correctly and we just kept the Graby name as an iconic ""point in time"" tribute to my son's childhood utterance.

Graby has a swim bladder infection that makes it difficult to stay upright. The interesting thing was the other Koi nudging her to help her stay upright (or maybe just nudging her for comfort?) during a bad spell before we took out to put her in the Koi hospital.

Here is ""Lemmy"" (named for a lemon coloring) nudging Graby as she lists. When we took Graby out of the pond the other Koi swam around a lot seemingly looking for her. That was somewhat unusual as it was January and the Koi were mostly in stasis for the winter and typically that time of year just hang out quietly in the bottom of the deep part of the pond.

This is Graby in the hospital doing better after antibiotics and antifungal medicine to treat a secondary fungal infection.

It will be interesting to see the other Koi's reaction when Graby gets reintroduced into the pond again. I do find it shocking how much personality these Koi have.

Koi just hanging out.

UPDATE: Graby is back in the pond.

Curng the fungal and swim bladder infections was quite the ordeal, but since we weren't sure it was even possible when we started we were quite pleased.

We put Graby in the shallow end and she swam straight down to the deep end where the rest of the Koi were. She seems a bit stiff, I imagine from a long time of not getting regular swimming exercise.

when she arrived at the deep end the other Koi swam against her and swam under and over her. Given it was sort of cold they were somewhat lethargic but it did appear as if they were rubbing against her. Lemmy (her best buddy) especially was right up against her.

Jordan,5y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"I discovered just the other day that my Blue Heeler can open the front door all on her own.

The culprit is on the top right.

I had known for a while that Finn could open doors, but only ones that swung outward. She would hop up and press her paw down on the handle and then do the rest with her body-weight.

I never worried about the front door because it swung inwards.

One day while playing video games with my headphones on, I noticed that Finn hadn’t tried to get my attention in the last 30 minutes or so. (Very unusual for her.)

I walk into the living-room to find my front door wide open. The corgi is sitting there staring at the open door, likely debating a life of adventure vs a life with consistent food. The food won for the Corgi. I frantically start shouting Finn’s name and run out looking for her without grabbing my shoes or a shirt.

The panic had definitely set in at this point, I live right next to one of the most notoriously dangerous highways in Texas, and off of a busy bus-stop/ train station. Finn also has some barrier aggression issues so I was worried about her getting into trouble as well as her getting hit by a car.

I’m sprinting around like a madman absolutely losing my shit, yelling her name until after a while someone says “hey man you looking for a dog?”

“Oh my god yes, yes I am.”

He led me to the dog-park where Finn was now pinned up in. Apparently she trotted down straight to the dog-park and began terrorizing this woman’s little foo foo dog.

Finn was all smiles after seeing me and I was flooded with relief. I wanted to beat her butt for what she did, but instead I just hugged her for like an hour.

Days later I got to see in person how she got the door open.

She would hop up and depress the handle with her paw. Then while keeping paw pressure on the handle she would slowly scoot her body backwards. This would get the door open an inch or two and then she could just stick her paw in the crack to swing it open the rest of the way.

I was admittedly impressed with her cleverness, but now I have to try and remember to always lock the deadbolt when I enter the house.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mb0z43cex81wn5ly', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I discovered just the other day that my Blue Heeler can open the front door all on her own.\n\nThe culprit is on the top right.\n\nI had known for a while that Finn could open doors, but only ones that swung outward.

Dan Stephens,Updated 2y,Which urban legends were you surprised to discover were not legends but true?,"This answer will contain images some may find disturbing.

Anyone who grew up in Western Pennsylvania, America, during the 1950s and 1960s would have heard the urban legend of the Green Man or Charlie No Face; a ghostly apparition: a man with no face.

The figure was only ever seen at nighttime.

The ghostly figure was said to run after and scare off anybody it saw while it was out and about.

One Koppel resident remembered seeing the figure as she walked home from the local swimming hole and later recalled: “I was so scared it was unreal.”

People would tell their children, who in turn would tell their children - and the story became part of the local culture. Everyone seemed to know the urban legend of the Green Man.

Only, it wasn’t an urban legend at all.

The Green Man did exist …

… and his name was Raymond Robinson.

See… in 1919, when Raymond was just eight years old when he was reaching for a bird’s nest at the top of an electrical pole when he came into contact with the cable, shocking him with over 11,000 volts of electricity.

This sent him flying to the ground in a brilliant flash of white, … and badly burned his hands and face — leaving holes where his eyes and mouth used to be.

Raymond, knowing that his condition would alarm some and being a good soul, would venture only at night time as he didn’t want to risk scaring anyone during the day.

It is believed that he got the moniker, the Green Man, from the light of passing cars reflecting on his flannels as they passed him in the dead of night.

While some residents were scared by this ghostly apparition, some took to befriending him; bringing him cigarettes and beers.

“Helluva a nice guy,” remarked one Phil Ortega.

Despite his horrific injuries, Raymond Robinson, the Green Man/Charlie No Face, lived until the age of 74, dying 11th of June, 1985.

Kate Scott,Updated 6y,"What's a cool thing you ‘invented/discovered’ as a kid, only to find it had already been invented/discovered ?","When I was about 7 years old, I invented something so incredible that I had to tell my Dad’s boss that he would be quitting.

He worked for a boating company that manufactured and sold boats—I’m pretty sure my dad was one of the salesmen for the company.

One day, my Dad had taken me to the docks with him. While he was messing with a boat, I saw some little fish next to the dock swimming around. After we got home and I went to bed, I had a stroke of genius! It was so good that I even snuck out of bed to go write it down!

Are you ready?

Glass bottomed boats.

The next day was a Saturday and I spent all day putting together charts and graphs and sketches and pictures. At the time, in my little mind, the papers looked like this:

But, in reality, I’m 95% sure they looked like this:

*That is my actual handiwork*

Later that evening we went to go pick up my Dad. As my parents were distracted talking, I walked into my Dad’s boss’ office.
The conversation went something like this:

Me: “Uh, yes… Dean? Could I have a moment of your time?”

Boss: “Well hi there kiddo! What’s up?”

Me: “Enough with the formalities. I’m gonna give it to you straight: I invented a boat.

And, frankly, it’s way better than what you’re churning out here.

Because of this, my family and I are going to be millionaires and my Dad will be quitting his job. I am now the breadwinner. Sorry to have to break this news to you—best of luck in your future endeavors.” (Or something to this effect)

With that done, I turned on my heel and strode out. Chest puffed up and nose in the air.

Later that night, I called a family meeting. Even the cats needed to be there for this one.

I strolled over to the dinner table and slapped my invention down, waiting for my mom to begin weeping tears of joy. We had it made now, I was sure of it.

Instead, my dad said, “Cool what’s that?”

And I said, “THAT, my dear father, is a glass bottomed boat. I invented it last night, and yes, we are going to be millionaires... I’ll give you a minute to take it all in.”

Much to my surprise there was neither weeping nor fainting.

Instead, my dad started smirking—trying so hard not to let out a chuckle- and said:

""Sweetie, that is SO neat that you came up with that on your own! However- there’s already boats with glass bottoms (or sections of glass in the bottom). SO… you didn’t technically invent it and… we’re probably not going to be millionaires just yet. But keep it up, kiddo! Never know when you’ll hit the big one!”

…

…

I was in shock as I went back to my room.

Absolutely crushed.

Defeated.

I rocked back and forth on my bed, petting my cat, staring with sunken eyes at my bedroom wall- looking like someone fresh out of the looney bin.

After an hour or so though, I finally decided: damnit, this is not the last you’ve heard of me! He did say: ‘Never know when you’ll hit the big one!’

So, throughout the next week, I submitted about 30 new boat sketches to my dad.

They were all—gently—turned down and I soon grew tired of boat inventions.

I didn’t end up hitting ‘the big one’…. YET.

Edit to Add: As far as I know, my Dad’s boss never mentioned our little ‘meeting’ to him.

Adi,Updated 4y,What new thing did you discover today?,"Today my fiancé Jackie and I discovered that she’s pregnant. We are going to have a baby!

She's been feeling weird for a couple of weeks and she missed her period, so she took two or three tests this morning and they were positive. I’m not sure exactly how this happened as I imagined that we were so careful. Wait actually, I’m a horny bastard so we probably weren't that careful. I took the day off and we wanted to be sure so we took an immediate Doctor’s appointment and she confirmed it. My swimmers have finally fulfilled their purpose.

I can't even describe how thrilled I am. I’ve wanted to be a dad ever since I was a teenager. I am fortunate in that I own a home, have a good job, and am financially stable right now. I think we are equipped to handle a baby. We’re getting married in like five weeks anyway, so by the time my kid is born his or her parents will be married. We were planning to have a kid in a year or so after marriage, but who cares? Even if this whole situation is unexpected, this is a great blessing.

We just got done explaining to our respective families that I got her pregnant prior to marriage. That was an awkward conversation, but everyone is happy for us nonetheless. My mom was kind of annoyed at my breach of conduct (lol), but she couldn't resist literally jumping with joy. My dad wryly commented that I never was one to stick to convention.

My future mother in-law’s reaction was largely the same as my mom’s. My future father in-law didn’t care about the pre marital pregnancy news, he just wants a grandkid.

My sister in-law is 7 months pregnant with a boy. I hope my future nephew and my own kid become best buds like my siblings and I. My sister is ecstatic that she’s going to be an aunt twice over.

I had to down some Jack Daniels after hearing the news and I still can't believe it. What the hell? I thought I was still a kid. Not anymore, I’m going to be a dad soon…

Anyways, parenting and fathering tips are extremely welcome. I guess my reading material has to change from foreign affairs and economics to parenting.

Update: We got married this afternoon (Sunday 10/13)!

Sagnik Misra,Updated 3y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Most of the times, I used to stay in hostel before the lockdown. Now, due to everyday morning classes, my daily breakfast used to get skipped.

Besides, I was kind of getting sick due to the unhealthy oily foods of my hostel in the morning. My classes used to take between 8a.m - 2p.m with almost no breaks.

So, instead of eating outside foods and wasting money, I came up with something different.

Most of our older generation is familiar with this healthy flour.

We call it Chatu in Bengali (Sattu). I first noticed my parents to make a juice of it and drink in the morning/ mix with puffed rice and eat. This gave their stomach full boost without any feelings of hunger before 1pm. It also energized them.

So, I thought of adapting this old technique of quenching hunger with healthy diet. I bought a packet of it.

In the morning, I mixed 3/4 spoons of Sattu with water along with sugar and salt of my choice. Then I drink it. It usually takes a minute or so to prepare.

It worked like a magic and provided me enough energies to continue my studies with no intention of distractions towards food before my lunch hours.

Picture Reference : Google

Many of my friends observed it. My roommate laughed at me for using this old technique by staying in 21st century. Some even neglect to touch it as they regarded it as poor man's food. I feel pity on them.

But my friend, old techniques are gold. It saved my money, my stomach, my energy and most importantly my hungry mind.

“Old techniques are gold. No wonder why our old generation is healthier and more functional than us just because of these clever life hacks.”

Hunger is the biggest distracting zone of a student. You also can't avoid your hunger as hungry brain doesn't function well. So, why not trying a healthier diet which will save our time and effort which we can put into some more productive work!

Sattu Juice may seem as an old fashioned technique but it is one of the most valuable and clever life hacks for those who want their time to be utilised in proper production places like Apple rather than waiting to eat an actual apple.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/id9z8mcanl3bqt7r', 'title': ""What is the most clever life hack you've learned?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Most of the times, I used to stay in hostel before the lockdown.

Shivansh Mathur,1y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Don’t change clothes just after you came home till you start the first productive activity

Let’s say you are coming from college and you have to do 10 homework questions,

What will someone typically do;

Come home,
Change clothes, shower,
Do the 10 questions

What you do with this hack

Come home,
Do 2 questions right away, (DON’T CHANGE CLOTHES)
Change clothes, shower,
Do the other 8 questions

The point is when you walk/drive home and when you change clothes after that, you tend to chill and get into the “home” mood and lose time just doing nothing. So this hack saves that precious time.

Michael,Updated 4y,"Which words would be the most terrifying if we discovered them written on a distant planet, like Pluto?","“I see you from four.”

“Don’t come 4.367.”

“We’ve always been with you.”

“Run.”

“They’re watching you.”

“Be quiet. They’re listening.”

I know my examples were extremely cryptic, but that’s exactly the point. Fear in the unknown.

In case you were curious, here’s an explanation for each of them:

“I see you from four.”

This is supposed to mean that the observers are fourth dimensional beings observing us from a higher spatial dimension. Being three-dimensional beings, we can’t see them, but they can see us. They can harm us, but we can’t harm them. We’re completely helpless.

“Don’t come 4.367.”

4.367 light years is approximately how far away Alpha Centauri is. Something is there, and we’re not supposed to go there. We’d wonder why.

“We’ve always been with you.”

Like the monolith from Space Odyssey, the aliens would have been affecting us throughout history and throughout evolution. This would mean that the alien guy was right all along.

“Run.”

Run where? Why? How? Until where? We don’t know anything.

“They’re watching you.”

But we can’t watch them. Again, similar premise as the 4th dimensional observer concept.

Rakshith Akira,Updated 5y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Flashback#1

2nd standard:

I was there for a singing competition. They announced,

Now, I call upon Rakshith for singing the Bhavageethe (Emotional Poetry)

I just stepped out of the crowd, people started to applaud. I stood on podium, someone gave a mic. I took with my sweating hand. My legs were shaking.

I started to sing and looked at the crowd of 150 people. I went blank. I forgot the lyrics. I was humiliated and stepped down from the dais.

Stage fear fucked me!

ಎಲ್ಲ ಕೇಳಲಿ ಎಂದು ನಾನು ಹಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಹಾಡುವುದು ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯ ಕರ್ಮ ನನಗೆ!

Translation:

I don’t sing for the sake of others, but singing is my inevitable fate.

Flashback#2

9th standard:

I was there for a public speaking (It was not a competition though). They announced my name.

I started to speak and looked at the crowd of 1,000 people. I went blank. I forgot the content. I was humiliated.

Stage fear fucked me hard again!

My class teacher called me to the staff room and said

Rakshith, I give you another chance and you should perform well next week.

I was like WTF? stage fear is a nightmare for me.

So, Next week in the prayer assembly,

I went and spoke for 5 minutes on the topic “ Health is wealth” without any breaks or pause. I completed with confidence and stepped down with pride.

So, you people are wondering what that one week changed me? Aren’t you? Well my teacher was in the same state.

The trick I played was,

I just took off my spectacles (I am a myopic) before stepping onto the stage. Everything was looking blur around me that day. So, I successfully mastered the art of public speaking.

Thug Life!

Proud to be a myopic!

Adele Kurtz,Updated 5y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"Film crews for Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Studio were filming a segment of Where Are They Now? on our property, and were shocked, in fact. Not us. Our admiration keeps growing out of respect for the animals — pets and visitors—we enjoy every day.

My husband Rich clues our animals to behave using hand signals, whistles and body language. We have no barbed-wire fences that could injure our horses, only white benign tape to let them know boundary lines. Raven’s Girl, a half-Arab descendent of War Admiral, is the smartest horse I ever met. She watches everything with keen interest and is the Alpha Mare of our entire 20-acre property. I have even observed her, ever curious, nuzzling the drill bit with her lips as my husband worked on her barn.

Rich was able to get the horses to run back and forth in the meadow for the film crews by pointing and whistling from afar, the same way he does when it is time for them to return to their corrals.

The crew smirked and whispered that they wished the two teens they were filming, along with their former-star dad, would take direction as well as our horses. Our horses responded better to retakes, as many as they needed to get filming right.

As they headed toward one of our large ponds, Rich asked if they would like to get some of the koi to pop up in the filming.

They laughed and said they wanted it all to look natural, no food could be in the shots. My hubby just shook his head, not to worry, and walked toward the edge of the pond, behind the cameraman. A dozen pretty butterfly koi plus a school of goldfish emerged to the surface in a parade.

I’ve heard people say that fish are stupid. Not true. Survivor is a big old koi in our other pond who has taught all the smaller fish to hide. We have two ponds, one shallow, one deeper. Survivor is King of his shallow fish pond, battle-scarred from being dropped twenty feet from the air by a heron. My son yelled at the bird who dropped the fish and returned him to the shallow pond. For several years now, you rarely see Survivor, even during feeding times, or the other twenty to thirty fish, or more in that pond. Meanwhile, in the deeper pond, the koi and gold fish follow me around to observe my gardening efforts and eagerly approach my husband, the feeder, as soon as they catch a glimpse of him.

Years ago, I was lost in the woods on my horse Buddy, and he knew it, although I didn’t. He stopped and refused to budge when I insisted he turn the wrong way. Horse sense means more than you may expect. I’ve come to learn that whenever Buddy challenges my commands, I should give him the rein. He’ll get me home, and he knows best.

My hubby and I have come to believe that all creatures have some skill that surpasses our human traits. We’ve always had pets and our respect has expanded through observation on our certified Wildlife Habitat. We’ve never been hurt, only helped by animals, many times.

As I am typing this we are observing a brown bear lying in a patch of sunlight in our distant meadow. I have watched a bear take a garbage bag of composting veggies to the edge of our hillsides and plop down to see what I packed inside. (I’ve since quit feeding them.)

Even our birds amaze us with their antics and intelligence. Stellar jays devise tricks for getting seed to fall from swinging perches, they use cooperation to outsmart the chipmunks. You can see a video where I am feeding the gray jays at our local ski resort too, from the lift 20 feet up in the air.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jtfx8k6zu2sig4ep', 'title': 'Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9488, 'ai': 0.0512}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Film crews for Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Studio were filming a segment of Where Are They Now? on our property, and were shocked, in fact.

Guy D. McCardle,2y,Which urban legends were you surprised to discover were not legends but true?,"This involves the unfortunate, very true story of this man, Jose Melena.

** The obituary photo of Mr. Jose Melena, age 62.

For about a decade now, there has been an Urban Legend going around that a man was cooked alive in an oven used to process tuna. For many, this seemed too horrific to be true and was thought to be a cautionary tale of how one was supposed to be extremely careful around industrial equipment.

Unfortunately, however, this is no urban legend. It actually happened.

Before dawn on October 11, 2012, Jose Melena was loading a 35 foot (10.6 meter) oven at the Bumble Bee foods Santa Fe Springs, California processing facility. A co-worker, thinking that Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with six tons of canned tuna and turned it on.

** This is the oven where Mr. Melina met his end. As you can see, it is sealed shut with the door to the left.

The machine ran its full cycle with Mr. Melena inside, and two hours later, his body was found when the pressure cooker was turned off and opened. It had reached a temperature of 270° F (132°C).

You are probably wondering why Mr. Melena was in the oven in the first place. An investigation by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health showed that the chain that pulls carts of tuna into the ovens sometimes gets snagged, requiring operators to enter the ovens to pull the carts through.

Bumble Bee paid $3 million to replace all of their outdated tuna ovens with automated ones and vowed never to require a worker to enter one again.

They also agreed to pay $1.5 million in restitution to the Melena family and $750,000 in fines.

Saul Florez, Bumble Bee’s former safety manager, pleaded guilty to a felony count of willfully violating lockout rules and indirectly causing Melena’s death.

He was sentenced to three years probation, ordered to complete 30 days of community service, and was fined $19,000.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/oxjbf8v42itnq7gr', 'title': 'Which urban legends were you surprised to discover were not legends but true?', 'score': {'original': 0.9948, 'ai': 0.0052}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This involves the unfortunate, very true story of this man, Jose Melena.\n\n** The obituary photo of Mr. Jose Melena, age 62.\n\nFor about a decade now, there has been an Urban Legend going around that a man was cooked alive in an oven used to process tuna.

Gary Meaney,2y,What is the coolest or most interesting dinosaur yet discovered? Why is that?,"Originally answered: What is the coolest or most interesting dinosaur yet discovered?

Among the extinct, non-bird dinosaurs, I think there are five main contenders for this title, species and/or groups which are a cut above the rest in terms of uniqueness. First of all, we’ve got the wacky and wonderful Deinocheirus.

This Mongolian dinosaur lived 70 million years ago, in an environment that was likely quite similar to that of the modern Okavango Delta: a lush, sprawling wetland in the midst of an otherwise barren desert. It was a member of ornithomimosaurs; dinosaurs who were typically lean and speedy, built like ostriches. Deinocheirus, however, was far from that.

It was a jaw-dropping 11 metres in length, and its eight-foot long arms were tipped with claws bigger than kitchen knives. Fortunately for hopeful time travellers, however, it was a plant-eater. It had a massive hump on its back and a flattened, shovel-shaped bill. In short, Deinocheirus could be described as a cross between a T. rex, a camel, a sloth and a spoonbill.

It coexisted with numerous species of therizinosaurs, which definitely deserve a spot in this pantheon too. They lived mainly in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period, and were somewhat related to the iconic dromaeosaurs, which included species like Velociraptor. However, they were superficially very different from raptors, or any other animal for that matter.

Up to 10 metres in length, therizinosaurs were covered in feathers, had short beaks and long necks, and wielded the largest claws of any known animals ever to live, at up to a metre each. Again, they were thankfully herbivorous, probably living a similar leaf-eating lifestyle to the giant ground sloths of the Ice Age. The structures of their inner ears and forebrain were also unusually developed, perhaps indicating astute hearing, good balance, or even intelligence.

Among the closest cousins of the therizinosaurs were the equally odd alvarezsaurs. This is ironic, because anatomically they’re basically the complete opposite. They were dainty little guys, with some species measuring as little as 50 centimetres in length, and evolved around 86 million years ago, lasting up until the end of the Cretaceous.

Alvarezsaurs’ big stand-out features were their comically teeny tiny arms, which contained only one claw. They make Tyrannosaurus rex look like a veritable gibbon. Short they may have been, but they were extremely muscular, as was the pectoral area. This, in addition to their thin, tubular snouts, suggest that they were myrmecophages (predators of ants and termites), like anteaters or pangolins, and used their claws to dig into termite mounds.

Another dinosaur which had an extremely unique diet was Spinosaurus. You may be surprised to see it here, since it’s such a well-known species. In my opinion, Spinosaurus become so familiar that people have forgotten just how bizarre a beast it was. Paleontologists make shocking discoveries about it all the time, and there’s still much left to learn.

Roaming the wetlands of Cretaceous North Africa, it was possibly the largest terrestrial carnivore of all time, with length estimates ranging from 12 to 18 metres. It had the semi-aquatic, piscivorous lifestyle of a crocodile, humorously stubby hind-legs, a highly elongated torso, a long snout pockmarked with pressure receptors, a paddle-shaped tail, and of course a massive sail on its back. If that’s not weird, I don’t know what is.

Last but not least, let’s meet the scansoriopterygids. I can’t seem to stop writing about these guys - in fact, this is the sixth time they’ve popped up in one of my answers - but they are more than cool enough to deserve all the attention. So, I might as well describe them again. This family inhabited East Asia, during the late Jurassic.

Scansoriopterygids’ claim to fame is their wings, as I’m sure you’ve guessed. They were not feathered wings, like those of birds, but rather formed by membranes of skin (patagia), like those of bats. These wings could be used to glide, and maybe even to flap, through the ancient Asian forests. Of the four discovered species, the largest measured two feet in length, and was the nearest thing we have to a real-life dragon.

So there you have it - the five non-avian dinosaur lineages which I believe are the most unusual, unique, amusing and fascinating. You might have noticed that all but one of my examples lived in the Cretaceous period, the end of the dinosaur era. By then, dinosaurs had been around long enough to flourish into more diverse and specialized forms.

That really makes you wonder how many oddballs might have evolved had that asteroid not struck the Earth 65.5 million years ago, or indeed if us mammals have a more varied and wacky future ahead of us.

First of all, we’ve got the wacky and wonderful Deinocheirus.\n\nThis Mongolian dinosaur lived 70 million years ago, in an environment that was likely quite similar to that of the modern Okavango Delta: a lush, sprawling wetland in the midst of an otherwise barren desert. It was a member of ornithomimosaurs; dinosaurs who were typically lean and speedy, built like ostriches. Deinocheirus, however, was far from that.\n\nIt was a jaw-dropping 11 metres in length, and its eight-foot long arms were tipped with claws bigger than kitchen knives. Fortunately for hopeful time travellers, however, it was a plant-eater. It had a massive hump on its back and a flattened, shovel-shaped bill. In short, Deinocheirus could be described as a cross between a T. rex, a camel, a sloth and a spoonbill.\n\nIt coexisted with numerous species of therizinosaurs, which definitely deserve a spot in this pantheon too. They lived mainly in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period, and were somewhat related to the iconic dromaeosaurs, which included species like Velociraptor. However, they were superficially very different from raptors, or any other animal for that matter.\n\nUp to 10 metres in length, therizinosaurs were covered in feathers, had short beaks and long necks, and wielded the largest claws of any known animals ever to live, at up to a metre each. Again, they were thankfully herbivorous, probably living a similar leaf-eating lifestyle to the giant ground sloths of the Ice Age. The structures of their inner ears and forebrain were also unusually developed, perhaps indicating astute hearing, good balance, or even intelligence.\n\nAmong the closest cousins of the therizinosaurs were the equally odd alvarezsaurs. This is ironic, because anatomically they’re basically the complete opposite. They were dainty little guys, with some species measuring as little as 50 centimetres in length, and evolved around 86 million years ago, lasting up until the end of the Cretaceous.\n\nAlvarezsaurs’ big stand-out features were their comically teeny tiny arms, which contained only one claw. They make Tyrannosaurus rex look like a veritable gibbon. Short they may have been, but they were extremely muscular, as was the pectoral area. This, in addition to their thin, tubular snouts, suggest that they were myrmecophages (predators of ants and termites), like anteaters or pangolins, and used their claws to dig into termite mounds.\n\nAnother dinosaur which had an extremely unique diet was Spinosaurus. You may be surprised to see it here, since it’s such a well-known species. In my opinion, Spinosaurus become so familiar that people have forgotten just how bizarre a beast it was. Paleontologists make shocking discoveries about it all the time, and there’s still much left to learn.\n\nRoaming the wetlands of Cretaceous North Africa, it was possibly the largest terrestrial carnivore of all time, with length estimates ranging from 12 to 18 metres. It had the semi-aquatic, piscivorous lifestyle of a crocodile, humorously stubby hind-legs, a highly elongated torso, a long snout pockmarked with pressure receptors, a paddle-shaped tail, and of course a massive sail on its back. If that’s not weird, I don’t know what is.\n\nLast but not least, let’s meet the scansoriopterygids. I can’t seem to stop writing about these guys - in fact, this is the sixth time they’ve popped up in one of my answers - but they are more than cool enough to deserve all the attention. So, I might as well describe them again. This family inhabited East Asia, during the late Jurassic.\n\nScansoriopterygids’ claim to fame is their wings, as I’m sure you’ve guessed. They were not feathered wings, like those of birds, but rather formed by membranes of skin (patagia), like those of bats. These wings could be used to glide, and maybe even to flap, through the ancient Asian forests. Of the four discovered species, the largest measured two feet in length, and was the nearest thing we have to a real-life dragon.\n\nSo there you have it - the five non-avian dinosaur lineages which I believe are the most unusual, unique, amusing and fascinating. You might have noticed that all but one of my examples lived in the Cretaceous period, the end of the dinosaur era. By then, dinosaurs had been around long enough to flourish into more diverse and specialized forms.\n\nThat really makes you wonder how many oddballs might have evolved had that asteroid not struck the Earth 65.5 million years ago, or indeed if us mammals have a more varied and wacky future ahead of us.

Kate Scott,Updated Sep 13,What was your first thought when you woke up this morning?,"“Oh, that little shit!”

This morning I woke up to the boyfriend shaking me.

“Get up, I’ve got bad news.”

Once I opened my eyes, he told me the news: My rat’s cage had somehow not been shut properly and one of my rats (the girl, of course) was nowhere to be found.

I trudged into the living room and sure enough: the cage door was wide open.

My male rat, Melon, was sitting on the ledge being the very good boy that he is. Milo, however, was gone.

I was certain that I would never find her. She’s a rat with an entire house to herself; what are the odds of me stumbling across her?

I was feeling a weird mixture of worried and livid.

Luckily, I remembered that they were getting very good at coming to me when I whistled for them.

With a sigh, I sat in the middle of my living room and started doing ‘the whistle’.

Nothing.

I did it for another minute or so, when I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye. I peered at my couch and whistled again.

Suddenly, a nose appeared from under the couch.

Then some whiskers.

And finally, her little head popped out to greet me.

I rustled her food bag and she ran over and sat on my lap.

After giving her a very mean “you’re in trouble” look, I gave her a treat and tossed her (rather unceremoniously) into her cage.

There was a funny part though:

As I was whistling for her, I had the cage doors open and Melon (the male rat) was going bananas.

Every time I whistled, he would come charging at me and hop around in his cage as if to say, “You whistled and I came! I’m here! Mom! What the actual fuck?!”

By the 5th time I whistled, he had resorted to launching himself onto my shoulder and running back and forth across my neck until I gave him a treat.

At least one of them is well trained…

E2A: Here’s my little monster looking oh-so-innocent.

Do not let her looks fool you.

She is planning her next escape…","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/47n0vs1dzaiwcf6q', 'title': 'What was your first thought when you woke up this morning?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“Oh, that little shit!”\n\nThis morning I woke up to the boyfriend shaking me.\n\n“Get up, I’ve got bad news.”\n\nOnce I opened my eyes, he told me the news: My rat’s cage had somehow not been shut properly and one of my rats (the girl, of course) was nowhere to be found.\n\nI trudged into the living room and sure enough: the cage door was wide open.\n\nMy male rat, Melon, was sitting on the ledge being the very good boy that he is.

Gary Meaney,4y,What's the oddest lifeform ever discovered?,"The other answerers’ submissions are all well and good, but If I’m honest, I think I can do them one better with these critters.

Rhizocephala

If I was to bet on the most bizarre animal in the world, my submission would be the barnacles of the superorder Rhizocephala. They’re also pretty spine-chilling, and of course they’re parasites too.

A Rhizocephalan begins life as a larva called a nauplius. It is this stage in the life cycle alone that identifies them as a crustacean, let alone a barnacle, they’re so absurd. This is a Rhizocephalan nauplius:

As crustacean larvae go, they look fairly standard, except for one thing - they completely lack a digestive system. No mouth, no gut, no anus. As such, the larvae don’t eat at all; they just float around and molt several times.

After they’ve molted enough times, they become an adult, or cyprid. The normal barnacles you see encrusted on rocks at the beach are in the cyprid stage. However, a Rhizocephalan cyprid is absolutely nothing like that of any other barnacle.

They have no legs or appendages, no segmentation (both crucial features of all other arthropods), and virtually no internal organs except a handful of muscles and reproductive bits. If the cyprid is female, it’ll attach itself to an unwitting host - usually, a crab, but sometimes a shrimp or other decapod.

Once it attaches, it metamorphoses into the final stage. The female literally injects most of her internal cell mass into the crab. This shapeless soup of cells becomes a network of roots which snake throughout the inside of the host’s body - these roots are collectively known as the interna.

And, yes, it’s going to get a lot, lot stranger. Where the crab’s reproductive organs (now eaten by the barnacle) once were, a large bulbous sac grows - the externa, pictured above. Here’s some more externae (externas?), marked with the letters “ex”.

For now, the externa is immature, but that’s about to change. Up to this point, we’ve only been talking about the females. Meanwhile, the males have not left the cyprid form and are still swimming about.

When males find the female, they latch onto her externa, and like she did to the host, inject their internal cells into the sac. Once inside - get this - they transform into nothing but a few, free-swimming sperm-forming cells. That’s all. This makes them both the simplest males in all the animal kingdom and the most sexually dimorphic creatures in the world.

(Human spermatogenic cells, couldn’t find any Rhizocephalan ones)

Now, the now-mature female ejects her eggs into the internal cavity of the bulbous externa. The males - or rather, what was the males - fertilize these eggs and die. The fertilised eggs transform into two morphs: large eggs which will hatch as females and small eggs which will end up as males. When they hatch, the cycle restarts.

There's one last thing I'd like to mention. To top it all off, the barnacle exerts a sort of mind control on its host. Even if they're males, the crab is somehow tricked into thinking that the externa is its egg sac, and it will care for it like it would its own young. What's more, because they've been castrated, they don't have the hormones which cause them to molt, so the Rhizocephalan is in no danger of falling off.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8og5lqyhe2np0wdb', 'title': ""What's the oddest lifeform ever discovered?"", 'score': {'original': 0.6849, 'ai': 0.3151}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The other answerers’ submissions are all well and good, but If I’m honest, I think I can do them one better with these critters.\n\nRhizocephala\n\nIf I was to bet on the most bizarre animal in the world, my submission would be the barnacles of the superorder Rhizocephala.

Kathy Stuart,4y,Have you ever discovered something about your pet that shocked you?,"I have a house full of rescues and throwaways. This spring I rescued a wee opossum from a flea market. I was not in any way looking to acquire an opossum, especially one so young. But there ya go.

Victoria Parsons,2y,What have you discovered when you cleaned out a vehicle you have just purchased?,"We purchased a used car from an auction once. It was in really good shape but needed to be cleaned since it was dirty from sitting for awhile. So I drove it home while my husband drove the other car, this one was a present for me.

Now before anyone gets into an uproar about my husband buying me a cheap car at an auction instead of a nice new car from the dealership, I was the one who told him lets go see about a car at the auction.

The car was a Mercedes, a convertible even that had reasonable mileage on it but for some reason the owner never retrieved it from the impound yard so it went up for auction and we won it.

So I get it home and told my husband that we had to clean this car because it smelled some and was dirty. He went and got the stuff from the garage and we began detailing it. Washed everything outside, waxed it so it looked brand new.

Now came the inside, we started cleaning it and the seats and dashboard looked fantastic, like the day it came off the showroom. He started checking the HVAC system in the car to change the filter since it didn’t blow as well as it should as well as it smelled some.

So he started taking the dashboard apart to get to the HVAC lines, blower and filter when he started screaming for me. I thought that he had hurt himself but he tells me to look inside and tell me what I see. I couldn’t believe it either.

Stuffed inside the vent tubes coming from the blower to the air vents were wads of money. We couldn’t believe it. After we got it all out, we counted it and found out that not only there was enough money to pay the cost of this car from the auction, but about four times more than we paid.

No, we didn’t go back to the police auction to report what we found, we figured if we did, they would have just taken it from us and possibly the car as well for a case or something.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/28eh1zx6ibo73uc9', 'title': 'What have you discovered when you cleaned out a vehicle you have just purchased?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'We purchased a used car from an auction once.

Gary Meaney,4y,What are the most remarkable caterpillars discovered?,"Ooh, I’m glad I came across this question. I happen to have a soft spot for caterpillars; they’re among my favourite arthropods, and they’re a lot cooler than you think. I know I say that in practically every answer I write, but it’s true. Here we go, then.

Hickory horned devil: This 15-centimeter giant is probably the largest caterpillar in the world. Easily one of the weirdest insects in the contiguous US, its vivid colours and elaborate spikes give it a fearsome appearance, despite it being totally harmless. It metamorphoses into an attractive orange, grey and white moth.
Amphibious caterpillars: These 12 species (which, as of yet, have no Latin names) are endemic to Hawaii. They are the only insects which are truly amphibious, and can survive underwater longer than any other air-breathing animal - up to a month! They do this using respiratory pores in their skin and actually require flowing water to breathe.
Carnivorous caterpillars: Another Hawaiian endemic, these 3 species in the diverse moth genus Eupithecia are unique for their predatory habits. They lie motionless in wait, mimicking twigs or stems, until an insect flies by, which they snatch using the terrible hooked claws on their forelimbs. Scaled up, these would be terrifying predators.
Snail-eating caterpillar: Like the previous creature, this one is both carnivorous and only found in Hawaii. They feed only on land snails, catching them using nets of silk. They then crawl inside the snail’s shell and eat it alive, from the inside out. And get this - they decorate their bodies with their victim’s shells, likely for camouflage reasons.
Slug caterpillars: The larvae of this family (Limacodidae) are so named for their slug-like appearance. They’re rotund and gelatinous, and have suckers, rather than legs, on their undersides. They move via rhythmic rippling of their belly and a kind of liquefied silk which functions as a lubricant.
Spun glass caterpillar: While it is in the slug caterpillar family, I had to give this one a separate bullet because it’s so incredibly beautiful. Looking like a handcrafted glass ornament, it’s covered in transparent crystalline barbs which can give you severe dermatitis if touched. They’re mainly found on the East Coast of the USA and feed on oak leaves.
Jewel caterpillars: This family of moths, Dalceridae, is often confused with the slug caterpillars, as the larvae of both families are gelatinous in appearance. They’re covered in jelly-like mucus, and when predators - like ants - try to attack, they get stuck in this goop and starve. You should also look up an adult jewel caterpillar moth - they’re beautiful too.
Flannel moth caterpillars: These caterpillars are instantly recognizable, as they’re covered in a coat of long fur (which is actually venomous setae, so don’t touch one), which can be yellow, brown, white, or even curly. One species, found in Peru, looks remarkably like Donald Trump’s hair, which has gained it Internet fame.
Hag moth caterpillar: It’s easy to see why this critter is nicknamed monkey slug, what with its brown furry appearance and limb-like appendages. These “arms”, of which there are six, are able to detach and regrow without any harm to the caterpillar. While some people report no symptoms, others may experience irritation after touching its tufts of setae.

And that’s all I’ve got, for now anyway. While we’re here, here’s a fun fact about caterpillars - they turn into butterflies, right? Wrong. Well, mostly - about 90% of the caterpillars there are, and probably an even higher percentage of those you’ve encountered, metamorphose into moths, not butterflies. Anyway, thanks for reading.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pjbn1qlmc9zdy6iv', 'title': 'What are the most remarkable caterpillars discovered?', 'score': {'original': 0.45355, 'ai': 0.54645}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Ooh, I’m glad I came across this question.

Patrick Gono,2y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Forget about oven mitts. Get a pair of welding gloves!

Wait, hear me out.

My mom always complained about her oven mitts. They were either too thin, making prolonged handling of hot dishes difficult. Or they were too thick, making them clumsy. For some reason, the fabric would quickly deteriorate, even when using non-budget pairs. And more often than not, they were too short — she’d often get burns on her forearms when reaching inside a hot oven, oven mitts only protect your hands.

However, one day she found a pair of welding gloves lying around, and got the genius idea to use them in the kitchen.

These things are:

Very robust, literally industrial strength. No fear of them falling apart.
Heat-proof up to hundreds of degrees Celsius
Made of rough fabric, and have fingers, making handling of various dishes very simple. No slipping and dropping your lasagne ever again!
Quite long, offering total protection not only for your hands, but your wrists and forearms too. No need to worry about touching the edge of a blazing hot oven when reaching into it.
Are generally quite cheap, $20 bucks or so. Not much difference to “premium” (but still garbage) oven mitts.

I recently received a pair from her as a birthday gift. I tossed my oven mitts immediately. From then on, it’s welding gloves all the way.

Karamvir Sehgal,Updated 4y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Some of the hacks that I knew are :-

1.Soaking a sock in water and then putting a bottle in it, is a great way to keep drinking water cool, especially in dry areas.

2. Packing clothes efficiently.

3. Peeing in the showerprevents/cures athlete's foot.

4.Tying knots on the top of the laces prevents boots from coming untied. Also, tying the knot at the centre of laces prevents them from getting off-centred.

5. If you don't have time to iron your wrinkled clothes, try spraying them with water and then hang them to dry.

6.Syndicate opportunities preserve your night vision when a car approaches you with its high beams lit, try closing one eye. When the car has passed, switch eyes until the eye exposed to the bright light has recovered.

7. If you want your leather shoes to shine like a mirror, try the fire method!

8.Using duct tape on the feet to prevent blisters, hot spots, etc works way better than using moleskin or bandaid on the same area.

9. Runner's tights keep you warmer than most varieties of lower-half thermal wear, and they'll fit under most of your clothes.

10. To prevent the painful blisters and shoe bites, soak your DMS boots in water to make them soft.

11. To avoid your shirt from looking poofy, try tucking it the militaryway.

12.If you think someone is following you, make four consecutive right turns. If they're still there, drive to a police or fire station.

13.Women's maxi pads do wonders in stopping blood flow as they don't stick to wounds, and they soak up a lot.

14.Also, powdered sugar or sugar paste can be used to cover the wound as bacteria can't survive in an environment with a high sugar content.

15.Mixing cotton balls and vaseline together is a feasible way to start afire.

Vincent Person,Updated 1y,What animal that you recently just discovered surprised you?,"Do you know this strange mouse with deer legs?

No, there is no trickery or strange mutation here, this animal really exists! Its name is Tragulidae (or chevrotain).

This small deer-like species with tiny fangs had been considered extinct for over 30 years and some even feared it was gone forever until one of its representatives was photographed in 2019 in southern Vietnam.

The chevrotains are the smallest existing ungulates, never weighing more than 44 lb (adults of the genus Tragulus can weigh less than 3.3 lb)

Most Tragulidae species live in the forests of Southeast Asia and India. Preferring tropical rainforests, they are essentially nocturnal. The 3 Asian species prefer rocky areas while the aquatic chevrotain, good swimmer, prefers wet places. They feed on fallen fruits and foliage.

It is often called mouse-deer, but no species of Tragulidae has antlers or horns unlike other ruminants.

Sunny Dhondkar,3y,What new thing did you discover today?,"I discovered something common between these two things:

Sweating

Earthen Pot (used to store water)

So, what could be the similarity between these two things?

I will tell you that under the investigation of this question:

How does earthen pot make water cold?

Well, you might have wondered over this question many times while drinking the cold and soothing water from an earthen pot in your home.

Earthen pots are majorly used to store water and cool it, in many parts of India, since ancient times, especially in summers.

Even if you put hot water in the pot, it becomes cold after some time.
That’s why it is preferred to be used for cooling drinking water, instead of refrigerators.

An earthen pot is made from mud clay. (Combination of two types of mud clay, actually).
This clay is mixed with water and then it is shaped properly. It is then dried for days.
This process takes about 7–8 days.

Since we add water in the mud (to shape the pot) and then we dry it, the water evaporates from the surface. This leaves tiny pores on the surface of the pot.

That is, the earthen pot is porous on a microscopic level. You can’t detect these pores with your naked eyes.

When this pot is finally made, you take it to your house and store water in it.

Those tiny pores on the surface of the pot let some water out by Capillary action.

The capillary action is a behaviour of liquid getting out from a narrow and slim tube. Even if gravity is present to oppose this flow. The force that helps water to get up, opposing to gravity, is Surface Tension.

You might remember this effect if you have played with a straw in your childhood. (Once you suck water from a straw… it keeps flowing out without any required pulling force like suction).

This is how the water gets out of a general tube due to capillary action:

Similar is the case with the millions of ‘microscopic level tubes’ in an earthen pot.

Once the water gets out on the surface of the pot, it gains heat from the surface of the pot for evaporation.

We know that, if a substance changes its state, it requires energy.
So, the water consumes heat from the surface of the pot, to change its state from liquid to water vapour.

This drops the temperature of the surface of the pot and makes it colder.
This leads to the cooling effect of water inside the pot.

Same is the case when you sweat:

When you work out or exercise for a while… your body gains heat due to high exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. A high amount of sweat is produced even when you are giving an exam and you mark the option: none of these.
To reduce the temperature of your body, sweat is released from the tiny pores on your skin.

Water present in the sweat undergoes vaporization and uses heat from your body for that. This, in turn, makes your body cold.

It is so amazing to know that sweating of body and earthen pot cooling effect work under the same mechanism.

Sunny Dhondkar

Post credits:

Now, what about the refrigerators?

Is there any similarity between the cooling effect of an Earthen Pot and a Refrigerator?

Now, the mechanism of a Refrigerator quite big.

But I will be glad to tell you that one part of this mechanism uses the same principle as that of an earthen pot!

A refrigerant is used inside the body of a Refrigerator. A common example is of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (the chemicals you were taught in the class of Environmental Science, which cause the Greenhouse effect).

We have one step in the cooling mechanism of the Refrigerator: Throttling process.

In this process, an Expansion Device is used. A narrow tube is used in this device.

When liquid refrigerant is passed through this device, it undergoes a sudden declination in pressure.
When the pressure is reduced, the boiling point of the liquid is reduced too.

So, some part of the liquid refrigerant turns into a gas (it vaporizes).

This is when the principle of earthen pot cooling effect comes into play.

This process is carried out in an adiabatic surrounding. (That is, the refrigerant can’t exchange heat energy from the surrounding).
Oh. If this is the case... From where will the refrigerant get heat energy for vaporizing itself?

Well, since the walls of the device don’t allow heat exchange from surrounding, the small amount of refrigerant that vaporizes… has the only option of consuming heat from the remaining liquid refrigerant itself.

This, in turn, leads to a drastic decrease in the temperature of the remaining liquid refrigerant. Hence, it cools down.

Ian O'Grady,7mo,What is the most recent thing that scientists have discovered?,"A new species of cat has just been identified from the Galeras Volcano, in South Colombia.

Mondit Mahanta,Updated 6y,What is the most interesting historical fact you know off the top of your head?,"It was a battle that was almost impossible to win. The Small kingdom in a corner of northeast against Mighty Aurangzeb who controlled 25% of world GDP. It was a no match

On 27 December 1667, Aurangzeb’s 4,000 troopers (from his char-hazaari mansab), 1,500 ahadis (soldiers recruited by the Emperor) and 500 barqandezes by an additional 30,000 infantrymen, 21 Rajput chiefs (Thakurs) with their contingents, 18,000 cavalry, 2,000 archers and shieldmen and 40 ships and led by non other than the glorious Rajput hero Ram Singh, son of Jai Singh of Amber and finally joined by the armies of Kochbehar- Aurangzeb’s vassal marched to capture Assam , ruled by the Ahoms.

Mughals had Turkish cannons that had range of miles and what did Ahoms have?

Few men with determination forged in fire.

So before the judgement day, Mughals camped at the hillock of Itakhuli overlooking Brahmaputra river where the battle was to take place- The fearsome Turkish cannons pointing towards the river, ready to sink Ahom boats. It was a master stroke from Ramsingh because Ahoms were outnumbered in Land and hence he knew they will choose naval battle; it was a matter of hours before the canons would annihilate Ahom boats.

But Ram Singh underestimated Ahom’s strategy and Espionage- Lachit, the supreme commander of Ahom army, sent a group of spies under the cover of night to neutralize the cannons. The Assamese spies, who knew the terrain at their fingernails, poured water in all the cannons and the gunpowder stocks and silently returned back to Ahom camp.

Next day, as the Ahom’s small boats covered the entire Brahmaputra, Ramsingh ordered the firing of the cannons. But the cannons didn’t fire, the gun powders were dampened and expert Ahom boatmen with their small cannons (Or hiloi as it is called in Assamese) sank boat after boat of the Mughal intruders forcing a humiliating retreat. Mughals tasted ignominious defeat and never dared to look towards Assam again.

And rest, as they say, is history.

Jesus Rueda Rodriguez,Updated 4y,"If Antarctica was not discovered until the year 1818, then why does it seem to appear on many older maps (dated medieval and before)?","Indeed, many maps do show a southern continent something like this:

Notice the big continent in the south? Impressive huh. That’s a 1570 map by Abraham Ortelius. It is huge! Cannot miss it!

From the 15th century onwards, Europeans embarked on an age of discovery - seeking to explore the entire world. And part of that exploration meant that the world needed to be mapped.

So, cartographers built maps. World maps - in a few years even more detail was shown on the southern continent. Here, let’s have a look at one of the most famous maps of the 16th century:

This is the 1569 Mercator Map - Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata or if you prefer the New and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation.

Notice again - a big southern continent with an intricate coastline and a lot of detail there… but not much of it with any bearing on reality.

The Mercator map is interesting because it actually has a note regarding the southern continent:

On the approach from the Southern Continent to Java Major.

Ludovico di Varthema, in Bk.3, on India, Chapt.27, reports that on the southern side of Java Major, to the southward, there are peoples who sail with their backs to our stars of the north until they find a day of but 4 hours, i.e. to the 63rd. degree of latitude and he refers to this as coming from the mouth of his Indian pilot. As for Marco Polo, the Venetian, he saw opposite this continent some provinces and several islands and he noted the distances to Java Minor, which, according to him, is evidently neither the isle of Borneo nor some island lying to the eastward of Java Major (as most do variously think) for he says that it runs so far to the southward that neither the arctic pole nor its stars, i.e. the Little Bear, may be seen therefrom; and, in chapt.16, he states that in one of its Kingdoms, called Samara, neither of the two Bears can be seen ; therefore, considering the circumference of the island, which he states to be 2,000 miles, it is certain that its northern extremity goes beyond at least the 20th degree of southern latitude. Thus we conclude, therefrom, that the Southern continent extends far to the northward and makes, with Java Major, a strait; John Mandeville, an author who, though he relates some fables, is not to be disregarded as concerns the positions of places, is of the same opinion when he declares, in chapter 108, that the Red Sea is separated from the Eastern Ocean near Taprobana and the neighbouring regions and isles.

Or in other words - Marco Polo saw some land down there south of Java Major (in this case Java Major is the island of Java) - notice how Mercator accepts that there is some big continent just to the south of Java.

It seems like everyone seemed to know about Antarctica well before 1818 doesn’t it?

Except - they didn’t.

So why was everyone putting big continents in the southern end of their maps?

Blame antiquity. In fact blame the ideas of Claudius Ptolemy. He was a mathematician, geographer, astrologer, and generally someone really interested in the physical world. He lived in Alexandria in the 2nd century BC - and his works were very advanced for the time - his geography is one of the best descriptions of the world as seen by the Romans which we have.

However he had an idea which became pervasive but was fundamentally incorrect - the idea that because there were so many lands in the north, there needed to be a counterweight southern continent to balance the earth.

That idea pervaded cartography through the middle ages and into the age of exploration - the idea that there had to be some kind of southern lands - Terra Australis to balance the northern landmasses.

Cartographers initially thought the land was huge - they took any sightings of land masses to the south of the known world as a part of this southern continent - this Terra Australis.

As exploration continued, the area of Terra Australis became smaller and smaller - explorers showed that previous land masses were really only islands, and not really part of the southern continent. In fact by the end of the 18th century the idea of a true Terra Australis was mostly considered to be an old wive’s tale - a fable from old maps based on rumours.

And in a curious twist in 1820 a Russian expedition led by Fabian von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev actually discovered Antarctica.

So the legend turned out to be true - even though it had absolutely nothing to do with the balancing of the northern landmass. One of those curious cases of right answer, wrong reasoning.

And all those old maps showing Antarctica - a case of cartographers drawing up maps as they expected the world to be, and just maybe, of trying to show off their knowledge of the entire world - no empty spaces out there!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/s8boavg76c3h1q2u', 'title': 'If Antarctica was not discovered until the year 1818, then why does it seem to appear on many older maps (dated medieval and before)?', 'score': {'original': 0.99955, 'ai': 0.00045}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Indeed, many maps do show a southern continent something like this:\n\nNotice the big continent in the south?

Impressive huh. That’s a 1570 map by Abraham Ortelius. It is huge! Cannot miss it!\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, Europeans embarked on an age of discovery - seeking to explore the entire world. And part of that exploration meant that the world needed to be mapped.\n\nSo, cartographers built maps. World maps - in a few years even more detail was shown on the southern continent. Here, let’s have a look at one of the most famous maps of the 16th century:\n\nThis is the 1569 Mercator Map - Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata or if you prefer the New and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation.\n\nNotice again - a big southern continent with an intricate coastline and a lot of detail there… but not much of it with any bearing on reality.\n\nThe Mercator map is interesting because it actually has a note regarding the southern continent:\n\nOn the approach from the Southern Continent to Java Major.\n\nLudovico di Varthema, in Bk.3, on India, Chapt.27, reports that on the southern side of Java Major, to the southward, there are peoples who sail with their backs to our stars of the north until they find a day of but 4 hours, i.e. to the 63rd. degree of latitude and he refers to this as coming from the mouth of his Indian pilot. As for Marco Polo, the Venetian, he saw opposite this continent some provinces and several islands and he noted the distances to Java Minor, which, according to him, is evidently neither the isle of Borneo nor some island lying to the eastward of Java Major (as most do variously think) for he says that it runs so far to the southward that neither the arctic pole nor its stars, i.e. the Little Bear, may be seen therefrom; and, in chapt.16, he states that in one of its Kingdoms, called Samara, neither of the two Bears can be seen ; therefore, considering the circumference of the island, which he states to be 2,000 miles, it is certain that its northern extremity goes beyond at least the 20th degree of southern latitude. Thus we conclude, therefrom, that the Southern continent extends far to the northward and makes, with Java Major, a strait; John Mandeville, an author who, though he relates some fables, is not to be disregarded as concerns the positions of places, is of the same opinion when he declares, in chapter 108, that the Red Sea is separated from the Eastern Ocean near Taprobana and the neighbouring regions and isles.\n\nOr in other words - Marco Polo saw some land down there south of Java Major (in this case Java Major is the island of Java) - notice how Mercator accepts that there is some big continent just to the south of Java.\n\nIt seems like everyone seemed to know about Antarctica well before 1818 doesn’t it?\n\nExcept - they didn’t.\n\nSo why was everyone putting big continents in the southern end of their maps?\n\nBlame antiquity. In fact blame the ideas of Claudius Ptolemy. He was a mathematician, geographer, astrologer, and generally someone really interested in the physical world. He lived in Alexandria in the 2nd century BC - and his works were very advanced for the time - his geography is one of the best descriptions of the world as seen by the Romans which we have.\n\nHowever he had an idea which became pervasive but was fundamentally incorrect - the idea that because there were so many lands in the north, there needed to be a counterweight southern continent to balance the earth.\n\nThat idea pervaded cartography through the middle ages and into the age of exploration - the idea that there had to be some kind of southern lands - Terra Australis to balance the northern landmasses.\n\nCartographers initially thought the land was huge - they took any sightings of land masses to the south of the known world as a part of this southern continent - this Terra Australis.\n\nAs exploration continued, the area of Terra Australis became smaller and smaller - explorers showed that previous land masses were really only islands, and not really part of the southern continent. In fact by the end of the 18th century the idea of a true Terra Australis was mostly considered to be an old wive’s tale - a fable from old maps based on rumours.\n\nAnd in a curious twist in 1820 a Russian expedition led by Fabian von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev actually discovered Antarctica.\n\nSo the legend turned out to be true - even though it had absolutely nothing to do with the balancing of the northern landmass.

Ken Saladin,3y,What were some of the most interesting discoveries you made while working/studying on General Biology?,"l haven’t discovered anything very earth-shaking in biology.

The most important was the following because (1) my doctoral committee considered it important enough to grant me a Ph.D. for it, so l owe my career to these little creatures, and (2) l published it, so it became part of public scientific knowledge.[1] [2] (If you don’t do that, it’s not science.) (Oddly, l could find only a Russian translation of that second reference just now.)

These are the aquatic, infective larvae, called cercariae, of a human blood fluke. lt causes a very serious tropical disease, schistosomiasis, affecting and killing millions, from ancient Egypt to modern Puerto Rico. It’s about half a millimeter long, a mere speck in the water you have to squint at (or use a microscope) to see.

It reacts to light and shadows, which it senses by means of only two, highly modified, ciliated neurons near its anterior end that my major professor discovered by electron microscopy. These are his EM images of the receptor.[3]

Through many, many long lonely nights spent staring at these guys in a spectrum of monochromatic lights in a photographic darkroom, followed by long tedious days of computer-assisted analysis of data, l found that the presumed light-absorbing pigment in those two cells has an absorption spectrum almost identical to that of rhodopsin, the visual pigment in the rod cells of the human and other vertebrate eyes. This and other studies in the literature, of other species, suggest that the gene for the protein component of rhodopsin is highly conserved over evolutionary time and hasn’t changed much from flatworms to humans.

*

The other discovery l consider most interesting was made in work with one of my students, a visiting summer scholar on a National Science Foundation grant for undergraduate research. We worked on a tiny, gnat-sized parasitoid wasp called the jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. Nasonia lays her eggs inside the pupae of blowflies; the big brown object beneath her is a pupal case (puparium) she’s drilling into with her ovipositor. Her larvae eat the blowfly pupa within, then emerge, fly away, and home in on the smell of animal carcasses where they’re likely to find mates and more blowfly hosts.

Using choice chambers (olfactometers) to study the behavior of “newborn” and older female wasps, and both mated and virgin females, we found newly emerged virgin females to be repelled by carrion odor, but mated females 5 hours old to be strongly attracted to it.

This makes sense because by the time adult female wasps emerge, the carcass where their parents met, mated, and laid eggs is usually depleted. If a new female laid her eggs there, her young probably wouldn’t be successful. It’s better for new virgin females to disperse before they mate. That also helps to protect against inbreeding—mating with local males that may have come from the same mother. But after 5 hours, the new females would likely be well dispersed, so now they’re seeking fresh carrion and blowflies, a place to find mates and lay their eggs.

This never became part of published knowledge (true science) because (1) by the end of the summer when the student returned to his home campus, we didn’t have a large enough sample size to make our conclusions defensible and publishable; it took half the summer just to get our techniques down, and the weeks remaining after that were too short to collect enough data. (2) l would actually have discarded those data anyway and run trials with better methodology if l wanted to publish this. (3) After that student left, l returned to a heavy load of teaching and didn’t have time to continue this work. Even keeping wasp and blowfly cultures going, let alone experiments and data gathering, was very laborious. l never had another research student come along to pick up where this preliminary study left off.

But it was a pretty cool, intriguing observation, on 20 or 30 females, that might have been worth pursuing farther.

John Dennis,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Waiting !!!

Waiting at least 24 hours before making a big decision that will likely determine the course of your life:

Got a job offer? Don't make a decision yet. Wait for 24 hours and think over it. Don't be impulsive! This is a big deal choice.

Got fired? Wait for 24 hours and think what happened and what is your next best step. Don't rush to call the next recruiter that pops up on your job search.

Are you upset at your family because of a big disagreement? Don't tell them immediately that they are clueless. Wait for at least 24 hours and think about it: Is it really worth it to deteriorate life’s most important relationship?

Are you almost going to yell at your incompetent coworker? Don't do it yet! Wait for 24 hours before damaging your relationship with your colleague. Think it over and devise a plan on how to discuss things over.

My point is that a lot of times in our lives we are driven by our impulses and that we make decisions driven by a moment’s emotion. Countless regrets follow because of impulsivity, life changes not for the better , relationships are broken, misery and frustration can conquer your psychological well-being.

So please wait for a while before you fight with your family, wait for a while before you yell at your colleague, wait for a while before immediately committing to that job offer.

While thinking things by waiting doesn't necessarily mean that your life choices and outcomes will be the best, at least you tried and considered all of the possibilities. You deeply and genuinely thought about whatever major issues life has thrown at you, and you are sure there will be no regrets over the coming decision. So spare yourself some hardship, regret, tears, and insecurity by waiting. You can do it: you can wait!!

Hope this helps.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ns4e1hv0ijp92toc', 'title': ""What is the most clever life hack you've learned?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Waiting !!!\n\nWaiting at least 24 hours before making a big decision that will likely determine the course of your life:\n\nGot a job offer?
