12. A temple for ‘bommala koluvu’: Wooden temple is made by my son. Painting and all decorations are done by daughter in law.

13. Broom and mop holder (brooms etc are kept behind this door.

14. Warli art and frame: The warli art is drawn by daughter in law and frame is made by my son.

Edit: Many people in the comment section are asking whether it is his profession, whether he sells online and where did he learn etc.

My son and daughter in law, both are engineers in USA(Sudbury, Massachusetts). He has the passion for learning new things, so he joined wood working classes there. He built up a small workshop in his garage.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vxtg0rk8ofyqp2aw', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'These are some creative works done by my son and daughter in law.

Sabeeha,Updated 4y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I just love soapmaking and natural skin care making. I avoid buying almost all cosmetics.

Whenever I go shopping I spend time reading ingredients of creams and other skincare stuff rather than buying…

I can make soaps, lotions, body butters, deodorant creams, baby rash creams, lip balms, facial and body scrubs.. The list goes on..

Mostly, I make them as hobby for myself and family but I have also bartered, sold and ofcourse gifted.

OK here are some of the pics of my handmade skincare..

Lip gloss. It is completely natural even the colour is from alkanet roots…

Neem balm. The smell of neem oil is not so pleasant but still it's a wonder balm for problematic skin and hair.

Charcoal handmade soap.

Apple cider vinegar shampoo bars.

Lipbalm again coloured with alkanet roots.

Body butter. My favourite.

Oats milk and honey handmade soap for kiddies.

Lipstick made with beewax, soywax, cocoa butter and castor oil. Coloured with mica though (usually I don't use micas but wanted a vibrant colour).

Anonymous,Updated 7y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I am not an artist but I do love painting.

But recently (After getting a job) I could not manage enough time to indulge in this favorite pass time of mine.

So... I started painting in MS Paint. (using mouse ):p

Here are some of my works...

Then all 5 merged..It looked something like this...

Next Assignment...

Another one...

Another one is WIP...will upload once completed..

Hope you liked it.. :)

EDIT 1:

Thank you all for your appreciation and suggestions...:)

But... All of these I didn't do in a single go (I am not a very patient person ).. I spend max 1 hr at a time...

I still have an unfinished work which I started last year.. :o

I will definitely try some higher end tools .. again they will require more time and dedication... definitely give them a try some time..

Thanks Gurudutt Mallapur for the idea of using MIT scratch...will try it.

For those who are having a hard time believing that these are created using MS Paint

(*pun intended*) ... I will try and upload a video with steps shortly..

EDIT 2:

Here goes the video ...

still working on it ...

Cheers..","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v0ibp6m1swkt5x9c', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am not an artist but I do love painting.\n\nBut recently (After getting a job) I could not manage enough time to indulge in this favorite pass time of mine.\n\nSo...

Eleftherios Tserkezis,Updated 4y,"How were Greeks able to orally pass down the Iliad and Odyssey despite there being nearly 28,000 total lines of metered poetry between them? Without memorizing the words verbatim, they would have had difficulty speaking the poem in meter.","This question did trouble researchers for quite some time. You see, our modern societies differ from the archaic Greek world in numerous ways, and even the most objective and impartial mind cannot always fully grasp the discrepancy and walk in the shoes (or sandals) of people who lived 3,000 or 2,500 years ago.

A major difference between the two worlds is the level of literacy. That doesn’t have to do only with the number of people who knew how to read and write, but goes even deeper. The ancient Greek society was an oral one in general. Everything, including written texts, existed to be read aloud. Wealthy Classical-age Athenians had slaves called anagnōstai ‘readers’ read to them aloud (fun fact: Plato used to teasingly call Aristotle anagnōstēs, because the latter often stayed at home to read by himself instead of going to the Academy). It’s believed that this changed only during the Roman-Byzantine era, when silent reading became prevalent.

In the early 20th c., a young American Homerist named Milman Parry thought of studying actual bards or rhapsodes in an attempt to better understand how the Homeric epics were passed down before their official recording, which came later. To do so, Parry travelled to Yugoslavia, where literacy rates were low, and small oral cultures still existed, almost detached from the so-called modern world. Parry found that those bards were capable of reproducing thousand-verse long poems.

Above: Milman Parry (right) in Yugoslavia.

Parry’s study and the scholarly tradition it created also answers what seems to trouble the OP the most. You see, for a modern literate person, poetry seems more difficult than prose, right? After all, you have to think about the meter, the rhyme etc., while in prose you simply write anything you want.

Well, for pre-modern oral communities, it seems that the opposite was the case. Poetry is more primitive than prose, at least as far as literature is concerned, because it makes memorization and repetitiveness simpler. Rhythmic schemes offer the bard a strong frame which he simply has to fill in and make it easier for him to recall what remains to be said at any given time.

Closely connected with this trait of poetry is the matter of formulas, also studied by Milman Parry in the context of oral composition and transmittance. The Homeric epics are full of formulas, standard phrases that occupy specific places in verses (usually half-a-verse each) because of their metric pattern. Formulas can also be adapted so that various names can fit in them.

One example will suffice, I think. One of the most commonly used formulaic verses in both the Iliad and the Odyssey is ‘Answering to x, y said.’ Just see how many different forms it can take.

First part—note that all four versions follow exactly the same metric pattern.
Ton d’ apameibomenos prosephē…: Both x and y are male.
Tēn d’ apameibomenos prosephē…: X is female, but y is male.
Ton d’ apameibomenē prosephē…: X is male, but y is female.
Tēn d’ apameibomenē prosephē…: Both x and y are female.
Second part.
…nephelēgereta Zeus: …Zeus, the cloud-gatherer.
…polumētis Odusseus: …Odysseus of many devices.
…podas ōkus Akhilleus: …swift-legged Achilles.
…leukōlenos Hērē: …white-armed Hera.
…kreiōn Agamemnōn: …lord Agamemnon.
…xanthos Menelāos: …blond Menelaus.
…krateros Diomēdēs: …strong Diomedes.
…Dios alkimos huios: …the stout son of Zeus.

Roland Bartetzko,2y,Why do people go to poetry readings?,"If I say that I'm not fond of poetry, it's an understatement. I even wrote an anti-poetry answer here (“poetry is dead!”). Nevertheless, I recently went to my first poetry reading.

It was a rather small event (about 30 people in the backyard of a local pub). With poetry, you clearly can’t attract the masses. While our poetess, a very smart and talented young woman, was reciting from her work, I took a good look at the people around me.

Our young poetess, Uresa Ahmeti, reading from her work.

Here are my thought on why I think they were gathered there:

Friends and family of the poet(s). More than half of the people knew the artist. Most of them were her friends from high school and university, the rest family. I know that because she mentioned them all by name.
Other poets. Unlike people like me who are into prose, poets seem to be less jealous of each other. Maybe it's because they are all suffering from the same non-recognition of their efforts.
People who work in the pub. Our lovely pub manager was there and one of her staff members.
Guests of the pub. People like me and my buddies. I saw this quite often: when artists put their venue in a semi-public place, you get a crossover public. The beer-drinkers listen to the poetry while the poetry lovers have a beer.
People who helped the poet or worked with them (patrons, publishers, editors, translators, etc.).
Often, you also have some journalists at these events but not in this case.

Last but not least:

People who like poetry. Yes, these folks do exist! There was an actress sitting right next to me who has worked for the same TV production company I have worked for. I know that she loves poetry, after the recital, I had a chat with her about it.

It must be said that for poetry, having the author recite their own poems really makes a big difference in how you perceive their work. It’s also interesting to learn how the poems were created, especially how the author felt when she wrote them down. With prose, it doesn’t matter that much.

Although I’m still not a fan of poetry, I didn’t regret going there. It was a good evening and a quite a change to the usual bar atmosphere.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fvponb6iheus29dz', 'title': 'Why do people go to poetry readings?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""If I say that I'm not fond of poetry, it's an understatement.

Nandini Malviya,Updated 5y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I'm a 15 year old self-taught artist. I don't think any other description is required here. So here you go.
Let's get started with the water colours..

(I love how her lips are done the most!)

(I love how the paints spread on their own)

(I love the vibrant colours of this one.)

(This was originally hand made but I applied an 'oil pastel effect' over it)

By Qing Han

Yes I copied his drawing here, I made this by seeing his painting.

(Getting lost..)

Oil pastels (I wish I could do this to my eyes too!)

Without filter

With filter

Pencil colours work..
Pencil coloured landscapes
Beautiful Indian ladies…
Pencil sketches
Pen sketches

(I love doing such hair stuff! )

Some random fun..

(Made by using sketch pens, water colours)

.

~ Thank you !

PS ~ Let me know if you liked them

I tried my hand on the kitchen this time.

Drawing, kitchen ? Sounds weird huh.

You better see, my friend.

Egg, meat, omlet, bread.
Bacon
Time for something sweet and savory! (Yeah, desserts)
Straberry mousse cake.
Cupcakes
Berries
Ice cream with brownie
Chestnut swiss role
Drinks on your way just like summers.
Watermelon
Lemonade
Some more random stuff..

PS - As I love drawing I take screenshots of drawings I find anywhere and I draw them too, if you call it 'copying' then okay but for me it gives me happiness to draw, to get lost in the beauty of art. So okay I copy, copy to make myself happy.

Sure enough, the idea of them may belong to someone else originally but all these, I drew them with my heart and soul.

Being said that, if you don't wanna upvote the answer, don't. But at least don't down vote it and make it get collapsed, I drew these with all I have, it hurts when your art get collapsed because it was somebody's else idea, I would have given the credits but I don't remember the respective artist's names, if you do kindly let me know.

Lastly, a warm thanks to all from the bottom of my heart who liked my work :))
Edit : A lot of people ask me what's up with the age : I drew these drawings when I was 14 or 15 years old and wrote this answer at that time but of course I've grown up and now I'm 18. So, don't get frightened seeing my dp.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/orbai61sfm47kydq', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I'm a 15 year old self-taught artist.

Karishma Dhakad,Updated 5y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I just love Crafts.

The oldest memory which I have of myself crafting, is a thermocol model of mango tree . I remember cutting my hand with the cutter, still adamant to complete it.

These are some of the things I have done till now:

An explosion box card with 20 mini cards (June’15-Sept’15)

I made this for my ‘childhood rival turned friend’ Ankit on his 20th birthday (which was coincidentally on 20th September and 20 cards with wishes from his 20 friends). I started 3 months before his birthday to make a perfect gift for him.

That’s us on Habibganj Railway Station on his Birthday night. (Yeah, we actually celebrated his birthday on a railway station. It was fun!)

Award winning Scrapbook (May’10-June’10)

I won a National level Scrapbook making competition conducted by Dainik Bhaskar which fetched me a laptop from Mr Aamir Khan. (The black scrapbook is mine)

Pseudo framed photos (Oct’15)

These are 2D pics, some of them seem to be framed. This decorated my wall for a while, until I found something better. (See below)

A 16*12 sq. ft DIY wallpaper (Feb’16-Mar’16)

I made this wall paper using 150+ outdated posters and 32 black insulation tape in my hostel room. This makes a wonderful background for my pics! :p

Whoever comes to my room asks me only 2 questions about this, ‘1. How much time did it take? 2. How did I get to such height?’

I placed a chair on the table (shown in the pic) to reach 12 feet.

This is how my room look sometimes!

After I made the wallpaper, it was time to give my wardrobe door a makeover. I tried to create the effect of plywood with again insulation tape and brown packaging tape.

Birthday Card for my roommate (2nd Sept’14; 6hours)
A center step card (May’18) : I made this for a friend's birthday in a very eco-friendly way with one side used papers and a pantaloons bag as the envelope.
Memory box for my boyfriend (Dec’16)

This is what I made for my boyfriend’s birthday. He turned 22 in Dec’16. I made a memory box wherein I put 22 rolled personalized messages for him reminding him of the good time we had spent together.

2 STATES (May’17) : After graduation, my boyfriend got into IIM Bangalore (Karnataka) and went to Tamil Nadu for my job. Taking inspiration from the poster of Chetan Bhagat’s 2 States, I created this for him.

For comparison:

Left one is the original poster. I made the right one with paper. Instead of Punjab, I placed Karnataka.

And the silhouettes are us! :)

CV with a twist (Jan’18) : My academic reports always had a touch of creativity, so how could I leave my CV alone? I wanted to get into Surprise Planning as a career, so I made this!

P.S The contact number in this image is just digits from 9 to 0 written backwards. So don’t bother calling.

Template Source: PowerPoint School

Along with the CV, I also sent my ‘Surprise Portfolio’ and few of my ideas to potential employers.

‘Surprises delivered so far’ : It was a 14 page document where I had described all my surprises.

Chiranjeev Jain,7y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I am a Computer Science student. I mostly deal with programming and stuff but every time I make anything, I try to make the User Interface as good as possible.

I have a hobby of designing User Interfaces for already existing applications which either don’t have a very good UI or could be made better..

I use the Quora app a lot but it has a very poor user experience overall. I have thus tried to make a concept of how Quora could better its user interface with the help of Google’s Material Design guidelines.

Some of those concepts can be seen in the pictures below.

1. Login

2. Quora Home

This is how I imagine the Quora feed to look like. The upvote button and comment buttons are emphasized with bold colouring to encourage people upvoting more. Because lets face it, there’s a lot of difference between the number of views and number of upvotes on your answers. This may not really look like a big change but will definitely encourage people to use this button more. Additional actions to the answers are hidden in the contextual menu button provided with each answers. Every answer is displayed on its own separate card.

3. Expanded Answers

The picture above shows answers in a compact view.

When the user expands the answer, the context buttons would then stick to the bottom of the screen. Just like Quora does it on the web version.

4. Questions

Here’s where you write your answers. Or rather short answers. Clicking on the answer button would expand into a text field and the text editing buttons would then come into view. This is intuitive for writing small answers (which Quora does not like very much) but could be expanded into a full page text view with the contextual menu button.

5. Topics Page

I don’t think there is much to explain here.

Every design I made is my intellectual property and has no relation with Quora whatsoever. I would strongly discourage people using these concepts for personal benefits.

Quora does not provide an open API for app development. So I cannot do it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bnpuz9iom125ljdh', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am a Computer Science student.

Login\n\n2. Quora Home\n\nThis is how I imagine the Quora feed to look like. The upvote button and comment buttons are emphasized with bold colouring to encourage people upvoting more. Because lets face it, there’s a lot of difference between the number of views and number of upvotes on your answers. This may not really look like a big change but will definitely encourage people to use this button more. Additional actions to the answers are hidden in the contextual menu button provided with each answers. Every answer is displayed on its own separate card.\n\n3. Expanded Answers\n\nThe picture above shows answers in a compact view.\n\nWhen the user expands the answer, the context buttons would then stick to the bottom of the screen. Just like Quora does it on the web version.\n\n4. Questions\n\nHere’s where you write your answers. Or rather short answers. Clicking on the answer button would expand into a text field and the text editing buttons would then come into view. This is intuitive for writing small answers (which Quora does not like very much) but could be expanded into a full page text view with the contextual menu button.\n\n5. Topics Page\n\nI don’t think there is much to explain here.\n\nEvery design I made is my intellectual property and has no relation with Quora whatsoever. I would strongly discourage people using these concepts for personal benefits.\n\nQuora does not provide an open API for app development. So I cannot do it.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9998
Hira Khalique,Updated 5y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"Wow, all these answers gave me a serious panic attack.

I was literally sitting in a corner rocking back and forth, thinking hard on the fact whether my answer would be worthy enough to post it on this thread. But whatever, I’ll just give it a try because I like taking risks :P

Ever since I got a little break after A levels, I started drawing mandalas. When I first drew it, I did it out of sheer boredom without even knowing the fact that it’s actually called a ‘mandala’.

Alright so here’s my first try:

I know it looks like an ugly piece of sheet (pun intended) but I swear it gets better. Lets just keep this ugly one between you and I. Ssshhhhs.

→The second one : told you I’d improve :P

→ The third one: This is the largest I’ve done so far, but certainly not the prettiest.

→ The fourth: I guess I got the hang of it now. I did this in the car.
(P.S: the car wasn’t moving so don’t be impressed. :P Also, there is a mistake there. Spot it? ;) )

→ Fifth: I am really proud of this one though because I finished this in one sitting which was on the night I sacrificed my sleep to fuel this desire, while watching Powerpuff Girls. It took 6 hours. No kidding :P

→ This one didn’t require brainstorming :D

→ Here’s a few more from my other sketch book:

→And here’s a random one. This was done on Eid when I went out for lunch. I was bored and I saw a pencil and a tissue :D I randomly threw in my hand there to make the picture look instagram-worthy. Not such a great attempt though .__.

→ Currently working on this one so lets see how it turns out to be:

The thing about mandalas is that you don’t know how the final piece will turn out to be. You just pick up a pen and let your brain do its magic along the way. And sometimes, it turns out to be better than you imagined. The end is such a surprise.

So, in conclusion this was the activity I chose out of absolute boredom and now I’m addicted to it. You should try it too - it’s really fun and you will be addicted too, trust me :)

# Edit 1 : Alright, I took a while, but finally - finito!! :)

I know it’s cliché to edit in ‘Thank you’ notes on Quora, but I still will because I am overwhelmed at this amazing response so, merci beaucoup. :) (No I can’t speak french, I only know this word. :P )

#Edit 2 : I have done a couple more - colourful ones instead of the usual black. :D I actually spent my savings into this :P

I have a new favourite now.

Here's a close up of the details :

Alright that's it :)

#EDIT 3: Since many people appreciated my mandalas and told me they’d like to see more (YAY! :D), it motivated me to create a blog here on Quora-Mandalas & Mindless Doodles where I’ll be posting more mandalas and zentangles as I make them. You can post yours here too if you like, so check it out :)

Maici Mintchwarner,4y,What popular poem do you find overrated?,"This whole entire book.

It is basically a collection of short poems by Rupi Kaur compiled into a book.

There was a point in time where every girl on Snapchat was posting a picture of their feet in fuzzy socks, a coffee cup, and this book opened to a random page.

It is minimalistic in style, it is a cute decoration for your coffee table, but lacks so much depth. Here is an example of a poem from this book:

Like, what kind of poetry is that?

I

will never

understand

the hype for

this book.

HERE WE GO:

1) My friends came to me and said “You should draw something bigger”.

So, I did this.

2) I had got an award for this creativity by my Mom. And the award was “Flying chappal”.

I think, it was not much dangerous.

Stitches:

3) I tried Colour pencils too.

I didn't find this eye till now.:)

JUSTICE.
If you kick me when I am down, you better pray I don't get up and believe me, your prayers won’t work. I am a born king!

4) Flower pot .

Picture quality is not good because it was 2010.

5) Revolver.

My first 3D sketch.

Glass and spoon.

Trying to grab a spoon.

.

Some sketches:

6) I have drawn negative sketch.

My actual drawing.
Negative image of drawing.

7) Believe me, this is beautiful.

Ankita Chatterjee,Updated 6y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I'm an interior designer by profession and a few months back, I started working on a project given to me. I love working with new concepts and we decided to go eco-friendly and use upcycling (recycling things but in a different way).

It's a resto-bar at Fort, Mumbai. The whole place is made up of reusable things. I took more than 50 rounds of Chor Bazaar for this. Let me share a few pictures with you all.

Starting with my favorite section. This picture covered most of the things used. (Almost everything bought from 2nd hand market or Chor Bazaar or Lamington Road)

Spare windows, jute ropes. On the wall (old radios, phones, typewriters, suitcases, etc) added plants too. Inside the table, those colorful things are motherboards and on the table, it's a tissue holder made of keyboard keys, The furniture was reused, of course.

Second favorite is the Barrrr!

Made of vegetable and fruit crates. Also, don’t miss the pipes and cycle bar stools.

3. Furniture and lights.

1.Bottle Caps 2.Camera Lights 3.CD table 4.Record Stools (those black round things are made of records) 5.CD table, and made it all look like the Worli Sealink. Also, notice the doors on the walls.

The last is the loo that takes you back to school where the blackboard used to be. and aahh that sink is again a broken sewing machine and drum.

Used many more materials like number plates, cans, shutters, cards, paper cutouts, fan lights, locks, pipes etc.

I did many residential and commercial projects but this was the most creative and eco friendly. Where people are ready to spend a lot for lavish living, this client agreed to go with a different concept overall.

I hope you liked it. :)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q46t8hlv951peikn', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9893, 'ai': 0.0107}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I'm an interior designer by profession and a few months back, I started working on a project given to me.

Mariappan Kumar,Updated 6y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"Desktop Wallpaper

As a designer, I save too many temporary files and I forget where it is saved.

My files and folders should be organised properly, So those can be easily be found at the right time.

Usually, a project needs some two or three folders to be opened often. To make the arrangements easier, I made a wallpaper which has Table and Shelf vector drawings.

So, the currently working files are placed on Table and Previous project’s source files are arranged on bookshelf.Once the current project is done, it will be moved to the shelf. (Only most important folders. Others I keep it inside other partition ).

Ben Waggoner,Updated 6y,What is the best limerick?,"A mosquito cried out in great pain,
""A chemist has poisoned my brain!""
And the cause of his sorrow
Was para-dichloro-
Diphenyl-trichloroethane.

Edit: Quora is now suggesting that I should provide more explanation as to why this answer is correct, including links to relevant sources. Here you go! DDT

Edit 2: Quora is still suggesting helpful ways to improve my answer. How's this?

There was an old man
who wrote limericks that were
much more like haiku.

Authoritative reference: Haiku
 Any more edits, and I'm going to have to break out the obscene ones, so let's see what happens when I hit Submit. . .

Edit 3: Dammit. Sorry, Quora, you forced me into this.

There once was a vampire named Mabel
whose menstrual periods were stable,
so one week in four,
she'd slip to the floor
and drink herself under the table.

Edit 4: Dammit, Quora, do you really want me to provide authoritative sources for these?

There once was a miner named Dave
who kept a dead whore in a cave.
When asked ""Does she smell?""
he replied ""What the hell!
Just think of the money I save!""

Edit 5: I didn't make this up and I can't remember where I read it, but kudos to whoever it was in Internet-Land who came up with this:

There once was a man from the Wold
Who loved drinking beer icy cold.
As he reached for his cup,
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP!
Oooh, snap! You've been limerickrolled!

Edit 6: Thank you for the upvotes! Here's one more clean one:

There once was a lady from Guam
who said, ""Now the sea is so calm,
I shall swim in the dark!""
She encountered a shark.
Let us all sing the Twenty-Third Psalm.

And one more dirty one:

A Peruvian pervert named Bruno
Once said, ""There is one thing I do know:
A woman is fine,
A boy is divine,
But a llama is numero uno!""

Edit 7: Eighty-four upvotes!

There once was a vicar at Kew
Who kept his pet cat in a pew.
He taught it to speak
alphabetical Greek,
but it never got farther than µ.

Edit 8: Over 100 upvotes! Let's see here. . .

There once was a fellow named Weir,
Who had not one atom of fear.
He felt the desire
To touch a live wire. . .
and any last line will do here.

Slightly raunchier:

A lad and a lass from Aberystwyth
United the lips that they kystwyth.
But as they grew older,
They also grew bolder,
And played with the things that they pystwyth.

Getting worse:

There once was a sailor named Bates
Who was dancing the mambo on skates.
He fell on his cutlass,
Which rendered him nutless
And practically useless on dates.

Worse:

A lady from South Carolina
Put fiddle strings 'cross her vagina.
With the proper sized cocks,
What was sex became Bach's
Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.

And arguably worse:

There once was a harlot from Kew
Who filled her vagina with glue.
She said with a grin,
""If they'll pay to get in,
They can pay to get out of it, too.""

Edit 9: OK, last round, I promise. . . and a warning, these are all kind of rude:

There once was a redneck named Hollis
Who used possums for sexual solace.
His children had scales
On their prehensile tails,
And voted for Governor Wallace.

A historical one:

There once was a monarch named Ed
Who screwed Mrs. Simpson in bed.
As they bounced up and down,
He yelled, ""Bugger the Crown!
We'll give it to Bertie, instead!""

Even remoter history:

In the Garden of Eden lay Adam,
Contentedly stroking his madame,
And great was his mirth,
For in all of the Earth
There were only two balls—and he had 'em!

Last one for now, barring a surge of upvotes or something:

God's plan made a hopeful beginning,
Then man spoiled its chances by sinning.
Some trust that the story
Will end in God's glory,
But right now, the other side's winning.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wndcvpmafoe0zsxh', 'title': 'What is the best limerick?', 'score': {'original': 0.54955, 'ai': 0.45045}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'A mosquito cried out in great pain,\n""A chemist has poisoned my brain!""\nAnd the cause of his sorrow\nWas para-dichloro-\nDiphenyl-trichloroethane.\n\nEdit: Quora is now suggesting that I should provide more explanation as to why this answer is correct, including links to relevant sources.

Koyel Ranu | কোয়েল রানু,Updated 6y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I think it doesn’t take much courage to be creative, but it certainly takes a lot of it to share it. I’ve shared some of my photography work before on Quora, but today I’ll share some of the paintings I’ve done.

I mostly do abstracts, which many people don’t like.

Also, since I have synesthesia, paintings do provide me with an outlet that I can’t possibly express in words.

For example, I conceptualize “friendship” in the following ways:

It’s a comet, relentless, and leaving a trail. And it’s also a relationship that colours you back, as you colour others. Friendship is all about creating its own unique patterns and rhythms.

Inspiration:

Phenomena:

The painting below depicts living in the Internet Age with constant overstimulation and noise, and clouds of doubts; not a pretty picture, but a conceptualization of how I see it…

Hatred: (another not a pretty picture)

DREAMS:

BUT, not all the time do I do abstracts…

Paraphrasing Shakespeare, “If music be the food of freedom, play on”…

Well, not completely abstracts, I mean…

Left: It’s a cat’s life; Right: The one who got away

A Woman, a warrior and a survivor:

Jesus Looks Back:

Being a butterfly doesn’t mean you can’t glow in the dark.

Smell of sea-side.

I also love to do decor bottles out of recyclables (wine or olive oil bottles and, old pairless earrings) and gift them….

Some I gift, some I keep for myself…

Also, I love making votive-holders or tea-light holders out of recyclables too:

These were made out of tuna cans:

But the following were not made out of tuna cans (they are glass jars) but works just as fine!

Painting is my Escape. That’s what I mean in the painting below:

Catherine MacLeod,Updated 3y,Can you write a limerick about your cat?,"This limerick was inspired by Tippy, a beautiful short haired silver tabby. She was originally my sister's cat, but when my sister had to travel for her work, she left Tippy and her other cat, Max, with my parents. I was in my early twenties at the time and still living in my parent's home.

Max was a dominate and gregarious cat that everyone loved, so Tippy was overlooked. I felt sorry for the timid little tabby, so I made it my mission to give her the attention she deserved. Tippy repaid me by selecting me as her favorite human. She followed me everywhere and literally never left my side. It's been 30 years since my dear little Tippy passed away. As I type these words there’s a lump in my throat and tears blur my vision. I miss her still.

My dear little tabby named Tippy,

Found a box that was just itty bitty,

She knew she could fit

And determined to sit,

Her success was exceedingly iffy.

Photo source: Why cats love boxes so much

At this time, I don't have a picture of my dear Tippy to share, as all my photos from that long ago are old fashioned prints from film. The cat in the above photo looks very much like my beloved companion. As soon as I figure out how to scan my old photos, I'll replace it with one of the real Tippy.

The following image is of an adorable linocut print that I discovered on Etsy. I think it also perfectly illustrates my limerick.

Joshua Engel,9y,What's behind the absence of making words rhyme in a lot of modern English poetry? Why are French and Spanish poems rhyme more? What is the history of free verse poetry?,"It's because English eliminated its case endings.

Romance languages rhyme a lot because a lot of words end in a limited range of sounds. Just to grab a random example, from Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac:

Touche !
Trèfle !
Un baiser !
On voit !. . .
Pas de danger !
Lorsqu'on vient en avance, on est bien pour manger.



""Danger"" and ""manger"" end the way thousands of verbs do in French, with ""-er"". It's the most common class of French verbs. Rhyming is easy. Spanish uses the same three verbal endings. Nouns are even easier: practically everything ends in a gendered ""o"" or ""a"" in all of the Romance languages.

It's so easy that double rhymes are hardly interesting. In Italian, Dante use terza rima, which requires three rhymes:

Giustizia mosse il mio alto fattore;
fecemi la divina podestate,
la somma sapïenza e ’l primo amore.

Dinanzi a me non fuor cose create
se non etterne, e io etterno duro.
Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate’.


Podestate-create-intrate... (and in fact he's kinda fudging on ""podestate"", which is no longer used in modern Italian)... these would rhyme less effectively without the pronounced final ""e"". English, in fact, used to have one of those, but we dropped it, perhaps because early English poetry used alliterative rather than rhymed verse, though more likely because everybody just got peeved at having a superfluous syllable that doesn't contribute more than making everything rhyme.

English stopped doing alliterative verse around the time that it was so heavily influenced by French, though I personally have a fondness for it:

Where now are the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?
Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?
Where is the harp on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?
Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?



That particular poem skillfully blends alliterative and rhymed verse, and is based on an Old English poem, The Wanderer:

Hwær cwom mearg? Hwær cwom mago?
Hwær cwom maþþumgyfa?
Hwær cwom symbla gesetu?
Hwær sindon seledreamas?





Where is the horse? Where is the rider?
Where is the gift-giver?
Where are the feast-seats?
Where are the hall-revels?



Pretty damn fine stuff, even in my ham-handed translation. The adaptation above is by one of the greatest poets of 20th century English, playing in to both traditions, and it shows just how much English is capable of, without having to devolve into free verse. (Free verse doesn't have to suck, but it usually does, because too many poets have lost the feel for the flow of language. The greatest poets of this generation are sadly wasting their skills in braggadocio, but there is some genuinely fine hip-hop and rap out there that remember the power of English.)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/93eaqdc4s2tkzopr', 'title': ""What's behind the absence of making words rhyme in a lot of modern English poetry?

Actually, that was India vs Pakistan, Cricket match on 15th Feb 2015 in World Cup. My brother is a crazy cricket fan and It was India vs Pakistan (Enough said!!). I wrote same for my brother and all cricket fans.

Note : This poem will answer that what is situation in India and Pakistan when it's India vs Pakistan time!!

====

जुनून जब जज़्बातो से आगे निकल जाए,

हर पल ना जाने क्यूँ काटें ना कट पायें,

गेंद नहीं चली मानो गोली सी चल जाए,

बल्ला ना जाने कब कवच मे ढल जाए,

दीवानगी क्रिकेट की हद से आगे गुजर जाए,

ज़िंदगी थमे ना थमे, वक़्त बेशक़ थम जाए,

रक्त लाल नहीं हरा और नीला सा बन जाए,

बेचेनी एसी छाए की डर खुद भी ज़ुक जाए,

ये पाकइन्द(PAKIND) हे यारों ..

जंग नही जुनून जो रोके ना रुक पाए...!!

Translation:

=====
It's when passion overrules feelings,
It's when time won't even pass so easily with clock movements,
It's when a cricket ball seems like a gun shot,
It's when a bat becomes a shield,
It's when madness for cricket will break all it's limits,
It's when time will stop, may be life won't,
It's when the blood will become green and blue instead red,
It's when nervousness will be so much even fear gets succumb,
It's PAKIND Friends, It's not a battle, but an unstoppable passion.

Neman Ashraf,5y,"What should I know about plagiarism? If I copy an idea for a poem or a story, is that plagiarism too?","You should know that it’s insanely counter productive.

5/6 years back when the idea of writing online struck me… I was confused about what to write actually. How do I attract readers, get traffic and earn couple of million dollars by running advertisements.

All I had was a stupid domain name.

I didn't even understand the concept of blogging back then actually. Some idiot guru had told me to “write on the topic you’re really good at”. Well… I wasn't good at anything, excuse me! I don’t know gardening, cooking, gadgetries or anything else.

What does a person write about when they are not good at any topic?

I’ll be frank… this question bothered me.

So I thought of copying someone else’s work.

Mainly for kicks and giggles, I wanna say but that doesn't make it acceptable.

I looked and carefully researched for a few good websites and blogs and decided to copy/steal/plagiarize a wordpress tutorial blog, it is one of the most famous blogs out there for worpress tips and tricks.

And it had thousand of posts with multiple authors.

So what I did? I copied two or three of their latest posts, every single line of text including html codes that clearly flew above my head. And after restlessly and shamelessly completing that task…. I sat there looking at my blog having mixed emotions.

Yes, that’s wrong and unfair to the real author and how hurtful it would be for them seeing their content stolen and published elsewhere without credits.

How cheap and deep throat of me for doing that! Is this the way I am going to start my blogging venture!

But most importantly and stressfully what bothered me was the thought that by doing this, I’m accepting that I’m no good at writing, I have nothing to say or share of my own, there’s nothing original, unique and attractive about me or my opinion.

It disturbed me to the core.

So I deleted the stolen content right there and clearly understood it’s erroneous, dishonest and above all…. highly damaging to me a thousand times more than the person I stole this content from.

It will kill me as a writer. Plain and simple.

So I learnt my lesson in couple of hours.

But the dilemma of writing my own content remained with me for months.

What do I write?

So one day I started writing whatever crap that came to my mind, stories, thoughts and rants. It was a personal blog instead of niche-specific obviously. Including that very experience of stealing content. Heading was “Confessions of a content thief” I remember.

Anyway… after a month of writing, the next thing I experienced just blew my mind.

One of my stories was stolen and published on a website. It was clearly a case of plagiarism, they changed the images and swapped few sentences. But story was the same about a constable’s thoughts while doing sentry duties in public.

It didn't infuriate me to be honest but otherwise!

hallelujah! I’m making content that is worth reading and even stealing! :)

Sadly I couldn't carry on with writing, work, laziness and procrastination including the fears of technicalities about sustaining a self hosted blog…. even to this day.

But I understood the idea, I got the picture and I learned what works.

Hopefully I’ll write on a blog of my own sooner. But that’s not the point. So my dear….

You should know that plagiarism will practically decapitate your pen for good. You won’t be a writer but a content thief. You will do something wrong and will be caught both by people and bots….and you’ll have your ass handed to you, promise. Humiliation and regret will be your companions instead of real readers. Nobody will appreciate you. So it’s a big NO from me, don’t even consider doing it.

Get your own idea for a poem, story or whatever.

How? very simple.

Just be yourself. That very ordinary thought of yours is original and unique, just tell your story as ordinarily and imperfectly as it truly is and you’ll find your share of audience.

I assure you… it will be beautiful and worth reading.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4nrustbazcfxi650', 'title': 'What should I know about plagiarism?

Ben Waggoner,Updated 2y,What is the longest palindrome in English that makes sense?,"You can make palindromes of arbitrary length by repeating motifs: A Toyota’s a Toyota’s a Toyota’s a Toyota’s a Toyota’s . . . a Toyota. I mean, if Gertrude Stein could write “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,” then surely a Toyota’s a Toyota’s a Toyota.

It’s possible to extend palindromes indefinitely if you don’t really care about what sense you’re making. A man, a plan, a canal—Panama! is famous, because it actually refers to something familiar, the Panama Canal. But you can keep lengthening it by adding more palindromes to the middle:

A man, a plan, a cat, a canal, Panama!

A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal, Panama!

A man, a plan, a canoe, pasta, heros, rajahs, a coloratura, maps, snipe, percale, macaroni, a gag, a banana bag, a tan, a tag, a banana bag again (or a camel), a crepe, pins, Spam, a rut, a Rolo, cash, a jar, sore hats, a peon, a canal, Panama!

In the same way, some wit has expanded Dennis sinned into Dennis and Edna sinned, then Dennis Krats and Edna Stark sinned, and even Dennis, Nell, Edna, Leon, Nedra, Anita, Rolf, Nora, Alice, Carol, Leo, Jane, Reed, Dena, Dale, Basil, Rae, Penny, Lana, Dave, Denny, Lena, Ida, Bernadette, Ben, Ray, Lila, Nina, Jo, Ira, Mara, Sara, Mario, Jan, Ina, Lily, Arne, Bette, Dan, Reba, Diane, Lynn, Ed, Eva, Dana, Lynne, Pearl, Isabel, Ada, Ned, Dee, Rena, Joel, Lora, Cecil, Aaron, Flora, Tina, Arden, Noel, and Ellen sinned. Which always reminds me of prom night.

Using a similar construction technique, Lawrence Levine wrote a palindromic short novel of 31,594 words, Dr. Awkward & Olson in Oslo. It was apparently published in 1986 and reviewed in the Los Angeles Times
. I have never seen a copy, but I was able to find this essay
 by Levine, from the journal Wordways, in which he discusses his compositional method. You have to create what he calls emordnilaps—phrases that have one meaning when read forwards, and another meaning when read backwards—and then arrange them in order from the beginning to the center, and then in reverse order from the center to the end. A simple example: Tulsa is an emordnilap because it spells a slut backwards, and redraw is an emordnilap because it spells warder backwards. So you can arrange them to spell Redraw Tulsa, a slut warder! or Redraw a slut, Tulsa warder! Neither of those make much sense, but you see how you can keep shingling emordnilaps and their reverses on opposite sides of the center to make palindromic sequences of arbitrary length.

Redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder!

Star, redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder! Rats!

Faced star, redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder! Rats, decaf!

Mood-faced star, redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder! Rats, decaf! Doom!

Deep mood-faced star Liam, redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder! Mail? Rats! Decaf? Doom peed!

These don’t make much sense—Dr. Awkward & Olson in Oslo is virtually unreadable, I’m told. But they are grammatical utterances in English, albeit not the sort of thing that any speaker would come up with spontaneously.

But if you feel that’s cheating, and you require your palindromes to be well-constructed English sentences that someone with a well-functioning brain might conceivably speak in a normal conversation. . . there’s always things like:

Drab as a fool, aloof as a bard.

Lived on decaf, faced no devil.

Wonder if Sununu’s fired now?

I, man, am regal! A German am I!

Tenet C is a basis—a basic tenet.

Tulsa night life? Filth, gin, a slut!

Some men interpret nine memos.

Egad! A base life defiles a bad age.

“Naomi, sex at noon taxes,” I moan.

Yawn. Madonna fan? No damn way!

Sums are not set as a test on Erasmus.

“Do nine men interpret?” “Nine men,” I nod.

A moral, I’ve nagged: A bad egg—an evil aroma.

Did I do, O God? Did I as I said I'd do? Good, I did!

So may Obadiah, even in Nineveh, aid a boy, Amos.

Do Good's deeds live on? No! Evil's deeds do, O God!

A new order began; a more Roman age bred Rowena.

Now Ned, I am a maiden nun; Ned, I am a maiden won.

Doc, note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.

Are we not drawn onward, we freer few, drawn onward to new era?

And here’s one that makes sense, but you have to know the back story. There’s this married couple named Doug and Beryl, and Doug is an old hippie, and he’s also a nudist who loves to lie around in the backyard, buck naked. Beryl is starting to get exasperated at this behavior, and in despair she asks their next-door neighbor Ned to see if he can talk sense into Doug. So Ned talks to Doug, and asks him, “Are you deliberately trying to drive your wife crazy, flouting basic rules of social conduct?” And Doug says,

It was apparently published in 1986 and reviewed in the Los Angeles Times\n. I have never seen a copy, but I was able to find this essay\n by Levine, from the journal Wordways, in which he discusses his compositional method. You have to create what he calls emordnilaps—phrases that have one meaning when read forwards, and another meaning when read backwards—and then arrange them in order from the beginning to the center, and then in reverse order from the center to the end. A simple example: Tulsa is an emordnilap because it spells a slut backwards, and redraw is an emordnilap because it spells warder backwards. So you can arrange them to spell Redraw Tulsa, a slut warder! or Redraw a slut, Tulsa warder! Neither of those make much sense, but you see how you can keep shingling emordnilaps and their reverses on opposite sides of the center to make palindromic sequences of arbitrary length.\n\nRedraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder!\n\nStar, redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder! Rats!\n\nFaced star, redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder! Rats, decaf!\n\nMood-faced star, redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder! Rats, decaf! Doom!\n\nDeep mood-faced star Liam, redraw avid Tulsa, a slut diva warder! Mail? Rats! Decaf? Doom peed!\n\nThese don’t make much sense—Dr. Awkward & Olson in Oslo is virtually unreadable, I’m told. But they are grammatical utterances in English, albeit not the sort of thing that any speaker would come up with spontaneously.\n\nBut if you feel that’s cheating, and you require your palindromes to be well-constructed English sentences that someone with a well-functioning brain might conceivably speak in a normal conversation. . . there’s always things like:\n\nDrab as a fool, aloof as a bard.\n\nLived on decaf, faced no devil.\n\nWonder if Sununu’s fired now?\n\nI, man, am regal! A German am I!\n\nTenet C is a basis—a basic tenet.\n\nTulsa night life? Filth, gin, a slut!\n\nSome men interpret nine memos.\n\nEgad! A base life defiles a bad age.\n\n“Naomi, sex at noon taxes,” I moan.\n\nYawn. Madonna fan? No damn way!\n\nSums are not set as a test on Erasmus.\n\n“Do nine men interpret?” “Nine men,” I nod.\n\nA moral, I’ve nagged: A bad egg—an evil aroma.\n\nDid I do, O God? Did I as I said I'd do? Good, I did!\n\nSo may Obadiah, even in Nineveh, aid a boy, Amos.\n\nDo Good's deeds live on? No! Evil's deeds do, O God!\n\nA new order began; a more Roman age bred Rowena.\n\nNow Ned, I am a maiden nun; Ned, I am a maiden won.\n\nDoc, note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.\n\nAre we not drawn onward, we freer few, drawn onward to new era?\n\nAnd here’s one that makes sense, but you have to know the back story. There’s this married couple named Doug and Beryl, and Doug is an old hippie, and he’s also a nudist who loves to lie around in the backyard, buck naked. Beryl is starting to get exasperated at this behavior, and in despair she asks their next-door neighbor Ned to see if he can talk sense into Doug. So Ned talks to Doug, and asks him, “Are you deliberately trying to drive your wife crazy, flouting basic rules of social conduct?” And Doug says,\n\nNamed undenominationally rebel, I rile Beryl? La, no! I tan. I’m, o Ned, nude, man!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9941
Stuti Arya,6y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"Okay, honestly, it took me so long to decide if I am really sharing my art in yet another social media. (I’ve recently been hit by anxiety over creating a social presence which resulted in me boycotting every other social network.) Anyway, here I am. In this answer, I am solely focusing on my digital journey as it was very difficult to select and curate some of the many. I might write another answer because I have many ‘series’ of works, like a series of minimal fan work of the good old Cartoon Network, series of watercolour paintings, vector art, brainstorming, and also a little series of ramdom memes, if they can be called by that.

It was day 1 when I made a very cartoony, messy, oddly figured painting in MS Paint in our windows 1998 operating Desktop. Since then, I have been scribbling in any digital media I come across. Though I do not possess all the paintings I've done because of loss of my previous device and that’s the reason if some images are distorted or pixelated because perhaps I’ve dug them from Facebook ( Starya Studio
 ) or Instagram ( S T A R Y A (@s_t_a_r_y_a) 
).

I was using a Micromax 4 inch touch screen phone, downloaded a sketching app, used fingertips, and it was during those days I found love (probably 5 years ago)

2. I might not put a good chronological sequence but will make it as logical as I can

3. These vertically elongated drawings were all done in phone. I used to call this one Aishwarya Rai. During that time, I had been trying some logo for my work, as you can see.

4. You can see it was just a 18 year old trying to pass time.

5. I was extremely proud about the water in this picture, mainly because it was a more of a quick sketch.

6. Yes, I still draw girls more. I did this painting when I felt like I had been continuously failing in life, unable to set priorities, take life decisions on my own; and the truth is I couldn’t skip that phase.

7. Remember the disgusting attack of terrorism over Peshawar’s innocent school children. This is how I passed my condolences. Still gives a pathetic shiver thinking about the incident.

8. By then I started discovering more apps; and I also got an opportunity to work with an amazing group of people with whom I began exploring more areas like memes, story telling, comics, illustrations. (Hey, thanks Melodio, now TheChurningSpot and Content Wala!!)

Remember when UAE was qualified for the World Cup. Here’s an illustration on what UAE does best. ;)

9. My father is a big time Michael Jackson fan and when I was a kid, I used to be afraid of him, particularly in a music video where he turned himself into a lion. As I grew up, eventually became his fan, who wouldn’t! By the way this is how a puppet-MJ would look like. Scary, right!

10. Did this as a part of environmental week, some time long long back. (Lost original output)

11. By 2013 I moved to my laptop. I downloaded Autodesk Sketchbook and again used my fingertips to rub over the tiny trackpad to paint. I’ve even done some with mouse.

12. This, is my most cherished artwork; not because it has a deep meaning or I poured my heart out, or I did a good job, none of that; I took almost 4 to 5 days to complete it in phases, for the first time fully used the concept of layers, tried to bring meaning to it by only watching my hand and still not being satisfied. This was a lot of work which made me realise how I can neglect my beloved sleep for something so precious to me.

13. I watched Disney’s Brave and did this. For the first time I received a device of 9 inch (tablet) from my college as a government initiative, I began a newer journey, an enhanced one. It was a beautiful experience, sadly, I could not recover the original image. This was the device I was refering to; couldn’t be trusted I must tell! 2015.

14. Though it’s amazing how Facebook can act as an emergency cloud storage. Yes yes, obsessed with drawing girls. There’s no manly curve as beautiful. This one is called Alica.

15. The Soul Tree, as I call it.

16. “Year 2015 in a picture”. I was super-inspired to do this, I will quote reference when I come across. I tried putting all that happened in 2015, good, bad, hazardous, shameful, factual, and all, for a new year post. I wanted to make this my routine as a new year resolution and check my progress as well, but last December I was busy in unpaid engagements. :( I am pretty determined to do a “2017 in a picture” though.

17. I will be honest here because I respect Quorans, this here was a failed attempt. Everyone praised how I took pencil like sketch to digital, but this was indeeeed “supposedly” Shraddha Kapoor and I realised how miserably I failed and then I took to more and more practice and seriousness.

This will be funny to address that I received yet another tablet as a gift, precisely as a winning prize for a drawing contest to be clear. Now I have 10 inch iPad to sribble away, still with fingertips though! (Currently evaluating pressure sensitive stylus options).

2017 starts here.

18. This was my take on Demonetisation. (Yes, she has highlighted hair) I was prepared to add more to this seried of Cute Goddesses of India, but there arose an issue where someone criticised that I was ‘making fun of religion’. Sensitive issues are best left to public, I thought.

19. Medusa, may be?

20. I watched Deadpool and here’s him punching all those who said it was not a good movie. Wait, is it the first male character in the answer?

21. I have a Board in Pinterest of all those photographs I wish to digitally or otherwise paint. Here’s Sage.

22. Oh how could I forget Selena Gomez. She had been my muse since ever. Sorry for not being chronological but this is a 2015 piece when I gave a ‘try’ to photoshop painting (not editing) in my laptop. (Number 22 deserved Selena, anyway) ;)

23. Since a couple of months, I joined Sktchy and my progress grew IMMENSELY. I must tell, inspiration is everything, and iPad is a wonderful experience too. Attaching all Sktchy art altogether because they were all done in a matter of 1 month, possibly all of them in August-September 2017.

24. Some mixed media I discovered enjoying, also within the Sktchy experience.

Well, I think that was a LOT showcasing for now, might (or might not?) share other forms and media of my art limits sometime. For now, thanks!! :)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/uw974qso2elzc1kr', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.69006666666667, 'ai': 0.30993333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Okay, honestly, it took me so long to decide if I am really sharing my art in yet another social media.

Diana A.,1y,"What are two characters from two different books, movies, or poems that are similar?","Two early 20th-century novels for young girls, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1903) and Anne of Green Gables (1908) have very similar plots.

Rebecca is a thin, precocious 10 year old with long braids, a poor relation who is being sent to live with two unmarried aunts, sisters, whom she doesn’t know. At the beginning of the book Rebecca’s vivacious personality captivates the driver of the wagon who is taking her to the farm where she will be living.

When she gets there, she finds that her Aunt Miranda, the sister who really runs things, is rather crusty and stern in her expectations. (As the story goes, Miranda is disappointed, because she would have preferred Rebecca’s more practical sister, Jane, instead.) But Rebecca succeeds in ultimately winning her over, because she’s such a charming child.

Meanwhile, Rebecca learns about life through a series of misadventures, as she grows to young womanhood. The story takes place in a fictitious small community in Maine.

Anne is a thin, precocious 12 year old with long braids, a poor orphan who is being sent to live with two unmarried siblings (brother and sister) whom she doesn’t know. At the beginning of the book Anne’s vivacious personality capitivates the brother, who is driving her to the farm where she will be living.

When she arrives, she finds that his sister, Marilla, who really runs things, is rather crusty and stern in her expectations.

I don’t remember my first daddy. The only thing I remember is us playing Rock Paper Scissors on the stairs at our lobby. It was so so fun. After a while, he turned around and disappeared. I couldn’t find him. Daddy was really good at hide and seek. Mommy said that he left because I had too many barbies. I love barbies. But it’s okay, second daddy loves me too.

Whenever mommy’s around he would play thumb war with me and I’ll use my tiny thumb to squash him. Sometimes, when mommy was busy, he would come sleep with me, tucked under my warm warm blankie. Just like the other night when mommy was having a massage in the other room. He wore a pair of undies just like he always did and came to sleep with me. He’s afraid that I would fall off the bed. Silly daddy.

He slipped under the blankie with me and hugged me all night long… a little too tight though. I could barely move, but he was snoring so I didn’t want to wake him up. Poor daddy, he’s always tired. As he was hugging me, I felt something against my back. It was so uncomfortable. It was like a stone or something rubbing against me. Maybe daddy was wearing a belt? How does mommy sleep with daddy? But, I’ll just pretend to be sound asleep as I’m sure daddy must be very tired. The next morning I told mommy what happened and how brave she was to sleep with daddy. She just laughed but didn’t say anything. Did I say something wrong? When I asked mommy what’s wrong she just ignored me. That’s weird.

Anyways I love my family. That’s just some of the happy moments we had together. There’s lots of different things too! Like Friday movie nights and Sunday night outs. You should try it sometime you know. It’s super fun. Mommy says this will have to stop for a while though because… I’ll be moving to America. Yayyyyy! I’m going there alone though, mommy says she and daddy will come a few months later. At the mean time, I’ll stay with Mrs. Tam’s family. I don’t want to leave mommy and daddy but I have to be a big girl now. I want to make mommy happy and proud.

Hop hop away in my backpack and luggage, I went to the United States of America. They should shorten it you know, like how China is only one word. Oops, I sidetracked a little. Anyways, as I was there, I would video call mommy ever single day. Something doesn’t seem right though. Mommy seems thinner and thinner every day. Mommy says it’s because she misses me. I miss her too. She says she can’t come yet because my best best friend, Dr. Chang, wants her to stay in Hong Kong for a little bit. I trust Dr. Chang. She’s very smart.

After 3 months later, I finally get to go back to Hong Kong to see mommy again! I’m so so sooo excited. I packed my favorite chocolates, mommy’s favorite almonds and daddy’s favorite sugar packs. Mommy’s friend Lizy came and pick me up. We flew high up the sky and finally landed at the airport, but we didn’t go back home, which was very weird. Peaking out the taxi window, I saw the sign Prince Edward Hospital. Hm. Is Aunt Lizy sick? I didn’t ask though, she seemed sad.

When we arrived she took me to the fifth floor. Wow, there are so many beds and so so cold. Aunt Lizy should have told me to bring a jacket. As we were walking, Aunt Lizy brought me to a bed where a lady was sleeping in. She has a big big belly but was thin everywhere else, kinda like the skeleton I had during Halloween, but pregnant. She had a tube around her face and many many computers around her making beep beep beep noises. Then, I saw uncle Thomas, aunt Kelly, uncle Ryan, they were all there! Well except for daddy. Nonetheless I was so happy. This is the best day ever!

Aunt Kelly came up to me and told me to say hi to mommy. Mommy is here? Where? She pointed at the lady laying on the bed. That’s mommy? She doesn’t look like mommy. The lady whispers my name. I recognize that sound. THAT REALLY IS MOMMY! What happened to her?

She brings her hand to my face and smiles like she always does. I like her smile. Mommy is very pretty. But before she could say anything, she coughs so hard that her tissue became red. I stood there. I didn’t know what to say. Mommy said that it’s just bad guys in her belly and the doctors in this hospital are fixing her. Bad bad guy. I hate to see mommy sick. My eyes began to water but I told my eyes to stop because I am a big big girl and I have to be strong for mommy.

Not long, the nurses told us to leave because the doctors are coming to fix mommy. So I followed my aunts and uncles out of the room. As we were walking, I heard them talking.

“ She had it coming.” Hmm. I wonder what was coming. Ice cream trucks? Mmm I want that. My tummy is growling.

“I’m not raising anything.” What do they have to carry? Maybe I could help. Don’t underestimate me. I am small but I am strong.

A few minutes went by and finally Aunt Lizy spoke to me.

“Hey little one. I know you haven’t met daddy before but he really loves you. We called him and he wants to take you back home. Are you happy?”

“Silly Aunt Lizy. I have met daddy before. I lived with him too.”

“No, not that daddy. Your real daddy.”

“Oh.”

There he was. A tall tall man standing at the entrance of the hospital, a bit scary. It’s going to be alright though. After the doctors fix mommy, mommy can leave the hospital. We would be a happy family again with Friday movie nights and Sunday nights out with Daddy, second Daddy.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0lbwgzadjfho7nxk', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.76456666666667, 'ai': 0.23543333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I love my family.

Eleftherios Tserkezis,4y,What Greek hero from Homer’s Iliad was invulnerable except for his heel?,"This may come as a surprise to you, but the correct answer to this question is… nobody. There is no such character in the Iliad.

“But what about Achilles?” I can hear you ask.

Well, here’s the tricky part: Achilles is not invulnerable in the Iliad. In fact, at one point it’s explicitly stated he got injured.

So spake he [Asteropaeus] threatening, but goodly Achilles raised on high
the spear of Pelian ash; howbeit the warrior Asteropaeus hurled with both spears at once,
for he was one that could use both hands alike.
With the one spear he smote the shield, but it brake
not through, for the gold stayed it, the gift of the god
and with the other he smote the right forearm
of Achilles a grazing blow, and the black blood gushed forth; but the spear-point passed above him
and fixed itself in the earth, fain to glut itself with flesh.

The Iliad 21.161–168

Achilles’ invulnerability appears for the first time in a poem by Publius Papinius Statius, a Roman poet of the 1st c. AD. In the Hellenistic and Roman eras, myths became more flamboyant and baroque-esque, and acquired all sorts of exotic elements.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8pjdcmn4zbk0r17e', 'title': 'What Greek hero from Homer’s Iliad was invulnerable except for his heel?', 'score': {'original': 0.9839, 'ai': 0.0161}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This may come as a surprise to you, but the correct answer to this question is… nobody.

Justin Franco,6y,What is zeugma in poetry?,"Zeugma is a fun little way to turn phrases and heads in your writing.

See? I just used one, and you didn’t even notice…and yet, you did. As a figurative technique, zeugma largely goes unnoticed, but it’s effective in creating dramatic and comedic contrasts.

To create zeugma, a writer takes a word that can have multiple meanings and connects a single instance of that word to two or more parts of a sentence to exploit those meanings separately.

That definition was confusing, so we’ll clear it up with examples!

He took his hat and his leave.

This sentence uses multiple meanings of the word took. “He took his hat” means he literally put his hands on his hat and carried it off with him. “He took his leave” means he walked out. The writer combines these two meanings with one use of the word took. It’s intentionally a bit jarring when you read it at first, but that’s the intent of zeugma—to force your brain to pause and reevaluate the meaning of the sentence.

You could put the multiple meaning word at the end of the phrase too, as we see in Dolly Parton’s rendition of “The House of the Rising Sun”:

…a house they call the rising sun, where love and money are made.

This zeugma uses the figurative meanings of “making money” (earning it) and “making love” (sexual intercourse) to create the effect.

You can see more examples on the Wikipedia page
 for the device.

You may note that the definition of zeugma is a bit flexible depending on how it’s analyzed, but I’ve always considered the “take his hat and his leave” example as the purest definition of its poetic use.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/skfojtp48znbgwd3', 'title': 'What is zeugma in poetry?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Zeugma is a fun little way to turn phrases and heads in your writing.\n\nSee?

Alex Johnston,5y,"Can the British read ancient English nowadays, like Shakespeare's poems?","Shakespeare’s poems aren’t in ‘ancient English’.

‘Ancient English’ looks like this:

Hwæt! Wé Gárdena in géardagum

þéodcyninga þrym gefrúnon·

hú ðá æþelingas ellen fremedon.

Oft Scyld Scéfing sceaþena þréatum

monegum maégþum meodosetla oftéah·

oð þæt him aéghwylc þára ymbsittendra

ofer hronráde hýran scolde,

gomban gyldan· þæt wæs gód cyning.

Those are the opening lines of Beowulf, the most famous poem in Old English, which was probably written between 975 and 1025. Here’s a translation, taken from http://www.heorot.dk/beowulf-rede-text.html

Listen! We --of the Spear-Danes in the days of yore,

of those clan-kings-- heard of their glory.

how those nobles performed courageous deeds.

Often Scyld, Scef's son, from enemy hosts

from many peoples seized mead-benches;

and terrorised the fearsome Heruli after first he was

found helpless and destitute, he then knew recompense for that:-

he waxed under the clouds, throve in honours,

until to him each of the bordering tribes

beyond the whale-road had to submit,

and yield tribute:- that was a good king.

No native English speaker in Britain can automatically understand Old English. Grammatically speaking it has more in common with modern German than it has with modern English, and as you can see, it has a different vocabulary. But Shakespeare’s works are written in modern English. It’s just a more complex version of modern English than some people are used to.

It was also spelled a bit differently in the earliest editions. Here’s the opening of Shakespeare’s Hamlet as it was printed in the First Folio edition, which came out a few years after Shakespeare’s death:

THE TRAGEDIE OF HAMLET, Prince of Denmarke.

Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.

Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels.

Barnardo. Who's there?

Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold your selfe.

Bar. Long liue the King.

Fran. Barnardo?

Bar. He.

Fran. You come most carefully vpon your houre.

Bar. 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco.

Fran. For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold, And I am sicke at heart.

Barn. Haue you had quiet Guard?

Fran. Not a Mouse stirring.

Nishi Uppuluri,5y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Dear Diary,

Yesterday, Mommy told me that we are getting… I forgot the word. I think it started with an e. Or a u. Or an i. Sometimes those letters sound the same.

Anyway, Mommy said that that meant that we couldn’t live in our house anymore. She said that we have to live in our car. I don’t like our car. It’s old. And it’s small. And it smells stinky!

I told Mommy that I don’t want to live in her car, but she said we have to. She said that I can only bring my teddy bear named Thomas and a bag of clothes. And a blanket. She said it would be like camping. But I don’t think so.

I asked her why we have to live in the car, and she mumbled “because of your f***ing father who hasn’t payed child support in years.” I don’t know what that means.

Dear Diary,

Sometimes I notice my Mommy taking out a bag of powdered sugar out of her purse. I always ask her if I could have some, but she says no, it’s adult sugar. She then sniffs it, and I ask if I can sniff it too, but then she gets mad and yells at me that’s it’s not meant for kids. After she sniffs the adult sugar, her face turns red, and she gets even more angry.

These days, she sniffs even more sugar. I don’t understand why she doesn’t just eat it, or better yet, bake with it. I ask her to make some frosting with this sugar, and she says no, because we are broke. But if we are broke, then how come she always goes to the groceries to get more sugar? I don’t know.

I don’t like adult sugar.

Dear Diary,

At school today, my friend asked me why my hair was greasy. I wanted to tell her that I couldn’t take a shower because I was living in a car, but mommy told me not to tell anyone this. So I told my friend that I’m not very good at washing my hair. And then she said “ask your mom to do it for you.” I said okay. My friend won’t remember this anyways.

Dear Diary,

I’m so hungry all the time. I can’t eat because Mommy said that food is too ‘spensive and we’re broke. But I don’t care! I’m hungry!

Two days ago, I was so hungry, that I desided to try some of mommy’s adult sugar. It wasn’t fair that she didn't share it with me just because I’m a kid. I found the bag in Mommy’s purse when she went outside the car for a trip to the groceries to buy more adult sugar.

I took a taste of the sugar. And everything went black.

Dear Diary,

When I woke up this morning, I was in the hospital I think. There were tubes from my hands and beeping machines. My hed and stomac hurt hurt hurt!

A few minutes later, a lady with a white coat and hat come in. “I see you’re awake”, she says. She then walks out of the room again.

A police man enters a little later. He asks me qweshuns about my Mommy and where we live. I tell him that I live in a house and that Mommy buys a lot of adult sugar. He shakes his head. I ask him why he’s there. He shakes his head again.

The lady with the white coat and hat lets me get up two hours later. I try to find Mommy, but the police man from erliar grabs me by the wrist, and takes me to his police car.

He drives me to a place with a bunch of other kids in it.

“Where is mommy? “, I ask, once we get there.

He doesn’t say anything.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vus4f2hemqnxtgz5', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.4999, 'ai': 0.5001}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Dear Diary,\n\nYesterday, Mommy told me that we are getting… I forgot the word.

Priyanjali Bangaru,Updated 5y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"Hi, like doing DIY projects. I like gifting my loved ones with hand made gifts.

I have seen people around me into one or other kind of art. I don't know how to draw a straight line to speak of the least. While I thought “art” is not my cup of tea, I ventured into Nail art-quilling earrings-DIY projects and others.

Hence my description “I create what is already created in a better way.”

Here are some of many things I managed to make:

I don't have a lot of photographs of earrings that I made, these are just two of them. I usually gift them to loved ones.

Batman lamp- Made it for my bf who is a batman fan . He went nuts when he saw it

This is an old table of mine, we have it since I was in my 5–6th class. I am working now after completing my Pg. It’s thats old. I took comic books, cut them into pieces and stuck them with fevicol and water on to the table to give it a new look.

Game of Thrones- Iron Throne for my Bf, again he went mental when he saw it.

Lamp made out of news papers. Made for my brother. He wanted light source that’s not too bright on his face as he works during the nights.

Edit: These are my recent projects

Made that out of plastic spoons.

Silk earrings along with silk necklace

Edit 2: My most favourite Quilling design I have ever made.

They are Peacock Quilled Earrings!

Edit 3
Made a Game of Thrones inspired wall clock for myself.

Edit 4: I am into making customized wall clocks now, most of them I made so far have been Game of Thrones inspired.

Made the Night king clock for the boyfriend he as usual flipped with happiness. Yes, he is team #NightKing

My brother is a huge fan of Stephan King’s IT. Made this one for him

This one is for a friend who loves both the characters.

Targaeryan shield for the boyfriend. It was made when all the three dragons were alive, or else I would have painted one in blue.

I am planning to sell customized clocks online. Let me know if anyone is interested to buy.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/65y9cuo1n7lwetvd', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Hi, like doing DIY projects.

Rushali Ramteke,Updated 6y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"Not as beautiful & creative as other Quorians have shared. Here’s stuff I do other than work.

Adding recent work:

Tried my hands on Madhubani
, a traditional painting and folk art. I have kept the lady in traditional style and worked on the background to add a bit of turmoil. My sister has learned this art from a professional and she wasn’t too happy with the outcome. :(

This is the very first Madhubani style painting i took up. I didn’t have patience to paint it fully, so i kept it black and white and blurred it little.

Since pom pom is in trends now a days I have fused the striking pom pom into the dreamcatcher.

Recently tried Water color pencils.

I wish to visit Eiffel Tower during Autumn. I draw it very often.

This photograph taken at Udaipur - Lake Pichola.

My first canvas painting.

Recycling bottles - DIY

Ever since i attempted starry starry night, i fell in love with this pattern. Now it secures an undeniable place in my sketches.

A piece to start believing LOVE exists

Bought few owl charms from a craft shop to make old metal bangles into these funky item.

It’s somewhat inspired from a dream catcher.

Quite fed up of people asking me if i eat or not and why am i so thin. This image is utter out of frustration.

Day’s when i thought i need someone who can grow old with me.

The day I thought my crush will move to another country to never return home.

When I found two things for which i am mad about..

When I knew i was making a mistake by attempting this but still i continued since this canvas and oil paints were gifted to me.

Madly in love with Vincent Van Gogh’s work. I know this isn’t that great but i spent quality time thinking and sketching this ..

because..doesn’t matter how much i like to hangout, i love to be home at the end of the day..

Because at times people just don’t stop talking.. and sometimes it’s your thoughts.

because i realised last year that i like reading and i finished more than 38 books in the same year.

I saw a reference on pinterest and thought it will be a good thing to experiment with the paints. Well, I couldn't do it all and ended up making below painting.

Just another night of insomnia.

Probably the easiest thing to do Twine + Dia wine bottle + Lightings

because laptop wasn’t working

Dreamcatcher

Painting beer bottles

Spent almost a month dedicating each day with a new form of pen tattoo. Remember semicolon project?

Saying again - Not the best of the things. It’s just that it’s a great thing to do to engage mind & spend quality time with oneself.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zatgjcd9qxsf4uy0', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Not as beautiful & creative as other Quorians have shared.

Sanjana Pabbati,6y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I love creative work of any kind and I have been an art enthusiast from my childhood.

I consider myself an amateur artist but I have great interest in art. I posted some of my works here, I hope you enjoy them :D

Acrylic painting: Buddha

Inspired by artist Yuliya Glavnaya and this is his original painting

Embossed texture painting: Lord Ganesha
The big pictures: Most of these were made for display during fests

A friend and I made this red lady - Acrylic on paper

This was completely my own work and a lot of effort went into this - Acrylic on canvas

A battle between two worlds- A friend and I worked on this and we included various concepts like good vs evil, color vs black and white and acrylic vs charcoal. The acrylic part on the left was made by me on canvas. The charcoal part on the right was made by my friend on paper.

Again, a work completely by me- Acrylic on canvas

Stage shows: We performed as teams for the inauguration of various fests on campus. All of these works were completed in exactly 5 minutes on stage.

Glow in the dark art

Pencil sketches:
Rangoli:
Quilling Rakhis:
Mehendi: Didn’t take pictures most of the times
Earrings: I added tassels to old studs
Kindergarten project: Animal farm
Chalk pastel work: I could not get a good finish because I tried it for the first time. I hope I get better at it soon :)

And finally…

Phone case:

I learnt to make basic stuffed toys. Last year, I also made my first stop motion video.

I enjoy gifting my artworks and for the same purpose I made some creative greeting cards and paintings. But sadly I do not have any pictures of them.

Also, this is my first post on Quora.

CA Gargi Rai,5y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"Ok ok … Let's see what's in my gallery

Ok I have just sketches .. don't worry they are creative too

Here you go and just wait for it you will have varieties to see.

Though it's not complete (one reason I didn't put my signature in it) I think it's perfect this way.

Initially when I started this one, I thought it was ruined but at the end this could be one of my favourite ones

The patience level I had for this one. And the days of doodling after the office hours at home. This one took a hell of a time.

Enough of the nice ones.

Aim for the moon you will hit the stars kinda sketch

The rougher versions of my sketch

This one was signed by both me and my brother even though he didn't do any of it.

This one is somehow closer to heart, the sketch is amazing but try to look at the story behind it… i know you will find it relatable too

I dont just promise to get you stars, i promise you …

And now some sketch with utter sense of thought along… Try to grasp it

The eyes full of dreams :D

Ready for some fun … Lets go to the Cartoon zone

Pokemon and pikachu

Though not a real cartoon but i like this ones hair

Some girly ones

Okk ok something different: this ones are colour pen sketches

Dear Dia,

It's my birthday today. When Daddy came, he gave me a cupcake. Daddy never smiles, but he didn’t look mean today. I shared my cupcake with Mamy after we ate our beans. Daddy gave Mamy a book. Mamy gave it to me and said I can write to you when I am lonely.

Mamy said your name is Die-a-ree, but I think Dia is a prettier name. Do you like it?

. . . . .

Entry #56

Dear Dia,

I fell in the shower today. I yelled very loud and Mamy came running. She looked scared. My wrist hurts bad. I cried but I stopped when Mamy cried.

Mamy yelled at Daddy when he came today. The last time Mamy got mad was a long time ago. Daddy didn’t hit Mamy like last time. She told Daddy my left wrist broke and that I’m sick. My wrist is still on my arm so I don’t think it broke. And I don’t feel sick like when I have a cold.

Mamy put a towel around and around my wrist and said don’t move it. I don’t move it anyways cos it hurts.

Before Daddy locked the door today, he said he’ll bring milk. Mamy said I had milk before but I don’t remember.

. . . . .

Entry #58

Dear Dia,

Daddy gave Mamy milk today. When Daddy left, Mamy gave me milk in my bear mug. It’s yummy! Mamy said it’ll make me big and strong and I won’t break anymore.

I asked Mamy today where Daddy goes when he leaves, and she said upstairs to work. I asked Mamy why Daddy doesn’t live down here with us like the Daddies in the TV. Mamy said he’s too busy. I asked Mamy if we can see upstairs. Mamy said yes, we can see upstairs soon. Mamy looked sad.

. . . . .

Entry #82

Dear Dia,

I got Mamy in trouble. I didn’t hear a click today when Daddy left. When Mamy was sleeping, I opened the door. There was tall stairs after the door, and I went up. There was another door at the top. I tried to open it, but it didn’t open. I tried and tried and it opened!

Daddy was standing there and his face was red. He took my arm and took me back downstairs. Daddy yelled at Mamy and said I was dirty and sneaky. Daddy came to hit me, but when I closed my eyes, I didn’t feel anything. Daddy was hitting Mamy when I opened my eyes. I cried to Daddy. I told him I was sorry.

When Daddy left this time, I heard the click. Dia, I just wanted to see upstairs.

. . . . .

Entry #126

Dear Dia,

Mamy said I don’t have to wear the towel on my wrist now. There’s a funny bump on the wrist, but it doesn’t hurt anymore. We saw animals in the jungle and fish in the ocean on TV today. Mamy said she’ll take me to see fish after we go upstairs.

. . . . .

Entry #193

Dear Dia,

I saw a lady with pretty silver and red hair on TV. Mamy turned the TV so it talks low like always. The lady in the TV was sad. Mamy said the lady is my grandma. Mamy cried when grandma talked in the TV. I asked Mamy why grandma doesn’t come see us like Daddy. Mamy said Grandma can’t find us cos we’re lost.

Silly Mamy. How can we be lost if we’re here?

. . . . .

Entry #287

Dear Dia,

We went upstairs today! When Daddy left, I didn’t hear a click. Daddy was mad last time so I didn’t open the door. After lunch, Mamy said we are going upstairs. She held my hand and opened the door and we went up together. At the top, Mamy tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t open. I thought we have to go back down but Mamy yelled and knocked. I said to Mamy we’re not supposed to yell.

A lady opened the door. She has silver in her hair like Grandma but she isn’t Grandma. Mamy and the lady talked and let me see upstairs. Dia, there are so many pretty things upstairs! Just like in the TV!

I heard a bell and the lady opened the door. Police came inside and talked to Mamy and the lady.

The lady gave us soup and samwiches. The soup was tomato and the samwich was turkey. It was good. We are sleeping upstairs, but I don’t see Daddy. Mamy said Daddy’s going to be away for some time.

. . . . .

Entry #301

Dear Dia,

We saw Grandma today. She is even prettier in person and she didn’t look sad like in the TV. Grandma and Mamy cried even though Mamy says she is happy. We are sleeping in Grandma’s house and Mamy says we are staying here.

When are we going to see Daddy?

Dear Dia,

I’m sorry I don’t write for so long. I am going to skool now. There are so many girls and boys at skool just like in the TV. My teacher is very nice and the other girls are nice too. My class is the same age as me, but I am the smallest. Mamy said I’ll get big from Grandma’s food and going to the beech.

I wish you can come to skool too. I don’t know when I’ll write again, but thanks for being my friend.

Jerrica Coyle,4y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Mommy is so pretty, like a princess from my favorite movies!

We watch those movies all the time, mommy likes them too. Daddy used to like those movies, but then Daddy went away. I was a very little baby when Daddy went away, but Mommy says he loved us very much and he didn’t want to go. Mommy says he lives with God now just like Grandma and Grandpa, but I think he went to live with God too early.

Grandma and Grandpa were old when they went to live with God. Daddy wasn’t old. He didn’t even have any grey hair or anything. He’s always very happy in the pictures Mommy shows me. She says I am just like him, we have the same eyes and the same smile. I wish Mommy would smile like she does in her pictures with Daddy. I give Mommy big hugs because she gives me big hugs when I am sad, but I guess grown up sad is stronger than hugs.

Daddy had an accident with a big, big truck. That’s why he went to live with God. Uncle Jimmy told me when I asked why Daddy went there. I love Uncle Jimmy. He takes me to get ice cream and he lets me pick the songs in the car! He even lets me play the game where you pop balloons on his phone. He says that Mommy needs time to be alone sometimes because she misses Daddy very much. Uncle Jimmy says Mommy started to see a special doctor who helps people not be so sad anymore.

Mommy says she the special doctor gave her medicine so that she will be able to miss Daddy, but not be so sad. I hope the special medicine makes her feel better and that she will smile and look pretty like a princess again.

Mommy tells everyone that the doctor is helping her. She sure does smile a lot now. We watch princess movies and we go to the beach. Mommy collects shells with me. We see Uncle Jimmy a lot too. Mommy gives him a lot of my clothes so that they will be at his house when I sleep over. She gives me a pretty necklace that Daddy gave to her. It is so sparkly and pretty. She puts it around my neck after she puts me to bed. I tell her I love her, and she starts to cry just a little bit before she smiles and says she loves me too.

Mommy says that bathroom time is private time, but I really need to go. I knock on the door but Mommy doesn’t say anything. I can’t hold it anymore.

Mommy is in the tub, but she forgot to take off all her clothes. Her hair floats just like the Little Mermaid, but Mommy’s hair is brown and not red like the mermaid’s hair is. I tell her that I am sorry, but she doesn’t say anything. She is sleeping. I step on something tiny and white on the floor. It’s some of her special medicine. The bottle is next to the tub.

Uncle Jimmy comes with hospital people and a policeman. They bang on the door real loud. I tell them that Mommy is sleeping, but they go in the bathroom anyway. The hospital people take Mommy away with all kinds of wires sticking out of her. They put a scary looking mask on her face. The policeman wraps me up in a soft blue blanket. Uncle Jimmy gives me big hugs and tells me we are going to have a sleepover at his house.

The policeman tells Uncle Jimmy that he did a good job. They tell him if it had waited another ten minutes it would have been too late. I don’t know what he did a good job on, or what he was late for. I ask where Mommy went. Uncle Jimmy says Mommy got sick in the tub, and that I will stay with him until she gets better. She must be very sick if she has to be away from me for so long.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3t6m0gsj97xrybcf', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.39535, 'ai': 0.60465}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Mommy is so pretty, like a princess from my favorite movies!\n\nWe watch those movies all the time, mommy likes them too.

Stone Painting: The most interesting surface to paint on.

Diya (Earthern Lamp) Painting:

Rangoli (Designs or Pictures drawn on a flat, smooth surface using coloured sand): The last one is my favourite. Did it for a competition.

Shoes: I’ve done just a pair. Plan to do some more.

Eraser (Yes, you heard it right. I’ve done so just once though.):

Lastly, Ceiling: This is the ceiling of my bedroom. The room is ‘Space’ themed, as chosen by my brother. It took a total of 5 hours for my mother & I to complete it all. I did the Saturn & part of the Earth while my mother did the rest. Unfortunately the neck pain lasted much longer :p

Lily Evans Potter,5y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Mommy says to stay out of the bathroom when she closes the door. I always go to my room and play with my Legos while she’s in there. Sometimes I hear noises like crying from behind the door, but Mommy said not to go in the bathroom, so I don’t find out what they are.

Mommy just closed the bathroom door and told me to go to my room. I do what Mommy says, because Daddy didn’t, and now Daddy isn’t here anymore. Maybe Mommy sent him to his room and he didn’t listen.

There’s a police car outside! I can watch it from my window. The red and blue light on top is flashing, and the doors are opening. Men with belts covered in guns are walking up to our door. Mommy doesn’t like visitors.

“Mommy! The police are here!” I say this as I knock on the bathroom. Mommy will probably hit me later, but we have guests! She doesn’t answer, and I don’t hear noises from the door. I peek in the keyhole and see Mommy lying in the bathtub. She fell asleep! She’s using a bath bomb because the water is all an ugly red color. I don’t like it.

I run downstairs and open the door, even though in school we learned not to open the door for strangers. The police are important! A man with a furry face looks down at me.

“Young lady, we received a call from your neighbor and need to see your mother for a few minutes.”

“Mommy fell asleep in the bathtub! She’s taking a bubble bath with a bath bomb! The water’s all red and frothy. I don’t know why she bought the-” The big, furry man walks past me, beckoning to his police friends.

“But wait! Mommy doesn’t like people going in the bathroom while she’s in there!”

The men and women ignore me and walk up my stairs.

“MOMMY SAID NOT TO GO IN THE BATHROOM!” I yell, but they don’t listen to me. I run after them, but a short lady grabs my arm and takes me outside.

“Honey, why don’t we go grab some ice cream while my friend calls your daddy?”

I love ice cream! But Mommy is still asleep in the bathtub, and I need to wake her up so she can talk to the police.

I hope Mommy doesn’t send me to my room when I get home.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/x9rtvz6y4phignsm', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9932, 'ai': 0.0068}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Mommy says to stay out of the bathroom when she closes the door.

Coloured pencils

EDIT:

Thanks for all the comments. They are really encouraging :)

The tshirt i have painted, i have put a writing pad inside the tshirt for support and clamped it. I have drawn an outline with pencil(depending on the color of your tshirt, you can use coloured pencils). Then I used acrylic colours to paint it. Mixing small amount of water will give a nice finish, else, if you paint it directly, the tshirt will be stiff. Acrylic paints are washable, without any fear.

Tissue paper clay is made by soaking tissues in water for sometime, and adding fevicol into it after draining the water. Mix it. Mix it very hard. Mixing is the main thing in the preparation process. The more you mix, the softer the clay. Add vaseline and small amount of face powder if required. It took me many trails and errors to finally get the required clay. So don't give up :)

Acrylic paints are washable, without any fear.\n\nTissue paper clay is made by soaking tissues in water for sometime, and adding fevicol into it after draining the water. Mix it. Mix it very hard. Mixing is the main thing in the preparation process. The more you mix, the softer the clay. Add vaseline and small amount of face powder if required. It took me many trails and errors to finally get the required clay. So don't give up :)\n\nAll the best!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9997

Veronique Helmridge-Marsillian,3y,Why are there so many dark nursery rhymes?,"Censorship—when you are not allowed to call out the ruling class, you have to call it out through “nonsense” rhymes.
And these have survived as little songs or poems told to children.

See here, this is how you were treated in England in 1569 (under Queen Elizabeth I) if you had no job, no food, no shoes, and your clothes full of holes.[1]
Anyone who objects to his taxes going on welfare should have a good look.

A nobleman is tossing a coin at a beggar. The beggar stinks—he makes the nobleman feel bad—so the nobleman turns his nose and eyes away as he hurries past.
The nobleman does not know whether, round the back of the house, the beggar’s mates are not about to ambush him and his purse… so he clutches the pommel of his sword.
(This is an engraving from a drawing, so the image, hence the action, is reversed.)

Okay, now you have now seen a real beggar.
But there were other beggars—the ruling class itself.
Did you notice how the beggar and nobleman looked similar?

What kind of begging did the ruling class do?
Well, 50 years later (under King James I), they would tell Parliament to tell the King to tell the middle and lower classes to pay taxes!
Import duties, export duties, taxes on livestock and produce, you name it, the lower classes paid it.
As a result of which, the top noblemen looked like this.[2]

George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, painted by Rubens, 1625.

The Duke of Buckingham was one of King James’s “favourites”—I say, favourites—all beautiful youths—there were many of them,
and they poured into England from Scotland when Scottish James took the throne in 1603.[3]

Obviously, you weren’t allowed to say anything. Especially if you were lower class.
So you wrote a song:

Hark, hark, the dogs do bark,
Beggars are coming to town.
Some in rags,
Some in jags,
And some in velvet gowns.

(A “jag” is a jagged cut in a velvet surcoat, revealing the fine lawn shirt beneath.)

If you were really bold, you might even sing this song—loudly, raucously, mockingly—as some Duke or Count or Marquess swept past you in the street.

And, because rich beggars have continued until the present day,
so has this rhyme.

Sonya Naima,5y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Mommy said to not worry. I heard a weird scream while I was playing with Mr. Elephant and I ran to her. She had these weird marks on her hand. Like a zebra. I like zebras. But Mommy looked like a red zebra instead of a black and white one. Does she want to be a zebra? I go to bed and have a good dream about zebras. Maybe I’ll become a zebra soon, maybe when I’m as old as Mommy.

Daddy comes home really early today. He starts yelling at Mommy when he notices her zebra marks. I don’t think Daddy likes zebras. Mommy started crying and she left to the other room. She dropped a weird stick thing. She was using it yesterday to turn into a zebra. I wonder…

Slice.

Ouch. I didn’t know becoming a zebra would hurt so much. Does it hurt Mommy too? I hide the stick thing and go to bed.

Mommy found a new stick thing. I remember how much it hurt me and I try to take it from her, even though Daddy told me not to steal. Mommy just smiles. Why would she smile? Is becoming a zebra really worth it? I’m confused. Mommy gives me a long note for Daddy and leaves me home alone. I leave it at the front door for Daddy to read and I take a nap.

I wake up. Daddy looks at me with tears in his eyes. He’s holding the note. Did Mommy write something mean? I wish I could read… I take the note and tear it apart with the stick thing I hid awhile ago. Maybe Daddy will feel better? I show the tiny pieces of paper to Daddy to see if he feels better. He just smiles at me, like Mommy did. He’s crying too. I’m still confused. He gives me a hug.

“I’m so glad…”

“Why, Daddy?”

“At least I still have you.”

(Okay, wow. This was way longer than I expected. Anyways this describes depression, self harm, and suicide in the eyes of a young child.)

Amon Elriyad,4y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","My name’s Ella.

I’m six.

I didn’t have a birthday party bekus of mommy.

She kept on drinking water. A lot of water. I kept telling her to stop drinking water, but she wouldn't listen to me. I don’t know why.

On my birthday, daddy came to mommy’s house to take me. I don’t no why they don’t live together.

When he came in, mommy was drinking colored water with bubbles in it and daddy started yelling. I told him to stop because mommy was going to hit him like she hits me and I don’t want daddy to get hurt.

Daddy looked down at me and started crying. I felt reely bad bekus I yelled at daddy, and I told him I’m sorry.

But he didn’t listen, he kept on telling ME he was sorry bekus he “left me here”.

I don’t get it.

He went to the kitshun where mommy was.

“Mommy, daddy doesn’t want you to drink water, so can you stop plea-” I herd plates crashing, like my toy trucks.

And then it was quiet.

“Daddy? Mommy?”

Daddy came running to me. Mommy came with more colored water. I told her I liked her bubbles, and she got mad. I put my arm on top of my head, bekus that’s where she always hits me. And it hurts, even when I say stop.

Daddy picked me up and ran to his car. He put me in the back but forgot the seat belt. “Daddy!” I started lafing. “You forgot my sea-” “SHHH” he told me, so I stayed quiet.
We were driving but daddy was driving fast. I like it when he drives fast but this was scary. I didn't like it.

He looked in the mirror at me and asked me how mommy hits me. I told him with her colored water bottles. “They’re hard and it hurts” I told him.

He started crying again. “No no, daddy, I’m sorry, never mind it doesn't hurt”. And then he cried even more. It made me sad.

“Where are we going?”, I asked.

But why is he going to a lake? And into the water? “Daddy, stop” but he didn’t stop. He kept going and going and going but then I don’t rememember anything.

Sukh me dukh me sang mere rahna,
Tum meri sakhi banogi na ?
Jab jab mai ruthu ,tum mujhe manane aana..
Hans do na bas ek baar ,
Bol bol ke mujhko gale lagana..
Bolo aisa karogi na ?
Tum meri sakhi banogi na..

Maa aaj ye pehno , aaj ye oodho
Kehkar mujhse laad jatana..

Aaj ye khana ..aaj wo khaana
Apni farmayishe batana..

khub pyar mai karti tumse ,
Tum bhi itna pyar karogi na..
Tum meri sakhi banogi na ..

Amy Sasso,5y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Mommy bought me black sneakers. My school said I needed shoes that fit, and she said black doesn’t show dirt. She asked my Daddy if he liked them and he said they’re ugly. Normal kids wear white sneakers. Now they’re yelling at each other because I don’t fit in and my black sneakers will make it worse.

I wish I didn’t get black sneakers. I hate it when they fight. Daddy gets really scary sometimes. But that’s good, because if he’s angry that means he isn’t smoking drugs.

They’re mad because I don’t have friends at school. But I have a kitty and my flowers outside. I water them every day and I imagine them talking to me. Sometimes I sit in a bush so my sister can’t find me. It’s quiet and peaceful.

I try to be nice to the kids at school but they don’t like me. They say I’m poor and my clothes don’t fit. It’s not my fault I get my sister’s old clothes. They think I’m ugly because my hair is always tangled and sometimes I’m dirty. I don’t know how to get the tangles out of my hair and I don’t always take a bath. My sister is mean to me when we have baths.

The other kids play sports and go to clubs. I don’t know how to do sports and I can’t see very good. I read books because they’re close up and I go right home. The other kids have nice skin and shiny hair. I’m always covered with band-aids and bruises. Once my teacher asked, where did I get all my bruises, and she looked worried. I said my sister fought with me a lot and she relaxed. I don’t want people to worry like that so I guess I shouldn’t let them see the worse stuff.

Well I’m gonna go to bed. My sister is with her friends, so I can get some sleep without her bothering me! I can’t sleep at night any more when she’s home, but Mommy lets me take walks outside if I don’t go far. Kitty sleeps with me and purrs. I love kitty.

Alex Johnston,2y,Does rap (musical genre) actually stand for “rhythm and poetry”?,"No. This is what’s called a backronym, where people take existing words and assume that they must be acronyms of previously existing phrases.

The most well-known examples of backronyms are ‘For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge’ and ‘Fornication Under Consent [of the] King’, both of which are erroneously claimed to be the origins of the word ‘fuck’. ‘Fuck’ is a much older word which can be traced back to the medieval period.

‘Rap’ used in reference to speech is actually much older than it looks.

The OED has five definitions of ‘rap’
 used in reference to the act of speaking. Who knew that Thomas Wyatt in 1541 was such a homeboy:

I am wonte some tyme to rappe owte an othe in an erneste tawlke.

Henry Fielding in 1742 had this:

Adams then rapt out a hundred Greek Verses.

Here, ‘rap’ meant to speak sharply or vigorously.

Later, it came to mean talking generally. Here’s F.H. Tillotson in 1909, in the intriguingly titled How To Be a Detective:

‘Rap’ means to speak. If you ‘rap’ to a man you speak to him or recognize him.

And Damon Runyon in 1929:

I wish Moosh a hello, and he never raps to me but only bows, and takes my hat.

And Eldridge Cleaver writing in 1965:

In point of fact he is funny and very glib, and I dig rapping (talking) with him.

By 1979, however, it’s come to mean the practice of talking over a beat or speaking rhythmically in the style we associate with rap. Cf. the Sugarhill Gang in 1979’s ‘Rapper’s Delight’:

I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat.

So, as we can see, ‘rap’ has been used to mean a style of speaking for five centuries.

But only in the last five decades has it come to mean a particular form of speech associated with the music known as hip-hop.

It does not ‘stand for’ anything.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cul062o9k17bhwmx', 'title': 'Does rap (musical genre) actually stand for “rhythm and poetry”?', 'score': {'original': 0.998, 'ai': 0.002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""No. This is what’s called a backronym, where people take existing words and assume that they must be acronyms of previously existing phrases.\n\nThe most well-known examples of backronyms are ‘For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge’ and ‘Fornication Under Consent [of the] King’, both of which are erroneously claimed to be the origins of the word ‘fuck’. ‘Fuck’ is a much older word which can be traced back to the medieval period.\n\n‘Rap’ used in reference to speech is actually much older than it looks.\n\nThe OED has five definitions of ‘rap’\n used in reference to the act of speaking.

Prashant Tiwari,Updated 3y,Which is a must-read poem by Sadhguru?,"Anyone even slightly acquainted with Sadhguru knows what mischief he can pack in a verse and what profoundness he can effortlessly deliver through poetry.

Here are some of my favorite Sadhguru poems:

On the Glory of ‘Kailash’

2. On ‘Mukthi’, or the Ultimate Liberation, the highest goal :

3. On the possibilities of a life ‘Unformed’ :

4. Mystical Depths of ’Manasarovar’

5. We experience life ‘Here- Yes Here’ :

Sadhguru has countless more witty, pragmatic as well as profound poetry.

However, For Must read, my money is on: ‘Be or Busy’

Its so poignant as it talks of Sadhguru leaving. I cried when I heard it the first time. The mere thought of it sends shivers down my spine. Yet, this poem hurries me up to prepare myself, for when he ‘sings his last song’.

Who knew just four lines of verse and a couplet would have such capability to stir a soul.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6mpnoa9xuq3riy28', 'title': 'Which is a must-read poem by Sadhguru?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Anyone even slightly acquainted with Sadhguru knows what mischief he can pack in a verse and what profoundness he can effortlessly deliver through poetry.\n\nHere are some of my favorite Sadhguru poems:\n\nOn the Glory of ‘Kailash’\n\n2.

Leigh L.,4y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","March 14, 2019

Dear diary,

Today's my birthday! I'm now six years old. Mommy forgot to greet me again this year. Silly mommy. But our maid, Anna, made me breakfast of waffles with a candle on top! Yum, I love waffles! I like them with chocolate syrup but we only had strawberry so Anna ran to the grocer's to get some. She must be super tired 'cause our unit's on the top floor and maids aren't allowed in the elevator.

Anna gave me a gift! It was a pink stuffed elephant. I like elephants. We went to Bali last summer and there were big elephants there. I think I'm gonna name her Ellie. Ellie the Elephant.

Anna drove me to school and I played tag with my friends before class started. I got a boo-boo on my knee when I fell. My teacher made the class sing happy birthday to me and she brought out a cupcake with a candle on top. I blew the candle and shared it with my classmates but I got sad 'cause the purple frosting got on my uniform's jacket. I think Anna calls it a blazer.

When I got home, I tried to make a bowl of cereal on my own 'cause Anna was busy washing the frosting off my blazer. Mommy saw me and started yelling at me because I spilled the milk on the counter. She yelled that it was expensive marble and that brats like me shouldn't do things on our own. I told her I was sorry but she got more mad and she punched my nose and my mouth and my eye.

Mommy pulled on my hair until clumps of it came off. I cried and cried and cried but mommy got more angry and put a lot of salt on the ground and made me kneel on it. It hurt a lot because of my boo-boo but I tried my best not to cry. Anna saw what mommy was doing and got angry. Anna told mommy she'll call the police but mommy hit her and told her that if she ever calls the police, mommy will tell the police that she was the one who hit me.

Then, someone knocked on the door. We have a visitor! Mommy opened the door and a man i don't know came in. The clothes he was wearing looked like what my daddy wears. A white shirt. A tie. A blazer. A pair of black pants. Mommy told Anna to take me to bed. She gave the weird man a grown-up juice. I know it's grown-up juice 'cause it's colorful and has a teeny tiny umbrella on it. I'm not supposed to drink it, but I smelled it once, and it smelled funny. They went to mommy and daddy's room and mommy told me that she'll hit me again if I tell daddy about her friend.

That night, Anna tucked me to bed with Ellie. She was crying a bit but I told that I'm sorry but she told me it wasn't my fault.

But mommy got angry at Anna cause of me. It's my fault.

March 15, 2019

Dear diary,

Daddy came home today! He didn't ask about the purple marks on my face but he did smell like mommy's grown up drink. I don't care, though. He gave me an iPad and greeted me Happy Birthday. He told me he was doing business stuff yesterday so he couldn't come.

After school, dad picked me up and took me to his condo! It wasn't very far from mommy's and it was the top floor too. There was a nice lady there. Her lips were red and her clothes were tight. I told her maybe she needs to get a bigger size of clothes and she laughed. She told me her name was Lucy and she braided my hair.

When daddy saw me and Lucy talking, he gave me a box of chocolates and told me he'll give me more if I don't tell mommy about Lucy. I like daddy a lot.

Lucy downloaded games on my iPad and we played this funny game with cats and dogs. She helped me with my homework and gave me chocolate ice cream. Lucy’s so cool. She’s like Anna and mommy (when mommy’s not angry) together.

Daddy and Lucy order a pizza. Lucy taught me how to eat pizza with a knife and fork. The knife and fork were kinda heavy and it was hard and daddy laughed and told me to just eat with my hand.

Daddy and Lucy tucked me to bed and I told Lucy I like her better than my mommy. She laughed again and told me that maybe one day. Daddy kissed my forehead good night.

March 16, 2019

Dear diary,

Daddy woke me up early and he smelled like mommy's grown-up juice again. Lucy was gone. Daddy told me she went back home.

Daddy drove me to mommy's condo on his purple car. It only had two doors and it went fast! We swerved a lot and I got a little bit dizzy but I'm okay now.

When we went to mommy's unit, the weird man from a couple days ago was there. Daddy got angry and he went to their room and mommy was there with another man. They had a sleepover! I love sleepovers!

Daddy started yelling at mommy and called her bad words and something that starts with the letter W. Then, mommy got angry and yelled at daddy too, and told him that she knows about Lucy too and that she just didn't say anything 'cause he pays her money to take care of me. Then they started throwing things and I cried and I tried to separate them so they won't fight and daddy punched me.

Everything looks wet 'cause of my tears but I can see Anna trying to stop daddy but mommy slapped her. His punches are worse than mommy's and they hurt more and I'm crying and crying and mommy started kicking me and it hurts so bad and I'm seeing stars and I'm just begging them to stop to please stop mommy daddy please don't someone help me someone please help me I'm sorry mommy I'm sorry daddy I thought you weren’t like mommy please stop please it hurts so bad pl","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dk09opyfr6izlv7g', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.49046666666667, 'ai': 0.50953333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""March 14, 2019\n\nDear diary,\n\nToday's my birthday!

I like them with chocolate syrup but we only had strawberry so Anna ran to the grocer's to get some. She must be super tired 'cause our unit's on the top floor and maids aren't allowed in the elevator.\n\nAnna gave me a gift! It was a pink stuffed elephant. I like elephants. We went to Bali last summer and there were big elephants there. I think I'm gonna name her Ellie. Ellie the Elephant.\n\nAnna drove me to school and I played tag with my friends before class started. I got a boo-boo on my knee when I fell. My teacher made the class sing happy birthday to me and she brought out a cupcake with a candle on top. I blew the candle and shared it with my classmates but I got sad 'cause the purple frosting got on my uniform's jacket. I think Anna calls it a blazer.\n\nWhen I got home, I tried to make a bowl of cereal on my own 'cause Anna was busy washing the frosting off my blazer. Mommy saw me and started yelling at me because I spilled the milk on the counter. She yelled that it was expensive marble and that brats like me shouldn't do things on our own. I told her I was sorry but she got more mad and she punched my nose and my mouth and my eye.\n\nMommy pulled on my hair until clumps of it came off. I cried and cried and cried but mommy got more angry and put a lot of salt on the ground and made me kneel on it. It hurt a lot because of my boo-boo but I tried my best not to cry.

Mommy told Anna to take me to bed. She gave the weird man a grown-up juice. I know it's grown-up juice 'cause it's colorful and has a teeny tiny umbrella on it. I'm not supposed to drink it, but I smelled it once, and it smelled funny. They went to mommy and daddy's room and mommy told me that she'll hit me again if I tell daddy about her friend.\n\nThat night, Anna tucked me to bed with Ellie.

Sabahat Momin,Updated 7y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"Most of my creative works involve capturing the texture, feel and look of the subject in focus. You can say I try to find a certain speck of beauty in anything that really triggers my fancy.

Of lately, it’s been food. The reason why food is my current muse is because I find it to be one of those substances that are beautiful in their sheer imperfection, for example :

The above picture is a progress shot of my croissant drawing. As you can see, this particular croissant is vastly imperfect, it includes distorted lines crossing each other..visible dents and cuts..a disproportionate shape, along with a plethora of colors mixed together..

The above picture is another croissant that I drew, placed below the first croissant. This too, is imperfect with its wrinkles, random lines, sharp cuts and colors.

However, this is how my painting turned out once I completed it :

I strongly believe, that everything imperfect, is beautiful and food is the best example of that, apart from people of course ! :)

It saddens me to see how the society and media tricks people into thinking perfection is the true hallmark of beauty. Through my creative works, I try to capture imperfect, raw, unmodified objects that are beautiful in their very own element.

Mia Brunet,5y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Mommy likes to listen to the news when I ride to kindergarten. Sometimes I listen too. Sometimes we listen to fun music, but usually we listen to the news. I was showing Mommy the pretty red leaf I found for school for show and tell but Mommy was just quiet.

“I’m sorry honey but I need to listen to the radio right now.”

Grown-ups do that a lot and they always are listening to boring grown-ups talk about big things. When they listen they get really quiet and their eyebrows get real close and they look mad. But Mommy wasn’t real mad quiet.

“Mommy, why are you sad?”

Mommy was still quiet. She parked at a Dunkin Donuts and I don’t know why because then I would be late for school and I couldn’t show my red leaf to Sarah and Liam and Samantha. But we were at Dunkin Donuts and Mommy always ordered a French vanilla latte with two sugars and one cream. I asked her if she wanted one but she shook her head.

“No, honey. You get yourself some Munchkins.”

She handed me a whole $5 bill and there were a bunch of red and yellow and orange leaves in the parking lot so I got some and put them in my pockets. A nice lady held the door open for me because I guess she wanted a French vanilla latte with two sugars and one cream because coffee is a grown-up drink. But the nice lady was quiet too and she was watching the TV in the store. So was the boy at the cash register. So was the grumpy man who pushed his eyebrows down and frowned. He was mad quiet.

I looked at the TV. I didn’t know what was on the TV. It looked like really tall buildings to me so it had to be the city. But there was a building and it was on fire. I don’t like fire. It’s scary. There were clouds of black smoke and I listened to the news.

“…hundreds estimated dead…”

I don’t know what “estimated” is but I know that hundreds is a lot because I can count to a hundred because I’m good at math. And I know what dead is because last year my dog died and grandpa also died.

I ran out to the car because the word dead makes Mommy quiet sad and I don’t like that. Mommy was crying when I saw her. The radio was quiet.

“Sweetie, your Daddy isn’t going to be home tonight.”

“Why not? Where’s he gone?”

Mommy cried harder now. Louder.

“He’s in heaven now. I’m so sorry.”

It was quiet in the parking lot of the Dunkin Donuts that morning in early fall when I gathered my red and yellow and orange leaves.

Tarun Kuckian,10y,What is the best two-liner that you have heard?,"Translation source: http://drsuraiyanasim.wordpress.com/tag/allama-iqbal-mirza-ghalib/

These three poets are legendary in Urdu literature as also their following couplets. The poets Ghalib(1797 -1869), Iqbal(1877-1938) and Faraz(1931-2008) present their views on the universality of God in the couplets. It was not a feud. At best you can call it a poetic difference of opinion by intellectual and witty minds, spread across centuries.

Ghalib started it: In the 19th century , it was a bold statment. But then Ghalib was never known for meekness or following the crowd.

“Zahid, sharaab peene de masjid mein baith kar
Ya wo jagah bataa, jahaan Khuda nahin”

[Let me drink in a mosque; or tell me the place where there is no God.']



Allama Iqbal was not convinced and decide to reply about half a century later. So in the late19th-early 20th century, his poetic reply to Ghalib

“Masjid Khuda ka ghar hai, peene ki jagah nahin
Kaafir ke dil mein jaa, wahaan khuda nahin”

Mosque is the abode of God, not a place to drink. Go to the heart of a non-believer because there God is not.



Faraz had the last word. (Later half of 19th century) .

“Kaafir ke dil se aaya hun, main ye dekh kar Faraz,
Khuda maujood hai wahaan, par usey pata nahin”

[I have returned from the heart of the disbeliever and i have observed:
God is present in his heart too, but he just doesn’t know it.

So in the late19th-early 20th century, his poetic reply to Ghalib\n\n“Masjid Khuda ka ghar hai, peene ki jagah nahin\nKaafir ke dil mein jaa, wahaan khuda nahin”\n\nMosque is the abode of God, not a place to drink. Go to the heart of a non-believer because there God is not.\n\n\n\nFaraz had the last word. (Later half of 19th century) .\n\n“Kaafir ke dil se aaya hun, main ye dekh kar Faraz,\nKhuda maujood hai wahaan, par usey pata nahin”\n\n[I have returned from the heart of the disbeliever and i have observed:\nGod is present in his heart too, but he just doesn’t know it.

Radhika Mundra,8y,Which is the simple but most motivational poem ever?,"'Don't Quit'

When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
When the road you're trudging seems all uphill.
When the funds are low and the debts are high,
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh.
When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.

Life is queer with its twists and turns,
As everyone of us sometimes learns.
And many a fellow turns about,
When he might have won had he stuck it out.
Don’t give up though the pace seems slow,
You may succeed with another blow.

Often the goal is nearer than
It seems to a faint and faltering man.
Often the struggler has given up,
When he might have captured the victor’s cup.
And he learned too late when the night came down,
How close he was to the golden crown.
Success is failure turned inside out,
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt.

And you never can tell how close you are,
It may be near when it seems afar.
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit,
It’s when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.


And that’s worth thinking about.

My mum doesn't let me play outside a lot. She's mean. She says outside is dangerous and full of bad people. I don't think there's bad people. But yesterday night there was this big loud whistle in the sky and then a big bang. It was scary. I think there are pirates somewhere heheh.

Somdip Dey,6y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"Short Answer: ReMe Basket
, an app that reduces food waste and saves money from every individuals pocket. Website: https://remebasket.com

Long Answer:

Oh boy….it’s good to be back and writing on Quora after some time. Although the reason, why I couldn’t post anything for last couple of days is also part of this answer (post) but I would come to that point little later (..and if you read the short answer, of course you did, you already got the hint).

First, I have to admit that I am wowed by many answers on this questions. The creativity displayed here are really good.

Second, I do have to warn you that you have asked for me to boast here. So don’t blame it on me later.

Here goes….Btw….TLDR; Warning ahead.

Product of my creative side is this….

No no. I am not talking about just the cartoon (comic strip) itself.

In past couple of weeks, I designed and coded an Android app to help reduce food waste at home. Although I shouldn’t be taking full credit for the designing of the app because much of it is owed to my beautiful partner, who scolded me at every wrong design steps I’ve taken. But Yes, the concept and development part is completely mine. The name of this android app is ReMe Basket. Download Link: Google Play Store
. And this was also the reason why I was very busy for past 2 weeks.

Background Story:

Well, I am Software Engineer (kind of a hot-shot one) and was used to being single few years ago. Although I dated a lot around that time but I never found the right person to settle down with. Apparently that life also promoted a “spending” lifestyle and I used to eat out a lot, which meant I didn't have to spend a lot on grocery or had much grocery items at home. Then I finally met THE amazing woman and I settled down. But then came a lifestyle, which i wasn't accustomed with before. Buying groceries regularly and store them in fridge and cook at home, so that we can have healthy food right at home. But this was also the time when I happen to face my arch enemy, Food Waste
!

Almost every day I would run into trouble (..with my partner) because I have forgotten to eat or use some food item in the fridge, only to find out that they have expired long time ago and had to bin them for the same reason. Then there came a day when I told myself, “Enough is enough!” I did some research and found out that I am not the only one who forgets food in the fridge only to find out that they have expired. According to news sources, around 25% of people in UK throws away food
 because of similar reasons and food waste in UK costs every household £700 on average every year
.

So it was about time that I needed to do something about it.

I invented ReMe Basket to keep track of your expiring or expired food items, so that you do not forget about them every again and get the best quality out of your food before they go past the use-by date.

Know when your food is going to expire.

Features of ReMe Basket:

Add / Remove items to basket
App keeps track of your expiring items and notifies you.
Can share expiring items with friends and family via SHARE.IT option in case you can not use up all the items all by yourself.
Use Camera to read the labels and item names instead of typing in (ReMe: Inteli-Text-Read feature)
Voice In food items in case you are lazy enough to type it or scan it it.
Uses Camera to scan barcode labels (this feature is in Beta version and scanning barcodes is limited to few major brands world-wide. Recognisable brands are only limited to US/UK/France) [ReMe: Smart-Barcode-Scan]
Get recipe suggestions based on the items/ingredients from your basket (this feature fetches recipes from Edamam - Eat better!
)

Wait….did I mention that ReMe can also suggest you recipes based on the food items/ingredients in your list ?! Yes, ReMe is that intelligent and the best part of this app is IT’S ALL FREE!

ReMe Basket is completely free to use (no in-app payments or hidden costs).

Well, there you go that’s all to my creativity for the moment. And I did warn you before even I started sharing all these with you. So don’t blame me.

The only wish I have from this app that I hope ReMe Basket would help some other person like me, who is so forgetful that an app is necessary to achieve all the aforementioned tasks and reduce food waste

Ankit Kumar,Updated 3y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I'm not sure whether this is eligible or not for that “creative” tag, but I wanna show you and it's upto you guys to decide. I did a chalk carving. During the 2015 ICC World Cup event, I created this mini world cup trophy in my free time. This is purely carved from a single piece of chalk.

P.S. Don't mind the poor photo quality, as I didn't have a good camera at that time.

Athreya Chandramouli,7y,Would you share some of your own creative work with us?,"I have been exploring Origami for the past 4 years. The idea is to turn a sheet of paper into a finished figure by folding only, no cutting or pasting. Here are some of my favorites.



Horse designed by Hideo Komatsu, folded by me.


Violin designed by Gen Hagiwara, folded by me.
The bow is from a separate sheet.


Magic Ball/ Dragon's Egg designed by Yuri Shumakov?, folded by me.


Swan designed and folded by me.

Fox designed by Hoang Tien Quyet folded by me.


Sea Turtle designed and folded by me.

Each of these models is from a single sheet of paper, no cutting or gluing involved.
Models like the fox and the violin, which have two colours, are not painted. The design of the model is such that it uses both sides of the paper in a technique called 'colour change'.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zjift5m1pxnu6ql3', 'title': 'Would you share some of your own creative work with us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9664, 'ai': 0.0336}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I have been exploring Origami for the past 4 years.
