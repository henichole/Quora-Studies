Shreyash Late,3y,What are some underestimated inventions of Indians?,"Do you know her?

Meet ANKITA NAGARKAR

An Indian girl, from Pune, Maharashtra who came came up with an excellent idea which we never would have thought of.

A STAPLER WHICH INDICATES PINS ARE FINISHING.

What's the big idea?

The idea was to colour last 3 pins in a joined row of staples. When a stapler gets to these pins, it's an indication that the pins pins are about to be finish. [1]

The Idea is so simple, yet so effective!

Illustration of the same :

Story behind the idea :

Once Ankita was stapling some project papers of her school when suddenly the stapler stopped working. Opening up, she saw it was out of pins.

Her father asked her, “Why didn't you know that they were about to finish?“

This got Ankita thinking. She came up with an idea to paint the last 3 pins with her nail-polish. But the paint was too thick. So, she used a permanent marker. This worked well to indicate that the pins were about to finish.

The idea saves last minute rushing around and is easy to implement in our day to day usage, with hardly any cost.

Appreciation :

Ankita received the IGNITE-2011 award as a class 10th student. National Innovation Foundation (NIF) has also filed a patent application in her name. Apart from IGNITE she has received more than 26 awards.

FINAL CLOSURE :

India surely needs to provide a platform for such innovative minds so as to make sure that their contributions are acknowledged throughout the world. Because very few people manage to come up with such amazing ideas.

Thank you. Jai Hind.

Henrey Bradley,Feb 6,How come the British are so good at invention?,"There is something unique found only in this valley and nowhere else, it won wars and changed the world.

Roughly 500 years ago, a fierce storm swept through this mountainous valley in the north of our island, slates flew from roofs, sheep bleated in the night and windswept trees were uprooted. It was amongst the deep roots of those trees, now exposed to the light of day, that a strange dark steel grey mineral was discovered in vast quantities.

Initially, the folk of the mountainous valley thought it was coal, but it did not burn, soon they realised it was ideal for marking their sheep (the neighbouring valleys were partial to sheep stealing). Before long, other uses were found for this “Black Lead”, it could be sliced into convenient sticks and used to mark things (or by fancy folk to write with).

By the mid-1500s, sticks of this rare “Black Lead” was being sandwiched in wood and sold across the British Isles.

During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, it was noticed that this material could be used in iron foundries to mass produce perfectly shaped cannonballs, naturally, giving the early Royal Navy a significant advantage over basically everyone. The steady supply of cannonballs enabled the Royal Navy to practice gunnery at a much greater rate than the rest of the world, this practice would prove invaluable against the Spanish Empire, which sent three massive Armadas to Britain, all of which were promptly slapped around.

This advantage lasted for centuries and would be decisive in numerous wars.

Understandably, being the only place with such a rare and useful resource, resulted in the British becoming right tight bastards and not wanting to share it with anyone else.

With the noticeable exception being the Netherlands. The Anglo-Dutch alliance throughout the 15th century resulted in the export of significant amounts of black lead to the Dutch, to aid them in their war for independence from Spain. Shockingly, the Dutch became a major naval power, thanks in part to a readily available supply of this resource.

Interestingly, it was not in war that this resource changed the world, but rather in education, uplifting countless people across the world from poverty with the First Educational Revolution.

This can be best seen in global literacy rates, which clearly show that the British and Dutch literacy rates rapidly started to climb from a little over 10% in 1500, before the discovery of black lead, to above 50% by 1650.

You see dear readers, that idyllic valley in the north of our island was the only known source of graphite for hundreds of years, and to this day it remains the purest graphite deposit ever found on Earth.

This pure graphite became the pencils of the world for centuries, leading to old English riddles like this;

""I am taken from a mine, and shut up in a wooden case, from which I am never released, and yet I am used by almost everybody.""

By the early 1800s, with the Industrial Revolution in full swing, the British had started mass producing many millions of pencils not far from that graphite mine and shipping them across the world, uplifting mind-boggling numbers of people from generational poverty and illiteracy with access to education.

Simply put, this pure graphite deposit paired perfectly with the stable nature of the largest island in Europe, allowing educational institutions to flourish that spawned many great minds and with that important inventions organically followed, birthing the modern world.

All because of a long-forgotten valley.

Shakespeare described this sceptre’d isle as another Eden, a demi-paradise, a fortress built by nature for herself, against infection and the hand of war.

Our happy island people, safely nestled in a little world, a precious stone set in a silver sea, which serves it in the office of a wall, or as a defensive moat to our home, against the envy of less happy lands, this blessed plot, this isolated realm, this bountiful island and people safe, in a ceaselessly swirling storm.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dsm3pfgi2wz8evkl', 'title': 'How come the British are so good at invention?', 'score': {'original': 0.56095, 'ai': 0.43905}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'There is something unique found only in this valley and nowhere else, it won wars and changed the world.\n\nRoughly 500 years ago, a fierce storm swept through this mountainous valley in the north of our island, slates flew from roofs, sheep bleated in the night and windswept trees were uprooted.

Sean Kernan,4y,What was invented for all the wrong reasons?,"Outside of success as a medical doctor, Dr. Gatling was a very potent inventor, creating several patents on cleaning products, farming equipment, pneumatic power, and toilets.

The majority of his income stemmed from his practice in medicine. And there was plenty of medical work going around during the Civil War, having the highest US death toll of all American wars.

As he continued his work, treating many wounded soldiers and seeing hundreds die in his infirmary, he’d realized that more of his war patients were dying of disease than from actually bleeding.

Dr. Gatling began indulging his curiosity for engineering and developed what would become the first successful machine gun in the world:

The Gatling Gun.

It was a hand-cranked machine gun, that loaded, locked and fired 100 consecutive rounds without reloading. It was modified from an automatic seed planter he’d created for farmers.

He had created it under the premise that it would do the work of an entire regiment for them. He thought that under this premise, it would remove the need to draft so many soldiers. And had also hoped that its terrifying power might help prevent wars in the future.

And while Dr. Gatling was surely a brilliant man, brilliant men are often wrong: his assumption couldn’t have been farther from the truth. (Source: The Gun That Changed Everything and the Misunderstood Genius Who Invented It. Keller, Julia.)

He, like the inventors of great weapons of war, was deeply troubled as the Gatling Gun went on to cause significant losses of life abroad.

And the weapon was later evolved into far more terrifying forms:

Handheld mob weapon.

Grant Corriveau,4y,What obscure invention changed the world?,"Float Glass

If you have ever looked through the original windows of a very old house, like a house that dates before 1950 you might notice something amiss. The glass in the window appears to be a little thicker in the bottom than the top as if the glass is slowly melting as the decades have progressed. The windows are so distorted that the images you see through the window also appear distorted.

The truth is the old glass in the window pane looked like that from when it was first made. The glass was made when a huge ball of glass was blown into a large sized cylinder then the cylinder was cut in half and flattened then allowed to cool down. The flattened glass would then be cut into smaller sections in order to be inserted into the multifaceted window frames such as the following:

When the sections were inserted, the builder tended to have the thicker ends facing down. Windows for houses were not as clear as eye glasses, telescopes, or microscopes because manufacturing very clear glass was expensive. Clear glass required intense polishing.

In the late 19th century molten glass was drawn through steel rollers. Glass windows were made in mass production using this method but there were irregularities in the final product and the glass was not very thick.

Then in the 1950s in Great Britain, the process of float glass was invented. The process involves pouring molten glass onto molten metal, usually tin. The glass floats on top of the metal then it cools in a very flat and clear shape. It also became possible to make clear glass sheets that were 25 mm thick. By 1960 the process was applied to mass production then all of the sudden houses were able to have large windows like this:

So if you see the glass windows on a very old house and they appear to be melting that is not the case. They were manufactured like this until window glass making improved.

Today practically all glass windows you see in buildings were made using the float process. Only specialized decorative windows such as stained or patterned glass would be the exception.

The invention of the float glass process became the standard process but not too many people today are aware how it revolutionized the industry.

Prottay M. Adhikari,Updated 4y,Which inventors who are credited with famous inventions actually stole or did not come up with the actual invention themselves?,"What ? No one has mentioned Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose[1] yet ?

Surprising !

Contrary to the popular knowledge, Bose was the original inventor of Radio Communications. In fact this MIT archive[2] clearly states that Bose’s contributions in the invention of radio-communications were unfairly concealed. The scientist who was credited (including a Nobel prize) for the invention was Guglielmo Marconi.

The 1998 IEEE paper[3] published by Dr. Probir K. Bondyopadhyay proves that it was Bose who was the inventor of the Mercury Autocoherer (patented by Marconi as Italian Navy Autocoherer). The chronology of the events clearly establishes that Bose was unfairly deprived from his due credit (and a guaranteed Nobel prize in Physics).

Fun fact — You remember the name of the scientist who discovered/proved that plants have life ?

Yeah … it is the same J.C. Bose

The things I wrote here, are probably trivial for students in India. However, my current following is strangely international. Hence, this trivial information is still important.

Sean Kernan,Updated 4y,What inventions had deeply personal beginnings?,"Samuel Morse was never supposed to be an inventor.

From an early age, he showed brilliant promise in art. As he rapidly passed peers with his pieces, it was all but assumed that painting was his future. That was his obvious destiny.

But, when peeling back a layer, seeing his story, the groundwork of an inventor was all there:

He was a gifted student, creative, with an interest in multiple subjects, including mathematics, philosophy, religion, engineering and — horses of all things. A free thinker. Ambitious. Hard working. A problem solver.

He came from affluence and had the best education (Yale) as many inventors do.

While at Yale, he paid his bills and tuition by doing art. Did I mention he was good at art?

Getting your portrait painted was a significant event in the early 1800s. It was a statement of class and high status.

If you were a famous American dignitary who wanted to get his portrait painted, there was a small list of great painters to choose from, and Morse was one of them.

He painted many of America’s great historical figures, including John Adams:

But he had other masterpieces including “Dying Hercules”

His path to inventing all began when he was commissioned to create an art piece for Marquis de Lafayette.

Saying his goodbyes to his wife, who was pregnant with their third child, he departed for a city that was days away.

While on site, working on his painting of the Marquis, working through the intricacies of the painting, he received a handwritten note that his wife had passed away after giving birth to their third child.

He immediately left, racing to get home, leaving his painting unfinished.

By the time he returned, her body had already been buried.

All because of a technology deficiency that required messages to be delivered by hired horsemen.

Just imagine finding out via handwritten note that your mother or spouse had passed away days after the fact, not even getting to her before burial let alone by their side while they were ill.

“Hey by the way - your mom died 4 days ago.”

This was the reality of his day and age. And you thought ghosting was bad…

Samuel Morse then mustered his academic prowess and creativity to research and develop Morse Code. This was the precursor to telephone communication and was used for decades via telegraph, which he also invented.

Morse code simply consisted of using an electrical wire to communicate letters via beeping sounds. Letters were formed by the duration and pattern of each beep.

Although it wasn’t a system designed for extended conversations, it was unbelievably valuable in communicating emergencies and important updates over great distances.

And from a broken heart it emerged.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r6a5873xk4eob1lm', 'title': 'What inventions had deeply personal beginnings?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Samuel Morse was never supposed to be an inventor.\n\nFrom an early age, he showed brilliant promise in art.

Alex Cooper,4y,What is your favourite accidental invention?,"Melting and… un-melting (solidifying?) chocolate bars.

Specifically, one of these:

It was a simpler time; it was a… more sexist time?

I don’t know whether they were going for reverse psychology or something… but anyway, this isn’t about Yorkie’s advertising methods; it’s about my discovery.

I was a teenager, at the time. I’d left one of these chocolate bars in the glove box of my father’s car during summer, and forgot about it for a few days.

When I found it again, it was completely melted.

Well, mamma Cooper didn’t raise no fool. I didn’t weep for all those lost calories — I knew that a chocolate bar could become a solid once more, if reintroduced to a sufficiently cold temperature.

Several hours of refrigeration later, I had breathed life back into the Yorkie, but it did not resemble the carefully-partitioned chocolate bar of old. It was flatter. Wider. It had reached its final form.

Imagine this, but flatter. I’m sure you can do it.

The chocolate bar had somehow ascended to a higher plane. It had more snap to it, with every bite. I could take as small or as large a bite as I wished, rather than following the manufacturer’s recommended mouthful size.

It… it was a very slightly more pleasant experience.

I know, I know. Pick your jaw up off the floor. I didn’t mean to just shake the foundations of your very being.

I think this could work with any chocolate bar, although there’s more of a difference with one that’s thick to start with.

Toblerone. Now that would be a whole new world of chocolatey goodness. If you have a massive Toblerone triangle (triangular prism — pedant preemptive strike) that your grandmother got you as a gift for the seventh year running, then you owe it to both science — and your tastebuds — to melt that bad boy right now, and flatten that shit out before re-setting it in the fridge.

(Melt it however you like, but leaving it in a hot car is more authentic. One for the purists, if you will.)

Louis Vaught,Updated 2y,You are transported back to the year 1600. What could you realistically build all by yourself that hadn't been invented then?,"This is where it pays to be a Civil Engineer, because a lot of the people answering this question would just wind up dying of disease before their plans got anywhere. By modern standards, getting sick was insanely common back then.

If you don’t want to wind up immediately getting the Plague, you’ll need clean water. Luckily, that’s probably the single most important thing you could invent for a 17th-century society.

So I’d just build a slow sand filter. 
The design is incredibly simple and surprisingly effective - most of the difficulty is on the operations side. Here’s a basic diagram of a good one, you can see that it’s really not complicated:

If you’re curious about how they work, I’d recommend doing some independent research. I could summarize it here but ultimately you’d still be taking me at my word, and there’s a lot of nuance to this type of filtration.

The piping might seem like a big ask for 1600’s technology, but it’s not actually necessary. Low-tech versions of the same thing are under active development for countries where resources are limited. Here are some example designs from the World Health Organization:

Germ theory hadn’t been invented back in the 1600’s, so right off the bat people wouldn’t know all of the benefits they get from filtering their water, but even just being able to pour “dirty” water in the top and have it come out of the bottom clean would be pretty miraculous for a lot of people.

And it wouldn’t take very long to pretty much re-write the course of history. Dysentery was incredibly common back then, and gets practically eliminated by just properly filtering water, not to mention the impacts of basic sanitation and sickness treatment. Check out this graph of illness rate in the US following the invention of water filtration:

It would take less than a decade to cut deaths due to sickness in half, at least, and childhood mortality in particular would plummet. Once you’ve established some credibility by practically eliminating the big wasting illnesses, you could easily start teaching people germ theory in earnest.

Beyond that, there are dozens of different things I could “invent” as a structural engineer that would seem pretty miraculous. Especially trussed structures, which didn’t get invented in any serious sense until the 1800’s, but are easy to make by just lashing or gluing together bits of wood. Here’s a decent example of a low-tech roof truss:

Trusses don’t seem very spectacular, but they let you build longer and stronger bridges (and much faster travel because of it). With a lot of deliberation and some basic knowledge of systems engineering, it would be easy to start making the kind of highly-planned infrastructure that people wouldn’t start seriously considering for hundreds of years. It’s not like I’m speculating about this either - low-tech infrastructure improvement is still a modern issue in developing countries.

You could even “invent” the field of engineering if you really wanted. Although there are records of “engineers” older than the 1600’s, standardization was really isolated, and there wasn’t really a strong concept of what engineering even was until the Industrial Revolution. Like Sun Tsu’s “the art of war” a book formalizing the basic principles of engineering design and testing could be dense and incredibly useful, even without any detailed technical information.

Risk analysis, which was only formalized in the 1980’s, could be started centuries earlier by just encouraging people to quantify expected outcomes. If you’re not in the field it’s hard to see how that would help things much, but there are about a dozen disasters that I could list off the top of my head that would’ve been prevented with decent risk analysis. In fact, part of the reason climate change is such a problem now is because we’ve lacked the tools to properly assess what kinds of potential harm we’re doing.

The main concern would be setting all this up to avoid coming into conflict with anyone already in power, since infrastructure is powerful in its own right. Just cozying up to one ruler seems like a bad idea, because the 1600’s was definitely a period of political turmoil, and accelerating societal progress would probably make that worse.

But you can’t just ignore them either, because building useful infrastructure with no direct replacement is a surefire way to either get “municipalized” 
or wind up with a lot of political authority anyways.

Just ask Facebook.

Tiny Nair,Updated 6y,Which is the greatest invention to date?,"Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen was born in Germany, raised at Netherlands, had his higher education in Switzerland, Zurich. He was a brilliant student, a keen researcher and above all a fantastic human being. As far as research and science is concerned, his sharp eyes did not miss even the faintest twinkle of a new development.

Wilhelm Rontgen

In the summer of 1895, he was experimenting with diffraction of rays in a vacuum tube, partly covered by cardboard. A barium coated glass plate lay several meters away from the workbench. Suddenly he noted an unusual faint glow of the barium coated plate. With his incisive mind, and sharp sense of deduction, Wilhelm understood that the vacuum tube produced some kind of extraordinary wave that penetrated the cardboard covering of the tube and lit of the barium coated glass plate. A wave, a ray, unheard of till that day. A ray destined to change the very face of medicine, giving rise to a new era in medical imaging. Wilhelm started experimenting, spending day and night in his Lab.

On November 8th he was ready to surprise his young wife. He invited her to his lab, asked her to put the palm of her left hand inside a box shaped contraption. A little later, working with the chemicals he produced the first ever picture of the bones of her hand, with the wedding ring clearly visible. Mrs Rontgen was not impressed, but the world stood up in attention. The science of medical imaging was born with the advent of X ray.

The First X-Ray of Roentgens Wife. The wedding Ring is visible.

X ray quickly caught the imagination of everyone, from scientists to fiction writers, comic books to pornography, with stories that now all human secrets under the cloth is revealed. Stories of X Ray spectacles surfaced. Superheroes with X ray vision were born. But X-ray was poised to travel to new heights, far beyond diagnosis of fractures or chest infections.

The modern day Cath lab (Angiogram lab) still use the same kind of vacuum tube that Rontgen experimented with but technically vastly advanced. Without X-Ray discovery, there would have been no angiogram, angioplasty or bypass-surgery.

But wait, I salute Roentgen for something else.

Andrew T. Post,1y,Which event seems invented but is real?,"The Tunguska event.

At approximately 7:17 on the morning of June 30, 1908, a gigantic explosion sundered the sky over Eastern Siberia. The area—an expanse of bog-strewn taiga near the Tunguska River—was sparsely populated. Only a handful of people witnessed the event: Russian homesteaders and members of native tribes. They described a ball of blue light nearly as bright as the Sun streaking across the sky, trailing a stream of fire. As the ball approached the horizon, it burst in a blinding flash, staining the whole countryside crimson. Minutes later, a series of thumping roars—like a distant artillery barrage—was heard, followed by a shockwave that blew out the windows of houses and cabins for hundreds of kilometers in every direction.

Closer to ground zero, the effects were even more drastic. A scientific expedition dispatched to the blast site in 1927 discovered an area of forest five miles wide where all of the trees had had their bark and branches burned off. Farther out, there was an intermediate zone of downed, partially scorched trees radiating outward from the epicenter. And beyond that, the expedition found tens of millions of knocked-over trees—an entire forest, instantly flattened. Later expeditions determined that 2,150 square kilometers of taiga had been devastated by the mysterious explosion. Members of these expeditions searched high and low for an impact crater, but found none. Several small bogs were investigated, but no conclusive evidence of an asteroid impact was ever found. After interviewing what few witnesses they could find, Russian scientists guessed that three people in (relatively) close proximity to the epicenter may have been killed. But no bodies were located and the deaths were never confirmed. The nearest survivor of the event had been 40 miles away. He’d been scorched by the heat of the blast and thrown to the ground by the shockwave, and had all the windows of his house blasted out and an iron lock on his barn door snapped in two.

Wow.

And that isn’t even the craziest thing.

Due to the paucity of eyewitnesses and physical evidence, scientists still don’t know for certain what caused the Tunguska event. Based on the scant testimony gleaned from the peasants and tribespeople who were in the vicinity, modern-day scientists are reasonably certain that the explosion was caused by the midair breakup of a stony asteroid 160-200 feet across. The asteroid entered the atmosphere at a speed of 27 kilometers per second (60,000 miles an hour) and broke up 16,000 to 33,000 feet (3 to 6 miles) above the ground. The result of this meteor air burst
 was a titanic explosion equivalent to anywhere from 10 to 40 megatons of TNT—possibly more powerful than a hydrogen bomb. The subsequent shockwave flattened eighty million trees over an area of some 830 square miles. Atmospheric disturbances caused by the blast were detected as far away as the Dutch East Indies and Washington, D.C. In certain areas, the shockwave was as powerful (and had the same effect) as an earthquake registering 5.0 on the Richter scale.

But that’s all conjecture. Since most of the asteroid—if asteroid indeed it was—burned up in Earth’s atmosphere and the remainder sank into the Siberian bog without a trace, all scientists can do is make an educated guess about what triggered the explosion that flattened a forest and rattled windows hundreds of miles away. Scholarly debate about the event’s true cause has raged for decades. One (debunked) theory holds that the object was not an asteroid at all, but rather a small fast-moving black hole. Another states that it was an icy comet whose remnants melted away to nothing following the blast, which would explain the lack of physical evidence.

The Tunguska event is classified as an impact event, though whatever caused it never actually hit the ground. Over a century later, it remains the largest impact event in recorded human history. If it had taken place over a major city, that city would have been wiped off the map. The sheer scale of the event is rivaled only by its enigmatic nature. Unsurprisingly, it has been referenced more than a few times in popular culture. Many science fiction TV shows, films, comics, and novels allude to the Tunguska event, positing that it was the collapse of a black hole, the opening of an interdimensional portal, the crash of an alien spacecraft, or some other paranormal occurrence.

Conny O'Rossy,1y,Why wasn't the bicycle invented long before 1817?,"Because they’re incredibly hard to make and it wasn’t possible. The bicycle is clearly the greatest invention.

Kate Scott,Updated 6y,"What's a cool thing you ‘invented/discovered’ as a kid, only to find it had already been invented/discovered ?","When I was about 7 years old, I invented something so incredible that I had to tell my Dad’s boss that he would be quitting.

He worked for a boating company that manufactured and sold boats—I’m pretty sure my dad was one of the salesmen for the company.

One day, my Dad had taken me to the docks with him. While he was messing with a boat, I saw some little fish next to the dock swimming around. After we got home and I went to bed, I had a stroke of genius! It was so good that I even snuck out of bed to go write it down!

Are you ready?

Glass bottomed boats.

The next day was a Saturday and I spent all day putting together charts and graphs and sketches and pictures. At the time, in my little mind, the papers looked like this:

But, in reality, I’m 95% sure they looked like this:

*That is my actual handiwork*

Later that evening we went to go pick up my Dad. As my parents were distracted talking, I walked into my Dad’s boss’ office.
The conversation went something like this:

Me: “Uh, yes… Dean? Could I have a moment of your time?”

Boss: “Well hi there kiddo! What’s up?”

Me: “Enough with the formalities. I’m gonna give it to you straight: I invented a boat.

And, frankly, it’s way better than what you’re churning out here.

Because of this, my family and I are going to be millionaires and my Dad will be quitting his job. I am now the breadwinner. Sorry to have to break this news to you—best of luck in your future endeavors.” (Or something to this effect)

With that done, I turned on my heel and strode out. Chest puffed up and nose in the air.

Later that night, I called a family meeting. Even the cats needed to be there for this one.

I strolled over to the dinner table and slapped my invention down, waiting for my mom to begin weeping tears of joy. We had it made now, I was sure of it.

Instead, my dad said, “Cool what’s that?”

And I said, “THAT, my dear father, is a glass bottomed boat. I invented it last night, and yes, we are going to be millionaires... I’ll give you a minute to take it all in.”

Much to my surprise there was neither weeping nor fainting.

Instead, my dad started smirking—trying so hard not to let out a chuckle- and said:

""Sweetie, that is SO neat that you came up with that on your own! However- there’s already boats with glass bottoms (or sections of glass in the bottom). SO… you didn’t technically invent it and… we’re probably not going to be millionaires just yet. But keep it up, kiddo! Never know when you’ll hit the big one!”

…

…

I was in shock as I went back to my room.

Absolutely crushed.

Defeated.

I rocked back and forth on my bed, petting my cat, staring with sunken eyes at my bedroom wall- looking like someone fresh out of the looney bin.

After an hour or so though, I finally decided: damnit, this is not the last you’ve heard of me! He did say: ‘Never know when you’ll hit the big one!’

So, throughout the next week, I submitted about 30 new boat sketches to my dad.

They were all—gently—turned down and I soon grew tired of boat inventions.

I didn’t end up hitting ‘the big one’…. YET.

Ian O'Grady,Oct 28,Who is the greatest inventor in history and why?,"When asked about the force-multiplying power of leverage, he said, “Give me a long enough lever and a place to stand, and I’ll move the whole world.”

When people didn’t believe Archimedes, he used a system of pulleys to pull a fully laden ship ashore using just his two hands.

When his city was under siege by the Romans, he built a giant claw that could rip enemy ships from the water. When the Romans returned, he constructed so many catapults, that the Roman army thought they were being attacked by the hundred-handed giants of Mythology.

He was so focused when working on a problem he’d often forget to eat, sleep and drink and had to be forced to bathe by his students.

When the king of Syracuse asked Archimedes to build him a ship, he built him the largest ship ever built for the next thousand years. The ship was capable of carrying 600 people and complete with a garden, gym and a temple to worship Aphrodite.

When the Romans continued to attack his city, he allegedly built a death ray that could burn ships attacking Syracuse. The Archimedes Heat Ray could set fire to incoming ships from the shore of the city, by using mirrors to direct the sunlight into a deadly beam of light.

When the Romans finally managed to invade the city Roman soldiers found Archimedes scribbling his geometry equations in the sand. When the soldiers found him and demanded he go with them he refused and said “Do not disturb my circles.” This enraged the soldiers, and they pulled out their swords and killed Archimedes.

Archimedes wasn’t just an inventor of death machines and pully systems, he also made numerous contributions to the field of mathematics.

Archimedes - Wikipedia
Greek mathematician and physicist (c.287–c.212 BC) Archimedes of Syracuse ( / ˌ ɑːr k ɪ ˈ m iː d iː z / , ARK -ihm- EE -deez ; [2] [a] c. 287 – c. 212 BC ) was an Ancient Greek mathematician , physicist , engineer , astronomer , and inventor from the ancient city of Syracuse in Sicily . [3] Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity . Considered the greatest mathematician of ancient history , and one of the greatest of all time, [4] Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems . [5] [6] These include the area of a circle , the surface area and volume of a sphere , the area of an ellipse , the area under a parabola , the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution , the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution , and the area of a spiral . [7] [8] Archimedes' other mathematical achievements include deriving an approximation of pi , defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral , and devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers . He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena , working on statics and hydrostatics . Archimedes' achievements in this area include a proof of the law of the lever , [9] the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity , [10] and the enunciation of the law of buoyancy known as Archimedes' principle . [11] He is also credited with designing innovative machines , such as his screw pump , compound pulleys , and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion. Archimedes died during the siege of Syracuse , when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. Cicero describes visiting Archimedes' tomb, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder that Archimedes requested be placed there to represent his mathematical discoveries. Unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writings were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from Alexandria read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530 AD by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople , while commentaries on the works of Archimedes by Eutocius in the 6th century opened them to wider readership for the first time.

He was fascinated with geometric shapes. The basic premise of the design was a problem, “How do I move blocks, without the structure falling apart.”

His early prototypes used tape and rubber bands. Eventually, he was able to find a manufacturer who could help him make one. His father had several patents, knew the patent process, and was able to help him secure the intellectual rights to what would become one of those most well-known toys in the world.

Susanna Viljanen,2y,What technology do you wish was never invented?,"Leaded fuel.

Knocking 
- the premature ignition of air-fuel mixture in an Otto engine, also known as “pinging” and “dieseling” - was a problem in the early 1920s, and prevented constructing Otto engines with better compression ratio. So General Motors began to search for an anti-knock agent in 1921.

A young chemist Thomas Midgley experimented with various concoctions, and finally encountered dimethyl magnesium and tetraethyl lead - which were found to be effective antiknock agents. The good thing with tetraethyl lead was that it also lubricated the valves.

So General Motors, Du Pont and Standard Oil founded the Ethyl Corporation to produce tetraethyl lead and sell it to fuel manufacturers. Engine compression ratios, engine power and top speeds could be raised and everyone was happy.

For a while. It came that several Ethyl Corporation employees began to demonstrate symptoms of saturnism and one employee died from it.

As a chemical engineer, when I hear “organoplumbic compound” it is a signal to run fast. Tetraethyllead is extremely toxic, and it is especially damaging to children’s brains. Lead has also a nasty tendency to enrich in the food chain and cause lead poisoning
 among the top predators - including humans.

A much viable alternative - ethanol - had been available since the beginning, but Midgley had dismissed it as “too trivial”. The World War Two saw a gigantic expansion on Otto engines - especially aircraft engines - and while the RAF had resolved the knock issue with aromatic compounds, American aviation fuel contained immense amounts of lead - it can be easily observed by white exhaust stains on cowlings and fuselages. That is lead oxide - widely also used as paint pigment!

leaded fuel ran lean creates white exhaust stains

Gazillions of tonnes of fuel were burnt for over three decades. Then in the 1950s, a geologist Clair Patterson (1922–1995) wanted to determine the age of the Earth from uranium and its decay. The problem was that radioactive heavy elements eventually decay into lead, and he found all his rock samples contained much more lead than what was expected - and they were contaminated all around the world!

The culprit was air - there was lead in the air all around the world. In the end Patterson built a hermetically sealed lab and was able to determine the age of Earth as 4550 million +/-70 million years (which is also today’s estimate). But Patterson got alarmed. He published how lead in the atmosphere had contaminated the air - and it was everywhere. He published his research results on atmospheric lead in 1971. Naturally the automotive industry was not amused, and it tried to silence him.

Finally the health authorities in the USA and Europe got alarmed too. Despite the lobbying of industry, leaded fuel was prohibited - first in the USA 1986 and five years later in the European Union.

Turned out ethanol is a much better anti-knock agent and completely harmless. It lacks the lubricative properties of tetraethyllead, though - but as the lifespan of engines is limited, the solution was simply scrapping the old engines when they came to age. Modern Otto engines are much more fuel efficient than those of the 1960s and 1970s. As of March 2017, only Algeria, Yemen and Iraq continue widespread use of leaded gasoline for automobiles.

But much of the lead is still in the air, and it diminishes by a nasty-looking first order differential equation. It is estimated the American average IQ is two points lower than what it could be due to the lead in the air. The problem is especially prevalent in cities and suburbia. The situation is less dire in Europe due to the popularity of mass transport and diesel engines, but bad still.

Lead does not only impair cognitive development, but it also increases aggression on those who have the MAOA2 genetic variant and increases promiscuous behaviour. The violent crime numbers have decreased everywhere in the First World during the past thirty years, and I can well remember that from my own youth - the teens are far less violent today than what they were when I was young. Likewise unwanted pregnancies are far fewer today than they were in my youth.

Leaded fuel is still allowed to be used in aero piston engines - simply because many of them are decades old legacy engines, many dating to World War Two. Fortunately the turboprop engine has superseded piston engines in all but the very smallest private aircraft, and turbine engines have used unleaded fuel since the beginning. Still the private aviation releases over 200 tonnes of lead into atmosphere annually, and children living next to airfields tend to have much higher concentrations of lead in their bloood than their inner city relatives.

Reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the First World. A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve with a 22-year time lag. After the ban on tetraethyllead, blood lead levels in US children dramatically decreased. Researchers say that declining exposure to lead is responsible for an up to 56% decline in crime from 1992 to 2002. Taking into consideration other factors that are believed to have increased crime rates over that period, the researchers found that the reduced exposure to lead led to an actual decline of 34% over that period.

Although leaded fuel is largely gone in the First World, it has left high concentrations of lead in the soil adjacent to roads that were heavily used prior to its phaseout.

Phani Priya,Updated 3y,What are some underestimated inventions of Indians?,"Banana leaf preservation Technology:

Tenith Adithyaa ;

He has made 17 inventions on his name,

For his contribution he received global recognition including 2 world record attempts, 2 National Awards, 7 Titled Awards, 5 State Awards and many District Awards. He is a winner of the IGNITE AWARD conducted by National Innovation Foundation INDIA.

He stayed at Rashtrapati Bhavan from July 1 to July 20, 2014 and was mentored by the office of the President House!

One of his invention is ‘BANANA LEAF PRESERVATION TECHNOLOGY’.

He says, “This could save 30 million trees per year. Leaves can last a year without chemicals. Normally, Banana leaves dry up in three days because the cell wall is soft. The process that i am using hardens the cell walls and prevents the leaves from drying up atleast for a year.

The manufacturing cost of these plates and cups is very low’ and they can also be used as fertilizer if disposed of in the right manner.

“I do not want to live with problems, I want to solve them,” he says.

“I am inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci’s life. After reading about him I decided that I will not be a scientist only but will become an inventor who makes people’s lives better. I want to become an aeronautical engineer and a space scientist like Dr. Abdul Kalam and like Stephen Hawking,” he says.

Dan Vorhis,Updated 1y,How did you start or invent something that was totally worth it?,"Most of my inventions start with a problem. Some examples:

I was kneeling in the snow to put zip ties around little plastic protectors to keep rabbits from eating our fruit trees. I came up with a new kind of zip tie to make jobs like that quicker and easier.
I was camping with my wife on a bicycle trip. We are at a state campground, and we had to haul water from a faucet that was pretty distant from our camp site. It is hard to balance a pot filled with water while riding a bicycle. I came up with something that, at the time, was new, and is now a commonly found product - a flexible canteen. My invention is still sold - the MSR “Dromedary”(r).
I was weeding strawberries on my farm. I had knee pads on. I hate knee pads - they cut off your circulation when you kneel. So I came up with knee pads that hang from your waist, rather than cinch to your leg. After 2 weeks, I realized I had invented chaps with knee pads. I’ve sold probably 15K–20K pairs of them over the past 20 years - “GreenJeans(tm) farm and garden chaps”.
My most recent invention is for a new kind of EDC (every day carry) knife - a simple, sturdy, full tang, joint-less knife that fits in your pocket, and doesn’t require a separate sheath.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/s64oqaydjxn7rvbz', 'title': 'How did you start or invent something that was totally worth it?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Most of my inventions start with a problem.

Steve Baker,Updated 4y,Who is the most badass scientist in modern history?,"No question whatsoever - Richard Feynman.

He worked on the Manhattan project to develop the atom bomb - but he also taught himself how to crack safes, play the bongo’s, how to count time reliably in his head WHILE paying attention to other tasks.

He was in charge of a group of people whose job it was to do long tedious amounts of arithmetic (because this was in an age before computers and pocket calculators). Although they were all civilians, the project was run by the US military. His military bosses were upset by the playful, “unmilitary” way he ran this group of people…so he taught them to do a kind of military ‘drill’ with their pencils. So on command, they’d lay their pencils on the edge of the desk - and in perfect synchronism whack one end with their hand so the pencil would flip up, twirl end-over-end and then be caught right in the correct place to begin writing. So when the general came around, Feynman would yell “Preseeeeeent PENCILS” and in perfect unison, 30 pencils would flip into the air and be ready to write!

He used science for everything. After his wife died, and he went into some kind of a depression, he decided to use scientific methods to learn how to pick up women in bars!

When he had a vacation, he’d take it by doing work in some totally different field - so normally, he did particle physics and such - but when he had a 2 week vacation, he’d go and work in a biology lab or something.

Feynman was also a great teacher (unusual for great scientists) and his lectures on Physics 101 are still so great that the three volume set of books transcribed from them are still used in many Physics 101 courses today.

His most famous thing was after the first Space Shuttle disaster. There was a committee formed to look into the problems. Feynman actually ignored most of the committee work and just wandered around talking to NASA engineers. He found that the “O-rings” in the shuttle SRB’s would fail to work adequately at cold temperatures - and the engineers who knew this couldn’t get themselves heard. So in front of a bazillion camera - and after a bunch of other committee members had blathered on about this and that - Feynman took a piece of O-ring material out of his pocket, clamped it in a small C-clamp and dunked it into the glass of iced water that had been provided for each of the committee members. After a few seconds, he pulled it out of the iced water, released the clamp and showed…right there…on live television - that the material didn’t expand as it needed to do.

This demonstration - super-simple though it was - totally blew away thousands of pages of reports and graphs and who-knows-what. EVERYBODY who watched that presentation understood immediately what went wrong.

Bad-assed…and then some! (Oh yeah - Quantum Electrodynamics…Nobel Prize…yadda yadda).

Keep up the good work!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h2xgv56m1l0urp3f', 'title': 'Who is the most badass scientist in modern history?', 'score': {'original': 0.4998, 'ai': 0.5002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'No question whatsoever - Richard Feynman.\n\nHe worked on the Manhattan project to develop the atom bomb - but he also taught himself how to crack safes, play the bongo’s, how to count time reliably in his head WHILE paying attention to other tasks.\n\nHe was in charge of a group of people whose job it was to do long tedious amounts of arithmetic (because this was in an age before computers and pocket calculators).

iii) Bottle Cap Filter - The guy name Niranjan Karagi, in what we call an underappreciated invention, he used nano-composite technology to create a small bottle cap filter that cleans contaminated water 99.9%.

Hazel,4y,What inventors were bad at using their own inventions?,"Karel Soucek, a professional stuntman, constructed six-foot-long, shock-proof, red barrels, which he’d have roll off cliffs and high places—with him inside them.

It worked the first time. In June 1977, the barrel was dropped into Niagara River and swept over the brink. The stunt worked—Soucek emerged, bleeding a little, but safe.

Unfortunately, the guy was arrested by Niagara Parks police got fined $500 for doing it without a license.[1]

That didn’t stop him. The exposure from doing the dangerous stunt earned him a lot of money. He persuaded another company to fund an 180 feet barrel drop from the top of the Houston Astrodome into a tank of water to finance his project.

35,000 spectators watched the stunt as it took place.

However, when he fell, the barrel was released too early, and began to spin uncontrollably as it shot down the building. It didn’t fall into the centre of the tank of the water—rather, it clipped the rim.

Foam pads which were supposed to ease the landing floated to the surface instead of being secured to the bottom of the tank, so they couldn’t cushion his landing.

‘It started spinning real bad. After a while the people started getting so impatient that we went ahead and dropped him. Just as we started to release the barrel, it started spinning again.’[2]

Fatally wounded, he was cut from the barrel. Soucek had crushed his chest and fractured his skull.

The crowd applauded. They didn’t realise the stunt had failed. It was only after the ambulance arrived that the noise died down and they realised what had really happened.

Soucek died the following morning.

The side of Soucek’s custom-made barrel reads:

‘It's not whether you fail or triumph, it's that you keep your word ...and at least try!’[3]

It really is that simple. You want an alternative to fossil fuels, I'm sadly the one to report the most viable option is a non renewable, yet carbon neutral, alternative known as 'uranium', and its cousin 'plutonium'.

In the long term, yes, we need to learn to harness the power of the sun (which is, ironically, powered by nuclear fusion). Before that, however, we should just accept that the best bet is to smash some rocks together and watch them burn.

Coal and oil are awful power sources in the modern day. Their extraction is difficult and dangerous, their use is killing our planet, and their fumes end human life. Uranium and plutonium are (comparatively) easy to dig up, they don't cause global warming, and they only offer a risk to humans when handled improperly.

We can power ourselves for centuries off of the miracle of nuclear power, and in doing so we will drastically reduce the amount of damage we are causing our world.

C Stuart Hardwick,Updated 2y,Why do we have technology to heat stuff up rapidly (microwave) but not make stuff cold rapidly?,"Thermodynamics.

What you are calling heat is the rapid vibration and wiggling of atoms and molecules. Increasing heat in this sense increases entropy, and is an easy thing to do. Reducing it reduces entropy, and is hard.

To heat something up, it’s only necessary to add energy in any form. Place a cup of water next to a light bulb and it will heat up. Beam it full of microwaves, and it will heat up. Grind it with a sander and it will heat up.

To cool something down though, you have to create a lower heat region and allow heat to migrate into that region. Since heat tends to even out over time due to entropy, maintaining the lower temperature region requires constant effort. Put ice in a cup of water and it will cool down, but only until the ice melts, then heat will leak back in from the room and restore equilibrium.

The way a microwave oven works is by placing food in a closed metal box and bouncing electromagnetic energy around inside it until it’s absorbed. Microwaves mostly pass through solid objects, but if you bounce them around long enough, they’ll eventually be absorbed, heating the food.

There is no known or theorized way to reverse this process, however. Hot objects will spontaneously emit photons of infrared light, and by that means cool down—but that’s true of all objects, so an object can only cool down to equilibrium with its surroundings by that means. That works great for a space probe needing to get rid of waste electrical heat in orbit around Mars—but not so well for a soda you want to cool below room temperature.

If we had a way to stimulate a can of soda to radiate energy (either as infrared or in some other wavelength), then in theory we could create a “microwave refrigerator”, but so far as we know today, the laws of nature don’t give us any way to do that, and even if they did, we would likely dump more waste heat into the soda than it could radiate away anyhow, as some of the induction signal would inevitably be absorbed.

So…we are stuck. We can either use an adiabatic heat pump to move heat out of a box and put our soda in the box, or use a Peltier effect semiconductor to move heat out of the box, or use one of several other more exotic methods to move heat out of the box—but no matter how we do it, heat will constantly bleed back into the box, and some of the energy we use will be lost as waste heat, and the box with our soda in it will only grudingly cool below the room it’s sitting in.

And even if we do all the work ahead of time and create an effective heat sink—liquid nitrogen for example, we still have no way of rapidly cooling an object from inside the way we can heat food with microwaves. If you dunk a can of soda in a bucket of liquid nitrogen, the outside will freeze while the inside is still liquid, and you will end up with a ruptured can.

The only way to rapidly cool something without freezing the outside is by means of a heat exchanger. If you pipe your soda through loops of metal piping submerged in a salty ice bath, you can cool it to drinking temperature as fast as you pump it through the pipe—but that’s neither efficient nor practical nor the sort of solution you’re looking for:

A reader has pointed out that an Argentinian company appears to be promoting a rapid cooling vending product that gets around the thermal conduction speed limit by way of convection: A can of soda is loaded into a gripper at the end of a spindle. A shield comes down to protect the customer while the can spins in contact with a heat sink of some sort. Inertia within the can causes currents to carry heat from deep inside the can to the exterior, delaying the formation of ice and simultaneously cooling the contents:

The machine can supposedly cool a can of beer or soda in 30 seconds, but again, this isn’t exactly a “microwave refrigerator.” Also, it’s not much of a product, as the machine requires power and and only cools one can at a time and would seem to have appeal more as a novelty than as serious competition for a traditional vending machine—and it also competes directly with items like Spin-Chill, which does exactly the same thing in a field-portable form factor:

Augusto Baena Reig,Updated 7y,"What's a cool thing you ‘invented/discovered’ as a kid, only to find it had already been invented/discovered ?","I “invented” self-directed headlights for cars when I was about 8 in the early 80s.

I wondered why in windy roads the headlights would illuminate the trees where you don’t want to go and not the road you want to go to.

So I proposed that headlights would be mechanically connected (through a set of gears) to the steering front wheels, in such a way that they would “turn-in” in corners as well.

As “four headlights” cars already existed (such as BMW), then I proposed one pair would be straight and the other pair would be movable.

However, my dad told me they had just been invested in the re-design of Citröen DS (which was nicknamed “tiburón”, or “shark” in Spain)

Interestingly, the Citröen used the same concept I proposed: headlights would swivel in connection with mechanical steering.

Most “active headlights” today do not make use of this concept. They are not mechanical, but electronically-directed. And, in some cases, lights do not “physically move”, but rather different sets of individual lights are used, depending on the intended direction.

The most extreme case is the Matrix Headlights developed by Hella/Audi:

Much more powerful, but less interesting. :-)

Julia A. Lange,4y,What seemingly normal invention got its inventor in trouble back in the day?,"(image: irenne56 / Pixabay
)

You probably recognize these devices as umbrellas. They keep us from getting wet in the rain and protect us from the harsh ray of the sun. They are an average product that people in most places have.

But back in the day, umbrellas were controversial.

(image: Gettmann / Getty Images via Atlas Obscura
)

While visiting Persia, a British man named Jonas Hanway noticed something interesting:

The Persian prince used a large tent-like structure on a pole to protect himself from the rain and sun.

Hanway, a kindhearted man, came up with the idea to make smaller versions of the prince’s shade for non-royals and call them umbrellas.

However, when Hanway tried selling the umbrellas in Persia, he was met with contempt. The umbrellas were an Eastern symbol of royalty, so his misstep caused him to be kicked out of the country.

So Hanway returned home to Britain with his umbrella in tote. He thought, “Hey! if it were good enough to ward off Persian rains, my umbrella will be good enough to ward off British rain!”

The next time it rained, Hanway paraded around town with his umbrella.

Before Hanway decided the umbrella would be a good rain protector, women used the umbrella to cover themselves in public. But Hanway was the first Western man to carry an umbrella and the first person to use it for rain protection. So when he first emerged from his home, people were dismayed.

Townspeople met Hanway with hostility over his invention. They felt threatened over the umbrella and even pelted Hanway with garbage.

But Hanway didn’t care. The stubborn man continued to carry his umbrella. By the time he died, the umbrella became a staple for Londoners. Thanks to his perseverance, Hanway became a pioneer in rain protection.

Malayaj Kumar,Updated 6y,What are some of your amazing inventions?,"This is one of my recent invention that i made . I study in kendriya vidyalaya and participated in 44th Jawaharlal Nehru science, mathematics and environmental exhibition (JNSMEE) 2017. I came first at school level and participated in the regional level at Guwahati. There i secured second position in my subtheme ( Innovation in food production and security) . From around 400 students 12 students got selected and i was among them . After i got selected for the National level which was held at KV IISc, Bengaluru on 24 to 26 April 2017 . There again i secured second position in my sub theme & 18 students selected from 500 projects and i was among them. Next level is NCERT level(venue and date is still not decide ).

Now what i made :-

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:-

The name that I had given to this model is ‘ELECTRONIC BEJOOKA’. This model is totally based on the protection of the crops. There are 4 circuits which I had implemented in this model. BIRD SCARE (to deflect the birds), DOG CALLER (to call the dogs), TIMER (for the motors) & THE CHARGER. ELECTRONIC BEJOOKA is just similar to the simple bird scare but this is electronic. This model works like online UPS which get the solar energy during the day time and functions whole day and also the battery get charged during the day time and functions at night time. This model is like the bodyguard of the farmers, which will reduce their physical efforts and also helps in the protection of the crops.

This model consists of solar panel & four circuits . When the sun light falls on the solar panel the rotors which are presents at the end of the hand starts rotating for about 30 seconds. Automatically the rotors stop rotating and all the circuits come in the action. Firstly the bird scare circuit releases a frequency of which will deflect the bird from entering in the fields. At that moment the dog caller circuit will come in the action and releases a frequency of 27 khz which will call the dog.The whole circuit will be in the action for about 2.30 minutes and again the rotor will starts to rotate. This will function whole day and battery also gets charged during the day time which the farmers can use to charge their cell phones and glow the torch at the night time.

Thanks for reading…

Alina Medina,Updated 7y,"What's a cool thing you ‘invented/discovered’ as a kid, only to find it had already been invented/discovered ?","When I was in 6th grade, I came up with what I was convinced was the most awesome design ever.

This was going to be the logo for my clothing line. It was cool and patriotic. It was going to be the next Paul Frank.

I spent jr. high drawing up sketches of shirts, tank tops, backpacks, you name it. I painted my logo on a shirt and wore it to school.

My heart burned with passion whenever I wore it, drew it, or even looked at it.

Then in 8th grade, a guy looked at my shirt and asked, “isn't that the Captain America sign?”

At first, I was in denial. I had never heard of Captain America, but how can anything have the exact same logo as mine?

I tried to ignore it, fight the paranoia, as if that would make whatever Captain America was go away. But I knew I had to see, so months later, I bit my lip and googled it.

Devastation.

I saw a comic book character holding a shield with MY logo on it. The EXACT. SAME. LOGO.

And it was created (and made famous) decades before I was born.

As if the death of my clothing line wasn’t enough, I had also been walking around school with a comic book symbol on my shirt. (This was before the Marvel movies came out, when that would have been cool or at least normal.)

EDIT:

A lot of people think I must've seen the Captain America logo somewhere and had it subconciously resurface in my mind. No, actually. I remember exactly where I got the inspiration from.

My mom bought me a handmade krochet beanie from a street merchant while we were visiting San Francisco. The star with a blue circle was on top, and the stripes wrapped around the head in the same order, red, white, and red. I got the design from playing with my beanie and drawing the entire layout of what it would look like if it was flat.

Ciprian Blu,7y,"What's a cool thing you ‘invented/discovered’ as a kid, only to find it had already been invented/discovered ?","I was messing around in class filling in random squares on maths paper like every other kid.

After a while even this gets as boring as listening to the teacher droning on pointless facts, so I started experimenting with patterns.

I wanted to see what the full picture would look like if you started with a black row and apply a simple law to colouring the following rows.

For example, a simple rule might be made up of the following conditions: if the two or three of the above squares are black, the square will be black; if one or none of the squares above is black, the square will be white.

With rules only a little more involved than this, unexpected complex patterns can emerge.

Here is one of my sketches I dug out from my cupboard.

Here is a pattern (rule 102) from the Wolfram Alpha site. Looks familiar?

These patterns are called cellular automata and they have been used as an example of how complex life can result from elementary particles (atoms and molecules) and simple laws (of physics). Thus an attempt to answer the question of how sentient, incredibly complex beings can arise out of pretty much dirt and sunlight.

This concept has been taken a step further in Conway’s “Game of Life” which showcases how complex animated purposeful like objects arise out of a simple cellular automaton (developing in time as opposed to developing down the page).

Now, understand, at the time, this was probably more valuable than a “cure for cancer” would be today. Salk could have become outlandishly wealthy. Polio was so feared and so devastating that people would have gladly mortgaged their houses and sold their kidneys to afford a vaccine.

But, when journalist Ed Murrow asked Salk who held the patent for this amazing vaccine, Salk replied, “There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?”

To him, it was simply obvious that his work was for the good of all, not for his own profit.

Algorithms existed millennia before Al Khwarizmi, as did algebra. He is often called the ""father of algebra"" for being the first to completely systematize and formalize algebra.

Alan Dicey,Updated 4y,How great was Barnes Wallis? How much did his inventions actually contribute to the allies winning?,"Barnes Wallis (not Wallace, don’t confuse him with Mel Gibson wearing blue paint and a skirt) was an innovative, clever and stubborn (some would say forceful) engineer.

His first notable work was on the structure of the R100 airship, built by Vickers, where he designed the airframe to be constructed of a combination of only 11 standard parts.

The use of a few standard structures and the geodetic arrangement of the bracing wires in the R100 led Wallis to his first innovation, geodetic construction of airframes. Here, the outline of the airframe, wings, tail and all, was constructed of diagonally connected light aluminium crossmembers which were then covered with fabric. The resulting structure was strong and damage-resistant, a great advantage in something that is going to be shot at. First used in the Wellesley

which carried its bombload in underwing panniers, because Wallis hadn’t worked out how to cut the large hole needed for a bomb bay into the geodetic structure. The Wellington followed,

the only British bomber to have served throughout the war, firstly as the principal night bomber, and later in anti-submarine, transport and experimental roles. One was converted into the first AWACS, with ASV II and III radars, used to detect and direct fighters onto the He 111’s carrying V-1 missiles for air launch.

This example, stripped of its fabric skin, shows that they had worked out how to cut a bomb bay opening in the Wellington. Windows (at the top of the photo) were made by replacing the fabric with a strip of transparent perspex.

Wallis’s thoughts on how to end the war quickly led him to think of attacking sources of natural resource, mines, oilfields, dams and so on by means of shock waves, generated by a very big bomb designed to burrow into the ground intact and explode after reaching some depth. His proposals were largely waved aside, seeming too difficult to build at the time, which was probably correct. Undeterred, he found that a smaller bomb, detonated right against the waterside face of a dam, would breach it. That led to the Upkeep weapon and the Dams raid.

It was originally meant to be spherical, but the casing kept breaking off, and they found that the cylindrical form worked just as well.

Having achieved success with Upkeep, the earthquake bombs were now back on the menu, and the Lancaster bomber, a new development since Wallis’s first proposals, was available to carry them.

To carry a Grand Slam, the aircraft had to be stripped of its top turret to save weight, and the bomb was carried semi-recessed.

The Wellington served well and faithfully throughout the war. Upkeep provided a dramatic morale boost, and Tallboy and Grand Slam demonstrated the futility of trying to build bomb-proof structures. Wallis’s contributions to the war effort were strong and devastating to the Nazi’s myth of invincibility.

He was deeply affected by the loss of so many of the aircrew on the Dams raid, and made very strong efforts to never risk lives again, insisting on remote-controlled model aircraft for testing his new swing-wing concepts, Wild Goose and Swallow.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/x4n1dh7m0fv2je8t', 'title': 'How great was Barnes Wallis?

Jack Brownlee,4y,Which is the greatest invention to date?,"I don’t know if it necessarily counts as an ‘invention’, but I cast my vote for adult jokes in kids’ movies.

It isn’t super often that we encounter movies that are appealing to both adults and children. There’s just a lack of plot depth and intensity in children’s movies, deterring most adults, and obviously there can’t be a ton of gunfights and nudity in a kiddie movie. It’s difficult to make movies that appeal to a wide audience.

Adult jokes are the perfect solution to that issue.

“My name’s Richard Grayson, but all my friends call me Dick.”

Batman so expertly responds:

“Well, children can be cruel.”

An expertly timed adult joke. Subtle enough that a kid wouldn’t know any better, but apparent enough that the adults in the theater chuckled.

For the rest of the movie, there are little sprinkles of mature comedy throughout:

It took me a few seconds to understand this one, but if you say it phonetically it sounds like a… naughty British epithet.

Oscar Tay,Updated 6y,What year was the letter J invented?,"1524.

Classical Latin did not have the letter J. This was because Classical Latin did not have the “J” sound; it used I to represent both a vowel sound (as in “machine”) and a consonant (as in “yellow”). Latin names, such as “Julius” or “Jesus”, were actually pronounced “Yoolius” and “Yeisus” (and spelled “IVLIVS” and “IESVS”).

They’re now pronounced with the affricate /(d)ʒ/ because of a kind of sound shift called palatalization - or, in less technical terms, the Latin consonantal “I” sound underwent a sound shift that pulled the it forward into the French “J” sound.

English also underwent palatalization of its own, creating a new sound that was represented with “cg” or “dg”; the latter still survives in words like “hedge” or “badge”. Under French influence, the word-initial “dg” started being spelled with an I, but not in the middle of words. This is why “dgoke” and “heje” look so wrong to anglophones, and why J doesn’t appear in the middle of many Germanic or Latinate English morphemes.

There was now a problem: the letter I represented both a consonant and vowel sound. It took several centuries for a solution to appear in the form of Gian Giorgio Trissino’s 1524 Ɛpistola del Trissino de le lettere nuωvamente aggiunte ne la lingua italiana (“Trissino’s writing on the recently-added letters in the Italian language”), which is the first known work in which “I” is distinguished from its fancy swoopy variant “J”.

The idea caught on, I and J already having begun the split. This addition was not met with universal acclaim: many considered it no more than a variant of I even as late as the 19th century. Eventually, though, J won its place in the alphabet, becoming the most recent letter added.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gr7l6aw21usn9t38', 'title': 'What year was the letter J invented?', 'score': {'original': 0.9972, 'ai': 0.0028}, 'blocks': [{'text': '1524.\n\nClassical Latin did not have the letter J.

Jay Bazzinotti,Updated 1y,What if vaccines were never invented?,"In America in the 1600s, the population of Boston was less than 4000 people living in rough-framed wooden homes, or in caves carved into the beach dunes of Dorchester or domes covered with tree bark. The first store didn’t open til 1651 and yet 40 percent of Boston’s population would get Smallpox in a year. Smallpox was a scourge. Up to 30 percent of those people would die and those that survived were disfigured. Their teeth would turn black, often they would just fall out. And in a land where people were right on the knife edge of survival or had just moved past basic survival to building a community, Smallpox was a disaster. Because not only was it indiscriminate and hit rich and poor alike, it also killed the strong with the weak, the young and the old, the pious and the profane. And with up to 40 percent of the population sick, the healthy were crippled having to maintain farms and fisheries and put up food for winter - and care for their dying spouses, children, friends. Society as they know it was on the verge of collapse.

And them Onesimus, the Black Slave of Cotton Mather told his Master of the cowpox they used in Ethiopia to protect their people from the Smallpox and Mather, a well-read man and trained in medicine in England, decided to try the cure Onesimus spoke about. By giving the cowpox to people, a process called “variolation” he could encourage their own immune systems into fighting off the smallpox. He tried it on the slave’s children first - and they survived. And then he tried it on his own children - and they survived. And they never got the Smallpox.

And so he told the City of Boston about the miracle of the vaccine.

And the population of Boston tried to kill him.

You see, he was interfering with “God’s will” by saving people from the disease. And people had to die horribly. That was “God’s will”.

During the day, they tried to set his house on fire; they threw bricks and rocks through his windows, which was a big deal since almost all glass had to come from England; they wanted to hang him.

And then the Smallpox made its appearance and people started dying in droves.

And then, after midnight, the people who had thrown rocks through his window during the day brought their children to be vaccinated. Because they wanted their children to live. Because they didn’t want them to have scarred faces and bodies and black teeth and be pointed at in the street and shunned and be ashamed to be alive. They vilified him during the day - and begged for the vaccine at night.

And the vaccine saved Boston. Smallpox was nearly wiped out, although it would always be a scourge to the unvaccinnated.

If there had been no vaccine it is possible Boston, and much of America, would have failed. The ones who survived would have been in survival mode all the time, struggling to subsist in a harsh climate with few tools, few animals, few comforts or luxuries, struggling always to be one step ahead of starvation while tending to the sick or leaving them to die in the woods so they could save themselves.

Huyen Nguyen,Updated 3y,What are some of the most useful inventions that were created by mistake?,"In 1951, a WWII veteran named Wilson Greatbatch was working at an animal behaviour farm affiliated with the psychology department at Cornell. His work involved attaching experimental instruments to the animals, measuring their brain waves, heartbeats and blood pressure. One day, he had lunch with two visiting surgeons and listened to them talk about the dangers of irregular heartbeats. He imagined the heart as a radio that was failing to transmit or receive a signal. The random analogy didn’t come back to him until several years later.

A year later, Greatbatch started teaching electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo and worked part time at the Chronic Disease Institute. A physician at the institute recruited Greatbatch to help him design an oscillator that would record heartbeats using the new silicon transistors.

One day, while working on the device, Greatbatch happened to grab the wrong resistor. When he plugged it into the oscillator it began to pulse in a familiar rhythm. Thanks to his error, the resulting circuit fired exactly like a heartbeat! Here was a device that could restore the faulty signal of an irregular heart, by shocking it back into sync.

Up till then, pacemakers were bulky units which required the use of mains power. He modified the device further to be able to work in conditions inside the body and also to have long battery life. The result was an implantable, largely maintenance-free pacemaker. Within two years, he and another surgeon named William Chardack deployed the first implantable cardiac pacemaker on the heart of a dog.

Anna Kerr,Updated 6y,"What's a cool thing you ‘invented/discovered’ as a kid, only to find it had already been invented/discovered ?","When I was around 6 years old, I “invented” Google.

There was one day when I spent HOURS trying my very best to come up with a website that hadn't already been made. (I wasn't into coding or anything, I just wanted to make one up so I could make it when I grew up.) I approached my mom over and over to tell her my ideas:

“What about a website all about hair and hairstyles and stuff?”

“I'm pretty sure that's already been made, sweetie.”

“Ugh. Well, what about a website JUST for playing games?”

“That's been done before too.”

“Uggggghhhhh!”

Eventually I got really frustrated. My mom said it was okay to make a website even if there's already a similar one out there, but I wanted my website to be the FIRST of its kind.

Finally, genius struck. I was absolutely POSITIVE that this idea would make me FAMOUS. There was no way ANYONE could have come up with this one already!

I marched up to my mother and attempted to explain my complicated idea:

“Okay, so- what if there was a website where you type in a word, and then the website shows you EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE EVER that has that word?? PLUS, when you click on a website with the word, it doesn't just go to that website. It goes to the part of the website that actually has the word! Has THAT been done before??”

My mother frowned. “You mean like… a search engine? Like Google? Yes, that's been done before.”

That was the last straw for me. Apparently every great idea on the internet was taken. I gave up on coming up with websites for the night.

UPDATE: Okay, so this is pretty hilarious… It turns out my Dad answered this same question a year ago, with the same story. The problem is, he remembered a few things wrong… like the fact that I told my mom the idea, rather than him. Plus, in his version my vocabulary is apparently much more sophisticated. Lol. There's this whole conversation in the comments where he corrects himself though.

Tara Collins,4y,Who is the most badass scientist in modern history?,"I'm going to have to go with Justin O. Schmidt, inventor of the Schmidt Pain Index.

Schmidt is an entomologist who originally studied honeybees but has since expanded to ants, wasps, and arachnids.

What do all of these creepy-crawlies have in common? Venom! Specifically, venom that hurts. He had a hypothesis that painful venom evolved first in hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees) and then only when they became social did they need stings that actually did damage to their victim. A solitary insect just needs to inflict enough pain to escape, while a social insect needs to keep a predator away from the colony. If the predator learns that the pain is a lie, not indicating real damage, they might push through it to get to the honey or larvae the insect is protecting.

It's pretty simple to quantify toxicity in a petri dish, but to test his hypothesis Schmidt needed to rank pain. This is less simple; tissue grown in a lab can't feel pain. So he did what any good scientist would do: be the test subject.

He exposed himself to the stings of dozens of insects, recording a rating of 1 to 4, along with comments more appropriate to wine tasting than agony: A sweat bee's sting (1.0) is “light, ephemeral, almost fruity. As if a tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm”, while a yellow jacket's (2.0) is “hot and smoky, almost irreverent. Imagine W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue”. One of the sadist champions, the warrior wasp, has a score of 4.0 and is described as “torture. You are chained in the flow of an active volcano. Why did I start this list?”

There are others I could mention who experimented on themselves, like Barry Marshall, who drank a concoction of Helicobacter pylori to prove that it, and not stress, was the cause of chronic stomach ulcers.

Pieter,2y,Why wasn't the bicycle invented long before 1817?,"If you wanted to go from A to B you would walk.

If you wanted to go faster or with less effort you would ride a horse or a camel, or maybe you hired porters to transport you in a litter, sedan chair or palanquin.

Roman and Chinese emperors would occasionally ride chariots for ceremonial purposes but by and large men just didn’t really use vehicles for long distance transport.

This all changed rather suddenly in late 16th century Europe. Within a few decades it became normal to travel by horse drawn vehicle. In cities horse cabs exploded into use and for longer distances (stage) coaches became the fastest and most comfortable way to travel.

Pratim Sarkar,6y,What are some cool inventions?,"PENCIL WITH POTENTIAL

What if instead of throwing your pencil stubs away you could plant them and have them grow into something delicious, beautiful, and fun? What if pencils could grow?

CSAIL graduate Mario Bollini has transitioned from programming robots that bake cookies
 to developing pencils that when planted will sprout fresh herbs and vegetables. In a new endeavour called Sprout, Bollini, who was previously a member of CSAIL Director Daniela Rus’ Distributed Robotics Lab, and fellow MIT classmates from a product development course have developed a “pencil with potential.”

Each pencil has a different seed located inside. When the pencil is too short to use, users can plant it, and when watered the pencil will sprout anything from cherry tomatoes to radishes and marigolds.

Sprout is a pencil with a seed inside. When it's too short to use, it can be planted at home, at the office, or in the classroom.

We really like writing with wooden pencils. They have a tactile feel that even the best mechanical pencils can't match. When Sprout is too short to use, it can be planted to grow into a wonderful flower, herb, or vegetable.The seed capsule is water activated, the first few times you water Sprout dissolves the protective capsule and starts the seed's germination.

Isn’t it amazing?

Hagop Tashjian,6y,What is an invention everybody uses but the inventor didn't make any money from it?,"Diamonds.

Well, synthetic ones.

I don't know if anyone answered before me, but…

Tracy Hall was an American physical chemist and the first person who grew a synthetic diamond by a reproducible, verifiable, and witnessed process, using a press of his own design.

At that time, he worked for General Electric. Naturally, his discovery changed the world market- forever. GE went on to make billions out of this new business. So a lot of money was (and is) actually being made out of the synthetic diamonds business and its derivatives.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Dr. Hall's reward, you ask?

A 10$ US savings bond.

Note: I know this isn't the best example as “10$ is not the same as no money made” but if you compare the diamond industry's profit to the 10$ reward… yeah I'm gonna go with this.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/liawjqcve26ngszt', 'title': ""What is an invention everybody uses but the inventor didn't make any money from it?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Diamonds.\n\nWell, synthetic ones.\n\nI don't know if anyone answered before me, but…\n\nTracy Hall was an American physical chemist and the first person who grew a synthetic diamond by a reproducible, verifiable, and witnessed process, using a press of his own design.\n\nAt that time, he worked for General Electric.

Steve Baker,2y,Which computer invention helped to make computers much smaller and faster?,"Well, the switch from glass vacuum tubes to transistors…that probably dropped the size by a factor of 20 to 50. From a room-sized machine to a couple of racks.

But then going from transistors to integrated circuits was a similar size jump…getting the size down to a single rack mount module.

But once we got to the form-factor of (say) a DEC PDP-11 - they were about the same size as a large-ish desktop PC.

At some point, getting smaller computers was less important than getting more powerful computers - so once the size of the computer was about that size - even as the circuitry shrank by factors of a million or more - we just stuffed more and more circuitry into the same sized box.

So the size of the components has shrunk to an AMAZING degree - but it’s just not particularly obvious.

This is also true of things like laptops…laptops can’t get smaller because the size of the screen an keyboard becomes a limiting factor.

So I would say that the answer is “Integrated circuits” for both size and speed.

But there are computers that are insanely tiny…one of my favorites is the ESP-8266. I think this is the smallest computer that I’ve ever personally programmed.

This circuit board is about the size of my thumbnail - it costs about $1 - and it has WiFi and a surprisingly powerful computer (MUCH faster than an Arduino)….

I have run a website off of one of these little beauties! As an example, I connected it to a motor controller that drives a stepper motor that moves the “fence” on my saw table. So I can grab my phone, open the saw table’s web site - and enter the distance I want from fence to blade in inches, millimeters, etc.

I recently read about a small device that’s just 1 millimeter on a side that’s designed to be injected into the blood stream. It doesn’t do much - just measures temperature and sent out a single number via ulrasound. It’s also powered by ultrasound because it’s too tiny to have a battery.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/swufaibhkgr5xvp0', 'title': 'Which computer invention helped to make computers much smaller and faster?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Well, the switch from glass vacuum tubes to transistors…that probably dropped the size by a factor of 20 to 50.

Virendrasingh R.Todmal,Updated 4y,What inventions had deeply personal beginnings?,"These were created due to personal necessity more than an accident. In 1920, Earle Dickson was married to a rather clumsy woman named Josephine.

Josephine was very accident prone, which made life difficult for poor Earle, since medical attention wasn’t cheap. She was always cutting her fingers in the kitchen while preparing food.

A frustrated Josephine shared her plight with her husband, Earle Dickson, who happened to be a cotton buyer for Johnson & Johnson .

When he realized that his wife’s accidents wouldn’t stop, he had an idea. He cut a small piece of gauze and placed it on another strip of gauze with adhesive on each end. Josephine’s wounds were saved from getting infected, but no one knows if she stopped walking into walls or not.

Eventually, the pair figured out that they could make a lot of pre-made bandages by laying out a long roll of sticky tape and cutting out lots of little pads. Together with some crinoline to keep the sticky bits from getting prematurely stuck, they had created adhesive bandages...later known as BAND-AID® .

By 1939, Band-Aids were also sterilized, just in time for WWII.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0atcqzuib6ejn549', 'title': 'What inventions had deeply personal beginnings?', 'score': {'original': 0.999, 'ai': 0.001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'These were created due to personal necessity more than an accident.
