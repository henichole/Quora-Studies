Bishnu Dev Panda,Updated 6y,Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of?,"Do you know who she is? Today, I will tell you about her.

Late Riya Chaudhary

March 10, 2014 was a pretty normal day for Riya’s family. She was sitting in her room and studying for her exams when she heard some unusual noise in the living room. As she rushed towards the living room, she saw some men with guns there. They were aiming at her father. And then they fired at her father.

Without giving a second, she came in front of father and took the bullets on her chest. While she was alive she saw that her mother was also in danger, as one of the men was aiming at her. When he fired the shot, she jumped and pushed her mother out of the way and saved her life. After that she fell down and died.

Student of class 11 of Gyan Deep Public School, Riya Chaudhary was selected for the National Bravery Award in 2014 by the Indian Council for Children Welfare.

Whenever we see such scenes in television, we get goosebumps. Many start crying while many clap to applaud the bravery of the actor/actress in the movie. We see Army men dying, we salute them for their act of bravery. I think she deserves a salute from us too.

A big salute to this Indian Braveheart. Hats off!

Thanks for reading.

Shashank Gupta,Updated 6y,Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of?,"Mr. P V Saar, the puppet seller, Connaught Place, Delhi

He is alive inspiration and a real example of never say die attitude, at the age of 75.

Mr Sahay is a living example for the people who are scared to struggle, he is 75 and still working. At this age, he commutes daily from Rohtak (which is about 85 km from Delhi) with a bag full of puppets which makes difficult for him to even walk.

He has a railway pass which enables him to commute daily from Rohtak. He earns for his wife, married daughter and her children. He happens to be a Retired Bank manager, of a multinational bank but that bank stopped operations in India. He had a son who was a chartered accountant, he had spent all his fortune for his son's career.

His son moved to Bahrain, UAE without informing him and after some time a news came to him that his son had died in an accident, now he was the sole breadwinner for his family, and he had already spent all his fortune on his son.

He chose to accept the fate and started working to support his family and never asked for help from anyone.

Jean-Marie Valheur,2y,What generally least-liked celebrity has/had a dark past that many of us may not know about?,"When he was born in 1947, Arnold Schwarzenegger did not have the easiest start in life. His father had been a Nazi soldier. His mother had been war widow, her first husband, another Nazi, killed in the battlefield, Schwarzenegger senior her second husband. There was quite a bit of stigma attached to Arnold’s father’s former profession, needless to say.

He wasn’t an only child, either — Arnold had an older brother named Meinhard. And while Arnold was considered homely looking and not-too-bright, his brother was the handsome, movie-star looking firstborn. His parents doted upon Meinhard. The favorite. The golden child.

They were very strict, however, to Arnold. His father wasn’t an easy or a pleasant man at all. In may 1971, when Arnold was only 23 years old, his brother got in a car crash. He died at the scene, 24 years old. He left behind an wife and an infant son, named Patrick…

Not burdened by hard feelings, Arnold took care of his nephew, paying for his education and caring for his brother’s widow as best he could. He tried to be the best uncle and father-figure he could. Later, when Arnold had his first son, he named his Patrick as well, in a hommage to both his brother and his nephew.

The two men remain close to this day. Arnold Schwarzenegger overcame a difficult childhood, a quiet mother and an aggressive father. He overcame struggles and hardship and took great responsibility upon himself at an early age to care for his brother’s family, where another man might have passed the opportunity out of a grudge to the ‘favorite child’ who got all the attention…

Honestly, the more I hear about the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger the more impressive the man becomes. He really is larger-than-life, and he’s entirely self-made, mind, body and soul.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j46nrq9p2lvc5zh7', 'title': 'What generally least-liked celebrity has/had a dark past that many of us may not know about?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'When he was born in 1947, Arnold Schwarzenegger did not have the easiest start in life.

Arjun Chandur,Updated 7y,How would life have unfolded for Michael Phelps had he been born in India?,"Phelps started swimming at the age of 7. So this would have been his timeline if he was born in India.

7-10 years - Learn Swimming.

11-14 years - Ace Nationals Under 15. Dreams of winning a medal for India at the olympics.

15 years - Cram for class 10.

16-17 years - Societal pressure from ""char log "" gets to their parents and they join him in a coaching class. Now he studies hard for 2 years to enter into an elite engineering university and puts swimming on hold.

18-21 years - Studying Mechanical Engineering at XYZ university. He wins all the inter university competitions in swimming.

22 years onwards - Work for TCS! Swims on weekends to fight obesity.

End of a dream!

We all had a bit of Phelps in us in our childhood only to let him loose for a safer option towards stability. Hope our next generation has the freedom to pursue their dreams!

Edit 1:- Question is hypothetical (or is it?) and I have given answer from a common man's perspective. The ones who had real talent eventually make it to the top irrespective of the conditions.

Edit 2:- John Adams, The 2nd President of United States of America had said the following lines couple of centuries ago,

“I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.”

India is presently in the second stage according to Adam's timeline. I believe we will rule the field of sports as we do presently with Engineering, but sadly it might take more than a few decades!

Anmol Singh,Updated 8y,Why was there so much controversy after Vijender Singh chose to become a Professional Boxer?,"Vijender chooses Money over Country!!

To earn more money Vijender signs a professional contract. He is not going to represent India at Olympics. He betrayed the country.

Seriously??

Most of the people who are saying such rubbish things don't understand what Vijender becoming a professional Boxer implies.

Wasn't he a professional-boxer before, when he was playing for India?

No, he wasn't. He was an amateur boxer because the competition he was participating in like Olympics, Commonwealth, Asian games comes under Amateur Boxing Associations.

Becoming a profesional is a step ahead for Vijender's boxing career. It is like moving from second-tier to first-tier of the game.
It's unfortunate that now he can't play for India at Olympics. But it's not his fault. It's AIBA(The International Boxing Association) rule that a professional player is ineligible to play in amateur competitions for obvious reasons.

People who are gutted over his decision to turn professional should recognize what he has done for India and how he has made us all proud.

According to his promoter Francis Warren of Queensbury Promotions, a company that promotes several boxers in the professional circuit, said:-

""After spending the past week with him in Manchester, there is no doubt in my mind that he has what it takes to be a very successful professional boxer, not only because of his undoubted natural talent but also due to his drive and focus”.


It is a 'historic moment' for boxing in India. If Vijender succeeds then no doubt Indian Boxing too will succeed and our boxers will get more international recognition.

So instead of throwing punches below the belt, support the lad and pray that he succeeds there too and makes the country proud.

Mayank Garg,Updated 7y,What are some famous gestures of respect in sports?,"“I want to talk to you,” Ponting insisted as Dravid stepped on the crease.

Dravid wondered what he had done wrong; on the contrary, Ponting wanted to tell him what he was doing right. Dravid was having a poor series; Ponting urged him to hang in there.

“I know you’re not making runs, and I know there’s probably a bit of pressure on you at the moment,” Ponting told Dravid. “But let me tell you: every time you come in, I tell my guys that you look like you’re going to get runs today.

Abhishek Negi,Updated 6y,What are some famous gestures of respect in sports?,"Great gesture of respect by -

Yogeshwar Dutt

We all know Yogeshwar dutt won the bronze medal in London Olympics 2012 in 60 Kg category.

However there were news that Silver medallist Russian Besik Kudukhov had reportedly tested positive for a banned substance Which meant that Dutt would be receiving an upgrade turning the Bronze medal into Silver.The Russian Athlete unfortunately had passed away in an Road accident in 2013.

Yogeshwar Dutt not only showed great respect by not accepting the medal but also said that he had great respect for the family of the deceased and therefore wanted the medal should stay with the family.

Here is what he tweeted-

Translated Text : If possible, please let that medal remain with his family. It would be more respectful for them. For me, humanity is above all of it.

SaiCharan Ch,Updated 3y,What are some famous gestures of respect in sports?,"This one from Mahendra Singh Dhoni deserves its place here.
ICC T20 World Cup 2014
Semi Finals: IND vs RSA
Virat Kohli scored 68 of 43 which made the chase easy for India.
India need just 1 run to win from 7 balls.
The man on strike was M.S.Dhoni. What every one expected was a winning shot from Dhoni as he usually loves to do. But what he did was outstanding.

​
He blocked the last ball of the over for no run and gave strike to Virat Kohli to finish the innings.

What he meant by that is ""You won the game for us, you finish it.""

​

This incident may examplify the definition of a Leader.

Rajhans,Updated 6y,Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of?,"The monk who’s sold on maths-

Swami Vidyanathananda, also known as Mahan Maharaj.

After clearing IIT entrance with rank 67; he entered the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where he initially chose to study electrical engineering but later switched to his true love- Mathematics. He graduated with a Masters in mathematics from IIT Kanpur with near 9.8 CGPA.

Later, he joined the PhD program in mathematics at University of California, Berkeley. He received the Earle C. Anthony Fellowship, U.C. Berkeley in 1992–1993 and the prestigious Sloan Fellowship for 1996–1997.

After earning a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1997, he worked briefly at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Spiritually inclined, he joined the Ramakrishna Math as a renunciate upon being impressed by the life and work of the Vedantic philosopher Ramakrishna Paramahansa. He was ordained a monk and received his saffron robe in 2008.

Later, in 2011, he was awarded Shanthi Swarup Bhatnagar Award for Mathematics- India’s most coveted science honor.

He also won Infosys Prize 2015 for Mathematical Sciences for his work in hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, low-dimensional topology and complex geometry. Currently, he is Professor of Mathematics at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Mumbai.

He has been quoted as saying- ""I am enjoying being a monk as much as I enjoy my mathematics.""

By looking at him, it seems that science and spirituality can go side by side, although both are commonly perceived as antithetical to each-other.

EDIT- Many people objected to the last line of the answer and pointed out that I was wrong in placing Science and spirituality at odds. Yes, you people are right. Pardon me for my parochial perspective. Science and spirituality are not antithetical rather complementary to each other. Mea culpa! I stand corrected.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yj3iofxu5basc2tr', 'title': 'Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of?', 'score': {'original': 0.9914, 'ai': 0.0086}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The monk who’s sold on maths-\n\nSwami Vidyanathananda, also known as Mahan Maharaj.\n\nAfter clearing IIT entrance with rank 67; he entered the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where he initially chose to study electrical engineering but later switched to his true love- Mathematics.

He is considered to be the most down to earth person by his colleagues. He donates huge bulk of money every year to startup companies as charity.

He is still not as popular as others in our country, because the only reason I think is he never had any desire to be the CEO of any company, for example legends like Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella.

Sumeet Sinha,Updated 8y,What are some famous gestures of respect in sports?,"Many people have written about a player congratulating another player after he played a good innings. That is fine, and very much expected.


One incident stands out in my opinion.
India vs South Africa, in year 2000, when SA visited India, Ganguly was a new captain then.

Robin Singh was running hard and threatening to take the game away from SA. Just then during a run, he collided with a SA fielder and fell mid way. The ball reached the bowler's end, and the bowler was about to dislodge the bails.

Hansie Cronje shouted from mid-on not to do so, came running toward the player (Steve Elworthy I think), put his hand on his shoulder and walked along away from the stumps, explaining him something.

Result: Robin Singh survived the run out because of brilliant sportsmanship shown by Cronje.

This tops my list of gestures of respect for the game.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/n21quy56lvmgiozj', 'title': 'What are some famous gestures of respect in sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Many people have written about a player congratulating another player after he played a good innings.

Tushar Verma,4y,What shocked you in ICC Cricket World Cup 2019?,"Check out an incident from today's match between England and Bangladesh.

Stokes delievered a short length ball.

Batsman went on to hook it but couldn't connect.

After hitting his body, ball went on to hit the stumps.

But Bails didn't come off.

You must be thinking that this is so common.

No, it was not the same case today. It hit the stump reasonably hard.

And the real concern is that it has already happened at least 3–4 times in this world cup.

Even Bairstow was very surprised. He tried to hit the stump manually to check whether it was functioning well.

It wasn't.

Stokes gave a hopless smile and moved on. He was able to not care much because England were winning it comprehensively. It wasn't going to matter.

What if it was a semifinal and situation was 2 runs required with one wicket remaining? Would they have been able to smile and move on?

What if it was the Final?

ICC should take care of it before it is too late. They have enough time to focus on Dhoni's gloves but not for a serious issue like this.

Emotions of Billion fans are attached with the tournament. One disputed incident can make this prestigious event look hideous.

EDIT 1: It's not even 24 hours since I wrote the answer and it has happened again. This time it was Bumrah who went unlucky and Warner survived on the very first ball of second over of the inning. Yet again ball hit the stump relatively hard.

Sean Kernan,Updated 4y,Why have Olympians become so much faster?,"Swimming is a perfect case study that can be extrapolated to most sports, the same underlying principles will explain many of the differences:

If you compare swimming times from now against the times from even 30–40 years ago, it isn’t even close.

Let’s look at Mark Spitz, who held the Gold Medal Record (7) before Michael Phelps came along.

If you put Phelps’ best 200 Fly time next to Spitz’s best 200 Fly Time, the difference is about 9 seconds.

Which - in swimming - is a chasm, equating to multiple body lengths. If you were filming these two racing at those times, Spitz wouldn’t even be on screen when Phelps finished.

So why is Phelps, like many top athletes, ridiculously faster than his predecessors?

Let’s look at Mark Spitz’s stroke:

Obviously, he doesn’t have a cap or goggles, which is going to knock a few notches off his time. (1: equipment improvements).

But there is more - compare his stroke to Phelps:

It’s like the difference between a puddle jumper plane and a stealth bomber.

Note his body position. Spitz is going near vertical to breathe, dropping his hips and creating drag in the water which slows his forward momentum.

Phelps, in turn, is staying as horizontal as possible, gliding along the top of the surface, his chin is just scraping above the waterline, increasing speed and reducing effort.

Also, note his arms are almost symmetrical on both sides, keeping his body balanced, with his wrists staying just above the water line. (2: technique improvements)

This isn’t by accident. It’s a product of decades of research and testing, all aided by technology and film study of swimming technique. (3: Research and Technology).

Additionally, in years past, swimmers were overtrained to the point that it eroded their muscle and speed in the pool. Peaking for competition has been whittled down to a science. They have also perfected weight training regimens that enhance in-water speed. (4: Training).

Lastly, the number of athletes competing is exponentially larger and hence, your outliers will be even more extreme. (5: expansion of the talent pool)

It might be hard to believe but someday, years from now, another swimmer very well could make Phelp’s stroke look just as goofy.

Small incremental improvements from multiple data points, compounded over decades, result in massive differences in performance in any sport.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/k2no54mv0l7qb9pu', 'title': 'Why have Olympians become so much faster?', 'score': {'original': 0.9975, 'ai': 0.0025}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Swimming is a perfect case study that can be extrapolated to most sports, the same underlying principles will explain many of the differences:\n\nIf you compare swimming times from now against the times from even 30–40 years ago, it isn’t even close.\n\nLet’s look at Mark Spitz, who held the Gold Medal Record (7) before Michael Phelps came along.\n\nIf you put Phelps’ best 200 Fly time next to Spitz’s best 200 Fly Time, the difference is about 9 seconds.\n\nWhich - in swimming - is a chasm, equating to multiple body lengths.

Angel Santiago,Updated 2y,Who is the most intimidating athlete of all time? Why?,"His name struck fear within veterans and novices alike.

His nickname? The Experiment.

For someone of his strength and stature could not have been a normal man. A genetic anomaly of the highest degree that made all who attempted to challenge his dominance quiver in fear that they may have made an awful decision as he hoisted them through the air with unrelenting violence.

Alexander Karelin.

If this guy sounds like Ivan Drago or Zangief from Street Fighter, know that you aren’t too far from the truth. I’d even say Karelin was more intimidating than both of those fictional characters and for good reason.

Karelin, a Greco-Roman wrestler for Russia, only ever lost two matches in his entire life.

Compare this with another superstar of the combat sports world, Floyd Mayweather Jr., who lost no matches in his professional career boxing.

The only difference is that Karelin wrestled 889 matches in his career while Mayweather had probably boxed hundreds including his amateur fights, losing some of them.

Karelin neglected to give up even a single point over six years.

For years, Karelin seemed to be an impregnable fortress capable of catapulting his 200+ lb foes across the mat as if they were weightless ragdolls.

Wrestling in the Super-Heavyweight division, Karelin’s strength, athleticism, flexibility, and stamina were extremely uncharacteristic for someone of his size.

His signature move was one that broke his foes mentally before they even went out on the mat. The Reverse Body Lock.

Karelin would grab his opponents up off the mat and fling them through the air for huge points. This was originally a move reserved for lighter weight wrestlers but Karelin made it look effortless on even his biggest adversaries.

A quote from one of his opponents stated this about his signature move:

""I was doing everything humanly possible to prevent him from lifting me off the mat. I weighed 265 pounds. I was in good shape. I was scared—intense fear. I don't like flying through the air like that. I kept thinking, 'Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt.' With him, it's almost a victory if you don't get thrown.""

Yeah, could you imagine victory being equated to not being launched by your opponent? That his how utterly petrified people were about stepping on the mat with Karelin.

To this day, if someone mentions a Karelin Lift, they are talking about a Reverse Body Lock. He was so skilled at the move that his own name became synonymous with it.

Karelin was one of the most dominant athletes in any sport ever. His long and victorious career is one that has yet to been matched.

There are not many athletes before or since Karelin’s prime that could be considered intimidating to the level that he was intimidating. Karelin struck primal, anxious fear into each and every one of his opponents without fail. The only equivalent I could draw for a wider audience to understand would be Mike Tyson; it wasn’t if you were going to lose but how fast you would lose and how much of a beating your body would take.

For these reasons, Alexander Karelin remains an incredible example of what dedication, skill, and genetics can do when coupled with a terrifying countenance and legendary status.

Off the mat though, he wasn’t all that terrifying.

Karelin was quoted as saying he didn’t much like himself before wrestling, stating that:

“…Teenagers sneer, 'Look at this guy! The legs! The ears!' And older people see my face and say, 'My god! Look, quick! A criminal!' ""

Karelin enjoyed reading poetry and literature as well as listening to music and keeping a generally warm composure. He was the definition of a gentle giant outside of his matches.

In the realm of wrestling though, his name was enough to make even the burliest men sigh anxiously.

The Russian Bear, Alexander Karelin: An indomitable grizzly bear on the mat and incredibly wise, tact teddy bear off of it.

…………………………………………………………………

EDIT:

Fixed a small part about Floyd Mayweather Jr.’s career. He was only undefeated in his professional fights, not his entire career.

EDIT 2022:

I wrote this in 2019 and it is just a joy to see people still coming back to this answer. I still love the sport a lot so it is nice to see people show respect to one of the greatest, most dominant athletes of all time across all sports.

Thank you for supporting my work!

Don\'t get hurt.\' With him, it\'s almost a victory if you don\'t get thrown.""\n\nYeah, could you imagine victory being equated to not being launched by your opponent? That his how utterly petrified people were about stepping on the mat with Karelin.\n\nTo this day, if someone mentions a Karelin Lift, they are talking about a Reverse Body Lock. He was so skilled at the move that his own name became synonymous with it.\n\nKarelin was one of the most dominant athletes in any sport ever. His long and victorious career is one that has yet to been matched.\n\nThere are not many athletes before or since Karelin’s prime that could be considered intimidating to the level that he was intimidating. Karelin struck primal, anxious fear into each and every one of his opponents without fail. The only equivalent I could draw for a wider audience to understand would be Mike Tyson; it wasn’t if you were going to lose but how fast you would lose and how much of a beating your body would take.\n\nFor these reasons, Alexander Karelin remains an incredible example of what dedication, skill, and genetics can do when coupled with a terrifying countenance and legendary status.\n\nOff the mat though, he wasn’t all that terrifying.\n\nKarelin was quoted as saying he didn’t much like himself before wrestling, stating that:\n\n“…Teenagers sneer, \'Look at this guy! The legs! The ears!\' And older people see my face and say, \'My god! Look, quick! A criminal!\' ""\n\nKarelin enjoyed reading poetry and literature as well as listening to music and keeping a generally warm composure. He was the definition of a gentle giant outside of his matches.\n\nIn the realm of wrestling though, his name was enough to make even the burliest men sigh anxiously.\n\nThe Russian Bear, Alexander Karelin: An indomitable grizzly bear on the mat and incredibly wise, tact teddy bear off of it.\n\n…………………………………………………………………\n\nEDIT:\n\nFixed a small part about Floyd Mayweather Jr.’s career.

Shruti Gupta,Updated 6y,Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of?,"Sushmita Sen is applauded for adopting two girls, at a very young age from around the world .

But have you heard of Ajeet Singh?

A person who adopted three children of a prostitute at 18, back then in 1988. After that he never looked back and to this day, he has rescued 1000+ girls from sex traffickers.

The world needs to know about him. Not because he needs any recognition but we need inspiration like him to restore our faith in humanity, to believe that humanity is still left, to have a hope of a better India.

Ajeet Singh was just 18 when he attended a wedding in his home town near Varanasi in 1988. It was here that he saw a nautch girl performing at the wedding.

“The way people were looking at her and treating her was something that shocked and deeply saddened me. It was then and there that I decided to do something to free girls like her from such a profession,” recalls Ajeet.

This was not just a passing thought that Ajeet had that day. When the girl finished her performance, Ajeet went up to her and asked if he could take care of her children and give them an opportunity to study and lead a better life.

Ajeet Singh was still in his teens when he realized what he wanted to do.

It wasn’t easy for an 18-year-old boy who was still in his first year of college to take on such a big responsibility. But Ajeet didn’t think twice and actually adopted the three children of the girl.

“Of course my decision was not welcomed by my family or society. I faced huge opposition from everyone. But this is what I wanted to do,” he says.

He then went ahead and started teaching the children in his spare time and helped them come up with life goals that would take them far away from the dark streets on which their mother lived.

In addition, he started going to the red light areas of Varanasi to teach the children of the women who worked there. But he soon realised that the problem was much more complex than he had thought.

Ajeet provides educational opportunities to the children of women who work in the red light area of Varanasi.

“The whole profession and system are so complex that providing mere education to the kids or spreading awareness about health, HIV, etc cannot solve it. The issue is slavery and the need to abolish the system of sex trafficking. It is only then that girls can be saved to lead better lives,” he says.

It was time to take a more aggressive approach, Ajeet thought. And this is when he started an organization called Guria in 1993 to fight against the sexual exploitation of girls, especially minors. What these girls needed was freedom and he was here to help them.

Ajeet prepared himself to take on the racket. He got a few hidden cameras—in his pen, shirt button, watch, etc — and started to pose as a customer, only to track the locations of red light areas and the number of minor girls there.

Once he had done the mapping, he collected a large number of volunteers and raided the Shivdaspur red light area of Varanasi. They managed to rescue 15 girls in one day.

Since then he has conducted raids on all the red light areas of Varanasi and rescued over 1,000 girls so far.

Ajeet organizes many campaigns and rallies to spread awareness about the issue of human trafficking.

Once the girls are rescued, they are sent to government shelters and homes and, after counselling, sent back to their parents. A close track is kept of their activities to make sure they do not end up back in the same situation again.

“Today, I can say Varanasi is almost free from child prostitution,” claims Ajeet.

After he started rescuing the girls, Ajeet decided the next step was to take on the pimps and brothel keepers who played a key role in the prostitution racket. “Even the police did not do anything and we thought it was time to bring this issue out in the open,” he says.

So, apart from rescuing girls, Ajeet started taking legal action against the sex traffickers. Through his organization, Guria, he has filed about 1,400 cases against traffickers and has even landed many of them in jail.

Guria’s work does not end with just filing cases against the traffickers. The organization also tries to ensure that those who have been convicted do not get bail. The team works intensively towards the bail rejection of such convicts—over 400 such bail requests have been rejected due to Guria’s intervention.

“Often, these traffickers who get bail come out quickly and start doing what they did earlier. We make sure they stay in jail for a long time. Some of them have been in jail for about four to five years now,” says Ajeet.

Another area of focus is to get the rescued girls to the court for trials. They are provided witness protection, helped with mock trials, provided counselling, and encouraged to speak up about the wrong that has been done to them. Over 108 girls are currently being protected and hidden at various locations to get them ready for trial.

Guria also helps in rehabilitating the rescued girls and teaching them various skills so they can switch to other professions.

Guria is working to prevent trafficking, especially of minor girls.

Educational workshops and awareness campaigns are among the other initiatives of Guria.

“Our idea is not just to provide one-time support. These girls are like our children. You cannot just provide clothing or just food to your children. You have to give them overall support. This is what we do for these girls,” says Ajeet.

Thanks to Ajeet, thousands of girls lead a better life today. Ishita (name changed), a 17-year-old minor girl was kidnapped from near her house in Varanasi in 2009. She was taken to New Delhi by the traffickers and was raped repeatedly by numerous men inside a locked room. She was then taken to Surat and was gang raped for several days. Ishita’s horror did not end here. She was then taken to Mumbai where traffickers planned to sell her to a third party. This is when the Guria team intervened and rescued the girl from the claws of the traffickers. They did not just bring Ishita back to her family but also got the lead trafficker arrested and made sure his bail was rejected. The case is under trial in district court.

What may appear to be a simple success story wasn’t easy to implement at all. Ajeet had to face challenges from all sides—from family members who went against him for choosing to work in this field to brothel keepers who would go to extreme lengths to make sure Ajeet did not succeed in his mission.

“I have been attacked so many times and given death threats. Even my family did not support me. A lot of people raised question about my work but I was determined to save the lives of these girls”, says Ajeet.

Ajeet wants to make sure that no girl is forced to enter the dark profession of sex trade.

Also, the network of brothels is so complex that many girls always speak in favour of the brothel keepers.

“They are brought up in that environment, they are scared and never speak against them. When it comes to minors, we do not listen to them and sometimes have to pull these girls out of the brothels,” he says.

With a team of 25 members and hundreds of volunteers, Ajeet continues his mission to eliminate this profession entirely from the streets of Varanasi. He gets support from CRY and individual donations, which help him conduct rescue operation and organise various workshops.

In the future, Ajeet wants to continue with his mission to make sure no girl is forced into this dark profession.

Pablo Emanuel,Updated 3y,What is your favorite sports photo?,"This picture, by Christopher Hanewinckel (USA TODAY Sports), of Shaunae Miller’s dive to win the 400m in Rio 2016.

When the competitors were announced, my daughter, then 11 years old, said she was rooting for Miller - “her hair is gorgeous!”. I explained she wasn’t the favorite to win, but, since she liked her so much, I’d root for her too.

At the finish line, noticing she was a few meters behind, Shaunae Miller realized that the opportunity of reaching the Olympic glory was much bigger than her own physical integrity, and decided to dive right into the floor of the Olympic stadium, and claim her gold medal.

To an ecstatic 11-year-old girl, that was the ultimate demonstration of what’s the Olympic spirit, a lesson that couldn’t possibly have been conveyed so perfectly. There was a powerful beautiful woman, great hair and all, teaching a little girl that you’re never the underdog if you have the heart of a champion.

Sean Kernan,Updated 4y,What were the worst athletic performances of all time?,"In Shizō Kanakuri’s defense, getting to the Olympics was difficult.

It was 1912, traveling from Japan to Sweden was no easy feat. He had to take the Trans-Siberian railway for 18 days in uncomfortable conditions.

By the time he arrived in the city, he was completely exhausted and needed several days to recover.

Then—he immediately developed food poisoning and diarrhea from the local food. He had trouble keeping food down and sleeping in the days before the race.

By the time it was his turn to go run a marathon, it wasn’t looking good.

The marathon began. He and the other runners began weaving the long 26-mile course.

Midway through the race, he felt weak. He collapsed. A local farmer found him on the side of the road, brought him inside, fed him, and brought him back to health.

He felt shameful for his weakness. (The old-school Japanese mentality ran strong in him).

He decided to just return home to Japan rather than finish the race.

The Swedish officials reported him as a missing person.

Meanwhile, Kanakuri was back in Japan, living his life.

In 1967, many years later, the Swedish athletic commission contacted him. They invited him to come finish the race.

Shizo accepted their invitation. This time he traveled by comfortable airline.

He then successfully completed the Marathon.

His time was 54 years, 8 months, 6 days, 5 hours, 32 minutes, and 20.3 seconds. (Source: Better late than never for Japan's first, ""slowest"" Olympian. The Japan Times. Edan, Corkill)

When asked about his time, he said,

""It was a long trip.

Neil Menon,Updated 4y,Why is the chase of 438 by South Africa against Australia considered so legendary?,"If at all there was an ODI that was played long ahead of its time, it was the 5th ODI between South Africa and Australia at the Wanderers on the 12th of March, 2006.

Australia smashed the then world record for the highest innings total in an ODI, 434, only to watch in horror as South Africa chased that down with 1 ball to spare.

438 still stands as the highest total ever chased down, almost 13 years on.

There was no T20 back then and scoring anything over 6 runs an over in a 50 over game was exceptionally challenging. For instance, take a look at the scores put on during the same series.

1st ODI at Centurion. Australia: 229/8, South Africa: 207/4 (SA won by 6 wickets by the DL method)

2nd ODI at Cape Town. South Africa: 289/7, Australia: 93 all out (SA won by 196 runs)

3rd ODI at Port Elizabeth. Australia: 254/6, South Africa: 230 all out (Aus won by 24 runs)

4th ODI at Jo’burg. South Africa: 246/9, Australia: 247/9 (Aus won by 1 wicket)

Not even one game with a score of 300 or more, and then, come the 5th ODI, the series decider, not 300, not 350, not even 400; but you have one team smashing the world record in the first innings only to have the chasing side smash that back to win the game and the series.

This was one for the generations.

To begin with, South Africa lost the toss and were put in to field first. However, Smith did say at the the toss that he’d have preferred to bowl first.

""Losing the toss and wanting to bowling first anyway and then with 10 overs to go and every ball is sailing over your head into row 20 or 30 you start to think, 'Well, that was a good decision, Smith',” South Africa’s captain for the game Greame Smith recalls.

""I remember walking past (wicket keeper Mark) Boucher at one stage and asking, 'Do you think they'll get 400? They can't, surely not'.

""It was a terrible day in the field, terrible, then getting off at lunch and knowing you've only got 15 minutes before going back out to bat and now you've got to contemplate, 'how do you do this?'

Ponting scored a career high of 164, powering Australia to an incredible 434/4 in 50 overs, and in all likelihood, a match and series win. (Looks like Ponting’s about to say “Fuck yeah!”)

But, no!

“It was Jacques (Kallis) that broke the ice in the dressing room,” Smith said.

As the South Africans sat there in the dressing room, heads hung, shoulders droopy, gloomy and despondent, with an almost insurmountable task ahead, veteran Jacques Kallis walked up the stairs, looked at everyone and said: “Guys, we've done a great job! I think they're about 15 runs short”.

Delivered in his usual, no-nonsense deadpan style, the bewildered South Africans cracked up. There was laughter.

The tension was broken.

To be honest, I think this was the best speech and one of the most inspiring words ever delivered in a cricket match! They’re 15 runs short!

""Then we set some targets, which also made a few people chuckle because we had never seen targets like this in our whole career,"" Smith continued.

""It was a magnificent pitch, the ball was sailing on the Highveld,"" Smith recalled.

The Highveld region of South Africa is the area near and around Johannesburg, that’s an elevation of 1500 - 2100 m. At this elevation, the cricket ball really flies!

Taking cue from the Australians, Smith and Herschelle Gibbs launched a stunning counter-attack as they put on 187 for the second wicket in about 23 overs.

Let that sink in. The year 2006. 187 runs. 23 overs.

Smith went for 90 off 55 odd balls, while Gibbs stood anchor! Usually, it’s the other way around, but here, the captain showed the way!

The moment Smith got out, Gibbs took on the aggressor’s role, slog sweeping the very next ball, off Michael Clarke, for a six, making his intentions very clear. There would be no slowing down, no matter what!

""From that moment he played some unbelievable shots,"" said Smith. ""We got ourselves into a position where we started thinking, 'Jeez, we can actually win this thing'.

Gibbs brought up his 100 off 79 balls, and was relentless after that.

(Gibbs’s century with a relatively new AB de Villiers)

Gibbs finally got out for 175 runs off 111 balls, with South Africa still needing 136 off 108 balls.

With Johann van der Wath’s absolutely necessary innings of a lifetime, 18 ball 35, followed by Roger Telemachus and Andrew Hall, and Makhaya Ntini’s (with two to win and 1 wicket in hand) cool-as-a-cucumber nudge down to third man to bring Mark Boucher on strike, and Boucher’s eventual straight drive to bring up the winning runs, South Africa pulled off the impossible.

.. the winning moment!

As the earlier matches in the series suggest and, sort of confirm, these were the days when scores above 250 were challenging in 50 over cricket, and here was a team successfully chasing down 434! I mean, scoring 400 in an ODI was unheard of back then, let alone chasing it down!

""I'll never forget seeing the replay of Makhaya's one down to third man from outside leg stump, thinking only Makhaya could pull that off,"" Smith chuckled.

With the scores tied, Boucher hit a boundary for the winning runs and an already delirious Johannesburg crowd exploded.

""That moment, in that stadium, the Bullring, was something I wish I could have kept with me right throughout my career,"" Smith said. ""The emotion, the crowd, what had been achieved was just incredible.""

I couldn’t agree more!

There were 42,000 people in a packed Wanderers ground, and they were treated to the greatest ODI ever played! You could see tears in the eyes of the fans soon after Boucher hit the winning runs! Here’s the final scorecard.

Given the era and the way the game was played, the circumstances, and all other parameters, a match like this is unlikely to ever happen again!

This game is legendary simply because it proves, beyond any doubt, that impossible truly is nothing.

Sean Kernan,5y,What are some remarkable displays of selflessness witnessed in sports?,"While Rick Hoyt's son, Richard, was in the womb the umbilical cord became wrapped around his neck.

This resulted in his being afflicted with Cerebral Palsy which left Richard almost completely immobile and required care for the remainder of his life.

Against the orders of doctors his father Rick chose to keep him at home and give him the best life he could.

When Richard was 15 he asked his dad, Rick, if they could do a race to raise money for charity for an injured athlete from his school.

He pushed his son in his chair for the entire race.

His son ended up loving it, saying that while they raced he felt like he could walk for once in his life, that he felt alive.

That was all that his father needed to hear.

This began a long tradition of running races:

Which included triathalons, in which Rick would put his son in a raft and pull him:

Carrying him to different vehicles for transport.

They have formed a legendary partnership that includes hundreds of races and 72 marathons.

There is now a statue of the two in Boston:

His father’s dedication to raising money and awareness for Cerebral Palsy, and above all, his dedication to bringing happiness to his son's life has always moved me.

Love Mishra,Updated 7y,Who is the best Indian in the Rio Olympics?,"Pullela Gopichand

He has trained PV Sindhu, Kidambi Srikanth, Saina Nehwal,Jwala Gutta for four different games.

During PV Sindhu’s semi final match. He told PV SINDHU that “ SHE has no Weapons” . Which gave her a confidence and she won the set with 11 straight points.

He helped Saina Nehwal in 2012 London Olympics to get bronze. In 2016 he improved his coaching skill by getting PV Sindhu a silver.

His own journey as a badminton player was quite tough that inspired him to help other players.

Gopichand’s last title had come 15 years ago, and after a bad Olympics campaign for him. He had been at his top form both game-wise and physically but had no support at Sydney 2000.

Pullelaa Gopichand playing with enduring pain and on plaster at the SAARC Badminton tourney on 28March 1996 at Vijyawada.

He had no coach to turn to. None there to comfort him or boost his confidence. His best chance of winning an Olympics was shattered ,so he made up his mind that he wouldn’t allow another Indian to feel that way in front of the world.

He got into coaching in 2004, and then became national coach in 2006.

He is the best person in RIO who is supporting our players .

Kevin Yue,5y,"Because of the massive outcry for equality between men and women, particularly about money, when are we going to see mixed-sex singles tennis (or, in fact, all sports)?","This is Serena Williams:

She is:

Arguably the best female tennis player still alive.
She has 23 Grand Slam titles, the second-most all time.
She spent over 3 years in the #1 spot.
The highest paid female athlete several years running

And, she lost a match to this guy, Karsten Braasch:

Lost badly. 6–1. It wasn’t even close.

At the time, he was ranked #203. He has never won a Master’s cup, much less a Grand Slam.

His assessment? Williams would have “no chance” against anyone ranked “500 and up.”

The answer to the question is “never.”

We will never see mixed-gender sporting events because the result would be females virtually exiled from sporting events.

Evolution gave men all the advantages in this particular field. Men:

Are taller (more reach)
Are heavier
Build muscle more easily
Have stronger bones
Have fewer organs and less fat (less excess weight)

Interestingly, because skill tends to follow a normal distribution, this means curves skew increasingly as you move away from the normal. In layman’s terms:

The more skilled both parties are, the more even slight disadvantages count against you.

Alex Cooper,4y,What are some recreational sports that absolutely terrify you?,"Wingsuit BASE Jumping.

He died how he lived. Looking ridiculous.

Race you to the bottom.

For those who find skydiving too dull and predictable, wingsuit BASE jumping sounds like the ultimate adrenaline rush.

It’s basically just jumping from a fixed object, e.g. a cliff, with a special suit that allows people to freefall for longer than regular BASE jumpers.

Compared to normal BASE jumping, wingsuit BASE jumping allows pilots to fly far away from the cliffs they jumped from, and drastically increase their freefall time before deploying a parachute.

Oh, and jumpers only carry one parachute (there’s only time for one attempt), so if the first one doesn’t deploy properly you’ll only have a few seconds to reflect upon your rapidly ending life.

How does the suit work?

The wingsuit flier jumps from a cliff, and within a split second, an intake fills the suit’s baffled chambers with air, turning them rigid. By holding a proper body position, the wingsuit flier is able to glide forward at a ratio of 3:1, meaning that he is moving forward three feet for every foot of descent.

Some wingsuit BASE jumpers have learned to control their flight so well that they can fly just metres away from terrain. This is known as “proximity flying.” The margin for error is, naturally, very small, and plenty of ex wingsuit BASE jumpers have learned to almost avoid terrain.

The wikipedia entry helpfully explains:

During the flight, hazards exists such as trees, rocks and the ground which must be avoided.

Well, the ground is only a hazard if you’re rapidly descending from a great height, and forget to/can’t deploy your parachute.

I’m happy with the ground. I’m going to stay there.

Is it that much more dangerous than skydiving, though? Yes.

The fatality rate for skydiving is around 1 death per 100,000 jumps and the average is skewed by experienced jumpers misjudging high-performance landings (swooping). Ignoring these competency-based breakdowns for a moment, performing 17 skydives in a year poses around the same average risk of fatality as driving a car 10,000 miles in a year. For BASE jumping it is closer to a roughly estimated 1 death per 500-1000 jumps so is, roughly, more than a hundred times more fatally prone to risk than skydiving.

(Wingsuiting Death and Risk Statistics
)

That’s got to be merely inexperienced and impressionable youngsters making up all the deaths though, right?

Well no, experienced jumpers frequently die too. Most of the sport’s trailblazers are, in fact, deceased.

The fatalties included both highly experienced pilots and others who were disturbingly unqualified. Unlike other high-risk adventure sports, wingsuiting didn’t seem to attach safety to skill. In fact, it was almost the opposite: the more experience you had, the more flights you logged; the more confident you became, the more likely it seemed you were to die.

(Has the world's deadliest sport become safer? It's complicated.
)

Without much regulation, the sport remains perhaps the world’s most deadly, and its target demographic yet need for intense training and experience doesn’t help.

The ideal wingsuit BASE jumper is someone who is very calculated and patient,” says Frat. “You have to be crazy to want to jump off a cliff, but you have to have enough logic-based decision-making skills to survive. This is a rare personality.”

The ideal wingsuit BASE jumper is, essentially, someone who wouldn’t take it up in the first place.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/z6vqklj0ftpciynh', 'title': 'What are some recreational sports that absolutely terrify you?', 'score': {'original': 0.49965, 'ai': 0.50035}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Wingsuit BASE Jumping.\n\nHe died how he lived.

Dominic S,Updated 3y,Do ordinary people underestimate the power of a professional boxer?,"Yes they have no idea how hard they hit. I boxed as an amateur and one of the pro boxers used to come into the gym to help us train. He was a welter weight so 147lb on fight night. So i’m guessing he walked around at 155–160lb and he was about 5′9″ tall.

In the gym this night was a huge guy and he was working on the bag. He was throwing decent combos so that he looked like he knew how to box and the room shook when he landed on the bag. When I say huge that’s not doing him justice. He was about 6′4″ and I estimate about 240lb of solid muscle, he had not an ounce of fat on him. The guy was built like Anthony Joshua but more on the athletic side i.e. not overly muscle bound. Well the pro boxer didn’t usually spar with any of us, presumably because it would be too much of a mismatch. But this night was different. He got into the ring with the AJ look a like and pretty much everyone who noticed stopped what they were doing to watch.

I knew the pro boxer was a decent pro but I figured he was so much smaller that he could get hurt in there because all the big guy had to do was land one shot due to the massive size disparity. What happened was awe-inspiring. It started off tentatively with the big man trying to establish his jab but the pro made it impossible because he started slipping left and right. The punches just slipped past him and at this point the pro was not throwing much of note. Then occasionally he’d fire a shovel hook to the body off a slip. He made it look effortless. He then shelled up and let the big man fire at his guard. The big man threw a combination of straights but they just got absorbed on the pro’s gloves. I thought he’d be able to blast past the gloves but that turned out to be not the case in reality. The pro just absorbed those shots on his gloves with no issue.

The big man started to look frustrated, his output started to die down but not before the pro started to turn the screw. For each straight punch that he slipped he landed a thudding body shot, he was really ramping up the power. Sickening body shots were landing unopposed with regularity. And his footwork was amazing. For each long shot that came his way if he wasn’t slipping them he was just taking a half step back to completely take the sting off the punch. And when he countered he was able to step into range at will and throw to the body with impunity.

It was now two minutes into the round and the big man had landed not a single decent shot. Just hitting gloves when he was allowed to but most of his shots were hitting thin air. By now most of us watching realised he was hopelessly out-classed and that his size meant absolutely nothing due to the vast chasm of skill on display. The pro had now started to sit down on his body shots which was pretty much all he was throwing and the big man looked to be crumpling. What was noticeable was that the big man looked really reluctant to throw anything because he knew he was going to ...

Doug Manning,1y,What if a boxer uses brass knuckles instead of gloves in a boxing match?,"It’s never been tried, for obvious reasons.

But if you want to have an idea of what the outcome would be, watch the infamous light middleweight match between Billy Collins and Luis Resto at Madison Square Garden in 1983.

Collins entered the match with a perfect 14–0 record and was widely considered a future contender for the light middleweight title. He was heavily favored over the journeyman Resto.

But the fight turned out to be a lopsided match with the underdog Resto pummeling Collins unrelentingly. Somehow Collins remained on his feet the full ten rounds, but his face was badly injured and one eye was swollen shut.

After being declared the winner, Resto approached Collins and his father — a former boxer himself — to shake their hands. When the elder Collins felt Resto’s glove, he knew something was amiss and alerted ringside officials. Resto tried to leave the ring but was stopped.

It was later determined that Resto’s manager, Panama Lewis, had removed significant padding from Resto’s glove, and had soaked the tape covering his hands in plaster of Paris — making Resto’s punches feel like concrete blocks.

Both Resto and Lewis were sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for assault. Collins suffered a torn iris which permanently blurred his vision and he was told he would never fight again. This led to a spiral of depression and alcohol abuse, and nine months after the fight Collins died in a car accident which many believe was a suicide.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ezdyfm67tkisglu8', 'title': 'What if a boxer uses brass knuckles instead of gloves in a boxing match?', 'score': {'original': 0.9839, 'ai': 0.0161}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It’s never been tried, for obvious reasons.\n\nBut if you want to have an idea of what the outcome would be, watch the infamous light middleweight match between Billy Collins and Luis Resto at Madison Square Garden in 1983.\n\nCollins entered the match with a perfect 14–0 record and was widely considered a future contender for the light middleweight title.

Manas Tripathi,Updated 6y,Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of?,"This guy -

Bunker Roy

In 2010 chosen as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by TIME magazine

He is the founder of the Barefoot College movement in India.He has empowered the people of a drought prone Tilonia and created a self sustained economy for the natives there.

The amazing things happening in Tilonia would leave you spell bound.

They produce their own electricity, via solar panels -

Manufacture their own lightning equipment -

The amazing fact is these awesome microchips and solar panels are developed by women who are either illiterate or have very little education.

This is the simple yet genius idea of Bunker Roy

Rob King,Updated 2y,"Has anyone ever heard of a boxing match that was so brutal, that neither boxer was ever the same afterwards?","The epic final fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier is the most famous example.

I’m sure many will detail that encounter so instead I’ll highlight another.

WARNING: If you’re sensitive to tragic stories please stop reading now.

This is the swollen face of ‘Irish’ Billy Collins Jr following his bout against Luis Resto on the 16th June 1983.

Twenty one year old Collins Jr came into the fight as a 14–0 (11) prospect while Resto, a seasoned pro, had a record of 20–8–2 (8).

The bout was on the undercard of a major world title fight at Madison Square Garden.

The image above is of Collins Jr being introduced - the man on the left is his father and trainer Billy Collins Sr.

Himself a former top level pro fighter, Collins Sr was the idol of his son when growing up; so he’d decided to help steer his son’s career personally.

The fight was fought at a good pace throughout with Resto dishing out a sustained beating.

In between rounds Billy seems shocked and at one point says to his father…

“He’s stronger than I thought, much stronger”

Collins Jr began to suffer unusually terrible facial swelling from round 3 onwards.

By the end of the 9th round Collins Jr’s face was grotesque mask. His father sent him out for the final round proudly telling him…

""You did good son. You're fighting your heart out""

Despite his terrible injuries Collins Jr hung in there firing back until the final bell.

After the decision was announced for Resto he went to the Collins’ corner to say a few words - as he left Collins Sr went to shake his hand.

That’s when Collins Sr noticed - Resto’s gloves were far too thin, far too empty!

Collins Sr held onto Resto, who frantically tried to pull away, while shouting at the officials.

“There’s no padding, there’s no padding in his damn gloves!”

Resto’s gloves were confiscated - they later found that a significant amount of padding had been removed by Panama Lewis (Resto’s trainer).

The fight was eventually ruled a no-contest.

Many years later Resto would confess that his hand wraps had also been soaked in plaster of Paris, causing them to harden into solid casts.

In 1986 Panama Lewis and Resto were sentenced to prison with both serving two and half years.

Carlos ‘Panama’ Lewis

Sadly that ‘justice’ came too late for Billy Collins Jr and his family.

Collins Jr suffered a torn iris during the fight leaving him with permanently blurred vision - he would never be allowed to box again.

In one cruel fight he’d gone from the verge of a world title shot and big paydays to unemployed with his dream in tatters.

Billy spiralled into a deep depression, losing several jobs, and turning heavily to drink and drugs.

Then just 9 months after the Resto fight.

Billy Collins Jr was dead.

Killed instantly from a drink and drug fuelled car accident that his father, and many others, believe was a suicide.

Collin Jr left behind a wife, a young child and a heartbroken father who never recovered.

Billy Collins Sr always maintained that ‘they killed my boy’.

Panama Lewis continued to train fighters until his death in Sept 2020, he just couldn’t officially accompany them to the ring.

Luis Resto was never again allowed a boxing license, although he actually applied several times after prison. Today he trains fighters but, like Lewis, he will never obtain a seconds license.

Resto’s life has been defined by that night.

Today he protests that he’s been overly punished for naively following his trainer’s plan.

Billy Collins Sr with Collins Jr

Collins Sr refused to answer his door when a documentary crew tried to interview him in 2011; he could only scream at them to go away.

Billy Collins Sr died a broken man in 2018.

It wasn’t just the boxers who were never the same after this bout.

That night changed the lives of many.

Five men were participating. From the United States, Apolo Anton Ohno; Ahn Hyun-soo from South Korea; Li Jiajun from China; Mathieu Turcotte from Canada; and from Australia, the…

Steven Bradbury.

Pause. First, here’s some context.

It was already a miracle that Bradbury had made it to the finals.

In the quarterfinals, Bradbury would have to compete against Ohno, who would eventually make it to the finals himself, and the Canadian Gagnon, who was the defending world champion. Only the top two racers of the quarterfinal race would advance to the semifinals. Bradbury finished third.

But, wait!

Gagnon was disqualified for obstructing another racer. And so, Bradbury advanced to the semifinals.

Bradbury talked to his national coach Ann Zhang before semifinals, and they devised a new strategy. Bradbury was one of the older racers, and he knew it. He wouldn’t be able to compete much with the fiery younger guys. The plan was simple. Bradbury would lag behind the lead racers, hoping that they would make a mistake, slip, and fall. He would have enough time to react, and because accidents like this aren’t uncommon in the final turn, the other racers would not be able to recover. The strategy would be all or nothing for Bradbury.

In the race, Bradbury was in last place, well off the pace of the medal favorites. However, defending champion Kim Dong-sung of South Korea, multiple Olympic medallist Li Jiajun of China and Mathieu Turcotte of Canada all crashed, paving the way for Bradbury to take first place and advancing him through to the final.

The strategy had worked! Bradbury would be going to the finals. But would it work in the biggest race? With the best of the best?

Now resume. Five men. 1000 meters. One race.

Race begins. The laps go by fast, and as planned, Bradbury lags behind them. As the race progressed his chances looked slimmer with each passing lap. Coming into the final lap stretch, Bradbury was this much farther behind than the rest of the racers.

Essentially no hope in winning for Bradbury unless…

The leading quartet rounded the final bend, Lia Jiajun tried an over-ambitious overtaking maneuver outside Apollo Ohno sending them both onto the ice and bringing down Mathieu Turcotte and Ahn Hyun-soo in the process. (Ohno!)

Bradbury saw his chance, and he took it.

While the other racers were on the ice still in shock of what the heck just happened, Bradbury was skating in for first.

In conclusion, Bradbury won the gold, being the oldest guy racing. What can you learn from this?

This is Cheddar, who is always so relaxed that he sleeps on his back.

This is Bandit, who is trying to get me to rescue him.

Rahul Chauhan,5y,Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of?,"Friederike Irina Bruning aka Sudevi Dasi, 60, is a German woman who has been living in Mathura since 1978 and runs a shelter, the Surabhi Gauseva Niketan, for sick cows. She is affectionately called German Maiyya (Mother).

Sudevi Dasi made India her home and stays in Radha Kund, Mathura for over 35 years, taking care of cows in need. Today she is a local celebrity and considered a mother figure for her exceptional service towards the holy cows.

Sudevi Dasi, the ace Gausevak’s Radha Surabhi Goshala provides home to the homeless and abandoned cows. It provides food for no less than 1200 cows every day and also provides medical aid for the sick, handicapped, and the injured cows. Radha Surabhi Goshala is situated in the Radha Kund, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh.

With a monthly expenditure of Rs.20 lakh and the abandoned and sick cows increasing, this initiative by Sudevi Dasi is like an oasis in a blazing desert for the cows and also the animal lovers. She has spent her own income from German properties and support from her father on serving cows. Other supporters also contribute to her cause.

She was awarded Padma Shri by Indian government in January 2019. I believe there is no reward that can match the service and dedication for welfare of Matashri Sudevi Dasi.

Yedu Krishnan,Updated 8y,What are some famous gestures of respect in sports?,"Stickcricket is a popular online cricket game, which is famous for outrageous batting options and high scoring chases. Like regular games of cricket, the batsman can be out in a variety of ways - bowled, caught behind, caught in the deep, etc. But Stickcricket's most famous and innovative method, is the Hit Wicket. If the bowler bowls a short delivery and the batsman misses it, he is hit on the head and comically falls on the stumps, thus getting out ""hit-wicket"".

​
(Bowler bowls a short ball)

​
(Batsman is hit on the head by the ball and collapses on his own wicket)

​
(The Hitwicket as often seen in Stickcricket)

On 25 November 2014, Australian batsman Phillip Hughes was hit on the head by a bouncer while playing a domestic match. He was immediately taken to a hospital in Sydney, but he never regained consciousness. He died of cerebral haemmorage on November 27.

After this particular incident, Stickcricket decided to remove its iconic HitWicket gameplay, since it closely resembles the incident leading up to Hughes' tragic demise. While it is clear that Stickcricket only put it up for comic value, its implications struck a little close to home. Stickcricket omitted the Hitwicket from its gameplay and passed a statement that it would never be used again, as a token of respect for Phil Hughes.

Stickcricket has also immortalized Phil Hughes by making him a permanent member of its All-Star XI. Thank you, Shyam Singh for pointing that out!

EDIT :

In the updated version of the game, every time a batsman reaches the score of 63, he pauses for a moment, looks up and raises his bat at the sky, acknowledgeing Phil Hughes' final innings.

Arpit Sharma,Updated 6y,Who are some great Indians that most people have not heard of?,"IPS Officer Gaurav Tiwari. (Batch 2010)

He is the man behind the busting of Axis Bank Hawala scam of Rs. 500 cr. in Madhya Pradesh after Demonetization. MLA from BJP & Minister of M.P. Government, Sanjay Pathak also came in this cyclone of scam. His Ministry is on stake right now. Several other big leaders of BJP are under suspicion.

Due to this, he was transferred from Katni district on 9th January 2017. After hearing about his transfer, people of Katni started the protest against State Government. More than 70% of voters of Katni are participating in this agitation. Three hundred thousand labourer have decided to go on strike from 2nd February if his transfer orders would not be cancelled.

The impact of protest is so huge that major publications from Europe published this story in their newspapers.

Women & children were in majority in these protests & agitation. Because this IPS Officer is also responsible for demolishing the racket of smack & other drugs which was prevailed in the district.

This has helped him gaining a huge popularity among the public here.

Madhya Pradesh has never seen such a huge popularity & fan following for an IPS Officer until now.

Recent news is Madhur Bhandarkar is going to make a film on him. Also Singham 3 could be made on his life story.

Truly a man with a lion heart !

Edit 1

Latest news om this scam is that Madhya Pradesh's CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan has said that this whole money laundering scam hs been given to ED (Enforcement Directorate). ED has filed 4 FIRs following this scam. Our CM said that because police force has limited & controlled authority, therefore ED will look into matter from now onwards.

And also, our state government has stated that the transfer order of this brave IPS officer is a routine administrative affair.

Matthew Bates,6mo,Why don't more men watch women's sports?,"I will speak for myself.

They’re boring.

Well, most of them are boring. So are most men’s sports.

However, every four years, I usually take the time to watch the women’s gymnastics and figure skating, when it’s at the Olympics.

I like watching those because:

They’re rare. I know they have other competitions throughout the other years, but I only care to watch the Olympics.
They’re nerve-wracking, in a good way, because they often are on the edge of falling. They keep me on the edge of my seat. They’re not boring.
There’s the chest-thumping American pride aspect to it, plus the respect for watching people from all countries who are at the peak of physical performance.
They highlight things that women are naturally better at, like flexibility and gracefulness. They’re some of the rare sports where men can’t out-compete women based on strength and size alone.
A lot of other people watch them. I don’t feel like the loser who is into something few other people really care about.

I live in Chicago, which has a WNBA team. I know that we have a WNBA team, because I listen to NPR, and they include the WNBA team in all of their sports coverage, often as the lead story. If you only listened to NPR, you’d think that the [looks up name of team] Chicago Sky were right up there with the Cubs, Bears, White Sox, Bulls, and Blackhawks as far as having a fan base.

The truth is that, even after being in Chicago for 17 years, the Chicago Sky, like every other WNBA team, only averages about 7,000 attendees per game, and gets barely any TV ratings.

I used to do lawn security for an outdoor music venue near Chicago. I was there for large crowds and, even if I didn’t care for the performer that night, just being in a large crowd had an excitement and energy all of its own.

Being in a small crowd in a place that you know was designed for a larger crowd has the opposite effect. I’ll never forget the night I was working when a traveling group of Chinese acrobats were performing. The acrobats were really good! I know this, because there were more security people there than there were people in the crowd, and we were told to go home, or stay and watch the show for free, but they weren’t going to pay us to do security for the 30 or so people who showed up. I opted to stay and watch for awhile.

I felt bad for the performers, though. And I felt awkward being there when so few other people were there. I ended up leaving early.

Even if a performance is exciting, and the performers are really good, a fan base has an energy of its own. People like being into things that other people are into. It’s really difficult to get people into things that already have a reputation for being unpopular.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/duwh7tn9j1qx5l8i', 'title': ""Why don't more men watch women's sports?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I will speak for myself.\n\nThey’re boring.\n\nWell, most of them are boring.

Sirpa Kulonen,5y,How many cats do you have?,"How many cats do you have?

I have three cats. They are all siblings. The two eldest are two years old and the youngest is four months younger. Besides them I have two dogs. They are seven and four.

Viiru (left) and Sohvi are two years old. Their little brother Masu (right) is four months younger.

I had three cats earlier in my life (before the dogs). Despite having the dogs I missed having a cat – they are so different. So I decided to take a cat. Just one.

Then I thought she might be lonely and afraid with the two big dogs. I took her brother, too. They had an accident litter in the same rural house four months later, and that’s how the “little brother” came into the house.

I’ve been happy with my decisions. All the animals seem to get along well, though the dogs chased the cats for the first two weeks. I don’t even know, if they understand that they are different species.

I’m 51 years old now and I hope that my cats live until I’m retired. I suppose I’ll never take a kitten again, because I guess I’ll be nearly 70 when my cats pass away.

Eleftherios Tserkezis,4y,What was the most dangerous Greek sport?,"Probably pankration (παγκράτιον), a Greek MMA of sorts.

The term comes from pās ‘total, all, everything’ and kratos ‘power, strength, force.’ The sport was first introduced at the 33rd Olympiad (648 BC), although Greeks attributed its invention to Theseus, Heracles or Hermes himself. At the 145th Olympiad (200 BC) child pankration was also introduced—it was the last addition to the Olympics before their abolition.

Pankration combined elements of both wrestling and boxing, which means kicks, punches and grips of all kinds could be freely used. You could also try to strangle your opponent, lock or twist his body parts, throw him down and hit him anywhere and any way you could. Only biting him and gouging out his eyes was prohibited. Broadly speaking, there were two styles: upper pankration (fight standing) and lower pankration (fight to the ground); the latter was more common.

Pankration had few official limits and rules. As far as we know, there were no weight or other categories—anyone could simply fight anyone. There were also no time limit, or number of rounds, or official way to determine victory and defeat other than one’s own acceptance of defeat—or their falling unconscious or dead. To accept his defeat, a pankratiast had to lift his hand and make the so-called apagoreuein sign.

As one can easily imagine, the sport was particularly dangerous, but also one of the most thrilling, spectacular and popular among ancient Greeks. Death was not rare, and the same goes for severe injuries. Here’s an example.

Arrhichion of Phigalia is said to have been one of the most popular and successful pankratiasts. At the final match of the 54th Olympiad (564 BC), he was locked with his opponent in a difficult position. The latter held Arrhichion down with his legs and was strangling him with his hands. Arrhichion then grabbed the man’s toe or ankle (accounts don’t fully agree) and dislocated it, causing him insufferable pain. The guy made the sign of surrender, but before they could disentangle their bodies Arrhichion died of suffocation. The Hellanodices decided to give Arrhichion the olive wreath post mortem.

Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,2y,Why did Neeraj Chopra dedicate the Olympic gold to legendary sprinter Milkha Singh?,"IN the year 1960 - Milkha Singh went to Rome along with a 40 member contingent to hope to win a Medal for India in Athletics.

It was there that he discovered How poorly off the Indian Athletes were compared to the Dutch or British or Swedish (Western) Athletes.

Milkha had to request sponsors to buy him a pair of Shoes.

India did not even have a Starter Pistol after one was damaged for 18 months during which time a Clapboard was used.

Milkha despite all this came 3rd in the Qualifiers breaking the National Record. He then came 2nd in both the next rounds of the 400m dash.

In the finals - he came fourth in a climatic photo finish.

After being unable to win a medal in 1964 in Tokyo

Milkha revealed that His only wish was to see an Indian Athlete get a Gold Medal in the Podium.

Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,2y,What are the learning points from Neeraj Chopra?,"#1 Confidence

He quietly told an Anchor at an awards event “Hindi main poonch lo bhai”. It was his response to a question in english without the slightest embarrassment. Now weve all seen Pakistan cricketers and even some Indian cricketers trolled for their english - Not one of them except Rashid Latif said “Hindi/Urdu main poonch lo” even to Indian or Pakistani commentators.

He doesnt care if he cant speak english properly

#2 Humility and Realism

“Can you win a medal for India”

Answer “Sir. Koshish to poore dil se karoonga” (Sir ill try my level best)

“How do you respond to Vetters remark that hes better than you?”

Answer : “Sir woh bahut behtereen khiladi hain, 90+ throws bahut kiye hain , ab sirf muqabla ke din pata chalega” (Sir hes a great player and has thrown 90+ many times so we’ll see during the actual event”

Meanwhile his friend Shivpal said “Sure both of us will win medals” and ended up not even qualifying

#Respect all your Coaches

Many trolled Neeraj as a Sanghi for not acknowledging his first coach - Naseem Ahmed.

Then Naseem Ahmed said “He called me on 7th itself and said did you watch the TV?? He thanked me on the same day and so did his father”

So he may be a devout Hindu but he didnt allow politics to interfere even though a lot of people tried their best to create a Hindu - Muslim angle","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ctuokz9nesp1wm7x', 'title': 'What are the learning points from Neeraj Chopra?', 'score': {'original': 0.9971, 'ai': 0.0029}, 'blocks': [{'text': '#1 Confidence\n\nHe quietly told an Anchor at an awards event “Hindi main poonch lo bhai”.

Jayesh Lalwani,Updated 6y,Why is Usain Bolt so fast?,"Usain Bolt is fast not just because he can run fast. He does run very fast, but that’s half the story. He is fast because he can run fast longer. To understand this, you need to understand the distribution of speed in a typical 100m race.

Winning a sprint is all about reaching your top speed quickest while maintaining the top speed longest. Bolt ran 100m in 9.58 s, this means his speed was 10.438 meters/second. That’s the average speed, which doesn’t give the complete picture. When any runner sprints, the sprinter accelerates from 0 to his/her top speed, maintains that speed and then decelerates at the end of the run. The top speed for any sprinter is obviously higher than the average speed. In Bolt’s case, his top speed was 12.195 meters/second. This itself is not extraordinary for Olympic level sprinters. What’s extraordinary about Bolt is that he maintained it for a full 30 meters. Most sprinters cannot maintain their top speed for more than 10 meters. Bolt is not extraordinarily faster than other Olympic level sprinters. He is fast for a longer duration.

That’s why you see in most of his races it seems like he accelerates in the last 40 m and then does a sort of victory dance in the last 20m. His acceleration is an illusion. He isn’t accelerating; the others are decelerating. Right around the 50m mark, everyone reaches their top speed, including Bolt. Around the 60m mark, everyone else slows down while Bolt keeps going. Right around the 80m mark, Bolt realizes that everyone else has dropped behind and he starts slowing down.

Julia Pugliese,6y,Why does Usain Bolt slow down at the finish line?,"There are a few theories.

During trials, preliminaries, and sometimes semi-finals/penultimates, athletes that are above their competition don’t want to fully exert themselves. The qualifying races are often consecutive, and they may have other events to do.

That’s likely why Usain Bolt slows down in qualifying races, but he also slows down in finals, which is probably what you’re talking about.

Some people think it’s just showboating. It would appear that way. At the recent summer Olympics, he decelerated before the finish line and smiled at the group of cameras.

Sponsors pay their athletes bonuses if they beat both personal and class records. Usain Bolt could’ve been trying to break his record millisecond by millisecond to get his sponsors to pay him more. As athletes get older, though, sponsors start paying them for getting x-number tenths of seconds away from their record.

The most important point was that he was offered a sick leave back to his home because of getting injured in the similar operation few days ago in J&k only but he refused the sick leave and volunteered for this operation.

When our Jat Brothers were doing public damage in parts of Haryana during JAT agitation he himself being a JAT was defending our land from intruders.

Rohit,2y,How has James Anderson managed to have such a long career whereas other bowlers his age are sitting home?,"Having a cricket career for 19 years and playing for 160 tests as a pace bowler is almost unprecedented.

Reasons-

First is due to his pace as it takes a toll on the body. He rarely touches the 140 kmph mark and mostly bowls around a comfortable pace of 130–135kmph. In his earlier days he was fast but not now. And most of the 140+ bowlers barely last for 12 years. Shoaib AKhtar-46 tests, Shane Bond-18 tests, Dale Steyn only managed to play for 11 years before getting injured, Mitchell Johnson played for only 8 years. Wasim Akram is an exception as he played for 19 years but still only 104 tests.

Second reason is his bowling action- One of the most perfect and smooth bowling actions of all times.

Notice that his back is not bending atrociously like many other bowlers ; this reduces the strain. In contrast Jeff Thomson had a very injury prone action for e.g

I can’t fathom the amount of side strain one would get.

Plus Anderson has a classic mid way action which is better than the side on and chest on actions. Next is his release-

His front foot and the release arm are just in line. If his arm was not in the imaginary line of the foot he would have to exert more force.

Moreover, look at his back foot ; it isn’t too straight and it hasn’t bent a lot either. This minimizes the impact when the back foot lands on the pitch suddenly.

And next is his follow through.

This follow through is so poised. Usually, express pace bowlers bend a lot more than James Anderson, but since he not that fast he is able to manage that.

Third reason is that he only plays tests since 2015. Normally fast bowlers get more injury prone from 32–33 onwards but Anderson stopped playing limited overs since then and that was a very smart move. Anderson has played 61 test matches in 5 years (excluding 2020) which means around 12 tests per year. This is not that easy considering the fact that ENG usually opts for 4 match test series and not 2–3, but still better than other bowlers, say Rabada who has played 183 matches (including T20i and IPL) in 5 years: 37 matches a year!

And finally even after all factors are considered Credit also has to go to Anderson’s unparalleled fitness and discipline levels. Maybe Stuart Broad would be the only one who will break his record in the near future, with respect to number of tests played.

Samir,Updated 2y,Which sport personality made a fortune from a completely different business rather than from the sport which they were related to?,"The third richest NBA player ever is a guy that you have never heard of.

He averaged 13 points per game, never made an All-Star team or won a championship and his highest salary was $300,000.

So how exactly is Junior Bridgeman worth $600 million?

Well he owes a ton of credit to Wendy Thomas. You have seen her red hair and freckles before. She's the namesake of one of the largest franchises in the world.

Junior realized he needed to prepare for a life after basketball, he wasn't even a starter, meaning endorsements were non-existent.

While most players spend the off season relaxing, junior was absolutely grinding, he studied law. When he wasn't studying, he was working at a local Wendy's in Milwaukee. That's right, an NBA 6th man taking drive-through orders.

By the time he retired, he already owned 3 franchises, soon this became 160, also 120 Chili's restaurants.

At one point Junior owned more Wendy's than any person in the world.

In 2016, he cashed in and sold all his franchises and bought Heartland Coca Cola in St. Louis and also in Kansas City, Missouri and a couple of more warehouses.

He's not an NBA player, he's just a businessman who played NBA when he was young.

My man said “this NBA shit is just a side hustle”🤑

Tushar Sharma,Updated 7y,What is the best inspiring story of a cricketer? And who is the most inspiring cricketer?,"I am not sure if this is the best, but this is damn inspiring. This guy is not one of those who didn't have money to buy kits and shoes, but still made it to international cricket, but did more than the needed struggle.

As they say, it is easy to get to the top of the mountain, but way too tough to be at the top for a long period of time. A lot of cricketers go from rags to riches with consistent performances. But there are some, who have are betrayed by their form, consistency and physical fitness, but still they make it to the top, not once but everytime. Yes it's the ace indian speedster, Ashish Nehra
:


​

I would like to talk about Ashish Nehra, the cricketer from Delhi who made his ODI debut in 2001 and bowled well to get a ticket to the 2003 World Cup, where his sharp bowling earned him his career best bowling figures (6-23) against England. But due to several injuries in back and ankle he lost his form and so as the place in the Indian pace battery.

After his recovery he was called back in March 2006, but still could not cement his place in the team. He was sent back and made a come back 4 years later in 2009 India's tour of West Indies, as a replacement for Zaheer Khan, which again was not so special tour for him.

For the 4th time, he was picked for the 2011 World Cup where he played a match which was not so amusing for the Indian fans. He had to defend 13 runs of the last over, but ended up giving 16 runs in 4 balls. The complete social media and cricket world went behind him with unending criticism. However his spell in the next match against Pakistan was a crucial one as India won the match. He was again challenged by injuries which made him watch the finals from the pavillion.

After recovery, he again anticipated a call for the 2011 series against England and Australia, as he achieved notable figures in the Ranji season that year. He said, he was ""deeply hurt"" by that.

But he kept hopes alive and worked hard to make a rocking comeback in IPL and in the T20 series against Australia. Superb line, challenging lengths, perfect pace, sharp swings and timely variations have made him now one of the most dependable bowlers this season for the team. He was so good this year that even Captain Cool (MS Dhoni) consulted him in a couple of matches. And his performance in World Cup 2016 earned him a place in World XI
. (Did we mention an Indian pace bowler in a world t20 team - when was the last time this happened?? )

Not to forget he is 37, the age when even spinners retire, and being a fast bowler he is still hitting the deck hard. He still stuns batsmen across the globe with his out going beauties. Hatsoff to this sportsmen. He has been in and out of the team for half-a-dozen times, but still giving his 100%.

​

​Salute to the seamer!!

Edit : Apologies for the stellone link. Attached that in haste. But Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan have rolled out statements that they are inspired from this guy. I think this man deserves more respect than what we give. Many such sportsperson go unnoticed.

Yanesh Bhushan Mishra,Updated 7y,What can we learn from P.V. Sindhu?,"Bingo !! She is a complete package and a total inspiring personality. Start from anything and we shall learn everything from her -

Forget the masses, get struck to your own dreams and capabilities since early days and ACHIEVE.

Getting awards from Indian Prez is not a daily soap ..

Quit luxuries ahead of your goals, they shall deviate you for sure.
Expectations from the least expected is the LEAST. (Who thought she would bring medal with Indians knowing Sania Mirza, Leander Paes, Saina Nehwal, Gutta Jwala, Abhinav Bindra, Yogeshwar Dutt etc )
A perfect guidance ought to make it count.
Aggression is your power when it comes to Sports (I guess everyone saw her face while playing her matches )
The true spirit of Humanity at every corners.

PV Sindhu shows her respect for the game by picking up Carolina Marin's racquet after Rio 2016 final

And lastly Do not kill the Dreams of a girl or the girl herself. She could be Nation's pride Some Day !!

Totally agree with this statement by Smriti Mandhana, who plays for the national womens cricket team.

Roland Bartetzko,2y,What are some easy ways to quickly improve my fitness?,"I had this problem two years ago when I planned on running a 51 kilometers ultra-trail marathon.

Two months before the run, I was completely out of shape. I had at least 10 kilos extra weight and hadn't run more than 10k a week on a treadmill in the gym.

My “get into shape fast” plan was the following:

I went to Germany and started a three-day hike in the mountains. Every day, I forced myself to walk at least 50k. After the first day, my legs were hurting so much, I couldn’t sleep.

I ignored the pain and carried on. Three days later, I had walked 155k, lost a few pounds, and felt tired but great.

During my test run.

Back at home (Kosovo), I immediately started cross country running. The first week I ran 50k, the second one 55, and so on. Two weeks before the marathon, I made a little test run.

I started very early in the morning for my first 51k run. Unfortunately, it was raining like hell and I lost the road. When I came home late in the evening, looked at my GPS watch: I had run 77kilometers. I was ready!

Dushyant Johar,Updated 7y,Which cricketer has the most inspiring story?,"You may have seen the stories of other top class cricketer's in other answers, here I revealed the childhood story of Ajinkya Rahane.

In a recent interview with Hindustan Times, newly appointed Indian Test Vice-Captain revealed his childhood story. He told that in his earlier days he used to wake up at 4 am to catch up the Dombivli Fast to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus for net practice at Azad Maidan.

Rahane has grown up in a modest family with an engineer father and a homemaker mother. During his childhood, he could not afford an auto-rickshaw to and from the cricket ground.

He said, “When I was very young, I could not even lift my kitbag. So my mother (Sujata Rahane) picked it up in one hand and held my younger brother Shashank in the other and the two of us walked to the nets. At times we ended up walking for 10 kilometers under the harsh sun. My mother then sat outside for three hours till I finished practice and then we walked back.”

Since the Indian right-handed batsman was very shy as a kid, so his father Madhukar Rahane joined him for karate classes. “I got my black belt First Dan at the age of 12 and I was the youngest in my training centre. I practiced karate till a few years ago and it has helped enhance my flexibility, stamina and mental toughness,” said Rahane. “Karate taught me to channel my aggression. During a martial arts exam, I once broke 50 bricks with my hands. Another time, 20 sugarcanes bound together were broken on my back and I smashed more than 15 tiles with my head”, he added.

It’s hard to believe but Jinx is aggressive as well. “I am aggressive from the inside. When I am batting on the crease, I am the boss. I want to dominate the quickest bowlers in the world, whether it is Dale Steyn in Durban, Mitchell Johnson in Melbourne or James Anderson at the Lord’s.” said Rahane.

John McGlothlin,2y,Was Muhammad Ali (Cassius Clay) really worthy of all the veneration he was given or was he just a bit over hyped and over rated in the field of real societal accomplishments?,"This talks only about Ali’s societal impact and accomplishments, and not his boxing resume, as the questions asks…

Paul Combs has done a great job of talking about Muhammad Ali’s Parkinson’s Center, and kudos to him for it.

I am going to add a bit of context outside that, in his historical resistance to the war, and his personal acts of kindness and charity, most not generally known…

CREDIT PICTURE LOS ANGELES TIMES AND BORIS YARO SHOWING MUHAMMAD ALI HELPING A MAN OFF THE LEDGE OF A BUILDING

Ali was a lot more than just a boxer…

As a human being, Ali also proved he earned the term the Greatest

He wasn’t perfect. His domestic life was chaos. He regretted his statements about Joe Frazier for 40 years. He regretted not supporting Malcolm X for over 50 years.

And yet, for social impact, and for social service, trying to do good, no athlete is greater than Ali…

In compiling a list of the greatest heavyweights, Tyrone Bruce said in ranking Ali first among greats:

“In terms of social and historical impact no one even comes close. “

Beth Dailey perhaps said it best about Ali and his greatness outside the ring:

“Ali … brought completely new dimensions to the sport and gave it a sort of aestheticism and a broader relevance that was without precedent.”

What made Muhammad Ali 'The Greatest' in the ring?

Ali’s opposition to the War in Vietnam was historically relevant, but more important is the fact that he stayed in the States, and risked 5 years in prison

Instead of fleeing the country - which he easily could have done. Any Muslim or African country would have granted him asylum, and probably most European countries as well, Ali refused to run away, and stayed to fight what he regarded was an unjust act in American Courts..

Ali, unlike the tens of thousands who fled abroad, stayed and fought it in the courts, and said he would accept the outcome, even if was prison.

His real relevance is summed up by a comment he made when asked why he stayed, instead of leaving the country, when it could results in prison for him.

Jerry Izanberg asked Ali:

“are you planning to join the swelling ranks of war objectors in Canada?

Jerry said he knew the answer even before an outraged Ali jumped down off the table he had been standing on, and roared:

“I thought you knew me better than that. America is my home. Do you think I would let somebody chase me out of my home? Nobody is going to chase me out of my birthplace. If they say I have to go to jail, then I will. But I'm not gonna run away, and you should know it.""

And he did stay, and fought and was vindicated by the courts in a decision that revealed the venal depths the Government went to in order to silence dissent...

A year later, looking back at how Ali was remembered

Ali’s interests outside the ring went to trying to improve the social ills of the world

Ali recorded two spoken word albums and a rhythm and blues song, receiving two Grammy nominations for his venture into artistry. He donated the profits to charity.

After retiring from boxing in 1981, at age 39, Ali focused on religion and charity, until his declining health prevented him from public appearances. Ali donated millions to charity organizations and disadvantaged people of all ethnic, racial and religious backgrounds. Ali helped to feed more than 22 million people afflicted by hunger across the world.

Among his many charitable efforts, Ali worked with the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Disease to raise awareness and encourage donations for research. In 1987, the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Constitution selected Ali to personify the the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Ali rode on a float at the following year's Tournament of Roses Parade, launching the U.S. Constitution's 200th birthday celebration.

In 2012, Ali was awarded the Philadelphia Liberty Medal in recognition of his lifelong efforts in activism, philanthropy and humanitarianism.

Ali’s cultural and social significance is best shown in 5 separate acts of randomkindness, out of the literally hundreds or thousands that he did

These five acts define who Ali really is, not the person you see on TV, but the real man behind the cameras and the headlines.

The act of kindness least known was Ali saving a Jewish Old Age Home from closure..

Jerry Izanberg, a sports writer who covered Ali his entire career, relates a story that really speaks to Ali as a human being:

“Three nights before he fought Earnie Shavers in the Garden, he was watching the TV news in his hotel room with his close friend and camp business manager, Gene Kilroy. They heard a story about a Jewish old age home in the Bronx. The elderly residents were about to be evicted into the snow and cold of December.”

Ali lept up from the television, and off he and Gene went, to save elderly Jews.

Jerry Izanberg goes on to relate that when Ali arrived at the old age home, and was referred to the Manager, he asked how much the home needed to stay open. Told it was nearly half a million dollars, Ali whipped out his checkbook.

Izanberg relates that Ali first sternly warned Kilroy:

“and don't tell nobody.”

Ali then handed the director two checks. The first was for $300,000. The second was for $150,000.”

Kilroy wryly told the Director as he looked at the checks:

“Hold the second one for a week so we can transfer the money.""

Ali literally took his purse from the Shavers fight and paid to keep an old age home open, and then insisted that no one talk about it, or release the information to the press.

A year later, looking back at how Ali was remembered

The second act of quiet kindness happened in 1967, as Ali returned from Germany

Angelo Dundee once recalled an incident that took place after Ali’s last fight before his almost 4 year exile in 1967.

On September 10, 1966, a young Ali defended his title in Frankfurt Germany against Karl Mildenberger as part of his ""European tour."" He was tired and stressed by a return to the USA to continue his fight against the military draft, but he won the fight nonetheless. In the 12th round, with Mildenberger on the ropes, referee Teddy Waltham stopped the fight.

At the airport the next day, Waltham’s fee of 1,000 pounds was stolen. Waltham, who was counting on the money to pay his mortgage and bills, was distraught. When Ali heard, he gave Waltham money from his own pocket to replace what had been stolen.

When asked about the incident, Ali shrugged it off, saying:

“man, don't make this a story, he needed the money more than I did.”

If it wasn’t for Angelo Dundee relating this story to Thomas Hauser, we would never have known it happened.

Then there was the kid in the hospital in 1975

Ali visited hospitals, nursing homes, and other places all the time, but one visit stands out in the mists of time.

In the 1970’s, Ali, much to Joe Frazier’s annoyance, lived in Philadelphia for three years. Ali was very much a part of his new home, trying to help calm racial strife at South Philly’s Tasker Homes, visiting nursing homes and hospitals, and hiring old fighters to work his camps.

Maury Z. Levy in a 1975 Philadelphia magazine article relates a story about Ali:

“One day he got into training camp at Deer Lake late because he heard a thing on the news about this little kid who had gotten his legs cut off by a train, He went to the hospital, unannounced, and held the kid in his arms and started dancing around. ‘This,’ he said, ‘is the Ali shuffle. And one day you’re gonna be doing it yourself.”

There was going out on a ledge, literally, to save someone else, and then asking the press not to make a story about him, but to credit first responders

The story of Muhammad Ali going out on a ledge, literally, to stop a man from jumping to his death is preserved forever by Los Angeles Times photographer Boris Yaro. On Monday, Jan. 19, 1981, Yaro was monitoring a police scanner in LA and heard a report of a suicidal jumper. His editor at the LA Times was not interested, but Yaro drove over to Los Angeles’s Miracle Mile, where the man had been reported on a ledge despite that,

There, Yaro found a young black man in jeans and a hoodie, on an office-building fire escape nine floors above the ground.

The young man, “Joe,” as he was named in reports, had evidently been up there for hours. The police at the scene said, “he seemed to think he was in Vietnam with the Viet Cong coming at him.” A crowd had grown, of course, on the street below, and was happily screaming to “Joe” to jump to his death.

Police officers, a police psychologist and a chaplain was stationed at a window close by, begging him to come inside. But Joe shouted, as he moved to the edge and hung out when it appeared someone was going to intervene:

“I’m no good, I’m going to jump!”

In a twist of fate, Muhammad Ali’s best friend, Howard Bingham, was there that day, and called Ali, who at that time was living in LA not far from the Miracle Mile. Bingham would later remember:

“About four minutes later, Ali comes roaring up the wrong side of the street in his Rolls with his emergency lights blinking.”

Boris Yaro watched in amazement as Ali talked briefly with the police, then saw the former champ run into the building. Yaro’s pictures, below, record the rest of the incident for history.

Ali, in a dark suit and tie, is seen leaning out of a nearby window, trying to see the young man threatening to jump. Just a few feet away, Joe is perched dangerously on the ledge, holding a pillar as he leans out over empty space.

By The Los Angeles Times’s account
, Ali leaned out and shouted to Joe saying:

“You’re my brother! I love you, and I couldn’t lie to you”

Dodging back inside, Ali found his way to the fire escape, came out, put an arm around Joe and lead him back inside. The two walked out of the building together, got in Ali’s car and drove, after a stop at a police station, to a nearby V.A. hospital.

Ali, deflected credit for saving the young man’s life, saying the first responders were the heroes.

A year later, looking back at how Ali was remembered

Then there was Ali’s trip to Bagdad in 1990.

Nothing sums up Ali's life, and who he was, than what he did in 1990. That year, Ali went to Bagdad as the first Gulf War was looming, to try and free 15 American hostages being held by Saddam Hussein.

Ali, already badly ill with Parkinson's, ran out of his medications while in Bagdad, and endured very real suffering, yet refused to leave, and persevered until Saddam allowed him to take all 15 American hostages home to their families.

But Saddam did not want to give up the hostages, who he was using for human shields, literally being chained to the doors of factories and military bases, so the Dictator declined to meet with the ill Ali, thinking he would have to go home without his medications.

But Ali would not leave, and his health grew worse.

Other Arab countries, worried that something might happen to the world’s most famous Muslim, increasingly pressured Saddam to give him something, and get him to go home before something bad happened.

Saddam, to appease other Muslim countries, finally publicly met with Ali to give him a few of the hostages, to satisfy the other Islamic countries and get Ali to go home before something happened. But before Saddam could announce it, Ali thanked him for agreeing, like a good Muslim, to release all those in the custody to him. Saddam, with the media taking down every word, reluctantly ordered the release of them all.

On Dec. 2, 1990, Ali and the hostages flew out of Baghdad, headed for JFK.

The 15 men remain overwhelmed to this day.

Former hostage Bobby Anderson remembers:

“You know, I thanked him, and he said, ‘Go home,’ be with my family . . . what a great guy”

Ali again asked the media not to make the story about him, but about the hostages and their reunited families.

The New York Times, after Ali rescued the 19 hostages in Iraq in 1990, said:

“however great he was in the Ring, Ali is greater as a human being. Despite being ill, the Champ has given millions of his own money, raised tens of millions more for charity, to feed people, for medical treatment, and perhaps most importantly for a man who is ill, he donates his time to help others. His recent trip to Iraq to rescue hostages held there, during which he ran out of medications he must take, and which caused him considerable suffering, is an example of one man reaching out to help others with no regard for his own health or safety”

And for the haters who keep trying to paint Ali as a racist, all but one of the hostages were white…

Ali spent almost 40 years trying to apologize to Joe Frazier

in explaining why he made his opponents into villains, Ali wrote about meeting Gorgeous George, and liking how “rasslers” promoted fights:

“I decided that could work for boxing too. I didn't realize that not everyone was going to like playing a role in my show. I am truly sorry for hurting Joe and have told he and his family so.""

Ali realized that promoting fights as a clean cut kid who won the Olympics was not enough, his wholesome life and character which simply did not present much for a drama.

Sonny Liston said :

“A boxing match is like a cowboy movie. There's got to be good guys and there's got to be bad guys. And that's what people pay for - to see the bad guys get beat.""

So Ali, like ‘rasslets” made his matches a morality show, the good guy against the bad guys. But not everyone enjoyed being cast in a role in his dramas, Joe Frazier, most of all.

Ali said it best:

“I’'m sorry Joe Frazier is mad at me. I'm sorry I hurt him. Joe Frazier is a good man, and I couldn't have done what I did without him, and he couldn't have done what he did without me. And if God ever calls me to a holy war, I want Joe Frazier fighting beside me.""

Ali tried, on many occasions, to mend the rift with Joe. When Joe was dying, Muhammad visited him and for the last time asked his forgiveness. (He told Joe he wasn’t leaving till Joe forgave him! And Joe finally did forgive him, and his son Marvis feels he was at peace with the past when he died)

In September of 2015, after Joe Frazier was long gone from this world, the City of Philadelphia, thanks mostly to Larry Holmes and Bernard Hopkins, finally put up a long overdue statue of Joe Frazier in Philadelphia, and Ali’s business manager, Gene Kilroy went to the ceremony. He and Marvis Frazier, Joe’s oldest son, then went to Frazier’s grave and laid a wreath inscribed with a message from Ali.

The wreath and message from Ali said:

“To Joe Frazier from Muhammad Ali, Rest in peace, Joe, until we meet again. Next time we’re not going to fight, we’re just going to hug each other.”

Amen to two great champions, hopefully happier in a better place…

And that was the real Muhammad Ali, who did deserve the veneration he got for his acts of charity and kindness outside the ring…

Robert Lipsyte, who spent a large part of his life chronicling Ali’s says any claim that Ali was doing it for acclaim was, even if true, only possible one part of why he would try to talk a man off a ledge.:

“The other part was he was capable of acts of kindness; almost casual acts of kindness,”

Lisyte believed Ali showed up to the office building that day to save a man on a ledge, or saved a Jewish Old Age home, not only because he thought he could help but because he wanted to.:

“In some sort of ways, he talked a lot of people off the ledge, I think about a guy who made people brave. That’s what he did.”

Told it was nearly half a million dollars, Ali whipped out his checkbook.\n\nIzanberg relates that Ali first sternly warned Kilroy:\n\n“and don\'t tell nobody.”\n\nAli then handed the director two checks.

When Ali heard, he gave Waltham money from his own pocket to replace what had been stolen.\n\nWhen asked about the incident, Ali shrugged it off, saying:\n\n“man, don't make this a story, he needed the money more than I did.”\n\nIf it wasn’t for Angelo Dundee relating this story to Thomas Hauser, we would never have known it happened.\n\nThen there was the kid in the hospital in 1975\n\nAli visited hospitals, nursing homes, and other places all the time, but one visit stands out in the mists of time.\n\nIn the 1970’s, Ali, much to Joe Frazier’s annoyance, lived in Philadelphia for three years. Ali was very much a part of his new home, trying to help calm racial strife at South Philly’s Tasker Homes, visiting nursing homes and hospitals, and hiring old fighters to work his camps.\n\nMaury Z. Levy in a 1975 Philadelphia magazine article relates a story about Ali:\n\n“One day he got into training camp at Deer Lake late because he heard a thing on the news about this little kid who had gotten his legs cut off by a train, He went to the hospital, unannounced, and held the kid in his arms and started dancing around. ‘This,’ he said, ‘is the Ali shuffle.

On Monday, Jan. 19, 1981, Yaro was monitoring a police scanner in LA and heard a report of a suicidal jumper. His editor at the LA Times was not interested, but Yaro drove over to Los Angeles’s Miracle Mile, where the man had been reported on a ledge despite that,\n\nThere, Yaro found a young black man in jeans and a hoodie, on an office-building fire escape nine floors above the ground.\n\nThe young man, “Joe,” as he was named in reports, had evidently been up there for hours.

But Joe shouted, as he moved to the edge and hung out when it appeared someone was going to intervene:\n\n“I’m no good, I’m going to jump!”\n\nIn a twist of fate, Muhammad Ali’s best friend, Howard Bingham, was there that day, and called Ali, who at that time was living"", 'result': {'fake': 0.5652, 'real': 0.4348}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""in LA not far from the Miracle Mile.

Yaro’s pictures, below, record the rest of the incident for history.\n\nAli, in a dark suit and tie, is seen leaning out of a nearby window, trying to see the young man threatening to jump. Just a few feet away, Joe is perched dangerously on the ledge, holding a pillar as he leans out over empty space.\n\nBy The Los Angeles Times’s account\n, Ali leaned out and shouted to Joe saying:\n\n“You’re my brother! I love you, and I couldn’t lie to you”\n\nDodging back inside, Ali found his way to the fire escape, came out, put an arm around Joe and lead him back inside. The two walked out of the building together, got in Ali’s car and drove, after a stop at a police station, to a nearby V.A. hospital.\n\nAli, deflected credit for saving the young man’s life, saying the first responders were the heroes.\n\nA year later, looking back at how Ali was remembered\n\nThen there was Ali’s trip to Bagdad in 1990.\n\nNothing sums up Ali's life, and who he was, than what he did in 1990. That year, Ali went to Bagdad as the first Gulf War was looming, to try and free 15 American hostages being held by Saddam Hussein.\n\nAli, already badly ill with Parkinson's, ran out of his medications while in Bagdad, and endured very real suffering, yet refused to leave, and persevered until Saddam allowed him to take all 15 American hostages home to their families.\n\nBut Saddam did not want to give up the hostages, who he was using for human shields, literally being chained to the doors of factories and military bases, so the Dictator declined to meet with the ill Ali, thinking he would have to go home without his medications.\n\nBut Ali would not leave, and his health grew worse.\n\nOther Arab countries, worried that something might happen to the world’s most famous Muslim, increasingly pressured Saddam to give him something, and get him to go home before something bad happened.\n\nSaddam, to appease other Muslim countries, finally publicly met with Ali to give him a few of the hostages, to satisfy the other Islamic countries and get Ali to go home before something happened. But before Saddam could announce it, Ali thanked him for agreeing, like a good Muslim, to release all those in the custody to him. Saddam, with the media taking down every word, reluctantly ordered the release of them all.\n\nOn Dec. 2, 1990, Ali and the hostages flew out of Baghdad, headed for JFK.\n\nThe 15 men remain overwhelmed to this day.\n\nFormer hostage Bobby Anderson remembers:\n\n“You know, I thanked him, and he said, ‘Go home,’ be with my family . . . what a great guy”\n\nAli again asked the media not to make the story about him, but about the hostages and their reunited families.\n\nThe"", 'result': {'fake': 0.1568, 'real': 0.8432}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'New York Times, after Ali rescued the 19 hostages in Iraq in 1990, said:\n\n“however great he was in the Ring, Ali is greater as a human being.

His recent trip to Iraq to rescue hostages held there, during which he ran out of medications he must take, and which caused him considerable suffering, is an example of one man reaching out to help others with no regard for his own health or safety”\n\nAnd for the haters who keep trying to paint Ali as a racist, all but one of the hostages were white…\n\nAli spent almost 40 years trying to apologize to Joe Frazier\n\nin explaining why he made his opponents into villains, Ali wrote about meeting Gorgeous George, and liking how “rasslers” promoted fights:\n\n“I decided that could work for boxing too. I didn\'t realize that not everyone was going to like playing a role in my show. I am truly sorry for hurting Joe and have told he and his family so.""\n\nAli realized that promoting fights as a clean cut kid who won the Olympics was not enough, his wholesome life and character which simply did not present much for a drama.\n\nSonny Liston said :\n\n“A boxing match is like a cowboy movie. There\'s got to be good guys and there\'s got to be bad guys. And that\'s what people pay for - to see the bad guys get beat.""\n\nSo Ali, like ‘rasslets” made his matches a morality show, the good guy against the bad guys. But not everyone enjoyed being cast in a role in his dramas, Joe Frazier, most of all.\n\nAli said it best:\n\n“I’\'m sorry Joe Frazier is mad at me. I\'m sorry I hurt him. Joe Frazier is a good man, and I couldn\'t have done what I did without him, and he couldn\'t have done what he did without me. And if God ever calls me to a holy war, I want Joe Frazier fighting beside me.""\n\nAli tried, on many occasions, to mend the rift with Joe.

Any Muslim or African country would have granted him asylum, and probably most European countries as well, Ali refused to run away, and stayed to fight what he regarded was an unjust act in American Courts..\n\nAli, unlike the tens of thousands who fled abroad, stayed and fought it in the courts, and said he would accept the outcome, even if was prison.\n\nHis real relevance is summed up by a comment he made when asked why he stayed, instead of leaving the country, when it could results in prison for him.\n\nJerry Izanberg asked Ali:\n\n“are you planning to join the swelling ranks of war objectors in Canada?\n\nJerry said he knew the answer even before an outraged Ali jumped down off the table he had been standing on, and roared:\n\n“I thought you knew me better than that.

Mark McRae,4y,How much better are pros than other people at sports?,"The summer before the 80–81 NBA season, Tiny Archibald was in the Mitchell community center gym every day working out to be ready for pre season basketball.

I worked in the gym as a senior counselor, and because we had a full, regulation sized, competition quality basketball court, we would play ball with any down time the staff had.

One afternoon, Tiny was working out on one end of the full court, and some of the staff and I were on the other. Playing half court 21.

The guys playing on the court with me were all tall guys. Our center director, we’ll call him Jim for the purpose of this story, was the only person on the court shorter than Tiny.

Tiny waits on the side till someone calls game, and then comes on the court. We start another game of twenty one, which is every man for himself, winner has to score 21 points. Two points from the field, one point from the line.

As the game progresses, it seems to me, that I could probably play in the NBA. After all I’m holding my own with Tiny Archibald, already a legend in the league, and it doesn’t seem as if I can’t score at will on him, or post him up down low when I get ready.

Now by this time my head is swelling up pretty big, and as Tiny goes around me for a lay up, I get the idea to block his shot, pinning it to the glass to show him that this is my house and I run shit here.

I touched the ball, but couldn’t get the stick, and then, something changed. Suddenly it was as if Tiny was the Flash.

He was faster, he was stronger, he shot far more accurately, and compiled twenty one points without allowing ANY of us to touch the ball again.

As for me personally,he busted my ass.

He would come down the lane crossing over as he came,looking me in the face, and fake me out of my shorts. If I pressed close, he’d go right around me as If I was standing still. If I defended the lane, he’d stop on a dime, pull a step back jumper that would hit nothing but net every time.

And he did all of this, smiling, making it look effortless.

Taught me a lot that afternoon. I learned that as a basketball player, I’m a great drummer.

CREDIT PICTURE FIGHT CITY

But if he hit on the break, if he failed to follow the referee’s instructions, that may invalidate his protections as a licensed fighter.

If a professional fighter dies in a ring, is it considered a murder? Would his opponent go to jail? (Video)

There have certainly been cases where one boxer died, and the other was charged criminally.

In 1930, Max Baer was charged with manslaughter when Frankie Campbell died after a legal and licensed match.

Max Baer was another fighter who was inconsolable after killing a man in the ring. Baer fought Frankie Campbell on August 25, 1930, in San Francisco in a ring built over home plate at San Francisco's Recreation Park for the unofficial title of Pacific Coast champion. In the second round, Campbell caught Baer, who tripped and slipped to the canvas.

Campbell went toward his corner and hot dogging, waved to the crowd. He thought Baer would receive a 10 count. Baer got up and flew at Campbell, landing a right to Campbell's turned head which sent him to the canvas.

After the round, Campbell said to his trainer, ""Something feels like it snapped in my head"", but went on to win the next two rounds. As Baer rose for the 5th round, Tillie ""Kid"" Herman, Baer's former friend and trainer, who had left him without notice and was now in Campbell's corner, was mocking Baer.

The enraged Baer then really went after Campbell, and had Campbell against the ropes. As he battered him with punch after punch, the ropes were the only thing holding Campbell up. By the time referee Toby Irwin stopped the fight, Campbell collapsed to the canvas. Baer's own seconds reportedly ministered to Campbell, and Baer stayed by his side until an ambulance finally came a half an hour later.

Baer ""visited the stricken fighter's bedside"", where he offered Frankie's wife Ellie the hand that hit her husband. She took that hand and the two stood sad and speechless for a moment. ""It was unfortunate, I'm awfully sorry"", said Baer. ""It even might have been you, mightn't it?"" she replied.

At 12:00pm the next day, with a lit candle placed between his crossed fingers, and his wife and mother beside him, Frankie Campbell was declared dead. Upon the surgeon's announcement of Campbell's death, Baer broke down and sobbed like a little child. Brain specialist Dr. Tilton E. Tillman ""declared death had been caused by a succession of blows on the jaw and not by any struck on the rear of the head"", and that Campbell's brain had been ""knocked completely loose from his skull"" by Baer's blows.

Baer was ultimately cleared criminally, but he never was the same again. The California State Boxing Commission still banned him from any in-ring activity within the state for the next year.

In a story in the New York Daily News, Max Baer Jr. said of his dad's depiction in the movie Cinderella Man, ""That's a lie. My father cried about what happened to Frankie Campbell. He had nightmares. He helped put Frankie's children through college."" Indeed, Baer helped support Campbell's family for the rest of his life.

Another good example is Sugar Ray Robinson and Jimmy Doyle.

In June 1947, while he was fighting as a welterweight, after four non-title bouts, Robinson was scheduled to defend his title for the first time against Jimmy Doyle. Robinson had a terrible dream in which he was warned he would kill Doyle, and Ray got up the next day and refused to fight. His manager sent him to a priest and a minister who managed to convince him that such dreams had no power.

Unfortunately, in this case, his dream proved true. On June 25, 1947 Robinson dominated Doyle and scored a decisive knockout in the eighth round that knocked Doyle unconscious and resulted in Doyle's death later that night.

Robinson said that the impact of Doyle's death was something he never fully recovered from.

After Doyle died, authorities in Cleveland threatened criminal charges up to and including murder, though in the end, none actually were filed.

Robinson's biographer Wil Haygood stated during a September 25, 2010 book festival appearance that Doyle was pushing himself to fight to ""buy his mother a house,"" and after Doyle's death in 1947, Robinson gave the earnings of his next four fights to Doyle's mother, so she was able to buy the house.""

Jake LaMotta, who knew Robinson well, said ""Jimmy Doyle never really left him.""

Gay taunts got Kid Paret killed live on national television

Emile Griffith had lost his world title to Paret seven months previously. The Cuban had upset Griffith at the weigh-in to that bout by taunting him as a maricón [“faggot”.] In boxing’s macho world there could be no greater insult – especially when it was an open secret that Griffith was “different.”

Griffith was about to step off the scales when he heard his trainer Gil Clancy call out “Hey, watch it!” A smirking Paret was pretending to have anal intercourse with him as his trainers whooped hysterically. He waggled a finger at Griffith. “Hey maricón,” Paret said in a high lisp, “I’m gonna get you and your husband.”

Emile Griffith was gay at a time when homosexuality was considered filthy, a disease, condemned as a sin and classified as a crime. Even consensual sex between two adult men could result in their going to jail for years. Homosexuality was a criminal act in every state of America, except in Illinois. The American Medical Association, classified homosexuality as a “psychiatric disorder.”

The night before the fight, Paret called his wife and told her his head was killing him, and she begged him to call off the fight. He did not, and his fate was sealed.

In the 12th round, Griffith repaid Paret for every snear and slur by literally holding him up in the corner, while pouring a savage beating on. Referee Ruby Goldstein, stunned by the ferocity of the beating, lept in and tried to stop Griffith, but the damage was done by 29 straight unanswered punches.

Griffith was never criminally charged, but harbored enormous guilt over Paret’s death. During the making of Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story, in 2005, Griffith, is introduced to Paret's son. 33 years after the father’s death, the son embraced Griffith, and told him he was forgiven.

Shortly after that, Griffith slipped into pugilistic dementia, which ultimately killed him.

The night boxer Emile Griffith answered gay taunts with a deadly cortege of punches

And then, there is Ezzard Charles and Sam Baroudi.

February 20, 1948 marked the day Ezzard Charles struck the blow which killed a man the following morning. Sam Baroudi was 41-11-2, 21 KOs, one of the toughest journeymen of his time and fought anyone who would face him at middle and light heavyweight. He was stopped only once in the fight that killed him. Baroudi died at age 21…and Charles was never the same.

Baroudi fell into a coma just as the referee counted 10 in his fight with Charles, the first time he had ever been counted out. Taken by ambulance to Cook County Hospital, Charles and manager Jake Mintz rushed after the ambulance, both men keeping an all-night vigil. Baroudi never regained consciousness, and died of a brain hemorrhage in the early hours of the morning of February 21, 1948.

Charles, a gentle soul out of the ring, never fully recovered from Baroudi's death.

Eerily, Baroudi himself had killed a man in much the same circumstances a year before. He knocked out light heavy Newton Smith in the 9th round on August 15, 1947. Smith collapsed and was rushed to the hospital, where he died of massive brain trauma.

We can go on and on. Over 500 men have died in the ring since the Marquis of Queensberry rules went into effect. Ray ""Boom Boom"" Mancini never got over the death of Duk Koo Kim.

But things never change.

Baroudi was said to be haunted by Smith’s death, and remarked repeatedly he wished it had been him.

A year later it was.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cxgktzov5qrsweja', 'title': 'If a professional boxer kills another professional boxer in the ring (obviously without the intention to do it), what punishment will he get?', 'score': {'original': 0.65153333333333, 'ai': 0.34846666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'If there are no exacerbating circumstances, he should get no punishment, other than what his own conscience will give him - and that is plenty...\n\nCREDIT PICTURE FIGHT CITY\n\nBut if he hit on the break, if he failed to follow the referee’s instructions, that may invalidate his protections as a licensed fighter.\n\nIf a professional fighter dies in a ring, is it considered a murder?

During the making of Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story, in 2005, Griffith, is introduced to Paret\'s son. 33 years after the father’s death, the son embraced Griffith, and told him he was forgiven.\n\nShortly after that, Griffith slipped into pugilistic dementia, which ultimately killed him.\n\nThe night boxer Emile Griffith answered gay taunts with a deadly cortege of punches\n\nAnd then, there is Ezzard Charles and Sam Baroudi.\n\nFebruary 20, 1948 marked the day Ezzard Charles struck the blow which killed a man the following morning. Sam Baroudi was 41-11-2, 21 KOs, one of the toughest journeymen of his time and fought anyone who would face him at middle and light heavyweight. He was stopped only once in the fight that killed him. Baroudi died at age 21…and Charles was never the same.\n\nBaroudi fell into a coma just as the referee counted 10 in his fight with Charles, the first time he had ever been counted out. Taken by ambulance to Cook County Hospital, Charles and manager Jake Mintz rushed after the ambulance, both men keeping an all-night vigil. Baroudi never regained consciousness, and died of a brain hemorrhage in the early hours of the morning of February 21, 1948.\n\nCharles, a gentle soul out of the ring, never fully recovered from Baroudi\'s death.\n\nEerily, Baroudi himself had killed a man in much the same circumstances a year before. He knocked out light heavy Newton Smith in the 9th round on August 15, 1947. Smith collapsed and was rushed to the hospital, where he died of massive brain trauma.\n\nWe can go on and on. Over 500 men have died in the ring since the Marquis of Queensberry rules went into effect. Ray ""Boom Boom"" Mancini never got over the death of Duk Koo Kim.\n\nBut things never change.\n\nBaroudi was said to be haunted by Smith’s death, and remarked repeatedly he wished it had been him.\n\nA year later it was.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.65153333333333
Ahmed Hussain,Updated 1y,Who was the hardest puncher in boxing during Muhammad Ali's era?,"Edit: Thanks for 500 upvotes!

It was Earnie Shavers, no question. His overhand right was the Tsar Bomba of punches. That thing would hit your chin and temporarily knock your soul into Justin Bieber's concert for about 10 seconds until the ref is forced to wake you up. He makes men like Francis Ngannou and Deontay Wilder look feather fisted.

He nearly punched off Norton's head and nearly killed an aged Ali in certain moments. It took Ali's chin and heart to survive 15 rounds. It's interesting to note that Shavers is the only man to hurt Muhammad Ali with a right hand punch.

This man's punch would knockout a silverback gorilla.

What's also interesting is that George Foreman and Joe Frazier did not fight him. Not to say they ducked, I don't know. But it's surprising regardless. They have a good chance of beating him but didn't fight him.

Quotes:

(Watch John Wick and see Viggo punching his son, it probably looked like that when Stallone took a hit from Shavers.)

(The above photo is not heavyweight boxer Tex Cobb.)

Deepak Mehta,5y,Can you be a feminist and watch only men’s sports?,"Let me ask you a few counter-questions:

Can you support LGBT rights and still be a heterosexual, cisgender male?
Can you be in a monogamous relationship but defend people’s rights to reject the conventional notions of marriage and courtship?
Can you be black and racist?

The answer to all 4 questions (including the one this is in response to) is “Yes”.

And the underlying philosophy is the same - “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”

Freedom of speech doesn’t mean you agree with everything people say. Freedom of expression doesn’t say that you need to partake in everyone else’s customs and celebrations. Feminism doesn’t mean that men and women are equal in every respect, but that they have equal rights and should not be discriminated against purely based on their gender.

As a practice, I do not judge people on their gender, views, habits, etc. If I am hiring someone for an open position, I am going to only judge them based on their suitability and their attitude. I don’t care if you are a stoner, only that it does not affect your on-job performance. If a woman wants to be in a physical job, it is absolutely fine as long as they do not ask for preferential treatment for being physically weaker. You could be thoroughly devout but if you can keep it separate from your work life, you are more than welcome to the team.

I am not into sports, though I occasionally dabble. I can’t fathom how people can spend so much time every year watching league after league of football, cricket, basketball etc. There seems to be no end to these sporting contests these days. I also do not think that the Olympics are the “greatest sporting event in the world”. There are, however, exceptions to it.

Cricket World Cup? I will be supporting India.
I am currently following FIFA WC closely since it has turned out to be quite interesting.
Nadal vs Federer? Damned, if I would miss it.

However, I did try and watch a Women’s T20 series recently. And I was under-whelmed. Once you have seen the devastating power of bastmen like Gayle and Yuvraj, or the killer pace of Akhtar and Lee, you wouldn’t get the same thrill from women’s matches either.

The fastest female bowler bowl at 125–130 kph, which is the lower limit for a pacer in the male edition (with 150+ being the target for the superfast ones like Tait, Lee, Bond).

Here is a quick comparison of male and female swimming records (courtesy The Atlantic
)

The more detailed research by Ira Hammerman (here
) proves that the female:male performance ratio across sports is around 90%, and has remained unchanged for a long time.

Equality shouldn’t be of outcome, but of opportunity. Women’s performance in most physical sports is sub-par than that of men. And anyone who tells you that you need to watch them or else you are a masochist, a masculinist, or sexist is an idiot who needs to be whacked on their head lightly with a blunt object (a sharp one will likely puncture that empty skull of theirs).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2vr3kgqm8d7t95c4', 'title': 'Can you be a feminist and watch only men’s sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.4996, 'ai': 0.5004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Let me ask you a few counter-questions:\n\nCan you support LGBT rights and still be a heterosexual, cisgender male?\nCan you be in a monogamous relationship but defend people’s rights to reject the conventional notions of marriage and courtship?\nCan you be black and racist?\n\nThe answer to all 4 questions (including the one this is in response to) is “Yes”.\n\nAnd the underlying philosophy is the same - “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”\n\nFreedom of speech doesn’t mean you agree with everything people say.

Michael Haddock,Updated 1y,Could Tour de France winners from 100 years ago compete with riders today?,"A much better question is whether current Tour de France winners could compete with riders from 100 years ago.

Lets take a look at the 1922 Tour Route:

It was literally a tour of France, making an almost complete circuit of the country. The race consisted of fewer stages than a modern Tour (15 compared to 21), but was spread out over four weeks. Stages took place on alternate days.

The stages were generally much, much, longer than those in modern Tours. There were five stages that were in excess of 400 km and the longest stage was 482 km. Compare that with the route for this year, which has only two stages over 200 km (the longest being 220km).

The cyclists in 1922 were still completely unsupported and not allowed to receive any outside assistance whatsoever during the stage. Pictures of them nearly always show them with spare inner tubes and tyres strapped to their bodies. Tour historians will remember the story of Eugene Christophe who in 1913 had to repair the broken forks of his bike at a local forge, but was penalised 10 minutes when he allowed a local boy to operate the bellows while he hammered the fork.

Eugene Christophe Had To Repair His Fork In A Forge At The 1913 Tour
Modern Tour de France riders don’t have to worry too much about mechanical issues. So how did Eugene Christophe deal with a broken fork back in 1913?
https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2020/09/10/eugene-christophe-broken-fork-at-the-1913-tour/

Incidentally, Christophe also suffered a broken fork in the 1922 tour resulting in a loss of over 45 minutes on the stage.

It was a rule change in 1923 that they were allowed to receive replacement parts from their team director (although not from other riders).

…and then there is the equipment.

Although the derailleur was actually invented in the late 1800s its use was not permitted in cycle racing until the 1930s, so in the 1923 Tour the riders would have been using a two speed set up, bearing in mind that shifting between gears required stopping, unbolting the rear wheel (no quick release), flipping the wheel round and then bolting it back in place.

…and the roads, which were in terrible condition compared with those that are raced on today.

There is no comparison between racing then and racing now. The Tour de France riders from 100 years ago would have had no chance against current GC riders on current courses. However, flip it round and you will also see that today’s riders would be completely unprepared for the physical and psychological test that the 1922 tour represented.

1922 Tour de France - Wikipedia
Cycling race 1922 Tour de France Route of the 1922 Tour de France followed counterclockwise, starting in Paris Race details Dates 25 June – 23 July 1922 Stages 15 Distance 5,375 km (3,340 mi) Winning time 222h 08' 06"" Results The 1922 Tour de France was the 16th edition of the Tour de France and was held from 25 June to 23 July. The 1922 Tour consisted of 15 stages covering a total of 5,375 kilometres (3,340 mi). [1] The Tour de France was won by the Belgian cyclist Firmin Lambot , who had also won the 1919 Tour de France . The first part of the race showcased the tactics of Robert Jacquinot and some action from Eugène Christophe . During the Pyrenees stages, the climber Jean Alavoine became the leader after three consecutive stage wins: Bayonne, Luchon, and Perpignan. Lambot was 48 minutes behind Christophe at one point but then plowed ahead to his win in Paris. Alavoine's success appeared to be written in stone as they raced through the southern part of the race. This was especially true when he increased his lead to more than 22 minutes in Briançon. On the stage to Geneva the frigid weather and several mechanical issues bore down on Alavoine. Thus it was not Lambot who attacked, but Heusghem (who had been second for the last two years). It appeared that this was going to be his shining Tour, however his bicycle broke on the ride to Metz. Heusghem made a prohibited bike change to stay in race for first. However, this defied the rules during this time, and he was docked one hour by race officials, dropping him to fourth overall. This is when Lambot noticed his change and took over in Dunkerque . Amidst all this Lambot took his second win of the Tour de France at the age of 36, becoming the first man to win the Tour de France without winning any stage. Innovations and changes [ edit ] In the 1921 Tour de France , the Belgians had again been dominating, which the French audience did not like. Tour organiser Henri Desgrange did not like the cooperation between cyclists, because he wanted the Tour de France to be a display of individual strength. He had sworn to change the format for the 1922 Tour de France, but this did not happen, and the formula remained the same. [2] Although World War I was already a few years ago, its economic impact was not yet over. The cycling companies were still not able to sponsor the cyclists in the way they did before the war, so as in 1919, 1920 and 1921 they bundled their forces under the nick La Sportive . [3] The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named 1ère classe (first class), the professionals, and 2ème classe (second class), the amateurs. [4] [5] The French cyclists Henri and Francis Pélissier had stopped the 1920 Tour de France after Henri received a penalty from the Tour organisation for throwing away a tire. For this reason, the Pélissier brothers did not start in the 1921 and 1922 Tours. [6] Participants [ edit ] Race overview [ edit ] Robert Jacquinot taking a break to eat at a cafe in Hos

However, flip it round and you will also see that today’s riders would be completely unprepared for the physical and psychological test that the 1922 tour represented.\n\n1922 Tour de France - Wikipedia\nCycling race 1922 Tour de France Route of the 1922 Tour de France followed counterclockwise, starting in Paris Race details Dates 25 June – 23 July 1922 Stages 15 Distance 5,375\xa0km (3,340\xa0mi) Winning time 222h 08\' 06"" Results The 1922 Tour de France was the 16th edition of the Tour de France and was held from 25 June to 23 July. The 1922 Tour consisted of 15 stages covering a total of 5,375 kilometres (3,340\xa0mi). [1] The Tour de France was won by the Belgian cyclist Firmin Lambot , who had also won the 1919 Tour de France . The first part of the race showcased the tactics of Robert Jacquinot and some action from Eugène Christophe . During the Pyrenees stages, the climber Jean Alavoine became the leader after three consecutive stage wins: Bayonne, Luchon, and Perpignan. Lambot was 48 minutes behind Christophe at one point but then plowed ahead to his win in Paris. Alavoine\'s success appeared to be written in stone as they raced through the southern part of the race. This was especially true when he increased his lead to more than 22 minutes in Briançon. On the stage to Geneva the frigid weather and several mechanical issues bore down on Alavoine. Thus it was not Lambot who attacked, but Heusghem (who had been second for the last two years). It appeared that this was going to be his shining Tour, however his bicycle broke on the ride to Metz. Heusghem made a prohibited bike change to stay in race for first. However, this defied the rules during this time, and he was docked one hour by race officials, dropping him to fourth overall. This is when Lambot noticed his change and took over in Dunkerque . Amidst all this Lambot took his second win of the Tour de France at the age of 36, becoming the first man to win the Tour de France without winning any stage. Innovations and changes [ edit ] In the 1921 Tour de France , the Belgians had again been dominating, which the French audience did not like. Tour organiser Henri Desgrange did not like the cooperation between cyclists, because he wanted the Tour de France to be a display of individual strength. He had sworn to change the format for the 1922 Tour de France, but this did not happen, and the formula remained the same. [2] Although World War I was already a few years ago, its economic impact was not yet over. The cycling companies were still not able to sponsor the cyclists in the way they did before the war, so as in 1919, 1920 and 1921 they bundled their forces under the nick La Sportive . [3] The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named 1ère classe (first class), the professionals, and 2ème classe (second class), the amateurs. [4] [5] The French cyclists Henri and Francis Pélissier had stopped the 1920 Tour de France after Henri received a penalty from the Tour organisation for throwing away a tire. For this reason, the Pélissier brothers did not start in the 1921 and 1922 Tours.

Matt Chanoff,4y,How much better are pros than other people at sports?,"I’ve been a decent endurance cyclist for a long time, I’ve done plenty of 200-mile-in-one-day rides, and big hills don’t scare me. For my 50th birthday I decided to take on the Giro d’Italia passes, with a tour group led by Andy Hampsten. Andy had won the Giro in 1988, but he hadn’t ridden competitively in decades.

I trained like hell the summer before, and was in the best shape of my life, but a few minutes after our group set off, I knew I was completely outclassed. There were Cat 1 and 2 cyclists in the group; real competitors doing this as a training tour. I found one guy, overweight and older than me, and figured I’d stick with him. No dice. Turned out he had held the California - New York senior speed record.

So there we were, climbing the Stelvio. At first, it seemed like just some lovely mountain going up through some apple orchards. Similar to climbing Mt. Tam from Marin. But when you go a few thousand feet up on Mt. Tam, you get to the top. When you go a few thousand feet up the Stelvio, you get to the bottom of this:

Pretty soon we were strung way out, with me near the back of the line, breathing hard and humping my way up to the next switchback. What seemed like miles above I could see the fastest members of our group.

Then Andy came up behind me. He chatted for a bit, told a joke, and said something like “good job so far.” He wasn’t breathing hard or sweating. Then he, seemingly effortlessly, glided up to the next rider ahead of me and did the same thing. Then the next, and the next. I’m pretty sure he went and chatted with the fastest of us, but then he drifted back down to check in. And, when we finally reached the top he was smiling and waiting for us, cheering us on.

A pro rider like Andy can put out over 400 watts over a sustained period, like a climb up the Stelvio. Which is to say that I can put out a bit more power than he can - if he’s only using one leg. But that doesn’t tell the whole story, he also weighs almost a third less than I do. In terms of watts per kilogram, a decent gauge of cycling potential, he’s just in a different universe.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o9t3gc70s1wuheka', 'title': 'How much better are pros than other people at sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I’ve been a decent endurance cyclist for a long time, I’ve done plenty of 200-mile-in-one-day rides, and big hills don’t scare me.

Calvin Fong,1y,How good was Wilt Chamberlain really?,"Wilt was so good he once won a game without shooting the ball AT ALL.

In 1967, Wilt decided to prove a point.

In a 76ers game against the Warriors, he didn’t shoot the ball the ENTIRE game.

Keep in mind this is a guy who once averaged 50 PPG over a whole season.

And followed that up by putting up 44 PPG the very next year.

He could score at will.

So why didn’t he shoot that game?

Because of exactly that - people accused him of scoring TOO much.

And just putting up meaningless scoring numbers, without getting his teammates involved.

Remember that ‘61–62 season when he averaged 50 PPG?

He also dished out a measly 2.4 assists per game that year.

So in the 1967–68 season, Wilt decided to PROVE that he could do anything he wanted to on a basketball court.

In the game against the Warriors, he finished with 18 rebounds and 13 assists (steals and blocks weren’t recorded back then).

On 0 points, from 0–0 FG.

Although he did make 1 free throw. So he finished with exactly 1 point (so I guess technically he did “shoot” the ball that game).

And helped the Sixers to a 7-point win over the Warriors.

(SIDE NOTE: He did have a game in 1973 where he went 0–0 FG and 0–0 FT, ending with 0 points. But Wilt did that at the tail end of his career, and his Lakers lost that game by 1.)

Remember he was trying to prove a point in the ‘67–68 season by passing more?

He ended up leading the entire league in total assists that year.

And averaged 8.6 APG - a far cry from the 2 or 3 APG he averaged in his peak scoring years.

Wilt was sending a message: he could do ANYTHING he wanted to.

That’s how good he was in that era. A man among boys.

Who could impact a game everywhere - even without shooting the ball for an entire game.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9yfogz48wqik1csv', 'title': 'How good was Wilt Chamberlain really?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Wilt was so good he once won a game without shooting the ball AT ALL.\n\nIn 1967, Wilt decided to prove a point.\n\nIn a 76ers game against the Warriors, he didn’t shoot the ball the ENTIRE game.\n\nKeep in mind this is a guy who once averaged 50 PPG over a whole season.\n\nAnd followed that up by putting up 44 PPG the very next year.\n\nHe could score at will.\n\nSo why didn’t he shoot that game?\n\nBecause of exactly that - people accused him of scoring TOO much.\n\nAnd just putting up meaningless scoring numbers, without getting his teammates involved.\n\nRemember that ‘61–62 season when he averaged 50 PPG?\n\nHe also dished out a measly 2.4 assists per game that year.\n\nSo in the 1967–68 season, Wilt decided to PROVE that he could do anything he wanted to on a basketball court.\n\nIn the game against the Warriors, he finished with 18 rebounds and 13 assists (steals and blocks weren’t recorded back then).\n\nOn 0 points, from 0–0 FG.\n\nAlthough he did make 1 free throw.

Anurag Singh,Updated 7y,What are some of the mind-blowing facts about Roger Federer?,"Rafael Nadal once said about Federer “ If someone thinks that i play better than Federer , he doesn’t know anything about tennis.”
Federer facts :

At the beginning of his career, he played in but couldn’t go past quarter-finals in 16 grand slams.
Federer has served a total of 9734 aces in his entire professional career. While his rivals are far behind with Djokovic having 4655 and Nadal with 2735 aces.
Federer also holds the worst record among players active since 1990 in so-called “Simpson’s Paradox” matches–those where the loser of the match wins more points than the winner.
Federer was gifted a cow by the organisers of the Swiss open, when he returned to play the tournament after winning his first Wimbledon title in 2003.

5. Federer and his wife Mirka competed together just once, playing in the Hopman Cup, held in Perth, Australia.

6. Roger Federer holds the record for the most consecutive points won on serve:
35 against Feliciano Lopez in the US Open 2007 4th round.

7. Roger Federer also hold 2 of 3 longest match record. Longest singles final match by time played. “in 2008, 4 hours and 48 minutes, vs Rafael Nadal.”
Longest singles final match by number of games. “in 2009, 77 games against Andy Roddick. This match also had the longest final set in a Grand Slam final by games.”

Misha Firer,2y,How popular is baseball in Russia?,"I take you on a tour of a baseball stadium on the territory of Moscow State University.

The commemorative plaque says the stadium was a gift from the provost of Tokai University, the President of Cultural Connections with Foreign Countries, Satiasi Matsumae, which opened on September 1, 1989.

Goddamn imperialists giving presents to our righteous communist students.

The first thing we did, installed a barrier and a tall fence because more imperialists can come and we need to be ready.

Next, we installed bars to prevent free riders from coming to the stadium without paying for tickets.

A fence around the stadium with barbed wire to prevent crazy fans from climbing over to beat up players.

I know there is a nasty surprise await the one who attempts to climb over. They smear fence railings with lubricating oil (solidol).

My friend touched and made greasy his hands and arms.

The fence all over the perimeter, I couldn’t enter the field from anywhere.

I found an abandoned umpire tower to look over the fence. After they built fences and smeared them with lubricating oil, authorities of the number one university in Russia abandoned the diamond-shaped field.

There were foreign students and local students who wanted to play baseball, but when the authorities learned how much it costs to maintain it they decided to rather invest that money into their dachas.

Students come to the stadium to drink beer instead of playing sport.

Remember foreignsky this maxim - in totalitarian country teamwork without external authority is a one-way ticket to Gulag.

I remember in my Soviet school in football (soccer) games we could never play as a team since everyone was out for himself.

This also the reason why standardization comes hard to us. Outside of a totalitarian system of control, we lack the discipline to follow through with an algorithm of actions and protocol and instead constantly improvise.

Our excessive pride and tendency to reflect in abstract forms restrain us from simply copying the best practices created elsewhere.

Rajitha Weeramanthri,Updated 6y,What are some famous gestures of respect in sports?,"I’m a Sri Lankan ,Cricket is our main sport , Great Kumar Sangakkara is my hero of cricket.

————————————————————————————-

Here is some thing from Wikipedia

Kumar “Sanga"" Chokshanada Sangakkara (Sinhalese
: කුමාර සංගක්කාර; born 27 October 1977) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer
 and captain of the Sri Lankan national team
. Widely regarded as one of the world's most influential cricketers,

Sangakkara was rated as the Greatest ODI batsman of all time in a recent public poll. Sangakkara has forged many formidable partnerships with long time team mate and friend, Mahela Jayawardene
 and holds numerous batting records in the modern era across all formats of the game.

Sangakkara scored 28,016 runs in international cricket across all formats in an career that spanned just 15 years.””

—————————————————————————————————-

1)Cricket is named as the gentlemen’s game . Sanga took it to another level. There are lots of incidents where he went off the crease before Umpire gives out. Some times, when even the Umpire say not out , he would walk way if he knows he is out. This is some thing that happens rarely in cricket. But, best I saw happened in IPL (Indian Premier League), the best and biggest cricket league in the world.

He, being given not-out by the umpire, walked away as he knew that he was out.

And this is how the bowler showed his respect towards him.

2) Currently, Virat Kohli is the best young batsman in the world, without any doubt. He is really talented and becoming a good captain. But, lots of people say that he has attitude problems, way too much aggressive and showing no respect for players in the other side. But Kohli showed his respect to Sanga lots of times.

When Sri Lanka about to win the T20 world cup final against India, Sanga scored half century and Kohli came and shook his hands ( even Kohli knew his team was going to lose the world cup that year)

and again after the match finished

In 2015, the great Sanga said bye to Test cricket. He scored less runs than Sachin, the God of Cricket. But his statistics were 2nd only to the Sir, Don Bradman. His last test match was won by India and it was the 1st Test win for Kohli, as the captain. This is how Kohli said bye to Sanga ( I’m crying).

This is Emotional.

3) Worst day for Sri Lanka Cricket history was the day when Sanga bid farewell from all types of International Cricket. It was a sunny and hot day .Sanga got out for the last time. He was walking off the crease. This is how environment react for that.

I bet he would’ve been weeping too .But no one can see his tears when it’s like this.

Once he went out rain stopped. Back to hot and sunny weather . How this even possible.??

P.S. Sorry I have only mentioned about him. But, he deserves that respect","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b6q405xiadoe9vwn', 'title': 'What are some famous gestures of respect in sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I’m a Sri Lankan ,Cricket is our main sport , Great Kumar Sangakkara is my hero of cricket.\n\n————————————————————————————-\n\nHere is some thing from Wikipedia\n\nKumar “Sanga"" Chokshanada Sangakkara (Sinhalese\n: කුමාර සංගක්කාර; born 27 October 1977) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer\n and captain of the Sri Lankan national team\n.

John Sew,Updated 3y,Why do some people say that Rafael Nadal’s tennis style of play is defensive?,"One of the beauties of Rafa’s game is his “percentage play”.

What is percentage tennis?

It is safe tennis. You don’t hit flat shots which have a high risk factor of either going into the net or sailing wide. You don’t look to clear the net by simply a few inches. You play to clear the net by a good few feet. To do that, you have to usually hit constant top spin shots. They sail up above the net, but also come falling down fast after that reach the high point. This either adds depth to a shot, or simply makes the ball bounce high if it lands short. In either scenario, the trajectory of the ball is difficult to tackle, especially because it is not the usual way the ball comes back to a player.

Needless to say, this is not an aggressive brand of tennis. Aggressive players usually hit flatter, faster shots and volley more. Federer is a good example. Federer is an extremely aggressive player. Nadal’s style is aggressive too, but not as aggressive. His focus is more on extracting mistakes and using bounce to displace his opponents (who often move further back to get the shot on a hittable level), and when he gets an open court, he can easily slam a winner.

Nadal also consistently stands far behind the basline when receiving serve. It’s obviously a much more defensive position, from where he takes a couple shots to come up to the baseline. If you look at Federer, he usually stands right around the baseline while returning serve.

Look at this difference in their receiving positions. It’s a classic aggressive/defensive contrast.

Lastly, if you look at Federer’s matches - most times, he outhits his opponents on winners. And even when he loses, it’s because he lands up with more errors. In contrast, Nadal may or may not have more winners, but he usually does far better in terms of unforced errors and that’s where he makes the difference count.

Both these approaches to playing the game have their own merits. After all, both these players have made their own style work incredibly. But yes, Nadal does have a more defensive approach, which relies on him making as few mistakes as possible. It’s really phenomenal though how he maintains the level of power and consistency with a constant top spin game.

ETA

Fun fact: Nadal’s phenomenal ability to hit so many “bananas” is a result of his percentage play. Because he usually looks to clear the net more, he doesn’t catch the net-tape like most players do while hitting their forehands down the line. His higher margin of error comes into play here. And of course, it’s this top spin that he imparts on the ball that allows the ball to curve round the outside of the line to finally drop into it. He is not hitting a different forehand, but his forehand is just so well suited to hit this shot!

Look at the net clearance. Look at the curve. Look at the shot.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9m3he0itw2c6yfpq', 'title': 'Why do some people say that Rafael Nadal’s tennis style of play is defensive?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'One of the beauties of Rafa’s game is his “percentage play”.\n\nWhat is percentage tennis?\n\nIt is safe tennis.

if u think play sport as fun activity, then no for sure. Maybe on short run, but no one play one or two games and stop. The point of gambling is that makes you greedy and emotional and that you always want more. That’s how they take you money.

If u think to play just arbitrage betting or strategic with some information that can be a key to predict the result then yes..

But also u have to be aware that u cannot make millions or get rich by playing a sport games.. but still can make decent amount for enjoying your time and makes some thing easier..

Matt Zietsman,Updated Jan 27,Who is the unluckiest player in the history of sport?,"Monica Seles

She was born in 1973 and before turning 20, Seles had racked up 8 Grand Slam Singles titles and 3 year-end final titles. Also keep in mind that:

This achievement took place during the Steffi Graf era - a player currently considered as one of the greatest, if not the greatest tennis player of all time.
No other player (male or female) has ever been able to win more than 6 Gland Slam titles before the age of 20 (which happened to be Steffi Graf after winning the only Calender Golden Slam in History in 1988)

In 1990, at the age of 16, Seles became the youngest ever French Open Champion and less than a year later she was ranked as the world number 1.

By the start of 1993, Seles had cemented herself as the top women's tennis player and heading into the season, she had won the French Open for three consecutive years and both the US Open and Australian Open in consecutive years (again worth remembering... she was still in her teens and had turned 19 just a few months earlier)

Then on April 30, Günter Parche, an obsessed fan of Graf ran onto the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a knife between her shoulder blades. She was quickly rushed to a hospital and did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years.

When she finally returned to tennis a couple of years later. Seles managed to add one more Grand Slam to her tally but she was never the same.

So my questions now are?

How often is Seles mentioned during discussions about being the GOAT (“Greatest of all time”)? Very rarely I’d say..
and how may things have been different if that teenager with 8 Grand Slam titles under her belt did not get stabbed on that awful day?

I’ve compiled the below table just to illustrate how astounding Seles’ achievements were when compared to those names we usually hear during discussions of the “Greatest of All Time”.
