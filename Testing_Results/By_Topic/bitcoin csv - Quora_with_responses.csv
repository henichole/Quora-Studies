Jessica Fowler,3y,Is it too late to start investing in Bitcoin now in January 2021?,"The too late mindset isn’t good for your psychology. It makes you feel like shit. When people think about bitcoin I quickly see them become disappointed. They wish they had listened earlier. Or they wish they had bought at least one bitcoin when the price was lower.

Cryptocurrencies are an ongoing technology and socioeconomic experiment. As a result, the blockchain space is booming with new opportunities like being able to invest on Platform like CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoFXnetwork,com) where you get return on your invested cryptocurrency after 10days. With an approximate market cap of $280 million, rest assured that this industry is here to stay. This new industry is constantly evolving, therefore the earlier you get acquainted with it, the higher your chance are of benefiting from its future development.

Note: this article is a personal opinion. Before making any investment decisions, you should always consult with a professional.

The problem with bitcoin is you can never buy at a good price. Why? Bitcoin keeps being the best-performing asset each year, and is now the best performing asset of the decade. Think about that. This is the superpower of bitcoin. It doesn’t matter when you buy it. What matters is that you do eventually.

Buy low, sell high

We’re taught to buy assets at a low price and sell them at a higher price. What if this was industrial age factory worker thinking?

The best time to buy bitcoin is when you decide to.

The reason is, bitcoin has a fixed supply of coins and predictable code built into it that tells you its future. You don’t have to be a genius to understand bitcoin’s future price.

A Dutch institutional investor known as Plan B created a stock to flow model which helps investors understand where the price is going based on the hard-coded, predictable monetary policy of bitcoin.

Once you understand stock to flow, then you’ll understand the overwhelming dollar value of guaranteed scarcity.

Forget the price. What’s the opportunity?

I want to shake up your thinking. The opportunity of bitcoin has nothing to do with price. Bitcoin solves a problem. The current value of the circulating supply of bitcoin is roughly $355 billion.

The current value of the world’s supply of gold is about $9 trillion. The current value of the world’s supply of derivatives (a popular financial instrument people dump money into) is $640 trillion. The current value of the world’s supply of stocks is $95 trillion.

If only a small amount of money moves out of one of these asset classes and into bitcoin then the price will skyrocket.

Investment firms are buying bitcoin, not because they want to, but because they have to. There are very few places you can put your money and get a return. There are even fewer places you can put your money to store it safely in the event of a downturn or recession.

I don’t personally care about the bitcoin price. I care about the problem it solves and whether over the long-term there is a financial return likely to occur for doing so.

Long-term thinking

The worst way to invest as an everyday person is for the short term. One of my early investments in bitcoin was short term. I bought a lot and then sold it when the price crashed in 2017. That short-term thinking has meant I’m working a few years longer than I need to.

I would be retired if I still had all the bitcoin I owned in 2017. I’m okay with that. My investor psychology was weak back then. I needed to see a few 50% drops to learn my lesson. The March 2020 covid crash was certainly a good test, and I passed without selling any bitcoin.

Thinking about the assets you invest in over the long term helps reduce your stress levels. You’re less worried about whether it’s “too late” or “is now a good time” and focused on doing your research and understanding what you’re buying. This phrase sums it up better than I could:

Time in the market beats timing the market.

Euphoria Is Coming

It’s going to be bad for your psychology. When euphoria hits an asset like bitcoin, people lose their minds and throw a wall of money at it. How do I know? I lived through the euphoric phase of bitcoin back in 2017.

People I worked with went from IT professionals to wild gamblers in a day. Every computer screen in my office at one point was showing the bitcoin price. One guy in the office mortgaged his house to buy bitcoin.

The problem ended up being rather unusual: people didn’t buy bitcoin. They bought shitcoins that were worth less than $1, thinking they’d get rich. That’s what euphoria can do to people’s thinking. It isn’t pleasant to watch — and it will happen again. The use-case for bitcoin was born during the pandemic. This is going to create ongoing euphoria.

What can you do about it? Stay calm. Your life won’t end if you don’t buy bitcoin. Take your time and research it. Start by reading the book, “The Bitcoin Standard” and go from there.

Patience always wins when it comes to investing.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/c5obdkfqh860rn39', 'title': 'Is it too late to start investing in Bitcoin now in January 2021?', 'score': {'original': 0.26715, 'ai': 0.73285}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The too late mindset isn’t good for your psychology.

Kelly Pearson,3y,Can you get rich if you invest now in Bitcoin?,"Basically you should have bought about 1,000 Bitcoins back when they were cheap.

Bitcoin has risen and fallen many times during it’s time, it is even expected by some investors now, last year we saw Bitcoin grow from $900 to $20,000 and now the price hovers at around $10,000.

If you got in before Bitcoin was worth $6,000 then this is not too bad, however I believe we will hit a price floor soon and from there the only way is up. It doesn’t look too late to me and I am confident that we are not in a real bubble.

Zajicek David,7mo,What are the best Web3 crypto?,"Hey there! You're curious about the best Web3 cryptos, and I'm here to help. But before we dive in, it's important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies always comes with risks, so please do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

Now, let's talk about Web3 crypto. Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, where decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain technology take center stage. It's all about giving users more control over their data and enhancing security.

When it comes to choosing the best Web3 cryptos, it can be quite subjective as different projects serve different purposes. However, I'll mention a few popular ones that have gained attention in the crypto space:

1. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is often considered the backbone of Web3. It enables developers to build decentralized applications on its blockchain, making it a go-to platform for many projects.

2. Polkadot (DOT): Polkadot is a multi-chain platform that aims to connect different blockchains together. It allows for interoperability between various networks, enabling seamless communication and data transfer.

3. Cardano (ADA): Cardano is a blockchain platform that focuses on security, scalability, and sustainability. Its unique approach to consensus and smart contracts has attracted a lot of attention from both developers and investors.

4. Solana (SOL): Solana is a high-performance blockchain that aims to provide fast and low-cost transactions. It has gained popularity for its scalability and ability to handle a large number of transactions per second.

5. Filecoin (FIL): Filecoin aims to create a decentralized storage network by incentivizing users to rent out their unused storage space. It allows individuals and businesses to store and retrieve data in a secure and distributed manner.

Remember, this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other promising Web3 cryptos out there. It's always a good idea to stay updated with the latest news and developments in the crypto space as new projects emerge regularly.

Lastly, it's crucial to be cautious when investing in cryptocurrencies. Prices can be highly volatile, so it's essential to set realistic expectations and only invest what you can afford to lose.

I hope this gives you a starting point in your exploration of the best Web3 cryptos. Happy investing!

Michael Fox,Updated 5y,What caused the recent spike in bitcoin prices beyond $10000?,"At the time, the majority of users, traders and investors still remained skeptical toward the ability of the Bitcoin Core development team’s transaction malleability and scaling solution Segregated Witness (SegWit) to efficiently scale the Bitcoin network.

Over the past two weeks, the bitcoin community and industry have seen drastic change in the bitcoin network. The size of the Bitcoin mempool has decreased from 150 to 6 million bytes and Bitcoin blockchain congestion has been relieved. For SegWit-enabled wallet and transaction users, around 30 to 50 percent reduction in fees was imposed, and the development teams of widely-recognized non-custodial Bitcoin wallet platforms such as GreenAddress believe the reduction rate of Bitcoin fees can surpass the 50 percent mark in the upcoming weeks.

“Our testing shows that segwit fees are around half the cost of the equivalent non-segwit transaction. Lower fees kick in once you start spending segwit inputs, so for most users it will take a few transactions before you see the full effects. As the rest of the ecosystem updates we expect block pressure to reduce which may also lower fees further,

— wrote the GreenAddress development team.

Unlike the pre-SegWit period wherein the optimization rate of Bitcoin blocks and transactions was difficult to speculate, it has become evident with SegWit activated that the solution has the potential to reduce Bitcoin fees by up to 70 percent if proper conditions are met. As of current, only 10 percent of all bitcoin transactions remain SegWit-enabled and as more Bitcoin wallet service providers such as Coinbase, Blockchain, and BreadWallet integrate SegWit, Bitcoin fees will decrease even further.

Due to optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s mid-term scalability and the emergence of applications launched on top of Lightning, a two-layer micro payments solutions development for Bitcoin, the Chinese government’s declaration of ICOs as an illegal fundraising method had minimal impact on Bitcoin price. The market panicked and the price fell by $500 within hours. But, within a 24-hour period, bitcoin price recovered beyond $4,550, demonstrating strong resistance and absolute confidence from the market and investors.

Keiser along with other prominent financial analysts believe Bitcoin has the potential to surpass the $10,000 mark in the short-term because of the immense developer activity that is currently ongoing within the network and clear rise in demand from institutional, retail, professional and casual investors toward Bitcoin as both a safe haven asset and a currency.

More importantly, as political conflicts between the US and North Korea intensify and global markets remain volatile as a result, the demand for Bitcoin will rise at an exponential rate. Already, in the US, South Korea, and Japan, Bitcoin trading volumes have been on the rise and have demonstrated a level of stability, which is considered as solid momentum indicators to predict Bitcoin’s price trend.

Said Nusir,2y,Why are people so interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?,"If you haven’t heard of Bitcoin or any of the other major cryptocurrencies, you’ve probably lived under a rock for the past decade or so. This virtual currency has made some ordinary people really rich, and we are talking about serious wealth here.

Erik Fineman probably has a shrine someplace dedicated to his grandma (if not, he really should), since this lady lent him $1000 back in 2011 so that he could buy Bitcoin.

When the value of this cryptocurrency skyrocketed a few years later, he made a fortune. Charlie Shrem, a co-owner of a gastropub in Manhattan bought some Bitcoins when they were only a few bucks, and bought a few thousand more when their value reached $20. Talking about a wise investment!

Logically, everyone wants to invest in cryptocurrency and be rich overnight because it is the new wave, Yes, it has made a lot of people rich but you cannot be rich overnight as it is a process. The problem remains that a lot of people do not know the right questions to ask and also the right investment platform to invest. From my experience, investing with the platform (www. cryptomartfx. com) where you earn 10% of whatever you invest in 10days is a very reliable platform that i have personally tested several times and never been disappointed. Also, they offer referral services where you can refer people and also make money from the process. This is not an illusion as it is very real.

NB- All of my writings can be verified with further research if you want.

Nowadays, Bitcoin is more popular than ever, since its price has hit an all-time-high of almost $20,000. Market experts and major crypto news publishers like Finixio predict bullish growth for the first and most well-known coin of them all. But what makes this time different to the last time we saw major growth?

More than a bubble

In December 2017 the Bitcoin crashed so spectacularly, that its value fell below the $4,000 mark. However, according to specialists, this time we shouldn’t expect the same scenario.

“The growth of bitcoin can no longer be seen as a bubble
,” suggests Adam Grunwerg of crypto media publishers, Finixio. “There will inevitably be more market corrections at some point, but the overall trend is going to be upwards, so long term, patient investors stand to benefit the most.”

So it seems that Bitcoin isn’t a bubble that could burst anytime, and it is in fact here to stay.

One of the reasons why cryptocurrencies shouldn’t be compared to tulip bulbs anymore is the maturing of technology. The transactions have never been more secure and new layers are being developed that will allow blockchain technologies to be used in financial markets.

Also, institutions are starting to recognize its value and major players are now embracing cryptocurrency. There has even been a change in stance in the largest bank in the US JPMorgan Chase.

Although its CEO Jamie Dimon called it a fraud back in 2017, a team of its analysts is now predicting that the value of Bitcoin could double or even triple in the future.

With that said, it sounds like investing in cryptocurrencies might be a really wise move. However, if you are still not sure whether you should start trading crypto, here are several reasons that should tip the scales and help you make a decision.

The rise of demand

When Bitcoin was created more than a decade ago, not many people were able to predict that it would inspire an ever-growing legion of followers and the birth of so many other cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin has definitely changed the traditional financial system since it was designed to be free from government manipulation and control. The field of cryptocurrencies is always expanding, and nowadays there are more than 2,000 digital tokens out there.

The simplicity

One of the reasons why so many people are interested in investing in cryptocurrencies is the fact that buying and selling Bitcoin and its virtual siblings is so easy. You do not need to be an expert to dip your toe into the world of cryptocurrency trading.

In fact, this type of trading is highly accessible these days and it is not reserved just for business investors and other sharks. Thanks to trading platforms with incredible technological organization, trading is quick and easy, so even newbies in this field can do it. These platforms offer various tools that make the whole process as simple as possible.

Turning a profit

Why would someone spend their money and time on crypto trading? Because of the possibility of making a huge profit, of course. Maybe you do not believe that money makes the world go round, but we can all agree that it can make your life much easier.

While investing in stocks is complicated and the potential returns are really low, with cryptocurrencies trading can really pay off, and you don’t even have to wait for a long time to turn a profit. Of course, the crypto market is highly volatile and you should never invest money you can’t afford to spend, but it is good to know that achieving high returns from a single trade is more than possible.

Great potential

This year has been challenging for everyone and everything, even the global economy, and the traditional financial system. Of course, the main reason for this is pandemic and lockdowns. Due to fear of a recession, a huge number of investors turned to cryptocurrencies as a possible alternative to traditional financial assets.

It has been predicted that next year will only continue the process of cryptocurrency adoption.

As Adam Grunwerg of Finixio has observed, “We have already seen several major players in the world of financial services embrace crypto, including PayPal, JP Morgan, Visa and Mastercard. We predict that in 2021, this progress will only continue. That’s why it’s well worth investing in crypto, perhaps now more than ever.”

Convenience

Investing in something like this might seem daunting since it is assumed that a lot of work is involved. For example, if you want to invest in real estate, first you need to possess a large sum. Then, there is a matter of visiting a number of banks, spending time in lines, signing a ton of papers, and dealing with all kinds of institutions.

However, by investing in cryptocurrencies, you can skip all of these steps and take a piece of the Bitcoin cake without wasting your precious time. Taking part in investment is so easy, you just need to make an account, make a small deposit and you are good to go. Since all of these platforms are compatible with smartphones, you can manage your investments from every corner of the world.

Lack of mediators

When you have a lot of money, what do you do with it? You put it in a bank, of course. However, not only will the bank take a piece of your profits, but you will be at its mercy, whether you like it or not. For example, if the bank is closed, you would have limited access to your money, not to mention that you could take a serious financial hit if the bank filed for bankruptcy. Though this may seem unlikely, remember that there were real issues and worries around this exact situation during the crash of 2008, so this is a very real possibility.

With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, you do not rely on any institution for holding and transfers. This means you can forget about wasting money on bank fees. Cryptocurrencies offer a level of independence a bank could never provide.

Bitcoin in 2021

It seems that cryptocurrency is not going anywhere and 2021 is going to be big for this form of money. Adam Grunwerg of crypto news publishers Finixio believes that we will see big changes in the sector.

“We are going to see record levels of interest in bitcoin this year, and the emergence of central bank digital currencies is only going to see that accelerate” he says.

“The effect of coronavirus on consumer habits has accelerated ecommerce, and as part of that, online finance is only going to move further and faster towards crypto”.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/s9mt4lkb56cy1dve', 'title': 'Why are people so interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?', 'score': {'original': 0.47393333333333, 'ai': 0.52606666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'If you haven’t heard of Bitcoin or any of the other major cryptocurrencies, you’ve probably lived under a rock for the past decade or so.

Brinkley Irving,7mo,How do I short the US dollar using crypto futures trading?,"Sure, I'd be happy to provide you with an informative and detailed answer on how to short the US dollar using crypto futures trading. Before we dive in, it's important to mention that this strategy is legal and can be a potentially profitable way to make money. However, as with any investment, it's essential to do your own research and understand the risks involved.

To begin, let's start by explaining what shorting means in the context of trading. Shorting essentially involves betting against an asset's value. In this case, you would be betting against the value of the US dollar. When you short the US dollar, you are essentially speculating that its value will decrease in the future.

Now, onto the process of shorting the US dollar using crypto futures trading. The first step is to find a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that offers futures trading options. Some popular exchanges that offer these services include Binance, BitMEX, and Bybit, among others. Make sure to conduct thorough research and choose an exchange that suits your needs and preferences.

Once you have chosen an exchange, you will need to create an account and complete the necessary verification process. This typically involves providing identification documents and sometimes even undergoing a Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure. It's important to note that different exchanges may have varying requirements, so be prepared to comply with their specific guidelines.

After your account is set up and verified, you will need to deposit funds into your trading account. This can usually be done by transferring cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum from your personal wallet to your exchange wallet.

Next, familiarize yourself with the platform's trading interface and learn how to navigate it effectively. Most exchanges offer educational resources, tutorials, and demo accounts to help you get acquainted with their platform. Take advantage of these resources to gain a better understanding of how futures trading works on the chosen exchange.

When it comes to shorting the US dollar, you will specifically need to find a futures contract that allows you to bet against the US dollar's value. This can typically be done by selecting a trading pair that involves the US dollar and a stablecoin such as Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC). These stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, allowing you to take a position against it.

Once you have chosen the appropriate trading pair, you can proceed to open a short position. This involves selling the stablecoin and simultaneously buying the US dollar futures contract. As the value of the US dollar decreases, you can profit from this price movement.

It's important to note that shorting the US dollar using crypto futures trading comes with its own set of risks. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. It's crucial to set a stop-loss order to limit potential losses and implement a risk management strategy.

Additionally, it's recommended to stay updated with relevant news and market trends that could impact the value of the US dollar. This will help you make informed trading decisions and minimize potential risks.

In conclusion, shorting the US dollar using crypto futures trading is a legal strategy that can be potentially profitable. However, it's essential to conduct thorough research, choose a reputable exchange, and understand the risks involved. By staying informed and implementing effective risk management strategies, you can navigate this investment opportunity with confidence.

HARRIS S,2y,How do I get a private key from my non-spendable blockchain wallet?,"The Blockchain wallet automatically generates and stores wallet private keys, each address has an accompanying public and private keys.

Jordan Jamie,7mo,How much cash do I need to start trading and buying crypto?,"Starting to trade and buy crypto can be an exciting venture that has the potential to bring in some real money. However, one of the first questions that often comes to mind is, ""How much cash do I need to get started?"" Well, the answer to that question depends on several factors.

First and foremost, it's important to note that engaging in crypto trading and investing is legal and can be a legitimate way to make money. While there are always risks involved in any form of investment, it's essential to approach crypto with a clear understanding of the market dynamics and a willingness to learn and adapt as you go along.

Now, let's talk about the cash you'll need to embark on this journey. The amount of money required to start trading and buying crypto can vary widely depending on your goals, risk appetite, and the specific cryptocurrencies you are interested in. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Education: Before diving into the world of crypto, it's crucial to educate yourself about the fundamentals. This will help you make informed decisions and minimize risks. Fortunately, there are plenty of free resources available online, such as educational videos, articles, and forums, where you can learn about the basics of blockchain technology, different cryptocurrencies, and trading strategies.

2. Trading Platform: To start buying and selling cryptocurrencies, you'll need to choose a reliable trading platform or exchange. These platforms allow you to deposit funds in various currencies (such as USD, EUR, or GBP) and then use those funds to purchase cryptocurrencies. Some popular exchanges include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.

3. Initial Investment: The amount of cash you'll need for your initial investment will depend on factors such as the price of the cryptocurrency you want to buy and the minimum purchase requirements set by the trading platform. For example, if you're interested in buying Bitcoin (currently priced around $30,000), you'll need at least a few hundred dollars to make a meaningful investment.

4. Risk Management: It's important to have a clear risk management strategy in place to protect your investment. This includes setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and diversifying your portfolio by investing in multiple cryptocurrencies. Remember, crypto markets can be highly volatile, so it's crucial to invest only what you can afford to lose.

5. Additional Costs: Apart from the initial investment, there may be additional costs associated with trading and buying crypto. These include transaction fees charged by the trading platform, withdrawal fees, and potentially taxes on any profits you make. It's essential to factor in these costs while planning your budget.

In conclusion, the amount of cash needed to start trading and buying crypto can vary depending on several factors. While it's difficult to provide an exact figure, it's advisable to start with a reasonable amount that you are comfortable investing and can afford to lose. Remember, successful trading and investing in crypto require knowledge, discipline, and a long-term perspective. So, take your time to educate yourself, start small, and gradually increase your investments as you gain experience and confidence in the market. Happy trading!

Van Evin,5y,What is the best graphics card for Bitcoin mining?,"Why worry what the best graphics card for mining Bitcoin is? Are you trying to mine solo? It sounds to me like you are new to everything crypto mining and it's a steep learning curve if you are a self-starter, so it will be a long time before you make any income on your expensive investment. Have fun with the electricity costs and repairs! Oh, or... you could start making income NOW if you join a cloud mining pool, and you don't have to worry about any of that. I earned $86,000 give or take last year from mining Bitcoin (and other coins) this way and I don't have to maintain any equipment or have the headache of being stuck at my PC. I travel a lot and cloud mining is convenient for all those reasons, because all I have to do is log in and choose what coins to mine, and the money from my investment in the pool starts making immediate profit.

It's easy to withdraw your mined coins to your wallet, and of course from there it's as good as cash. You have less responsibility, more flexibility and no need to learn anything technical, so it's a pretty easy investment for anyone who wants to get into crypto, without having to learn all the jargon.

Range of Supported Cryptocurrencies: Coinbase offers a wider range of supported cryptocurrencies compared to Gemini, which may be appealing to users interested in trading or investing in various digital assets.
Regulation and Compliance: Coinbase is known for its strong regulatory compliance and adherence to legal standards, making it a trusted choice for users concerned about security and compliance.
Liquidity: Coinbase generally has higher liquidity due to its popularity and large user base, which can result in faster trade execution and tighter spreads.

Gemini:

Security Features: Gemini is highly regarded for its security features, including cold storage, insurance coverage, and regulatory compliance. It has never been hacked since its inception.
Institutional-Grade Platform: Gemini offers a more institutional-grade platform, which may be appealing to professional traders and institutional investors looking for advanced trading features and tools.
Regulatory Status: Like Coinbase, Gemini is a regulated exchange, which can provide users with confidence in its compliance with regulatory standards and legal requirements.
Active Trader Discounts: Gemini offers discounts on trading fees for high-volume traders, which may be advantageous for users who frequently engage in trading activities.

Ultimately, the choice between Coinbase and Gemini depends on factors such as user experience, supported cryptocurrencies, security features, trading fees, and specific preferences. It's recommended to research both platforms thoroughly and consider your own needs before making a decision. Additionally, trying out both platforms with small transactions can help you determine which one better suits your requirements.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a2ezrio3ydq7t1mv', 'title': 'Which is better for cryptocurrency: Coinbase or Gemini?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Determining which cryptocurrency exchange is ""better"" between Coinbase and Gemini depends on individual preferences, priorities, and specific needs.

Fuller Norma,9mo,What are the secrets of cryptocurrency trading?,"Cryptocurrency trading can be an exciting and potentially lucrative endeavor, but it can also be quite daunting for beginners. Fortunately, there are some tried and tested strategies that can help you navigate the market with greater confidence and success.

One such strategy is known as scalping, which involves profiting off small price changes and making a fast profit off selling. This technique is particularly effective for day traders who are looking to make frequent trades and capitalize on short-term market movements.

The key to successful scalping is to focus on high-liquidity cryptocurrencies that are actively traded and have a large number of buyers and sellers. This allows you to quickly buy and sell the asset at the desired price point, without being adversely affected by slippage or other market inefficiencies.

Another important aspect of scalping is risk management. Since this strategy involves making a large number of trades, it's important to keep your losses small and your profits consistent. This means setting tight stop-loss orders and taking profits quickly when the market moves in your favor.

Of course, there are other strategies that can be effective in cryptocurrency trading, such as swing trading or trend following. The key is to find a strategy that works for your individual trading style and risk tolerance.

In addition to strategy, it's also important to stay up-to-date with the latest news and developments in the cryptocurrency market. This can include following industry influencers on social media, reading relevant news articles, and staying abreast of regulatory changes that may impact the market.

Ultimately, successful cryptocurrency trading requires a combination of skill, knowledge, and discipline. By implementing effective strategies, managing risk carefully, and staying informed about market trends, you can increase your chances of success in this exciting and rapidly-evolving space.

James Chatters,2y,What is the Bitcoin recovery phrase?,"The recovery phrase can be used to add access to the same wallet on multiple devices or to restore your wallet on a new device (e.g. you lost or broke the original device). A seed phrase, seed recovery phrase or backup seed phrase is a list of words which store all the information needed to recover Bitcoin funds on-chain. Wallet software will typically generate a seed phrase and instruct the user to write it down on paper. Bitcoin and Liquid wallets use a very large, secret number called a private key as a way to send and receive transactions securely. The recovery phrase represents your wallet's private key in a human-readable format. Representing the key as a series of words instead of a long string of letters and numbers minimizes the risk of errors when you write it down. What you really need to know is that the recovery phrase is the origin of all your private keys and public addresses. This means that anyone with access to that recovery phrase would be able to move your funds at any time. As long as you have your seed phrase, you have your crypto. If you lose a hardware wallet on a bus or break a phone containing a software wallet, you haven’t lost your crypto, you can simply enter your seed phrase into another wallet.

There are some secrets to successful cryptocurrency trading that can help you navigate the market and make informed decisions.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:

1. Do your research: Before investing in any cryptocurrency, it's important to do your due diligence. Read up on the technology behind each coin, its market cap, and the team behind the project. This will help you make informed decisions about which coins to buy and when to buy them.

2. Follow the news: Keep up with the latest developments in the crypto world. News can have a big impact on the price of cryptocurrencies, so staying informed can help you make smart trades.

3. Use technical analysis: Technical analysis involves analyzing price charts and market data to identify patterns and trends. This can help you predict future price movements and make more informed trades.

4. Use stop-loss orders: A stop-loss order is an order to sell a cryptocurrency at a certain price point. This can help you limit your losses if the market takes a turn for the worse.

5. Diversify your portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across multiple cryptocurrencies to reduce your risk.

6. Don't let emotions guide your decisions: Fear and greed can lead to bad decisions. Stick to your trading plan and avoid making impulsive trades based on emotions.

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.

The most important thing is competition. Due to heavy competition, cryptocurrencies are continually improving themselves and the technologies that they are using. This paves the way for a lot of innovation and improved performance and security measures.

Bitcoin may have had a greater chunk of share in the sector initially. But with the introduction of new cryptocurrencies and sophisticated & transparent technologies, the gap is diminishing as every day passes.

Mary Haylee,3y,What is cryptocurrency stacking?,"Cryptocurrency Staking Basics

In cryptocurrency staking is, from a user perspective, like being paid interest for holding a coin.

From a more technical perspective, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an alternative to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining model.

Instead of miners cracking cryptographic puzzles using computing power to verify transactions like they do with PoW, with PoS users with existing coins verify transactions in proportion to the amount of coins they have locked or “bound” in a staking wallet.

From a user perspective, all a person has to do is keep a certain amount of coins locked up for a certain length of time and they will earn newly minted coins (either the base coin, or a related coin). The length and minimum staking amount differ by which cryptocurrency we are discussing.

Without going into the details, in general with this method a person must stake a large amount of coins. Given this, people tend to join staking pools or more generally keep their coins on a platform that shares staking rewards.

A simple example of this is found with Binance. Binance offers staking rewards for some PoS coins including NEO, ONT, VET and NPXS. NEO produces GAS, ONT produces ONG, VET produces VTHO, and NPXS produces more NPXS.

Of course, there are more PoS coins than that, for example ADA has a staking system. So for ADA you would have to find a staking pool.

NOTE: There is no real risk to staking beyond these two points,

1. You have to keep your coins locked up, so you are vulnerable to price volatility, and

2. When it comes to staking pools you have to find a pool you can trust (any pool that is in charge of payouts requires you to trust a human at some level).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lpn50oi8tb3fkycs', 'title': 'What is cryptocurrency stacking?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Cryptocurrency Staking Basics\n\nIn cryptocurrency staking is, from a user perspective, like being paid interest for holding a coin.\n\nFrom a more technical perspective, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an alternative to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining model.\n\nInstead of miners cracking cryptographic puzzles using computing power to verify transactions like they do with PoW, with PoS users with existing coins verify transactions in proportion to the amount of coins they have locked or “bound” in a staking wallet.\n\nFrom a user perspective, all a person has to do is keep a certain amount of coins locked up for a certain length of time and they will earn newly minted coins (either the base coin, or a related coin).

Leno Brun,4y,Is all crypto dependent on Bitcoin?,"If you were to play a word association game with anyone in the general public, and said “cryptocurrency”, the first thing they would say would almost definitely be “Bitcoin”. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are effectively interchangeable to a large portion of the world, and this might be a bad thing.

By having it so all cryptocurrencies are painted with the same broad strokes that Bitcoin is, all nuance disappears and it becomes easier to dismiss the industry as a whole. This is extremely unfortunate, as many of the most interesting use cases of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are completely unrelated to Bitcoin.

Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these
Cryptocurrencies are heading to, DON'T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too until i came across Multicoinbank Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.multicoinbank,com) where i get double of my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency.

The Economic Risk

And if someone were to want to deposit money into their Binance account, they would most likely end up doing it using BTC or ETH (although Binance does allow deposits with other coins like LTC, NEO and BNB). Because of this, you have a strange correlation between Bitcoin and the entire sector. Would-be-investors must purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum in order to put their money in altcoins, and this pushes up the price of these more “blue chip” coins.

Right now, everything is valued in accordance with Bitcoin. Part of the reason for the massive run-up of crypto prices occurred in late 2017 is Bitcoin was continuing to increase in price, and a rising tide carries all ships. The question becomes whether this turns Bitcoin into a transactional currency of sorts, and if it will end up being artificially propped up for this reason, if at least until another coin becomes seen as the transactional coin of choice.

With many Bitcoin enthusiasts calling for Bitcoin to hit astronomical values before the end of the year, the assumption is that the rest of the crypto sector would participate in that increase as well. But no one is asking the question: is this a good thing? The Internet was very similar in the beginning, but eventually it evolved and spawned numerous unrelated entities that all employed the technology. Now we are waiting for the same thing to happen with crypto.

The Security Risk

The industry is currently configured in a way such that the flow in and out of the Bitcoin ecosystem is easily monitored and controlled. The high level of centralization through major players like Coinbase has made it easy to track the flow of coins. Yes, this has allowed for an extensive analysis and segmentation of the various groups, as shown above, but it also impedes on the censorship resistant aspect of the cryptocurrency.

If you have most cryptocurrency purchases flowing through Bitcoin and Ethereum, and Bitcoin addresses can already be tracked with relative ease by other companies in the space, then does one of the main promises of Bitcoin disappear?

The Political Risk

Finally, and maybe most importantly, does the dependency on Bitcoin create something very similar to a centralized node? And does this hurt the future of Bitcoin by not being able to provide the same anonymity that was originally anticipated?

It has always been assumed that decentralization was a good thing, and that sort of power shift is much of what Bitcoin originally promised to its users. But along with decentralization are a bunch of other characteristics that need to be continually supported for Bitcoin to maintain its value.

For example, Bitcoin needs to stay “trustless”, and as soon as users question the security of the network, all is lost. And censorship resistance by way of anonymity was always a libertarian dream that Bitcoin seemed to guarantee, but it is possible that the overly centralized exchanges have compromised that.

Centralized exchanges are currently necessary to convert money from fiat to crypto. You can use decentralized exchanges to trade between different cryptocurrencies, but you will need a centralized exchange in order to get your money into the market. This can be very frustrating if you are trying to avoid volunteering identification information, or just feel that it is a violation of what Bitcoin is all about.

There are tons of advantages to decentralized exchanges, such as the security and reliability, which are two notable issues with centralized exchanges right now. One of the most commonly given beginner tips regarding crypto is to keep your assets off the exchange, lest it be compromised. Currently these exchanges are much more expensive to use, but prices are coming down as kinks are worked out and a higher level of scale is reached. This bodes well for the network and the entire industry, because of the added confidence both insiders and outsiders will have in the technology.

To be considered “decentralized”, a project must be both censorship resistant and immune to any authoritarian modifications. Technically, the current use of Bitcoin fulfills these conditions, but in spirit, we are starting to see the centralized rent-seeking of massive exchanges make things appear a lot more ambiguous. So then the question is, does this threaten the whole crypto industry?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/s1b78paheiruywnm', 'title': 'Is all crypto dependent on Bitcoin?', 'score': {'original': 0.998, 'ai': 0.002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""If you were to play a word association game with anyone in the general public, and said “cryptocurrency”, the first thing they would say would almost definitely be “Bitcoin”.

Mary Gate,4y,Why would you have doubts in investing on bitcoins?,"If you only knew just how trivial is the reason behind the endless rise of bitcoin, you’d get your grandmother to invest as well.

And I am surprised to find people who still do not understand it.

How do people still come up with platitudes about bubbles, virtual currencies, passing fashions when they talk about bitcoin and crypto-currencies?

The rise of Bitcoin is tied to a very simple reason – anyone can understand it.

It is a matter of common mathematics. Easy like putting two and two together…

Faced with such a simple explanation, only those who are disingenuous or do not even want to bother seeing sense can afford to have residual doubts.

Now that you can invest hugely on Power-Miner Startup Lab (www.power-miner.store) where you can get daily profit off your bitcoin investments for as long as 6 months through mining and daily trading, then life is getting better for Bitcoin investors now. Thanks to the world cryptocurrency leaders for bringing in other options of earning cryptocurrency

Would you like to know the true, foolish reason why bitcoin can only continue to rise?

Here you go.

As you may already know, bitcoins as well as other crypto-currencies are bought on special platforms called exchanges, similar to those used for ordinary stock exchange transactions.

Now, let’s apply some real primary school-level calculations to one of the most famous of these platforms: 
Coinbase (but we could do the same to any other type).

Are you ready to calculate? It is a question of simple additions.

If you have forgotten how to do so, you can maybe rely on your 5 year old son to help you out…

Coinbase, the famous American exchange, adds about 55,000 new users a day from around the world.

In one month, 1.7 million new users enter the platform and buy some digital currency (mainly bitcoins).

Let’s a very poor estimate and assume only half of these new users actually invest, while the other half forgets that they have opened their accounts and, let’s see, maybe they go to the beach instead.

Let’s say that for the former half, the average investment is very low, let’s go with $3,000 per head (way less than half the value of a bitcoin).

I suspect that this may be a very low average, perhaps too low, but I want the calculation to have all figures against it…

Now, as much as I’d like to keep the calculations low so as not to traumatise the skeptics out there, this influx of 1.7 million new users on Coinbase, of which only half invests on average only $3,000, is still injecting more than $2.5 billion a month in this platform!

I am sorry, there is nothing I can do about it. You saw how I tried to keep my calculations low… But unfortunately, when we talk about crypto-currencies, the words “low”,”moderate”,”limited”,”measured” do not make any sense…

So, a minimum of $2.5 billion enters Coinbase each month. Suck it up: that’s just how it goes.

Are you lost? Let us recap:

55,000 new users per day amount to 1.7 million users per month.

If half of these 1.7 million users invest on average $3000 per head, it produces an inflow of $2.5 billion in just one month.

Now, the question is: will there ever be sufficient availability of bitcoins to meet this incredible demand?

Maybe now you’re beginning to understand…

Exactly: the rise of bitcoin is a matter of simple imbalance between supply and demand… as they teach in Economics 101.

On the supply side, 1,800 bitcoins are currently “extracted” every day.

Not every of them gets sold, but let’s pretend that they do (again, I mean to give as much advantage as possible to the skeptics out there).

At the current quotation of 1 bitcoin (approximately $8.220) these 1800 bitcoins daily amount to $14.8 million, which in a month amount to $443 million worth of new bitcoins extracted.

Now all you have to do is compare supply and demand and see what comes up.

On the one hand, we said that in a single platform, Coinbase (and there are at least 20 other equally important ones worldwide) there is a monthly demand of USD 2.5 billions.

On the other hand, the monthly offer of new bitcoins amounts to just USD 443 millions.

And, as I mentioned earlier, the pressure on purchasing is more or less similar in all the other most important platforms, and it adds up to the already impressive one of Coinbase…

While on the supply side, those USD 443 millions in bitcoin stay the same. It’s not a loaves and fishes kind of miracle.

To this simple calculation, which I believe is already capable of silencing any naysayers, we must then add other “aggravating factors” (aggravating for all skeptics out there, but not for those who invest, of course):

– In this interesting survey it turns out that only 1/3 of the current bitcoin buyers have already sold something. The majority, more than 60%, has never sold a single bitcoin of those purchased so far.

– To individual investors who are so reluctant to sell their bitcoins, you have to add the entry into the market of large hedge funds (currently, over 130 of them) that are buying yp every bitcoin available.

– Then, you have to add that the CME is about to launch the first futures on bitcoin (which will cause other waves of purchases)

– …Which in turn will pave the way for the most commercial investment funds (Etfs, mutual funds etc.). They’re still hesitant… but you’ll see, when it comes to earning money they will not back out.

– Here’s the icing on the cake: the total number of bitcoins is fixed and immutable, and amounts to 21 million (it is known that bitcoins are not inflationable, as we have explained here).

– If you haven’t yet got it all, putting all these elements together you will have the recipe for an unprecedented scarcity of an asset, served on a silver platter on one of the most favorable market situations in history.

This is a rush to the purchase of epic proportions, which only a hermit on top of a mountain would fail to notice.

Now, in the face of these simple figures, do we still want to talk about bubbles, algorithms and Chinese conspiracies?

To deny the evidence of these figures, you really can’t do anything but take refuge in those blogs that talk about chemtrails or UFOs.

The reality is exactly what it seems and there is no other possible interpretation. It’s a simple issue of supply and demand…

The normal reaction in the face of all this would be: “Damn, this is a unique opportunity that will never be repeated in history. I’m really lucky to be alive right now. Let’s see how I can take advantage of it…”!

Instead there is a good slice of the population which, precisely because of these staggering figures, is doubtful – and they turn around and run.

Lack of information or difficulties in investing are no longer a factor.

We are overflowing with bitcoin news and the platforms for investing are increasingly within everyone’s reach.

I believe that the reluctance of some people is only due to human nature.

Faced with the unexpected possibility of improving one’s life with little effort and a great result, humanity is split in two.

There are those who immediately react and take advantage of the chance provided, and those who get stuck, as if they were in front of a ghost.

I am convinced of this, so I no longer take notice.

In the end, after all, what can I do?

I’ve done all my duty as to inform you: it is up to others to make their minds.

What about you, what do you think?

What slice of humanity do you belong to?

I do not mean to judge you and I will respect you, whatever you come up with.

The only thing I can add is that if you are not interested in this topic I can do nothing more for you.

While on the other hand, if you are convinced that you are in an unrepeatable moment of history, if it’s clear that such favorable market conditions have not existed for at least the last two centuries, then there is still one thing I can do for you…

I can advise you to take all your countermeasures to get yourself into this market with the lowest possible risk.

It is one thing to acknowledge that we are living in a phase of enormous supply shortages in the face of a demand that is growing at a never-seen-before rate… But why not be cautious and give up on a calm, risk-free type of investment?

Even when a market is very strong, you always have the right/duty (towards yourself) to minimize the risks.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9zt2fbs4q0k3o5da', 'title': 'Why would you have doubts in investing on bitcoins?', 'score': {'original': 0.6547, 'ai': 0.3453}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'If you only knew just how trivial is the reason behind the endless rise of bitcoin, you’d get your grandmother to invest as well.\n\nAnd I am surprised to find people who still do not understand it.\n\nHow do people still come up with platitudes about bubbles, virtual currencies, passing fashions when they talk about bitcoin and crypto-currencies?\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin is tied to a very simple reason – anyone can understand it.\n\nIt is a matter of common mathematics.

Esquivel Ada,9mo,How much cash do I need to start trading and buying crypto?,"The world of cryptocurrency trading can be a lucrative and exciting one, but it's important to approach it with caution and a clear understanding of the risks involved. One of the most common questions that newbies to the crypto world ask is how much cash they need to start trading and buying crypto. The answer to this question is a bit more complicated than you might think, but I'll do my best to break it down for you.

Firstly, it's worth mentioning that there are a number of Telegram crypto pump groups out there that promise to deliver ""surefire"" tips and signals for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. While these groups can be useful for staying up-to-date on the latest market trends, it's important to approach them with caution. Not all of these groups are reputable, and some may even be scams or pump-and-dump schemes designed to manipulate the market.

With that said, let's get back to the question at hand: how much cash do you need to start trading and buying crypto? The truth is that there's no set amount that's required to get started in this field. You could start with as little as $10 or $20 if you wanted to. However, keep in mind that the more money you have to invest, the more potential profit (or loss) you can generate.

When you're first starting out, it's a good idea to focus on learning the basics of cryptocurrency trading before diving in with a large sum of money. This means researching different cryptocurrencies, understanding their underlying technology and market trends, and developing a solid trading strategy.

Once you're ready to start investing, consider starting small and gradually increasing your investment over time as you gain experience and confidence. It's also important to diversify your portfolio by investing in multiple cryptocurrencies rather than putting all your eggs in one basket.

In conclusion, while there's no set amount of cash required to start trading and buying crypto, it's important to approach this field with caution and a clear understanding of the risks involved. Start small, research thoroughly, and diversify your portfolio to maximize your potential profits and minimize your losses. And remember, never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Russell Woodrow,2y,"Why is Bitcoin so unstable, and what can be done to change this?","Bitcoin volatility is also driven in large part by varying perceptions of the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency as a store of value and method of value transfer. A store of value is the function by which an asset can be useful in the future with some predictability. A store of value can be saved and exchanged for some good or service in the future.

Just google CryptoFXnetwork for more details and steps to be taken or visit (www . cryptoFXnetwork . com).

A method of value transfer is any object or concept used to transmit property in the form of assets from one party to another. Bitcoin’s volatility at the present makes it a somewhat unclear store of value, but it promises nearly frictionless value transfer. As a result, we see that bitcoin's value can swing based on news events much as we observe with fiat currencies.

Large Currency Holder Risks

Bitcoin volatility is also to an extent driven by holders of large proportions of the total outstanding float of the currency. For bitcoin investors with current holdings above around $10M, it is not clear how they would liquidate a position that large into a fiat position without severely moving the market. Indeed, it may not be clear how they would liquidate a position of that size in a short period of time at all, as most cryptocurrency exchanges impose 24-hour withdrawal limits far below that threshold.

Bitcoin has not reached the mass market adoption rates that would be necessary to provide option value to large holders of the currency.

Security Breaches Cause Volatility

Bitcoin can also become volatile when the bitcoin community exposes security vulnerabilities in an effort to produce massive open source responses in the form of security fixes. This approach to security is paradoxically one that produces great outcomes, with many valuable open source software initiatives to its credit, including Linux. Bitcoin developers must reveal security concerns to the public in order to produce robust solutions.

It was a hack that drove the Yapian Youbit to bankruptcy, while many other cryptocurrencies have also made headlines for being hacked or having stashes of cryptocurrencies stolen. As an early example, in April 2014, the OpenSSL vulnerabilities attacked by the Heartbleed bug and reported by Google security's, Neel Mehta, drove Bitcoin prices down by 10% in a month.

Bitcoin and open source software development are built upon the same fundamental premise that a copy of the source code is available to users to examine. This concept makes it the responsibility of the community to voice concerns about the software design, just as it is the responsibility of the community to come to consensus about modifications to that underlying source code as well. Because of the open conversation and debate regarding the Bitcoin network, security breaches tend to be highly publicized.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1tlfn8ycj7ur4k30', 'title': 'Why is Bitcoin so unstable, and what can be done to change this?', 'score': {'original': 0.51165, 'ai': 0.48835}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Bitcoin volatility is also driven in large part by varying perceptions of the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency as a store of value and method of value transfer.

Northrop Ora,Sun,What are cryptocurrencies?,"A cryptocurrency refers to a type of currency that operates in a decentralized manner, without any government authorization. It is a product of the digital age and functions without the involvement of banks, governments, or intermediaries. However, in most cases, individuals need to utilize a digital currency exchange to buy or sell their digital assets. There are various types of cryptocurrencies available, including Bitcoins, Bitcoin cash, and Litecoin. Bitcoins are widely recognized as a popular form of digital currency. They are generated through computational solutions to complex mathematical problems and function independently from central banks, making them decentralized. Bitcoins fall under the category of Tokens, which are often obtained through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), similar to a stock offering. Although not officially classified as money, Bitcoins can be used for encryption purposes, such as bill payments. Bitcoin cash, introduced in 2017, is another variant of bitcoin. It differs from Bitcoin in that it has a smaller block size, with Bitcoin cash having 1MB compared to Bitcoin's 8MB. This smaller block size enables faster transactions for users. Litecoin shares similar fundamentals to Bitcoin and was created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. Lee aimed to develop a cryptocurrency that could complement Bitcoin by offering quicker transaction confirmation times and a different hashing algorithm. In conclusion, cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the concept of currency by operating outside traditional financial systems. With various types available, including Bitcoins, Bitcoin cash, and Litecoin, individuals have options for engaging in digital transactions without relying on banks or governments.

Sara Wilson,Mon,What are the factors affecting the price of Bitcoin (USD)?,"Understanding the factors that affect the price of BTC is important for investors who want to maximize returns and effectively manage risk. Several key factors can affect the price of Bitcoin:

1 - Market Demand and Acceptance: The level of demand for BTC plays an important role in determining its value. As more people accept Bitcoin and use it for transactions, its value can increase.

2 – Regulatory Developments: Government regulations and policies can have a big impact on the price of Bitcoin. Positive regulatory developments can create confidence and increase demand, while negative regulation can have the opposite effect.

3 – Technological developments: The development of new technologies and improvements to the Bitcoin network can have a positive impact on its value. For example, the implementation of the Lightning Network increased Bitcoin's scalability and transaction speed, making it more attractive to investors.

4 - Macroeconomic factors: economic conditions such as inflation rates, interest rates and geopolitical events can affect the price of Bitcoin. Investors often turn to bitcoin as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty, which can increase its value.

5 – Market Sentiment: The general sentiment and perception of Bitcoin in the investment community can affect its value. Positive news and investor confidence can lead to increased demand and higher prices, while negative news can lead to lower sales and lower prices.

6 – As an investor: it is important to be aware of these factors and monitor their potential impact on the price of Bitcoin. This knowledge can help you make investment decisions and navigate the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

Arteaga Leila,Feb 15,What are cryptocurrencies?,"Cryptocurrency, also known as crypto, is a digital form of cash that operates on blockchain technology. In order to fully understand its implications, it is important to first grasp the concept of currencies. Currencies are mediums of exchange, and our current currency differs from commodity money. Commodity money, such as gold and silver, is created from precious metals. On the other hand, representative money represents a claim on a specific commodity. The government has control over the supply and circulation of this currency, and it has the power to print notes at its discretion. However, the increase in the number of printed notes can lead to inflation. As more notes are circulated, the value of each note decreases. This highlights the need for banks, which play a crucial role in verifying transactions. For instance, if I need to send money to America, the bank acts as an intermediary. It verifies the transaction, converts the currency into dollars, and facilitates the transfer. Banks are essential for transactions involving fiat currency. In contrast, cryptocurrency does not require an intermediary body. It is a hidden currency that serves as a medium of exchange in a digital format. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using cryptocurrency. Advantages include increased security and privacy due to the encryption techniques used in blockchain technology. Transactions made with cryptocurrency are also faster and more efficient compared to traditional banking systems. Additionally, cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network, meaning no single entity has control over it. However, there are also disadvantages to consider. One major concern is the volatility of cryptocurrency prices. The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly, making it a risky investment. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies are not yet widely accepted as a form of payment, limiting their practicality in everyday transactions. As for the legality of cryptocurrency in India, it remains a topic of debate. The government has not yet issued clear regulations regarding its usage. However, there have been discussions about implementing regulations to prevent illegal activities associated with cryptocurrency. In conclusion, cryptocurrency is a digital form of cash that operates on blockchain technology. While it offers advantages such as increased security and efficiency, there are also drawbacks to consider, such as price volatility. The legality of cryptocurrency in India is still uncertain, as the government has not yet established clear regulations.

Emily Connor,Dec 12,"I have just lost $10,000 BTC to scammers. How do I recover my money back?","Online cryptocurrency scam results in significant financial losses for more consumers each month.

Victims in the United States have lost more than $4 billion to sophisticated criminal networks and hackers over the past year.

Sophisticated networks, often based abroad, host fictitious trading platforms that appear legitimate but are programmed to show fake trading profits and fraudulently route consumer funds.

Platforms appear so authentic that the average user cannot distinguish a fraudulent cryptocurrency website from a legitimate website.

It is believed that once a victim’s cryptocurrency is transferred from their wallet, typically held on a centralized exchange, to a decentralized exchange or private wallet, the funds are lost forever.

What to do after an investment loss.

If you are the victim if an investment scam, it can be a heartbreaking experience.

However, there are steps you can take to get your money back, protect yourself, and seek justice.

The first step is to contact an experienced recovery specialist, like those at Proupshot.

A recovery specialist can help you understand your rights and options, and guide you through recovery process.

Tracing Funds

This puts the victim in a very difficult situation.

A separate investigation and prosecution of these cases may be an option.

In some cases, teams with a good mix of investigative and forensic tracing capabilities, combined with an asset recovery specialist with experience in investigations and cryptocurrency law, can sometimes help.

Locate lost funds, recover them and identify bad actors.

While it is difficult to recover stolen cryptocurrency from a fraudster’s private wallet, blockchain provides very useful information and evidence and offers possible recovery routes.

Unlike traditional money transfers with financial institutions, every blockchain transaction is publicly recorded and accessible to those who know how to look for it.

Each transfer is trackable and important information related to the transfer is stored on the blockchain.

The data collected included the wallet address where the stolen cryptocurrency was sent.

The recipient’s address is available for identification by a qualified professional through a tracing process, which may reveal the amount of stolen funds in the criminal’s wallet.

Other useful information is available about the movement of funds and the recipient’s wallet activity.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o7d2wvhe1lu6gfjb', 'title': 'I have just lost $10,000 BTC to scammers.

Gilbert Ferguson,Mon,What are cryptocurrencies?,"Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary form of currency that eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries such as banks. Instead, it relies on cryptographic proofs to verify transactions. In contrast, traditional fiat currency transactions involve banks deducting money from the sender's account and crediting it to the receiver's account, all while charging hefty fees and taking several days to confirm.

The inefficiencies and high costs associated with traditional remittance systems and large-scale transactions highlight the need for a more streamlined and cost-effective alternative. This is where cryptocurrencies shine. By using cryptographic proofs to validate transactions and recording them on an unalterable ledger called the blockchain, cryptocurrencies ensure secure and efficient transfers without the need to trust third parties.

Whether you are sending $100 to a friend or $1 million to someone across the globe, the process remains the same in terms of fees and time to confirm the transaction. This level playing field makes cryptocurrencies an attractive option for individuals looking to make hassle-free transactions without unnecessary costs.

Nicholas The Crypto Fiend,23h,Is this the start of crypto bull run?,"The biggest bull run in crypto history is near, and you need to be ready.

Many will hate me for sharing this for FREE, as these secrets will sort winners from losers.

7 years in crypto in one ultimate trading guide 👇

Everything in world is cyclical, and history repeats itself time and again. Crypto is no exception. All bull runs started a year before and continue for a year after BTC halving.

Every time we think the cycle must eventually end, and each time we REKT again.

I've seen 2 bull runs and believe 2024 will be a super-cycle, where everyone can make it. To make it on bull run, understanding of market, is crucial, you need to know how to buy low, sell high.

It's crucial to know how the market is manipulated and how to exit traps as winner. I made $130k from $1k in the last bull run, after which I dumped it back to $8k.

In 2023, I turned $8k into $2M and plan to make at least $10M in this bull run.

Here's everything u need to know about TA, why it works, and how you're being manipulated 👇

Many don't get why TA(Technical Analysis) works; it's simple:

Charts aren't just candles; they reflect market sentiment. Each movement signifies one thing: crowd manipulation.

To earn, you don't need to blindly memorize chart patterns, but understand the meaning that whales, put into them.

1/➮ Now let's move on to how to identify this on the charts:

It's best to view charts through TradingView

✧ So, go to: tradingview

✧ Sign Up

✧ Set up your chart, remove all the noise, and make it sexy, cause with default settings, there's a chance you'll throw up on your PC

2/➮ Analyze chart from higher time frame to lower one cause:

✧ The higher time frame support and resistance levels will be stronger

✧ You need to Identify the trend starting from higher tf, cause it could be uptrend on 1d but you'll think the market is bearish since it is on 1h.

3/➮ Understand how support levels work:

Support level - a price range that attracts traders' interest.

✧ The more touches and rejections, the more significant the level becomes for prices, but after 4-5 touches, the level often breaks through, and here's why:

With each touch, new players enter long positions at this level, placing stop losses below it, where whales f*ck everyone.

Prices are intentionally squeezed down, liquidating long positions, and then continue pushing the chart upwards.

Here's how you can profit from this:

Order block:

You can open a position by entering where the bullish impulse started, placing a short stop loss below the close of that candle.

There's a large volume of purchases = a strong level, which is likely to pull the price back up, unless the trend changes.

4/➮ But wait, there's a second outcome - the trend changes, and after breaking the level, we go lower:

In such a case, we'll also be stopped out, and we'll lose this trade.

So how do we make money if there are 2 outcomes, meaning we're literally playing roulette on red/black:

Risk management is our middle name:

Trading isn't about luck; it's about consistency and discipline. Nobody can win 1000/1000 trades, as there are no prophets in this world.

So, our task is to build a system that earns over the long term:

Let's say you trade one pattern and perfect it. Your risk/reward is 1/3, meaning 1% loss on a loss, and 3% win on a win.

Even with a win rate of 50%, you'll consistently make money.

5/➮ There are three types of trends:

Flat - when the price is roughly within the same range.

Uptrend - each subsequent low and high of the price is higher than the previous one

Downtrend - each subsequent low and high of the price is lower than the previous one

I'm against playing the lottery or trying to catch that very reversal

So here's how to emerge a winner from any situation:

Downtrend - learn/Buy lows/Work IRL

Flat - Trade, make smart moves

Uptrend - Ape in everything there's no tomorrow, but always fix 50% of profits

6/➮ The Last Basic Tool: Fibonacci Retracement

✧ Fibonacci levels are used to determine optimal buying points for an asset.

✧ Key levels include:

- 0.5 (50% price correction)

- 0.618 (61.8% price correction)

- 0.786 (78.6% price correction)

Here's how to use Fibonacci retracement:

✧ After a bullish price movement, draw levels from the bottom point to the top

✧ These levels will indicate optimal buying zones

✧ It's not a cure-all, but it can be used as an auxiliary tool, when you need more confirmations.

7/➮ And finally, work on yourself by creating your system:

You might know everything in crypto and trading, but if you can't control your emotions, your only path is to McDonald's.

Nobody can win 1000/1000 trades, as there are no prophets in this world.\n\nSo, our task is to build a system that earns over the long term:\n\nLet\'s say you trade one pattern and perfect it. Your risk/reward is 1/3, meaning 1% loss on a loss, and 3% win on a win.\n\nEven with a win rate of 50%, you\'ll consistently make money.\n\n5/➮ There are three types of trends:\n\nFlat - when the price is roughly within the same range.\n\nUptrend - each subsequent low and high of the price is higher than the previous one\n\nDowntrend - each subsequent low and high of the price is lower than the previous one\n\nI\'m against playing the lottery or trying to catch that very reversal\n\nSo here\'s how to emerge a winner from any situation:\n\nDowntrend - learn/Buy lows/Work IRL\n\nFlat - Trade, make smart moves\n\nUptrend - Ape in everything there\'s no tomorrow, but always fix 50% of profits\n\n6/➮ The Last Basic Tool: Fibonacci Retracement\n\n✧ Fibonacci levels are used to determine optimal buying points for an asset.\n\n✧ Key levels include:\n\n- 0.5 (50% price correction)\n\n- 0.618 (61.8% price correction)\n\n- 0.786 (78.6% price correction)\n\nHere\'s how to use Fibonacci retracement:\n\n✧ After a bullish price movement, draw levels from the bottom point to the top\n\n✧ These levels will indicate optimal buying zones\n\n✧ It\'s not a cure-all, but it can be used as an auxiliary tool, when you need more confirmations.\n\n7/➮ And finally, work on yourself by creating your system:\n\nYou might know everything in crypto and trading, but if you can\'t control your emotions, your only path is to McDonald\'s.\n\nIf you enjoyed this answer\n\nKindly upvote and follow my space ""Defi Club"" for more exciting DeFi insights & general learnings like this😉.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.02705

Wilfred Edmund,2y,Could increased interest in cryptocurrencies ultimately hurt the stock market?,"I didn't plan on spending more time in today's Chart Advisor on bitcoin, but volatility in the cryptocurrency's price over the past 24 hours is worth some additional discussion. Even for non-crypto traders, this is important because it can affect the stock market in unexpected ways.

Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies might be heading to, DON’T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don’t be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency.

Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.

The bitcoin to U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate dropped more than 12% today, with $1,800 of those losses happening last night over a period of 10 minutes. As I mentioned yesterday, the closer bitcoin gets to its prior highs between $14,000 and $19,000, the more likely it is for investors who have been holding losses to trigger a sell-off. This is a phenomenon we see frequently with penny stocks that periodically ""go hyperbolic.""

The overnight selling seems to have been potentially worsened by technical outages at Coinbase, Inc., one of the big bitcoin exchanges. I will admit to having a skeptical bias against bitcoin as a currency because volatility is so high. Ideally, a medium of exchange is best when it has a relatively stable and reliable value over the medium term.

Whether or not you are a fan of the central bank based monetary systems used by the major reserve currencies – the U.S. dollar (USD), euro (EUR), Japanese yen (JPY), British pound (GBP), etc., their fluctuations are much smaller and occur over a longer period than BTC. That doesn't mean cryptocurrencies aren't going to be adopted more widely for exchange eventually, but it will take a while before that happens.

Even if you aren't that interested in cryptocurrencies, the bitcoin rally should still be monitored. There are several companies in the stock market that are used as a proxy for bitcoin, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), that swing up and down with the currency. These companies make processors used by ""bitcoin miners"" to create more bitcoin supply, and their share price rises and falls like industrial equipment makers during the gold boom of 2001 to 2012.

I am not even going to bother discussing the several penny stocks who changed their names to capitalize on bitcoin mania over the past two years (cough, Long Blockchain Corp, cough), but they will also probably spike and crash with the currency.

The lesson here is that tech investors must include some analysis of the bitcoin market when evaluating any positions in the semiconductor sector. Even if not directly involved in the bitcoin mining process, other companies are likely to benefit or suffer along with NVIDIA and AMD as the market whipsaws.

As you can see in the following chart, NVIDIA has been following bitcoin closely through the big declines last year and has recently turned higher as bitcoin was able to get above the $8,000 mark, where many miners are able to get above breakeven. I have shown the chart as a percentage to better illustrate the relationship. If this round of crypto-frenzy collapses early, we could see semiconductors and processor makers correct very quickly, which increases the risk of the sector's recent performance.

S&P 500

Concerns about trade seemed to pull on the S&P 500 yesterday, leading to a negative close. Today's performance was a little better, but the talks between Chinese President Xi and President Trump at the G-20 meetings over the next two days are still the most significant X-factor influencing prices

While I remain cautiously bullish to neutral in my own bias as investors prepare for second quarter earnings season, I continue to be concerned that long-term yields have not turned higher yet. As you can see in the following chart, the S&P 500 and the 10-year Treasury yield's divergence over the past two months has been persistent. Because yields have been so stubborn, I am concerned that, without positive news on trade this weekend, the divergence will snap back into alignment through a drop in equity prices rather than a spike in yields.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/32ozf8ej9l0dtcy7', 'title': 'Could increased interest in cryptocurrencies ultimately hurt the stock market?', 'score': {'original': 0.49355, 'ai': 0.50645}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I didn\'t plan on spending more time in today\'s Chart Advisor on bitcoin, but volatility in the cryptocurrency\'s price over the past 24 hours is worth some additional discussion.

Douglas A Cole,3y,How long does it take to get rich if you are trading cryptocurrencies?,"If you're ruing the decision not to dip your toes into the cryptocurrency market, and feel like you are one of the few that missed out, don't worry, you're not. Even with the recent plunge in prices, bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices remain well above historical levels. The New York Times published an article over the weekend titled Everyone is Getting Hilariously Rich and You Are Rich where a bunch of white dudes dressed like they pioneered the Williamsburg hipster movement told their stories of cryptocurrency success, leaving casual readers to wonder, why not me?

However, despite the media frenzy, distribution data suggest you are not alone if you don't own bitcoin, and if you do, you are certainly not getting rich. While millions read about surging cryptocurrency prices and growing market caps, the number of actual wallets widening is just a handful.

I came across a legit bitcoin doubling investment platform (www.protocrypto.tech)

You do not have to go through the risk and stress of trading , they will invest your capital and you’d get your interest within few hours or days right inside your wallet.

So it is your choice to continue investing with them or not because your wallet will be instantly funded.

According to bit info,, which tracks the total number and value of bitcoin addresses, 75% of addresses are home to less than 0.01 bitcoin, and 97.54% have a balance of less than one bitcoin. So at its current price of $10,100, three-quarters of bitcoin addresses are worth just over $100. And at the other end of the scale, the number of addresses with balances between 100,000 and 1,000,000 is three, or 0.0000106%. And in monetary terms, the bitcoin millionaire buzz is more a fuzz. Just 0.07% percent of addresses are worth more than $1 million whereas 74.5% of addresses are worth less than $1

Like I said above , I will be give to give a shot so you can make people around you fetch from this well.

You can actually do this with as low as what you have.

Henry Hike,4y,What can potentially cause the ultimate demise of Bitcoin?,"The bad old days are back. Crypto prices are in free fall and no one’s sure where the bottom lies. Even mighty Bitcoin wasn’t spared as prices crashed below the $6,000 mark—regarded by many as an unofficial floor—and then fell further to below $5,000. What’s going on?

Three recent events might explain the current collapse. The first is the SEC’s announcement on Friday that the operators of two “Initial Coin Offerings” (ICOs) broke the law by selling unlicensed securities, and must pay fines and restitution. As others have noted, this is only the beginning: Crypto bros spent most of 2017 poking the SEC bear, and now the bear is awake and ready to mete out a world of punishment. This development might be enough to spook some crypto investors, but it hardly come as a surprise. Anyone paying attention to the regulatory space knew this was coming, and so much of the fallout should have been priced into crypto token prices already.

Likewise, it’s hard to see how last week’s Bitcoin Cash fork—a second possible explanation for the crypto crash—could tank the market so badly. Sure, the fork was messy and created renewed centralization concerns over Bitcoin Cash. This hurt the price of Bitcoin Cash, and possibly spread contagion to the rest of the market. But Bitcoin Cash has always been dodgy and dysfunctional, and the crypto world has weathered forks before, so it’s hard to see how this triggered the crash.

This leaves a third possibility: Crypto investors got spooked by bad news from chip-makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which recently reported steep sales declines for cryptocurrency equipment. The sales declines suggest interest in crypto has waned, and is unlikely to pick up anytime soon. This could explain the chill on crypto asset prices, but also raises a chicken-and-egg question: Namely, is the chip makers’ misery a cause of the collapse, or just another symptom of it?

It’s possible, of course, that it was a conflation of all three events that KO’d the crypto markets. That would be welcome news for investors, in a sense, because it would mean individual shocks explain the downturn—and markets recover from shocks.

There is, however, a more existential explanation for the collapse: the whole thing is a bust. This is the position of tech exec Sam Gellman who, in a thoughtful series of tweets, points out that crypto has sucked up $30 billion in ICO money in two years and hasn’t delivered a user base beyond crypto speculators. It’s been ten years since Bitcoin came out, he says, and there is little of value to show for it. Needless to say, plenty of folks are popping up to refute Gellman but, if he’s right, look for investors to keep rushing for the exits.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j34uy9ozpqhged2b', 'title': 'What can potentially cause the ultimate demise of Bitcoin?', 'score': {'original': 0.5285, 'ai': 0.4715}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The bad old days are back.

Hope Rouse,Mon,What is the strategy for managing Bitcoin investments?,"Managing your Bitcoin investment requires careful planning and implementing an effective strategy. Here are some strategies to consider:

Define clear investment goals: Define your investment goals and create a clear plan for your Bitcoin investment. Determine your risk tolerance, investment horizon and desired return. A clear road map can help you focus and make informed decisions.

Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio: Although Bitcoin is often considered the king of cryptocurrencies, diversifying your cryptocurrency holdings is important. Consider investing in other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin or Ripple to spread your risk and maximize your returns.

Do Dollar Cost Averaging: Dollar cost averaging involves investing a certain amount of Bitcoins at a certain amount regardless of the price. This strategy helps reduce the impact of market volatility and allows you to collect Bitcoins over time.

Use a stop loss order: Using a stop loss order can help you protect your investment from significant losses. A stop-loss order will automatically sell bitcoins if the price falls below a certain threshold, limiting your potential losses.

Stay informed and adapt: ​​constantly monitor the cryptocurrency market, be aware of industry trends and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Bitcoin is a dynamic and fast-moving asset, and staying ahead of the curve is essential to successful investing.

Erika,Mon,Is Yoongi involved in any personal investments in Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies?

""I would go back in time to elementary school and buy Bitcoins.""

Boyd Pothier,Mon,What is the rise of Bitcoin as a viable investment option?,"Bitcoin's meteoric rise in popularity has not gone unnoticed by the investment community. In recent years, it has gained a lot of interest as a viable investment option. Several factors have contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as an investment asset.

One of the main drivers of Bitcoin's popularity is its significant profit potential. Since its inception, Bitcoin has seen a significant appreciation in price, which led to early adoption and wealthy investors. However, it should be noted that the price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results.

Another factor that contributes to Bitcoin's appeal is its limited supply. Unlike traditional currencies that can be printed on demand, Bitcoin has a supply of 21 million coins. This disadvantage leads to the adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation. As more investors realize the importance of diversifying their portfolio, the limited supply of bitcoins may further increase demand and value.

Caleb Temi,4y,Can I sell Bitcoins at a Bitcoin ATM?,"Yes!

When you sell bitcoins for cash using Bitcoin ATM, there are several general steps you need to go:

Verification step (optional, but normally for sell operations the operator will require you to identify yourself, however the identification procedure may vary for different machine types, or even operators running similar machines)
Send bitcoins to the given by bitcoin ATM QR code
Depending on the settings you will either get cash out of the machine immediately (may be set for small amounts), or you will be given the redeem code and need to wait for bitcoin transaction confirmations (normally 1 confirmation is used, but depends on the machine and operator, e.g. wallet update of Robocoin ATMs required customers to wait for 6 confirmations before they can get cash)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hravf4tm7bedzxys', 'title': 'Can I sell Bitcoins at a Bitcoin ATM?', 'score': {'original': 0.9963, 'ai': 0.0037}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes!\n\nWhen you sell bitcoins for cash using Bitcoin ATM, there are several general steps you need to go:\n\nVerification step (optional, but normally for sell operations the operator will require you to identify yourself, however the identification procedure may vary for different machine types, or even operators running similar machines)\nSend bitcoins to the given by bitcoin ATM QR code\nDepending on the settings you will either get cash out of the machine immediately (may be set for small amounts), or you will be given the redeem code and need to wait for bitcoin transaction confirmations (normally 1 confirmation is used, but depends on the machine and operator, e.g. wallet update of Robocoin ATMs required customers to wait for 6 confirmations before they can get cash)', 'result': {'fake': 0.0037, 'real': 0.9963}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1986644, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Yes!\n\nWhen you sell bitcoins for cash using Bitcoin ATM, there are several general steps you need to go:\n\nVerification step (optional, but normally for sell operations the operator will require you to identify yourself, however the identification procedure may vary for different machine types, or even operators running similar machines)\nSend bitcoins to the given by bitcoin ATM QR code\nDepending on the settings you will either get cash out of the machine immediately (may be set for small amounts), or you will be given the redeem code and need to wait for bitcoin transaction confirmations (normally 1 confirmation is used, but depends on the machine and operator, e.g. wallet update of Robocoin ATMs required customers to wait for 6 confirmations before they can get cash)', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9963
