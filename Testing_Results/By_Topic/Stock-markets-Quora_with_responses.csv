Ajay Pruthi,4y,Why is investing important?,"My maid came to me in 2002 and was looking a bit worried. I just had completed my engineering and we four friends were living in a 2 BHK in Mumbai.

I asked her what was bothering her? The answer was very simple- I have a daughter and I want her to be educated like you guys. I do not want her to be like me, going to people houses and cooking food.

I said ok, but what are you worried about? She said- I do not know how to save or invest. I asked her, how much she can save monthly and she said around 2,000 per month. It was a good amount at that point of time.

Give me a week`s time and I will let you know, was my answer.

I was also new to investing but I researched and after a week suggested her 2 mutual funds. To my surprise, she actually started investing after 1 month.

Another 2 years, I was in the same flat and she was still investing. But time changes and so does the jobs. I got a new job in Delhi in year 2004. Before shifting to Delhi, I advised her 2 things, just 2 things- Do not withdraw this money for any other things, whatever the circumstances may be. And withdraw all the amount 3 years before your daughter`s higher education and put it in a FD.

This is my number and you can call me if you ever face any problem regarding your investments.

I never received a call from her in next 14 years.

Year 2019- I received a call from an unknown number. She called me to tell that her daughter is now an engineer. In fact, after paying for her education, she still has money left for her daughter`s marriage.(The money had grown to around 18 Lakhs)

She said thank you and it was clearly visible from her voice that she was crying.

Perhaps Tears of Happiness and that is why investing is important.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/damw0fyb315ntoui', 'title': 'Why is investing important?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My maid came to me in 2002 and was looking a bit worried.

Palkesh Asawa,7y,What are some of the mind blowing facts about stock markets?,"An interesting case of how superstitions work in real life!

In the Bombay Stock Exchange, there is a statue of a bull in front of the second gate of the building. People in the market have this superstition that whenever that gate is opened, the markets crash.

This is the famous stock market bull statue -

The door was first opened in 1992, and the infamous Harshad Mehta scam happened soon after it.
In 2001, the door was opened again during US President Clinton’s visit, and there was a major crash in the stock exchange.
Again, in 2008 when the gate was opened to install a new statue, the markets crashed suddenly.

BSE bronze bull caused crash?

What is going on here?

Are we meant to believe that the bull statue really caused a crash in the stock exchange? I mean, do superstitions work in real life?

In order to understand this better, let me tell you a story…

Akbar and Birbal decided to conduct a social experiment. They announced that every person in the kingdom should donate one glass of milk to the royal treasury during the night time.

But in the morning, they saw that the tank was actually full of water, not milk! Nobody gave a drop of milk. What was happening?

To find out, they decided to disguise themselves and ask around.

One person said, “Oh, everyone else was going to put milk. Who will find out if I added one glass of water? I saved money!”

It was a genius idea, but alas, everybody thought the same. Everyone thought that everyone else is going to put milk, and hence it would benefit them if they put water instead. In thinking so, everyone eventually ends up putting water.

This is interesting, right? It happens in the stock markets too.

Imagine that you hold some shares in the stock market and you get to know that gate number 2 of the Bombay Stock Exchange has recently been opened. What are you thinking right now?

“Holy shit! Whenever they open that bloody gate, the market crashes. Man! I have a lot of money invested in the market. I better sell my shares before the market falls”

That’s a fantastic idea, except that everybody is thinking the same thing.

Everyone is afraid that the markets may fall. As a result of this, everyone wants to sell their shares and leave, before the price falls. What happens then? This is basic economics. When the supply rises, prices fall.

Imagine! Markets crash because people believe that they are going to crash.

Such is the power of a superstition!

John Cate,1y,Can Sears recover?,"If you mean Sears as the department store retailer, no. According to Wikipedia, there are just 23 Sears stores left standing in the USA, not including their small specialty stores. There is very little left, and the only reason those stores exist is so its corporate (mis)management can squeeze every last dime of value before filing Chapter 7 to liquidate anything that is left.

Sears’ department store model is dead and it will never return. People don’t like shopping at malls anymore and they don’t enjoy shopping in stores full of overpriced merchandise which they try to sell at a premium based on convenience. I watched Sears slowly decline from the mid-1980s onward, until they just disappeared from view altogether. The quality of the merchandise declined and so did their customer service. I still remember my father going into Sears around 1987 when a Craftsman tool broke and he went there to get them to honor the “lifetime warranty.” They tried to argue with him for half an hour before the manager honored it. Dad never bought another tool at Sears again.

(A funny side note: In the early 1980s, Sears had a computer section and I had learned just enough BASIC on the computer at school to write a program on Sears’ display model. Dad once got mischievous and told me to make their computer display “Shop at JCPenney’s” on an endless loop. After that, I did it every time I went into that Sears! One time I got caught and even the sales clerk laughed.)

I don’t think I have set foot in a Sears for like 10 years. There is a “Sears Hometown” just a few miles away, selling appliances, but I don’t need any, so there’s no reason for me to go there. There are only two remaining full-size Sears stores in the entire state of North Carolina. They are entirely gone from Charlotte, the state’s largest city.

I think the Sears brand will survive the death of the company, though. There is still value in the brand itself, and it will be one of the last things sold off in liquidation. This happened when Montgomery Ward died in 2001 for a lot of the same reasons Sears will. The brand was sold off, and since 2004, it lives again as an online retailer
, selling the same sorts of goods as the original.

The same, I suspect, will happen to Sears. And it will be sort of ironic, since Sears became a popular, successful brand at the turn of the last century because of its catalog sales. Sears called itself “The Cheapest Supply House on Earth,” and would sell you just about anything, even a prefabricated house! Sears was literally to 1905 what Amazon was to 2005.

Very impressive design work for 1909. Sears was a first-class operation then and continued to be all the way into my childhood, but the last time I was in one, I felt like I was in an overpriced Ollie’s or Big Lots. (Nothing against those stores, but Sears claimed to be in a different tier.)

Sears itself made moves to revive its old business model in the early years of the Internet, but never fully embraced it and instead chose to ride its 1960s business model right into the commode. There was still time. They were the largest retailer in the US until 1990, were profitable until 2010, and were still acquiring smaller retailers as late as 1997.

If they had someone with the vision of Jeff Bezos in the late 1990s, they could have transitioned to that model, while leaving their appliance specialty stores open. The problem is that it’s hard for a company so old and set in its ways to re-configure in such a way. A company like Sears is what it is, it’s not going to be agile. They never would have foreseen consumers using the Internet to bring into being a modern-day version of catalog shopping.

Bezos himself has said that someday, a new business model will put Amazon under. And he’s probably right. Every business has its moment in the sun, and when that sun sets, it’s over. Sears has been dying for almost 40 years. They should be grateful for the long twilight.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/avej7qnl04fuko58', 'title': 'Can Sears recover?', 'score': {'original': 0.4903, 'ai': 0.5097}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'If you mean Sears as the department store retailer, no.

Yves Pircher,5y,Why hasn't a mathematical model to beat the stock market been found?,"Because the market is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system.

Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it (e.g. weather): It doesn’t care what the weatherman says; if it rains, it rains. Though it is influenced by a myriad of factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts.
Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it and therefore can never be predicted accurately (e.g. markets): They care a lot about predictions and rumours . What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise.

So many forces are at work and their interactions are so complex that extremely small variations in the strength of the forces and the way they interact produce huge differences in outcomes.

We Are Here (WAH),Updated 2y,What are some screenshots that deserve 2.6k upvotes and views?,"When I gave birth to my first child on September 3rd, I was excited, feeling her small and warm body between my arms.

But after 24 hours, my baby girl Mila failed her first test. She was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect.

After hearing that I cried so hard, and I couldn't breathe.

It's something no mother should experience.

Her body wasn’t getting the oxygenated blood it needs, her heart functions are all missed up, and blood flow in the wrong directions, and they also found a hole in her heart.

Her first week of life has been lots of poking, blood drawing, and test after test, and it was very hard for me to see that every time, I couldn't eat even after being exhausted from the surgery.

The only thing I wanted to hear is the doctor saying your daughter is gonna be okay.

To fix these defects, she had open-heart surgery and was in surgery for around 5 hours.

She needs to stay for 3-4 weeks, for more testing and surveillance, meaning more expense, until we can take her home for the first time, and hope she can have a normal life.

Please, we really need all of the support we can get whether it's a donation, prayer, or share, I'll appreciate every help.

Please I'm begging you for any support, that can help my baby. Please.

Ross.Lederhman,3y,Has procrastination turned out to be beneficial for you in the stock market?,"Yes.

Many folks, who are proclaimed professional daytraders, feel they have to trade every day. Every fucking day. With their massive setups like this;

And shoutout to the world, how tough it is, how much hours it takes every day, so much stress, yada yada. The above is nonsense. You don't require all this rubbish. You don't need fixed daily goals, it makes, mathematically, no sense. One should trade when an opportunity arises, not the other way around. I am a “lazy” trader. I don't trade frequently, and when I do, I don't require 50 screens, ha.

I was busy working on an old algorithm of mine when someone of Quora name dropped me random firms (Jake). Chegg and Six Flags were one of em'. I put Chegg in my algorithm and was purely checking how it was working out.

Due to its results, I wanted to know more. Doing some reading about it made me realize, before earnings, I should put in a short, textbook example of a fat bastard of a company, earnings are likely going to be disappointing, the rest is probably going to indicate massive growth (book company, we are in the middle of the pandemic). It was the perfect moment for folks to exit some of their positions. And on that I anticipated. They published earnings after closing, made an absolute killer.

And why? Purely because someone fetched me the name of a firm I never investigated, they had earnings coming up, I did my research and felt a position should be taken.

And all on 1 small laptop, while I did my positions through the phone. Manually.

Being “lazy” is another word for waiting for what seems the right moment. You don’t need to trade. Heck, I never have to trade again, but I can, and it gives me time and clarity to research what I think is worth investing in.

I felt absolute no pressure, and I am convinced that helps me in my trading activities. I never understood the “need” to trade or “boasting” about how frequently one traded.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dopgar4syjq3n7c1', 'title': 'Has procrastination turned out to be beneficial for you in the stock market?', 'score': {'original': 0.9458, 'ai': 0.0542}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Yes.\n\nMany folks, who are proclaimed professional daytraders, feel they have to trade every day.

Prajwal,4y,Why is investment important for the future?,"This is Vijayalakshmi.

She is a famous South Indian actress. She has acted in around 37 movies including Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.

She has acted with almost all the big names of every South Indian film industry like Vishnuvardhan, Shivarajkumar, Raghavendra Rajkumar, Upendra, Mohan Lal, Vijay, Suriya, Arjun Sarja and so on.

She has also acted in a number of serials and hosted quite a few successful game shows.

Basically, every South Indian movie buff would be quite familiar with her.

Today, she is admitted in a hospital and is seeking monetary help from anyone she can. She says she doesn’t even have a house to go back to.

What happened?

How did such a successful actress fall from her grace?

Simple. When you are riding the high horse, you wouldn’t think of what would happen if the saddle comes loose. Basically, no investment for the future.

Sure, an actress has to splurge a considerable amount of money in terms of fashion and status to keep herself employable. But what happens when you are no more employable?

This situation can be averted by judicial investment of your finances.

A supporting actor for a serial today is paid around 3000 per episode excluding food and transport. So the main character will be obviously paid at least twice of that. For simplicity sake, lets consider it as 6000. Multiply that with 500 episodes (one of her serials ran for 845 episodes). 30 lakh rupees. And this is a conservative estimate. Main actresses get paid a lot more than that.

A 30lac investment over a period of 10 years in an SBI mutual fund would have generated 94lacs!

She is crying and blaming all her co stars that no one is helping her. They probably should, but how can you think that they owe you something?

Hopefully she gets better and gets back to the stardom she had achieved and this time build a better future.

And that’s why investment is important.

Doug Armey,4y,"When a stock market crashes and everyone is desperately selling, who is actually willing to buy?","I am. And thrilled to.

Of course, I’ve been accused of being a little off kilter, too.

2009, in the Great Recession, investors fled the stock market like rats off a burning boat.

They couldn’t sell fast enough.

Pundits cried, “It’s the end of the financial world. Get out while you can. Buy gold.”

I fielded phone calls morning to night from scared clients. I did my best to convince them not to bail.

Most followed my advice. A couple of them jumped overboard right at the height of the hurricane.

If you didn’t live through it as an investor you just can’t comprehend how frightening it was. And the level of panic that engulfed the markets.

In the midst of the carnage I analyzed underlying values. Stock prices had been decimated. But earnings of most large companies were fine. Their prices had plummeted and their values skyrocketed.

The stock market was like Macy’s having the “White Sale of the Century.”

Warren Buffett announced he was buying stocks.

He was asked, “Aren’t you worried they could go down more?

He replied, “Sure, prices might go down more. But they’re cheap now. Eventually they’ll go up.”

And every month I maxed out my 401k and bought stocks, also.

Me and Uncle Warren together. Of course, he has no idea that I’m his self adopted nephew.

Kind of like buying patio furniture on sale during a winter blizzard. I know spring is coming and it’s cheap now.

I look back at those investments and they’re some of the best I’ve ever made. They’ve increased exponentially.

And I’m giddy every time Macy’s has another “White Sale”. I load up on bargains again.

Of course, I’ve been accused of being a little off kilter.

Hannah Scott,Sep 30,Is investing in 529 better than investing in index funds?,"Investing in a 529 plan versus index funds?

Ah, the eternal battle of education savings versus broad market returns.

Let me tell you, my friend, investing in a 529 plan is like sending your money on an educational adventure, full of restrictions and limited choices.

Sure, it may offer some tax advantages, but at what cost?

You're locking your hard-earned money away for a specific purpose, limiting your investment options, and subjecting yourself to potential penalties if you withdraw for non-qualified expenses.

Now, let's talk about index funds.

They're like the superheroes of the investment world, providing diversification, low costs, and long-term growth potential.

With index funds, you have the freedom to invest in a wide range of market segments, capturing the overall performance of the economy.

No restrictions, no limitations.

Plus, you get to enjoy the beauty of compounding returns over time.

So, my dear questioner, if you want flexibility, freedom, and the potential for higher returns, index funds are the way to go.

Leave the 529 plans for those who enjoy the thrill of educational bureaucracy.

But hey, that's just my opinion.

Take it with a grain of salt and make your judgment call.

Happy investing!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nko68pgxe4q9170c', 'title': 'Is investing in 529 better than investing in index funds?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Investing in a 529 plan versus index funds?\n\nAh, the eternal battle of education savings versus broad market returns.\n\nLet me tell you, my friend, investing in a 529 plan is like sending your money on an educational adventure, full of restrictions and limited choices.\n\nSure, it may offer some tax advantages, but at what cost?\n\nYou're locking your hard-earned money away for a specific purpose, limiting your investment options, and subjecting yourself to potential penalties if you withdraw for non-qualified expenses.\n\nNow, let's talk about index funds.\n\nThey're like the superheroes of the investment world, providing diversification, low costs, and long-term growth potential.\n\nWith index funds, you have the freedom to invest in a wide range of market segments, capturing the overall performance of the economy.\n\nNo restrictions, no limitations.\n\nPlus, you get to enjoy the beauty of compounding returns over time.\n\nSo, my dear questioner, if you want flexibility, freedom, and the potential for higher returns, index funds are the way to go.\n\nLeave the 529 plans for those who enjoy the thrill of educational bureaucracy.\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt and make your judgment call.\n\nHappy investing!"", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1979848, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Investing in a 529 plan versus index funds?\n\nAh, the eternal battle of education savings versus broad market returns.\n\nLet me tell you, my friend, investing in a 529 plan is like sending your money on an educational adventure, full of restrictions and limited choices.\n\nSure, it may offer some tax advantages, but at what cost?\n\nYou're locking your hard-earned money away for a specific purpose, limiting your investment options, and subjecting yourself to potential penalties if you withdraw for non-qualified expenses.\n\nNow, let's talk about index funds.\n\nThey're like the superheroes of the investment world, providing diversification, low costs, and long-term growth potential.\n\nWith index funds, you have the freedom to invest in a wide range of market segments, capturing the overall performance of the economy.\n\nNo restrictions, no limitations.\n\nPlus, you get to enjoy the beauty of compounding returns over time.\n\nSo, my dear questioner, if you want flexibility, freedom, and the potential for higher returns, index funds are the way to go.\n\nLeave the 529 plans for those who enjoy the thrill of educational bureaucracy.\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt and make your judgment call.\n\nHappy investing!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Several long-term trends will continue to work in Facebook's favor. Companies are shifting to digital advertising. E-commerce is growing (with Facebook's launch of its Marketplace looking smarter every day). Augmented reality (AR) is on the way -- and Facebook will be a leader in AR.

Stock Price,Updated 4y,Why hasn't a mathematical model to beat the stock market been found?,"Investors aren't rational, information isn't always widely available or understood, and markets aren't 100% efficient. And the farther we go back in time, the more inefficient they were. This, combined with hard work to find the inefficiencies is why Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch, and many others were able to do so well. There have been models and algorithms over the years that have done better than average. As word got out about them, more and more people started using them, and their effect faded away.

Classical finance theory is based on the concept of the efficient market. 100% rational investors who know everything there is to know about the market as soon as the information becomes available. Of course that's a myth. There are still inefficiencies today, and people are still finding them, but my belief is they're getting harder to find all the time. And looking closely at things that have done reasonably well over time (i.e.: Berkshire Hathaway, others) shows that excess returns have been diminishing with time. Because the mechanisms that make markets efficient are getting stronger. There are many more educated investors.

Much better technology (internet, Moore's law doubling computer horsepower every 18 months, ever more sophisticated algorithms and software, big data analytics) and so on. There are even market front runners that get a few milliseconds head start on everyone else. And, as Joseph points out, an average is a mathematical absolute. This isn't Lake Wobegon where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking and all the children are above average. However, the stock markets adjust to these models and make them obsolete. Markets are not like weather, where once predicted you can assume that it will continue to work even as the entire earth population knows about the prediction. Markets are what some call a ""Level Two"" chaotic system. They react to the predictions about themselves. Therefore you can never accurately predict markets consistently. Imagine a scenario where you come up with a model which tells you the outcome of S&P for every day with a 99.9% accuracy. You pour billions into the model and start generating enormous income. What will happen next is everyone will just watch after you and not trade until your model makes a move.

Indrazith Shantharaj,Updated 2y,"Is it possible to earn a livelihood from the stock market? Is it possible to earn enough money, say 10k -15k rupees per month? I am new to the stock market, but I can invest time in learning.","I quit my well-paid IT job in 2016 to pursue full-time trading. It was a conscious decision as I was profitable since 2014 and took 2 breaks earlier to experience living without getting a salary.

It is possible to make a living from trading. But it demands some preparation and planning from our end. I will share my personal experience of how I shifted from an IT job to full-time trading.

When I took the first break (2 years before quitting), I was on cloud-9 as I made some profits and under the impression that it is damn easy to make money.

But the reality is entirely different because most of us have an unconscious addiction to month-end salaries.

Hence Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the author of the famous book ""The Black Swan"" once said:

""The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.""

The biggest takeaway from my first break is:

Cut the addiction to the salary (else I feel bad every first week of the month)
I made a small profit of Rs.10,000 to Rs.20,000 (130-256 USD) per month, which was insufficient for living. So, I had decided to learn position sizing and riding profitable trades.
More trades per day doesn't mean more money. There is a high probability of losing if we take more trades on any trading day.

Then I started learning from mistakes. I focused on saving more money (for capital and any emergency) and also worked on improving my trading skills.

After 1 year, I was utterly confident to depend on trading for a living. But didn't wanted to risk quitting the job. Besides, I didn't have any problem in the office as I had wonderful colleagues. So I have decided to take one more break for 3 months and to see how it goes.

The biggest takeaway from my second break is:

I didn't make profits for the first month. So, I was a little worried when my home EMI (Rs.40,000) got deducted the next month. I had some savings to pay the EMIs for a few months. But still, I was getting some pressure in mind relating to paying these fixed monthly EMIs.
On one trading day, I took an intraday position, and when I tried to place the stop-loss order, the trading application was hanged. I thought it was some problem with my laptop. But the broker server was down at that time, and by the time they rectified it, the price moved in the opposite direction, and I lost an entire month's profit in that trade.

After completing the break, I had decided to sell my flat as I didn't want to keep paying the monthly EMIs. I made a slight loss from the deal, but I was happy as the burden of paying EMIs every month is gone.

Then I had decided to take up full-time trading as a career and submitted my papers in June-2016. I had a fantastic stint with my IT job (I worked 10+ years in IT), and all my colleagues advised me to continue both. But I had decided to move on.

Once again, in the first month of full-time trading, I got another issue with myself by overtrading in indices and stocks. I have explained this story in the below answer (check Initial Hiccups with Full-Time Trading):

The Intelligent Investor · August 17, 2021
What is a career as a day trader like?
https://qr.ae/pGOzcp

Since 2016, trading is my main business. I wrote my first book, ""Trade and Grow Rich,"" in 2018, which won Amazon Best Read Award for the year. Later all my books became #1 Best Seller in the Business & Economics category on Amazon India. So, I do receive a small royalty amount from all these books every month.

During the pandemic, the market was showing volatile moves every day, and I didn't make money for a few months. Even though I had some cash reserves, I couldn't help many people who faced financial issues due to lockdown.

So, I started online courses (recorded courses), charged a small fee, and used that money to help needy people. Now I use some portion of that money for my CSR activities. But it turned out another passive income source in my life.

I have the below suggestions for the people who want to take up full-time trading:

Quitting your day job is not necessary. One can try positional trading systems to make money in the stock market. If you are only interested in intraday trading, you can try to develop algos as they demand less time in the live market.
Save some money which is sufficient to take care of the family for the next 2 years. They should not suffer for our madness.
Save enough trading capital. Suppose if your target is to make 5% every month, then 500,000 (5 lakh) will generate 25,000. So plan it accordingly.
Ensure you will see profits for a minimum of 6 consecutive months before quitting the job.
If possible, build 1-2 passive income sources. These passive incomes sources give tremendous confidence in life!

My last suggestion is don't aim to make some fixed amount every month. Because we are not building a wall on the construction site, and we are trading in markets. On some days, it gives more profits, and on some days, it offers small losses. Except both of them graciously and follow your system rules.

I hope my detailed answer is helpful.

It was a conscious decision as I was profitable since 2014 and took 2 breaks earlier to experience living without getting a salary.\n\nIt is possible to make a living from trading. But it demands some preparation and planning from our end. I will share my personal experience of how I shifted from an IT job to full-time trading.\n\nWhen I took the first break (2 years before quitting), I was on cloud-9 as I made some profits and under the impression that it is damn easy to make money.\n\nBut the reality is entirely different because most of us have an unconscious addiction to month-end salaries.\n\nHence Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the author of the famous book ""The Black Swan"" once said:\n\n""The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.""\n\nThe biggest takeaway from my first break is:\n\nCut the addiction to the salary (else I feel bad every first week of the month)\nI made a small profit of Rs.10,000 to Rs.20,000 (130-256 USD) per month, which was insufficient for living. So, I had decided to learn position sizing and riding profitable trades.\nMore trades per day doesn\'t mean more money. There is a high probability of losing if we take more trades on any trading day.\n\nThen I started learning from mistakes. I focused on saving more money (for capital and any emergency) and also worked on improving my trading skills.\n\nAfter 1 year, I was utterly confident to depend on trading for a living. But didn\'t wanted to risk quitting the job. Besides, I didn\'t have any problem in the office as I had wonderful colleagues. So I have decided to take one more break for 3 months and to see how it goes.\n\nThe biggest takeaway from my second break is:\n\nI didn\'t make profits for the first month. So, I was a little worried when my home EMI (Rs.40,000) got deducted the next month. I had some savings to pay the EMIs for a few months.

Steven Haddock,2y,GameStop short-sellers have lost another $1.9 Billion in just two days amid the stock’s latest spike. Why would any serious investor short GameStop considering what is taking place on Reddit with this stock?,"Not too long ago, the price of GameStop was hovering about $5 a share. The company is in trouble because (a) people don’t have to buy physical copies of game for their gaming systems anymore and (b) the pandemic means many of their stores are closed.

And, frankly, even though GameStop has made some changes to get their business model in line with reality, the fundamentals of this stock still say the same thing - it’s worth about $5 a share.

So, given that the stock price is currently about $102 a share with no significant increase in earnings, the stock pretty much looks like this guy

What we have here is a “Wile E. Coyote” moment. Now, we know from watching Coyote & RoadRunner cartoons for close to 60 years now that this cartoon doesn’t always stick to the strict laws of “physics”. However, we do know the laws of RoadRunner cartoons - that Coyote is going down. It’s only a matter of when.

Now, he may hit a trampoline on the way down and defy the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and probably Hooke’s law of elasticity to boot, but even after he comes back up, he’s going down again.

The only question is “when”.

If you’ve seen “The Big Short”, you may remember the scent where Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale) is on the phone during the first quarter of 2007 when, true to his prediction, there have been massive consumer payment defaults on the bonds he shorted. However, the bonds haven’t defaulted yet. Burry soon figures out why - the banks holding them are making the interest payments themselves to keep them from defaulting. Burry kept making his payments on his credit default swaps and - guess what, they eventually paid off when the bonds defaulted three months later.

Shorting GameStop is still a good play. It’s still a risky play, but eventually the short squeezers will either have to sell to take profit or risk losing their entire investment.

Varun Singhal,3y,Why do people believe Rakesh Jhunjhunwala blindly?,"What if I tell you that I have lost 50% of my portfolio value in the last one year. Would you want to hear me, take advice from me regarding stock market?

Probably no. Simple reason being that if I have good understanding of stock market, then I should be able to make money for myself.

Now you look at Rakesh Jhunjhunwala (aka THE BIG BULL).

He started with a capital of Rs. 5000 in the 1980’s and has converted this money into about Rs. 6000 crore currently. Clearly, it is a statistic which will stagger any investor or market participant. YOU WOULD WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS MAN AND HIS LEARNING OVER THE YEARS SO THAT YOU CAN POTENTIALLY REPLICATE HIS SUCCESS.

However, there are a host of pitfalls if one follows him or his portfolio blindly. Some of these are mentioned below.

His risk appetite is significantly more than the retail investors. As most of you must be knowing. Rakesh is a very active trader and maintains a trading book as well as investment book. His trading profits are also significant and over the years he is known to have take risky bets. Remember investing in JP Associates when it was at all time low.
His investment horizon and patience levels is significantly different from most of us. This makes a huge difference. As on September 30, 2008, his portfolio was about 12000 crore which is now reduced to 6000 crore. To him it does not make much difference as in the future when midcap smallcap rally would be back, his portfolio would again swell. Also he has made so much returns in stock investing that he understands that losing some is a part of the game. FOR RETAIL INVESTORS WHO STARTED INVESTING IN 2018, THINGS COULD BE VERY BAD.
It is a myth that investors such as Jhunjunwala do not make mistakes. They do make mistakes such as investing in Dewan Housing. But the difference is when they get is right they mint 50X and potentially 100X. For instance, Rakesh bought TITAN at an average price of Rs.3 in 2002–2003 and the price today is almost Rs. 850 More than 250X. But he had the vision and patience to hold on for so long. WE WOULD HAVE SOLD MUCH MUCH EARLIER.

I totally get it why people follow Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. But please learn from the man and his experience. DO NOT FOLLOW HIM BLINDLY. HIS RISK APPETITE AND INVESTMENT HORIZON ARE DIFFERENT FROM US.

I would to like to end this with one of his favorite lines.

“ I AM NOT SCARED OF MAKING MISTAKES IN THE MARKET. BUT I DO NOT WANT TO EVER MAKE A MISTAKE WHICH ERODES ALL MY CAPITAL AND I CANNOT PARTICIPATE AGAIN IN THE MARKET”

A Lesson for Retail Investors perhaps. Make mistakes but only those which you can stomach and still remain in the market!!

Shoaib Shaikh,Updated 3y,What are the biggest scams and frauds today?,"This is a story related to an Indian person , many of which may be found in other places of India too.

Also, the whole country cannot be blamed in account of a few people. Here goes the incidences happening with foreign tourists in India.

It happened when I was working in a hotel as a receptionist.

Below is my picture when I was working in the hotel.

Image Source:- My phone Gallery

An elderly foreign couple came to our hotel without reservation to check-in, the time I was working. I checked the reservations and Informed them that their rooms were not reserved.

They showed me papers of the hotel booking by their agent who claimed to have reserved the rooms.

A little background to this story :

They flew from their country to Delhi directly.

In Delhi they meet an agent who offers a full package tour of India, including transportation & accommodation. For which they pay him a sum of one lakh.

But he dosent book anything for them, he just books the train tickets.

They travel from Delhi to Aurangabad. I asked them to call the person who claims to be managing their tour. I took the number from them and called him as they did not have an Indian number. His number constantly came as switched off.

The couple were tired as they were traveling more than 24 hrs.

So I asked them you can do check-in first, we will contact him after sometime. After I finished the formalities they checked into the room.

Just before going to the room I asked them for a visiting card of that agent hoping to find something on the internet. I searched for the tours & travels and after some websites I got his alternative number. I contacted him and asked him about the mis-booking and malpractice.

He was shouting at me for calling, questioning where I got this number and asked me to never call again. I did still give the number to the couple. He did not pick the call number of times after this incident, we had to try calling from my colleague’s phone just to make him answer.

When that foreigner asked him about the booking, he apologized profusely saying he had forgotten about it. He offered to pay the hotel money online and asked for bank details. After sharing the details on WhatsApp, the number was again not available.

Meanwhile the guest wanted to explore Ajanta & ellora caves and then travel to Karnataka.They were having enough funds & credit cards to easily explore India without the agent.

I arranged the transportation services for them to Ajanta & Ellora, booked a hotel in Karnataka and their return tickets from Aurangabad to Karnataka.

After 2 days they check-out from our hotel and pay all bills and transportation charges.

In that 2 days we tried to contact that agent but his number wasn't connecting at all. I also tried to get information from my source but couldn't get any details of that tours & Travels.

The couple were very happy with our service as we helped them beyond our duty. The thanked us profusely and processed with their journey.

But the worst part is the fraud that agent committed.

They lost approximately one lakh rupees and faced so many challenges in booking tickets and hotels.

I feel very bad when the foreigner said this “I WILL NEVER TRUST ANY INDIAN’S WORD”

I didn't know what to say and stood with my head bent like a criminal. So I think such type of things(fraud) should stop immediately in india.

Just think if they didn't having enough fund so what would they have done??

Thanks to reading.

Cheers ❤️❤️

I checked the reservations and Informed them that their rooms were not reserved.\n\nThey showed me papers of the hotel booking by their agent who claimed to have reserved the rooms.\n\nA little background to this story :\n\nThey flew from their country to Delhi directly.\n\nIn Delhi they meet an agent who offers a full package tour of India, including transportation & accommodation. For which they pay him a sum of one lakh.\n\nBut he dosent book anything for them, he just books the train tickets.\n\nThey travel from Delhi to Aurangabad. I asked them to call the person who claims to be managing their tour. I took the number from them and called him as they did not have an Indian number. His number constantly came as switched off.\n\nThe couple were tired as they were traveling more than 24 hrs.\n\nSo I asked them you can do check-in first, we will contact him after sometime. After I finished the formalities they checked into the room.\n\nJust before going to the room I asked them for a visiting card of that agent hoping to find something on the internet. I searched for the tours & travels and after some websites I got his alternative number. I contacted him and asked him about the mis-booking and malpractice.\n\nHe was shouting at me for calling, questioning where I got this number and asked me to never call again. I did still give the number to the couple. He did not pick the call number of times after this incident, we had to try calling from my colleague’s phone just to make him answer.\n\nWhen that foreigner asked him about the booking, he apologized profusely saying he had forgotten about it. He offered to pay the hotel money online and asked for bank details. After sharing the details on WhatsApp, the number was again not available.\n\nMeanwhile the guest wanted to explore Ajanta & ellora caves and then travel to Karnataka.They were having enough funds & credit cards to easily explore India without the agent.\n\nI arranged the transportation services for them to Ajanta & Ellora, booked a hotel in Karnataka and their return tickets from Aurangabad to Karnataka.\n\nAfter 2 days they check-out from our hotel and pay all bills and transportation charges.\n\nIn that 2 days we tried to contact that agent but his number wasn't connecting at all.

Pramod Kumar,Updated 6y,What are few tips for trading in Indian stock market? What are the trading secrets?,"What Are The Trading Secrets ? :

The question is in two parts. The first one seeks tips for trading in Indian Stock Markets. The second part seeks to know the secrets of trading.

Once you know the answers to these two questions, profits will start rolling in and you are on your way to the world of stock market riches.

I have been trading for some 25 years now. In this period I have seen many traders go broke, never return to trading again. I have seen people make some money, lose more than that, take a break, return and meet the same fate and repeat the cycle many times.

And I have seen very few, who have made money from trading but they generally do not talk much about it.

If there was a secret formula or the holy grail of trading, then about 90% of the traders would not be in the losing category.

PART I : TIPS FOR TRADING:

Based on my experience of trading and observations of the characteristics of the traders, I would like to list the tips of trading.

(A) Trader Should Remain A Trader, Not Become An Investor:

This is the first tip for a trader.

A trader buys a stock at Rs. 100 in the hope of selling at 102–103 on the same day. Such trades are done on margin. Instead of going up, the stock falls to Rs. 97.

What do you do?

Take delivery of the stock. Now the money is blocked. You hope that the price will move up next day and you will exit at a profit. It goes down further to Rs. 92. You are now stuck with it.

After a month it is back to Rs. 100. You exit at break even. Lost the brokerage amount.

Few days later, the stock is at Rs. 120 and you are regretting the missed opportunity.

Does this look familiar?

A trader is in the trade for the day or few days. It does not serve the purpose if the trading capital gets blocked.

And the cardinal mistake here was waiting while in loss, but not waiting when the trend became positive.

Some traders have all the patience in the world when a trade goes wrong, but exit from a likely winning trade after only break even or with a small profit.

This can be summed up as the second important tip:

(B) Exit The Losing Trades Quickly, Wait In The Winning Trades.

At the risk of repeating myself ( I have said it many times in my other answers ), the following example will illustrate this point:

BHEL Futures Day Trades in July 2014 :

There were 6 trades in all, only one of them profitable. The loss in five loss making trades were— 0.00, 1.10, 1.65. 4.40 and 1.90 units respectively.

The profit in single winning trade was 22.10 units.

Exit from the losing trades quickly and waiting in a single profitable trade resulted in good profit for the month.

(C) Never Trade Without A Stop Loss:

All the above trades were with stop loss at pre determined levels . Once the trade became profitable, the trailing stop loss was used. In the absence of a stop loss, there is too much thinking before action which makes the trade go wrong.

Successful traders always use stop loss. Losing ones have not even heard about it.

(D ) Wait In Profits, Maximize The Gain From A Good Trade:

In the same screen shot, the trade which gave maximum profit is not about my skill about picking the right trade.

I had shorted BHEL earlier in the day and a stop loss was hit very soon. I had entered another short trade few minutes later and this time the trend changed. I could have been wrong again and taken a loss.

But when right sit tight theory was used and this single trade gave a profit of Rs. 44000.

(E) Trend Is Friend:

Trade with the trend. There are people who make very good counter trend calls. But that needs too much study of market and price movements.

Study is something which traders want to avoid even at the risk of loss.

Then at least take the easy option of staying with the trend.

And if the trend reverses, stay protected with appropriate stop loss.

(F) Trade Only In High Volume Stocks:

Traders look for small profits. So trades have to be done in stocks where prices are fair. That is possible in most of the large cap stocks.

Stick to those stocks or Indices like NIFTY or BANK NIFTY.

PART II:

SECRET OF TRADING:

There is none.

There is only one way of making money.

Buy Low Sell High.

Do it whichever way you want.

Buy first sell later. Do short selling and buy later. Buy and sell Options. Trade futures.

But the selling price is to be higher than buying price for making profits.

How simple?

But how difficult to achieve?

The secret to trading is— KNOW YOURSELF.

Know your strength and weakness.

Know your patience limit in loss and in profit.

Know to control your fear and greed.

Know that profit is the result of a good trade and not a lottery.

Know that losses are part of trading and are meant as lessons to be learnt.

Know and believe that trading can be profitable.

Do not go outside to search for secrets.

The secret to good trading lies within you.

Happy trading.

RamAn S,7y,What are the criteria of a potentially good stock to be chosen on a money control website?,"These are some basic fundamental and technical indicators of a stock. Fundamental indicators are related to the financial performance or financial position of the firm. And technical indicators are related to the trading activity in the stock.

At the outset, i would like to say you cannot look at just a few indicators and invest your hard earned money. A lot of research has to be done regarding the business model, management reputation, historical performance and competition before purchasing a stock.

Consolidated Stats Vs Standalone Stats:

There are always 2 set of numbers reported by companies. One is the consolidated set of numbers and the other is the standalone set of numbers. You are looking at the standalone set. Which is not wrong, but you should always look at consolidated figures. Reason being, standalone figures are for the company alone. While consolidated numbers are for the whole group including the subsidiaries.

For Eg. Lets look at Info Edge India which is the holding company of Jobs - Recruitment - Job Search - Employment - Job Vacancies - Naukri.com
 and holds majority shares in Zomato and some other websites such as Jeevansathi etc.

Standalone :

Number seems pretty genuine. Right? Now let look at the consolidated figures :

Opps! Suddenly some metrics changed completely or even disappeared. Why did this happen? Because Standalone figures include the profitable businesses of the company and the consolidated figures include the super loss making Indian Unicorn called Zomato. (there are some other companies too).

So, you should always look at the consolidated figures to get the complete picture. Some companies do not report consolidated figures because they do not have subsidiaries.

Market Cap :

This is basically the worth of the whole company. (excluding the debt). It is computed as Number of Shares outstanding * The current share price.

A share is basically a small part of the company, and every share has a value(share price). Multiply them - and you get the worth of the whole company.

Market Cap is something you should not look at when buying a share. Because it just tells you the size of the company. Nothing else. If i tell you there are 2 companies, one has Rs. 100 Crores market cap, and the other has Rs. 150 Crores. Which one should you buy? You cannot tell. Market Cap alone does not tell you anything but the size of the company.

I tell you, that one house is for Rs. 50 Lacs and other is for Rs. 40 Lacs. Can you make a decision solely based on this information? Probably not. The Rs. 40 Lacs house might be a 4 BHK, while the Rs. 50 Lac house might a 2 BHK.

Note : Consolidated and Standalone market caps will always be the same. Because lets suppose you bought the whole standalone company, you will get the shares in the subsidiary too. Its like buying a house, which has ownership papers of another house lying within it. You get both of them by buying the first house.

P / E :

Now this is important. Price to Earnings ratio. It is basically the :

Market Cap / Net Profit or Price Per Share / Earnings Per Share.

Net profit is the earnings of the company for the period (12 months), after all expenses have been deducted from the revenue.

Revenue - Expenses = Net Profit / Earnings

This basically tells you how much money you are paying for buying Rs. 1 earnings of the company.

Lets say, a company has market cap of Rs. 100 Crores. It has Net Profit of Rs. 20 Crores. So this company trades at a P/E of 5x. (100/20).

Usually, older and more steadier / stables companies (Such as Coal India) trade at lower P / E multiples as compared to high growth companies (Such as Page Industries). That is because investors feel earnings will eventually grow to a level that will bring the P / E multiple down in the future. (denominator expected to increase).

Another way to understand this is the house buying analogy. One house is for Rs. 50 Lacs, and has an area of 500 Sq. Feet. So the price per square feet is Rs. 10,000. Another house sells for Rs 40 Lacs and has the same 500 sq. feet area. When you compute the price per square feet, it is similar to computing P / E. Like my boss used to say ""Bhao kya chal raha hai ?"" (whats the current P / E ?).

Higher the P / E the more money you pay upfront for earnings in the future. Some investors consider low P / E companies as bargain stocks. It entirely, depends on the investment philosophy and style.

P / E is not a great indicator. It has many short comings. It should be just one of the things you use in your analyses. Most seasoned investors keep track of the P/E rather than the stock price. When it comes within their comfort range, they buy it. When it goes above their range they sell some of their position. But, they already know the company inside out, thats why they can reply on P / E.

Industry P / E :

This is simple the average or median of the P / E's of companies which are in the same industry / are the competitors / are someway similar to the company whose stock you are analysing.

In its simplest form, you look at the P / E of your company and compare it to the industry average, if its in trading lower it might be a buy. Because then P / E is expected to rise to the Peer average level. If your company's P / E is higher, it might indicate that your company is overvalued as compared to its peers.

The house analogy can used again. If the house you are looking to buy is selling for Rs. 10, 000 per sq. ft. and other similar houses in the same neighbourhood sell for Rs. 9,000 per sq. ft. then the house you are looking to buy is overvalued.

Industry P / E depends on which companies are selected as peers. Selecting peers takes a lot of research, and you should not depend on a site like Money Control for selecting peers for you. You should do your own research since no two companies are exactly the same.

P / B - Price to Book :

This is basically computed as:

Market Cap / Shareholder's Funds

Shareholder's fund basically is the amount owed by the company back to the shareholders. Which is :

Money Initially Invested + Profits over the years

Book Value Per Share is simple : Shareholder's Fund / Number of Shares Outstanding (The Per share - shareholder's funds)

Market Cap is just the current value of the shareholder's fund.

Price to Book, again, should not be looked at while selecting which stock to buy. It is fundamentally flawed. Because assets are shown on the balance sheet at historical costs.

It like you bought a house in the year 2000, for Rs. 10 Lacs. Now its market value is Rs. 50 Lacs. So the Price to Book of your House if 5x (50 / 10). Does it tell you anything relevant? No. What you spent on buying the house in 2000 is irrelevant now.

Price to Book is only relevant in financial companies like Banks, because their assets are shown at current value.

EPS : Earnings Per Share (TTM means Trailing Twelve Months)

EPS is basically Net Profit Divided by Number of Shares Outstanding. Basically it tells us how much did one share earn during the last 12 months.

Dividend Yield :

Many companies pay out dividend every year out of the profits they earned during the year. If the share can be bought for Rs. 100 and it paid Rs. 10 per share dividend last year. Then the Dividend Yield is simply : 10%.

Usually dividend yields are low for equity stocks. Some value investors prefer buying high dividend yield stocks because cash in hand, reduces the risk.

High dividend yield might also mean the company has run out of investing opportunities and its business has reached maturity stage.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vdrtgebo3nms6yzf', 'title': 'What are the criteria of a potentially good stock to be chosen on a money control website?', 'score': {'original': 0.88356666666667, 'ai': 0.11643333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'These are some basic fundamental and technical indicators of a stock.

A lot of research has to be done regarding the business model, management reputation, historical performance and competition before purchasing a stock.\n\nConsolidated Stats Vs Standalone Stats:\n\nThere are always 2 set of numbers reported by companies. One is the consolidated set of numbers and the other is the standalone set of numbers. You are looking at the standalone set. Which is not wrong, but you should always look at consolidated figures. Reason being, standalone figures are for the company alone. While consolidated numbers are for the whole group including the subsidiaries.\n\nFor Eg. Lets look at Info Edge India which is the holding company of Jobs - Recruitment - Job Search - Employment - Job Vacancies - Naukri.com\n and holds majority shares in Zomato and some other websites such as Jeevansathi etc.\n\nStandalone :\n\nNumber seems pretty genuine. Right? Now let look at the consolidated figures :\n\nOpps! Suddenly some metrics changed completely or even disappeared. Why did this happen? Because Standalone figures include the profitable businesses of the company and the consolidated figures include the super loss making Indian Unicorn called Zomato. (there are some other companies too).\n\nSo, you should always look at the consolidated figures to get the complete picture. Some companies do not report consolidated figures because they do not have subsidiaries.\n\nMarket Cap :\n\nThis is basically the worth of the whole company. (excluding the debt). It is computed as Number of Shares outstanding * The current share price.\n\nA share is basically a small part of the company, and every share has a value(share price). Multiply them - and you get the worth of the whole company.\n\nMarket Cap is something you should not look at when buying a share. Because it just tells you the size of the company. Nothing else. If i tell you there are 2 companies, one has Rs. 100 Crores market cap, and the other has Rs. 150 Crores. Which one should you buy? You cannot tell. Market Cap alone does not tell you anything but the size of the company.\n\nI tell you, that one house is for Rs. 50 Lacs and other is for Rs. 40 Lacs. Can you make a decision solely based on this information? Probably not. The Rs. 40 Lacs house might be a 4 BHK, while the Rs. 50 Lac house might a 2 BHK.\n\nNote : Consolidated and Standalone market caps will always be the same. Because lets suppose you bought the whole standalone company, you will get the shares in the subsidiary too. Its like buying a house, which has ownership papers of another house lying within it. You get both of them by buying the first house.\n\nP / E :\n\nNow this is important. Price to Earnings ratio. It is basically the :\n\nMarket Cap / Net Profit', 'result': {'fake': 0.0037, 'real': 0.9963}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'or Price Per Share / Earnings Per Share.\n\nNet profit is the earnings of the company for the period (12 months), after all expenses have been deducted from the revenue.\n\nRevenue - Expenses = Net Profit / Earnings\n\nThis basically tells you how much money you are paying for buying Rs. 1 earnings of the company.\n\nLets say, a company has market cap of Rs. 100 Crores. It has Net Profit of Rs. 20 Crores. So this company trades at a P/E of 5x. (100/20).\n\nUsually, older and more steadier / stables companies (Such as Coal India) trade at lower P / E multiples as compared to high growth companies (Such as Page Industries). That is because investors feel earnings will eventually grow to a level that will bring the P / E multiple down in the future. (denominator expected to increase).\n\nAnother way to understand this is the house buying analogy. One house is for Rs. 50 Lacs, and has an area of 500 Sq. Feet. So the price per square feet is Rs. 10,000. Another house sells for Rs 40 Lacs and has the same 500 sq. feet area. When you compute the price per square feet, it is similar to computing P / E. Like my boss used to say ""Bhao kya chal raha hai ?"" (whats the current P / E ?).\n\nHigher the P / E the more money you pay upfront for earnings in the future. Some investors consider low P / E companies as bargain stocks. It entirely, depends on the investment philosophy and style.\n\nP / E is not a great indicator. It has many short comings. It should be just one of the things you use in your analyses. Most seasoned investors keep track of the P/E rather than the stock price. When it comes within their comfort range, they buy it. When it goes above their range they sell some of their position. But, they already know the company inside out, thats why they can reply on P / E.\n\nIndustry P / E :\n\nThis is simple the average or median of the P / E\'s of companies which are in the same industry / are the competitors / are someway similar to the company whose stock you are analysing.\n\nIn its simplest form, you look at the P / E of your company and compare it to the industry average, if its in trading lower it might be a buy. Because then P / E is expected to rise to the Peer average level. If your company\'s P / E is higher, it might indicate that your company is overvalued as compared to its peers.\n\nThe house analogy can used again. If the house you are looking to buy is selling for Rs. 10, 000 per sq. ft. and other similar houses in the same neighbourhood sell for Rs. 9,000 per sq. ft. then the house you are looking to buy is overvalued.\n\nIndustry P / E depends on which companies are selected as peers. Selecting peers takes a lot of research, and you should not depend on a site like Money Control', 'result': {'fake': 0.0016, 'real': 0.9984}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""for selecting peers for you. You should do your own research since no two companies are exactly the same.\n\nP / B - Price to Book :\n\nThis is basically computed as:\n\nMarket Cap / Shareholder's Funds\n\nShareholder's fund basically is the amount owed by the company back to the shareholders. Which is :\n\nMoney Initially Invested + Profits over the years\n\nBook Value Per Share is simple : Shareholder's Fund / Number of Shares Outstanding (The Per share - shareholder's funds)\n\nMarket Cap is just the current value of the shareholder's fund.\n\nPrice to Book, again, should not be looked at while selecting which stock to buy. It is fundamentally flawed. Because assets are shown on the balance sheet at historical costs.\n\nIt like you bought a house in the year 2000, for Rs. 10 Lacs. Now its market value is Rs. 50 Lacs. So the Price to Book of your House if 5x (50 / 10). Does it tell you anything relevant? No. What you spent on buying the house in 2000 is irrelevant now.\n\nPrice to Book is only relevant in financial companies like Banks, because their assets are shown at current value.\n\nEPS : Earnings Per Share (TTM means Trailing Twelve Months)\n\nEPS is basically Net Profit Divided by Number of Shares Outstanding. Basically it tells us how much did one share earn during the last 12 months.\n\nDividend Yield :\n\nMany companies pay out dividend every year out of the profits they earned during the year. If the share can be bought for Rs. 100 and it paid Rs. 10 per share dividend last year. Then the Dividend Yield is simply : 10%.\n\nUsually dividend yields are low for equity stocks. Some value investors prefer buying high dividend yield stocks because cash in hand, reduces the risk.\n\nHigh dividend yield might also mean the company has run out of investing opportunities and its business has reached maturity stage."", 'result': {'fake': 0.0457, 'real': 0.9543}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 14, 'credits': 1979785, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'These are some basic fundamental and technical indicators of a stock.

Pramod Kumar,6y,What was your first stock market mistake?,"A trader makes mistakes everyday.

Not waiting in profit, waiting too long in profit, waiting endlessly in a losing trade and hoping that somehow the trade will work out are some of the mistakes we all make.

We learn from these mistakes and refine our trading methods.

But humans are fallible. We make mistakes again.

Markets punish us for these mistakes, we take it on the chin and move on.

Chastised and somewhat wiser, we again enter the market with new trades and new hopes and life goes on.

Profitably for some, loss making for the majority.

I might have made thousands of mistakes in my years of trading. It is not possible to recall what was the first mistake.

Probably getting into the markets was the first mistake. If you do not agree, confirm it from the spouses of most traders.

Jokes apart, the trading mistake which makes one learn some important lesson is the one which is remembered forever.

My such mistake was:

Two Cups of Tea for Rs. 30000:

The apparently refreshing cups of tea cost me Rs. 30000 and taught me a valuable lesson.

The day was June 09, 2000.

Weekly settlement on BSE used to be on Fridays and this day was a Friday.

A day earlier I had bought 500 shares of WIPRO for 2380 and it had closed at 2442. I expected to make a good profit on Friday and planned to collect the cheque for profit from the broker at the close of market.

It opened at 2498. Touched 2500 and stayed thereabouts. I was happy calculating notional profit of Rs. 60000 or so.

A friend came to visit. We went out for a cup of tea. It must have taken some 15–20 minutes. The friend bid good bye and went on his way.

I came back to broker’s terminal.

The profit had also bid good bye and gone away.

The price was around 2480 when we thought of taking tea. Now it was 2370 and falling. There was nothing much to do. I closed out at 2360. Sold another 500 shares at 2360 . It started recovering and I bought back at 2400.

Forget about the notional profits, I had messed up and had an actual loss of Rs. 30000.

The closing bell rang and brought an end to the agony and ecstasy of the day.

I later reflected on what had happened and learnt two important lessons:

(a) Treat your trading as a serious business activity. There is a time for markets and there is a time for socializing. Never mix them up.

A stop loss would have protected the profit, but I was blissfully ignorant about it.

(b) Never Trade Without A Stop Loss.

A look at the price movement of WIPRO on that fateful day, June 09, 2000:

What Else This Mistake Taught:

There is a reason other than the unfortunate cup of tea for remembering this trade. I had planned to buy a gift from the profits of this trade for my wife whose birthday is June 10. The fall in price hurt that plan too.

Markets are volatile. Plan your trade accordingly.

Do not plan to spend the profit before you actually earn it.

As Aesop’s fables tell us:

That was my first big mistake. I have made many more since then.

Every mistake hurts. The hurt makes you learn.

Life is a learning process.

Keep learning. Keep improving.

Thanks for reading.

They used to call the middleman as bear jobbers and in short “bears” which is known to describe the downturn in the market. As bull was assumed to be opposite of the bear at that time so it was termed as the upward movement of the market.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9268

Dapto Dawg,4y,What would happen if I bought $100 of a stock that listed at $.0001?,"What would happen if I bought $100 of a stock that listed at $.0001?

There is actually more to this question than meets the eye.

Mathematically (and this was answered by another), you get a million shares less any commission costs.

But, having worked in the industry many years ago, there is something else going on here…

A stock that is listed at $0.0001 is almost certainly a stock that is effectively worthless but that no one at the brokerage has gotten around to declaring worthless. Let me explain.

Say a company goes bust: either slowly and gracefully, or, more to my taste, by the CEO, CFO and COO going on a cocaine-fueled spree spending all the company’s money in slot machines in Atlantic City.

If the company is publicly-listed, the stock price naturally tanks. If it started at say $100, when news of the spree first hits the market it may drop to a dollar that day. Then, as gory details of the cocaine spree come to light over the next few days, and the market starts to realise yes it was ALL of the company’s money they spent, the price will go to 10 cents, then a penny, then a tenth of a cent, and then after some time it will stabilise at some insanely low figure like the one in the question - one thousandth of a cent.

Where it will stabilise is driven by the back office people not wanting to key in too many zeroes but still to get the point across. Yes, you read that right - the reason it is one thousandth of a cent and not one ten-thousandth or one hundred-thousandth is because someone didn’t want to key in an extra couple of zeroes on their keypad.

But the point they have made by making it as low as it was - one thousandth of a cent - is that the company and its stock is effectively worthless. Whenever a company becomes insolvent and is wound up shareholders always lose everything because they are so low on the pecking order of distribution of any remaining assets. 99.999% of the time an insolvent company being wound up manages to pay unpaid taxes, unpaid wages, trade creditors and a portion of bondholders’ assets at the most. By that time all the money is gone and shareholders are almost always entitled to ZERO.

So this was a long way of saying this company is effectively worthless (for shareholders at least), but is still being kept on the brokerage books at $0.0001.

Even long after everyone knows the company is effectively worthless - no white knight came along to save the day - the company will still remain on the brokers’ books at $0.0001. The broker usually wants to wait until all the legalities are finished with the insolvency (and this takes years) before removing the stock from their books. But why not just price it at zero?? There are two reasons for this - one technical and one legal - that are born of the same issue.

The technical problem is that brokerage systems can’t actually carry something at exactly zero - it would throw all sorts of DIV/0 errors in the background and would be impossible to administer.

The legal one is that any contract - and a share sale is a contract - must have offer and consideration. Neither the offer nor the consideration could be equal to exactly zero legally. You can never purchase or sell anything for exactly zero dollars. (Incidentally, that is why many contracts where something is effectively given away list its price at a dollar and sometimes even staple the dollar inside the contract. Contractually you can’t give something away.).

So there is a process that brokers have to actually declare a stock worthless and remove it from their books with some accounting magic. And as I said earlier, from experience this only happens months or years after the stock became effectively worthless and was priced at $0.0001.

And, to finally come back to the point, this is why I find this question so interesting!

Because if a stock is priced at $0.0001, everyone who knows anything knows it is worthless, even though it has not yet been declared worthless and taken off the books. By this point I should add it is very likely that all the stock is no longer being traded in the market and is kept in the brokers’ own reserves, so there is no actual counterparty to the transaction - if you buy it at $0.0001 you would almost certainly be buying it from the broker themselves and not some other poor slob.

So my question - to which I don’t have an answer - is WOULD THEY SELL YOU THE MILLION WORTHLESS SHARES AND TAKE YOUR $100?

They KNOW it is effectively worthless and they would also know that somewhere down the line it will be declared to be actually worthless and removed from the books.

I know it is not a good bet to bet against the greed of institutional bankers, but I kind of suspect that they would refuse to sell it to you if they had any sense. Because if there were ever any sort of government inquiry, this would be an example of them breaching their fiduciary duty by selling something they knew would eventually be declared worthless. Stories of ripping off the little guy and all that.

But I did say “if they had any sense”, and if there is one thing I learned working for this big bank is that there was a real shortage of people with any sense there. Who knows, maybe they would have taken the $100 and appearances be damned!

I kind of suspect this was a throwaway question not really looking for an answer like mine - but it doesn’t matter - the question intrigued me!!!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j4tczfnouvh52i3p', 'title': 'What would happen if I bought $100 of a stock that listed at $.0001?', 'score': {'original': 0.99925, 'ai': 0.00075}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'What would happen if I bought $100 of a stock that listed at $.0001?\n\nThere is actually more to this question than meets the eye.\n\nMathematically (and this was answered by another), you get a million shares less any commission costs.\n\nBut, having worked in the industry many years ago, there is something else going on here…\n\nA stock that is listed at $0.0001 is almost certainly a stock that is effectively worthless but that no one at the brokerage has gotten around to declaring worthless.

Pramod Kumar,Updated 6y,What are the biggest mistakes a trader should avoid in stock trading?,"Biggest Mistakes? :

Well, mistakes are made.

It should have been singular. Mistake.

You can not be making many mistakes and all of them biggest.

Biggest Mistake:

A trader makes mistakes almost in every trade. How do we say that one particular mistake is the biggest ?

It is indeed difficult to identify a single one.

I would settle for 3 mistakes and express my views for whatever they are worth.

I have made these mistakes at some point of time and suffered for it. Other traders too may be doing the same knowingly or unknowingly.

Mistake 1:

Real Example:

Reliance Infra was trading at around Rs. 453–454 on December 23, 2015.

My brother in law decided to buy 500 shares. I had recently resigned from a job with this company was not in favor of buying decision. For me everything about the company sucked. As if my leaving will cause the stock price to crash.

But he was very firm in his decision and placed a LIMIT order for buying at Rs. 452.

The price kept moving for a very long time between 455–453 range and I advised him to buy at MARKET price, not the LIMIT.

He did not change the order.

The stock was not bought.

It closed at 461 on that day, went up to 491 next day and on December 31, 2015 closed at 543.95.

An opportunity missed because of being adamant about limit order.

Every trader does it.

Why is this a mistake? :

Just consider this.

You are buying because you expect the price to go up.

Then why you are placing the order below the current price.

Are you not being too greedy?

You want the price to go up. But before that you want it to come down to meet your requirement . It should move up only after you have bought at a lower price.

Why should market oblige you twice?

It is difficult to get one move in your favour, you are asking for two.

This is what generally happens with such orders:

The order will not be completed like in this case and you miss out on a good trade.

You will get the stock at 452 and it will continue to go down further. Yes, the market obliged you once and did not reverse the direction after that.

Avoid this mistake.

Once you are committed to a trade, go ahead with a MARKET order.

Mistake 2:

Most traders have no idea about a STOP LOSS.

They have heard of it but do not know what to do about it.

Sure, we are here to make profits. Why we should be talking of booking losses?

See these Trapeze Artists:

Can they succeed without the safety net?

Trading is like a trapeze act. Stop Loss is the safety net.

In case of a fall, it will protect you from fatality and broken bones.

Meaning a total capital wipe out or a huge loss.

With manageable losses one can get into next trade with a positive feeling.

Never ever trade without a stop loss.

One of my experiences of trading without stop loss is narrated here:

Pramod Kumar's answer to What was your first stock market mistake?

Mistake 3:

I know I am courting controversy here but I am having a very firm view on this issue.

The advice given to traders by almost everyone is:

Trade with the money you can afford to lose.

I beg to differ.

Rather, I strongly disagree.

If you even have a slightest thought that you can afford to lose some money, believe me, you will certainly lose it.

Do not make the mistake of considering some loss as affordable.

Money is precious.

Money is important.

We work hard for it.

Why should I be even thinking of losing it and considering the loss affordable?

Every loss is bad.

It should give me pain.

I should work and refine my trades to eradicate this pain of losing money.

I trade with the money I can not afford to lose.

But all the money is not put in one trade. I plan to have winning trades but plan to manage the losing ones also.

Loss in one trade or a month does not rattle me. There are more trades to make and eventually right trades will bring in the profit.

Every loss should be taken as a lesson to improve my trading and money management and not shrugged off as something I could afford.

Summary:

Do not expect the markets to oblige you more than once. Place MARKET orders.

Do not trade without a STOP LOSS. It is dangerous.

Do not treat losses as AFFORDABLE. Learn a lesson from every loss. Learn to respect the MONEY.

These were my views on the biggest mistake a trader should avoid in trading.

Pradipto Banerjee,Updated 6y,What are the biggest scams and frauds today?,"The prologue first. I stay at Sector 5, SaltLake, Kolkata. It is the IT hub of Kolkata. So one fine day I needed to go outstation and so booked an UBER to howrah station (railway station) from my place, the car gets booked and the fare rs 400 approx is shown. Few moments later an Uber arrives, the car driver takes one of the longest possible routes to get out of my neighborhood , I didn’t tell him anything because I was too early for the train and had nearly 2 hours in my hand. Just before we were about to exit Sector 5 suddenly the car slowed down and abruptly stopped.

The driver gets out of the car, reaches the bonnet and after a while says the car broke down, he cannot continue the ride anymore and completes the trip (with my permission). The fare is a whooping Rs 200 just for maybe 2 kms and it was a 12.7 km ride for Rs 400 .

Now as my net was not working so the driver booked another UBER and the fare that was shown from there was Rs 350. I got up on the second uber and then explained to the new driver what had happened.

After listening to me he smiled a bit and said to me “This is a new scam in UBER. There are a few drivers, who pick up people and roam around within the city, justifying why they took this route when asked and when they feel that enough fare has been billed they stage some type of drama about car failure and again look for some new ‘murga’ ”.

He said that he can prove this to me, and again we reached the spot where my first Uber had a break down and it was hardly 8-10 minutes ride , the first uber car was no longer there…..!!!! This happened to many of my friends and room mates too.

Have complained UBER and waiting for their answer and refund…..!!! No mail so far from Uber

Mark Daviis,Updated 2y,If you were to invest your money in the stock market would you advise long-term or short-term holdings?,"When it comes to investing, it is important to find the right balance for you and your individual situation. Before you start investing, whether it be short or long-term investing, you should have clear goals in mind.

Investing isn't typically a get rich quick tactic that you can do for a short period of time and expect to make a significant amount of money. It's often a long-term process that requires patience, commitment, and keeping calm when the market fluctuates, as it inevitably will.

You may have heard of long-term investments and short-term investments, but are unsure of what they mean, what the difference is, or what investment strategy is best for you. A long-term investment usually offers a higher probability of maximizing your return over a 10-year period, rather than bringing you a high return in just a few years. Examples of long-term investment vehicles include stocks and index funds.

A short-term investment is an investment you expect to hold for 3 years or less, then sell and/or convert to cash. Examples of short-term investments include money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-term bonds. While many people like to play the market or speculate with day trading, it's a risky business and you should educate yourself and do plenty of research before you try short-term investing. For most people, it is easier and safer to plan on long-term investments.

Long-term investments are investment that you can expect to pay off after holding them for a period of several years. When investing long-term, you can be more aggressive because you have a longer time horizon, so you could opt to invest in an aggressive mutual fund to get the highest rate of return.

You can approach long-term investing by determining the rate of return you want, then looking for a mutual fund that averages that rate of return over a five to 10-year period. When you invest for the long-term you must not panic when a stock's value drops and avoid selling just because the market looks bad.

The market is cyclical and always recovers from drops, although it may take time to do so. However, if you pull out when prices are low, you may lose a portion of the money you initially invested. It helps if you avoid watching your portfolio often, and if there's a dip in the market, sit tight and don't pull out your money. Let the stock prices recover over time.

When you decide how much risk you can bear, keep in mind that the longer you have to invest your money the bigger the risks you can take. If you need the money in the next few years, take a more financially conservative approach to your investments and opt to invest in a more secure type of investment. Another factor in choosing the type of investment may be what you are planning on using the money for. This may determine how much risk you feel comfortable with while investing.

Long-term investments are more suitable for investors looking to save for a long-term goal, such as retirement or a college fund. You won't earn much of a return if you put money into a long-term investment that you plan to sell in three years, or if you want to use the funds for a more short-term goal, like a vacation.Check affiliatecoin.tech for more

Anurag R Nair,7y,How do I understand BSE and start trading?,"GO THROUGH PART 1 OF STOCKS DECODED FOR REFERENCE LINK: Anurag R Nair's answer to What are basic world and historic facts every person should know?

STOCKS DECODED PART 2-

What is Stock Exchange(SE)?

Stock Exchange is an exchange where traders can buy and/or sell stocks(aka shares),bonds and other securities.

Bombay Stock Exchange(BSE)- is an Indian SE located at Mumbai . Established in 1875, the BSE is Asia’s first stock exchange and it’s the world's 11th largest stock exchange with an overall market capitalization of $1.7 trillion as of January 23, 2015. More than 5500 companies are publicly listed on the BSE.

How are these 5500+ companies divided?

Companies are divided into various indices (Sensex being one of the indexes as mentioned in part 1 of my answer)

Various indices are calculated based on

1)Market capitalization which includes

BSE Sensex Index,BSE Mid-Cap Index,BSE Small-Cap Index,BSE-200 Index,Dollex-30 and many more.

The stocks in BSE Sensex approximately account for one-fifth of the capitalization of the exchange.

2)Type of industries which includes-

BSE Auto Index,BSE BANKEX,BSE Healthcare Index,BSE IT Index,BSE Oil and Gas Index,BSE IT Index,BSE Metal Index,BSE Power Index,BSE Healthcare Index,BSE FMCG Index,BSE Consumer Durables Index.

If a company like MARUTI is there in BSE Sensex Index then it can’t be there in BSE Auto Index.

So Conclusion—

BSE and Sensex are different, one is the stock exchange and another one is the Index which comes under BSE which includes various other indices.

Now coming to how Sensex is computed-

Sensex includes top 30 companies as per the market capitalization which is listed on BSE.

Calculation part for Sensex Index is explained in STOCKS DECODED PART 1 ,but these list of 30 companies gets revised in every quarter, i.e 3 months.

Suppose Co 1 to Co 30 are there in the decreasing order of Total free floating capitalization(TFFC). Now suppose cumulative Total free floating capitalization of these 30 Companies =Rs 1,00,00,000(1 crore) at the end of first quarter of 2016 and Sensex Index=25000 at the same time.

And suppose TFFC of Co 30=Rs 1,00,000(1 lakh) at the end of 1st quarter .

Now Co 31 did well in the 1st quarter with a Total free floating capitalization=Rs 2,00,000 which is greater than the TFFC of company 30 but less than that of Co 29 .

So now Co 31 enters into the top 30 companies of BSE(which we call new Top 30) and Co 30 goes out.

But now the cumulative TFFC of the new Top 30 = (Rs 1,00,00,000-Rs 1,00,000+Rs 2,00,000)= Rs 1,01,00,000(1 crore 1 lakh).

Now on the first day of 2nd quarter 0f, 2016 Sensex will indicate some different value.

What will be the new value?

For a TFFC of Rs 1,00,00,000 Sensex Index= 25000

So for a TFFC of Rs1,01,00,000 Sensex Index=25250 (Ratio Proportion)

Conclusion- Top 30 companies are not fixed and similar calculation is done after every quarterly report when there is a chance for”n” number of companies to get into top 30 list

Don Stuart,Updated 1y,What made people suddenly decide to sell their stocks on the same morning in late October 1929?,"It wasn’t sudden.

The Dow peaked Sept. 3, 1929, a month after the Reserve Bank of New York announced it was jacking interest rates from 5% to 6%.

We take credit for granted now, but in the Roaring ‘20s credit to consumers was a brand new thing. Guess what? People took to it like Peruvian Flake.

A figurative representation.

General Motors was built upon GMAC, the new credit arm facilitated by J.P. Morgan Jr. in 1919 that allowed buyers to “finance” a new car with a payment plan — for the first time. People soon after could borrow similarly to buy all sorts of durable goods. Eventually even stock in the makers and sellers of those goods.

So they did. The Dow rose 400% from 1921 to 1929, fueled by credit-driven consumer spending, increased manufacturing to meet demand, and speculative “investing” by people following the “smart money.”

Here’s a glimpse of the landscape courtesy of the FDIC (which didn’t exist then):

The Roaring '20s

Exposed to mass marketing and “easy payment plans,” people buy in record numbers everything from houses to cars to appliances and furniture.
Assembly lines increase production.
Department stores give credit cards to their wealthier customers. Metal charge-plates are introduced. Oil companies offer courtesy cards for charging gas.
Banks offer installment loans, mortgages, and loans to stock market speculators on 90 percent margins.
There are no insider-trading laws.
The dramatic expansion in the financial sector introduces new corporate securities issues, especially in common and preferred stock. The stock market undergoes an extraordinary, unprecedented expansion and is caught in a speculative euphoria between 1925 and 1929.
Banks unveil new securities affiliates with names almost identical to their own to wipe away the distinction between saving and speculating.
First National City Bank (Citibank) and its stock subsidiary, the National City Company, have 2,000 brokers selling stocks.
National City Company repackages bad Latin American loans from its affiliated bank and sells them to unknowing investors as new securities. This is one of the deals that initiate the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
Banks speculate on land development.
The financial environment creates new products like the unit trust (known today as the mutual fund) and compound-interest savings accounts.

Especially popular was borrowing to buy stocks on margin. Except few folk expected to face a “margin call.” That comes into play if your margin value falls too low, like um, if your stock prices go down. You gotta put up more collateral out-of-pocket, or else the broker sells off your stock regardless of market price.

Anyway, the Dow had already sunk 21% from its September peak by Black Thursday, which was initially just a nasty margin-reckoning session. Morgan and other big bankers bought stocks and propped prices back up, Friday was okay but after considering the Sunday papers the bears came running Monday morning. The bankers mostly surrendered and the market tanked by 13%. On Black Tuesday the panic was full blown — down another 12% in a day.

There had been political commentary about the market’s “speculative orgy” in September and October. The London Exchange had foundered amid scandal in late September, driving overseas investors and lenders to pull out of the US. And the “smart money” began shorting stocks — that’s leveraged betting that a stock price will fall.

Erosion of confidence was gaining momentum for six weeks ahead of the Crash, and began months earlier as new President Hoover urged the Fed and the press to throttle speculation, a massive tariff bill was working through Congress and consumer demand was lagging manufacturer oversupply.

Meanwhile a long recession in rural America was turning toxic. In four years 5,000 banks had folded as farmers couldn’t meet their loans and small-town folk defaulted on those “easy payment plans.”

Risk of panic was exacerbated by a long history of bank runs and failures in the US. Banks, you see, were also speculating with depositors’ money. And lending to help people play the market, driving up the value of the bankers’ own plays. By 1929, two out of every five dollars a bank loaned were used to purchase stocks.

While just 10% of Americans owned shares of stock at peak irrational exuberance, over 60% of families struggled below the poverty line. Then came the Great Depression as the economy and banking system gradually collapsed.

That’s become the conventional story. If you want to drill into what was probably the market’s tipping point, it was this:

The meltdown of highly leveraged, overvalued utilities stocks in mid-October due to looming investigation of rate-scalping. Electrification in the 1920’s was like the Internet of the 1990’s, only with wider economic implications and larger infrastructure costs.

Yup. A tech bubble.

There’s a deeper academic analysis below, from which I’ll share this tidbit:

Stocks lost nearly $16 billion in the month of October . . . Twenty-nine public utilities (tabulated by the New York Times) lost $5.1 billion in the month, by far the largest loss of any of the industries listed by the Times.

The 1929 Stock Market Crash
Harold Bierman, Jr., Cornell University Overview The 1929 stock market crash is conventionally said to have occurred on Thursday the 24 th and Tuesday the 29 th of October. These two dates have been dubbed “Black Thursday” and “Black Tuesday,” respectively. On September 3, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record high of 381.2. At the end of the market day on Thursday, October 24, the market was at 299.5 — a 21 percent decline from the high. On this day the market fell 33 points — a drop of 9 percent — on trading that was approximately three times the normal daily volume for the first nine months of the year. By all accounts, there was a selling panic. By November 13, 1929, the market had fallen to 199. By the time the crash was completed in 1932, following an unprecedentedly large economic depression, stocks had lost nearly 90 percent of their value. The events of Black Thursday are normally defined to be the start of the stock market crash of 1929-1932, but the series of events leading to the crash started before that date. This article examines the causes of the 1929 stock market crash. While no consensus exists about its precise causes, the article will critique some arguments and support a preferred set of conclusions. It argues that one of the primary causes was the attempt by important people and the media to stop market speculators. A second probable cause was the great expansion of investment trusts, public utility holding companies, and the amount of margin buying, all of which fueled the purchase of public utility stocks, and drove up their prices. Public utilities, utility holding companies, and investment trusts were all highly levered using large amounts of debt and preferred stock. These factors seem to have set the stage for the triggering event. This sector was vulnerable to the arrival of bad news regarding utility regulation. In October 1929, the bad news arrived and utility stocks fell dramatically. After the utilities decreased in price, margin buyers had to sell and there was then panic selling of all stocks. The Conventional View The crash helped bring on the depression of the thirties and the depression helped to extend the period of low stock prices, thus “proving” to many that the prices had been too high. Laying the blame for the “boom” on speculators was common in 1929. Thus, immediately upon learning of the crash of October 24 John Maynard Keynes (Moggridge, 1981, p. 2 of Vol. XX) wrote in the New York Evening Post (25 October 1929) that “The extraordinary speculation on Wall Street in past months has driven up the rate of interest to an unprecedented level.” And the Economist when stock prices reached their low for the year repeated the theme that the U.S. stock market had been too high (November 2, 1929, p. 806): “there is warrant for hoping that the deflation of the exaggerated balloon of American stock values will be for the good of the world.” The key phrases in these quotations are “exaggerated ba

Twenty-nine public utilities (tabulated by the New York Times) lost $5.1 billion in the month, by far the largest loss of any of the industries listed by the Times.\n\nThe 1929 Stock Market Crash\nHarold Bierman, Jr., Cornell University Overview The 1929 stock market crash is conventionally said to have occurred on Thursday the 24 th and Tuesday the 29 th of October. These two dates have been dubbed “Black Thursday” and “Black Tuesday,” respectively. On September 3, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record high of 381.2. At the end of the market day on Thursday, October 24, the market was at 299.5 — a 21 percent decline from the high. On this day the market fell 33 points — a drop of 9 percent — on trading that was approximately three times the normal daily volume for the first nine months of the year. By all accounts, there was a selling panic. By November 13, 1929, the market had fallen to 199. By the time the crash was completed in 1932, following an unprecedentedly large economic depression, stocks had lost nearly 90 percent of their value. The events of Black Thursday are normally defined to be the start of the stock market crash of 1929-1932, but the series of events leading to the crash started before that date. This article examines the causes of the 1929 stock market crash. While no consensus exists about its precise causes, the article will critique some arguments and support a preferred set of conclusions. It argues that one of the primary causes was the attempt by important people and the media to stop market speculators. A second probable cause was the great expansion of investment trusts, public utility holding companies, and the amount of margin buying, all of which fueled the purchase of public utility stocks, and drove up their prices. Public utilities, utility holding companies, and investment trusts were all highly levered using large amounts of debt and preferred stock. These factors seem to have set the stage for the triggering event. This sector was vulnerable to the arrival of bad news regarding utility regulation. In October 1929, the bad news arrived and utility stocks fell dramatically. After the utilities decreased in price, margin buyers had to sell and there was then panic selling of all stocks. The Conventional View The crash helped bring on the depression of the thirties and the depression helped to extend the period of low stock prices, thus “proving” to many that the prices had been too high. Laying the blame for the “boom” on speculators was common in 1929. Thus, immediately upon learning of the crash of October 24 John Maynard Keynes (Moggridge, 1981, p. 2 of Vol. XX) wrote in the New York Evening Post (25 October 1929) that “The extraordinary speculation on Wall Street in past months has driven up the rate of interest to an unprecedented level.” And the Economist when stock prices reached their low for the year repeated the theme that the U.S. stock market had been too high (November 2, 1929, p. 806): “there is warrant for hoping that the deflation of the exaggerated balloon of American stock values will be for the good of the world.” The key phrases in these quotations are “exaggerated ba\nhttps://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-1929-stock-market-crash/"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9799
Ankur Jain,Updated 3y,How do you choose stocks to buy for a long term? Is the SBI Card stock worth buying?,"I buy stocks for a long term (5 years or more) and very infrequently.

In my last 12+ years of investing in stocks, I have tested various methods but one method that has provided me the maximum returns is this.

Go with the company that has personally provided you excellent services and/or an excellent product.

—————————

Back in 2009, I was looking for a UPS which could take the load of just a modem. Most of the UPS - that time - required a minimum input load to function. While there were several brands available that time, VGuard UPS was the only one that could provide this functionality. The shopkeeper was very confident about this UPS in particular. On his guarantee, I purchased the UPS. It worked as intended and far exceeded my expectations in terms of the duration of time it could run when there was a power outage. In the next few days, I had to talk to the customer care and they were quite knowledgeable about the product.

Back then, I didn’t know anything about Fundamental/Technical Analysis. Just on the basis of my excellent experience, I purchased VGuard stocks. Here is the performance since then -

A staggering 40x returns in ~10 years.

—————————

Forward to 2011, I had started my own company and was looking for banks who could provide door step services. Tried several banks, one bank that was very professional in its approach and dealing was HDFC Bank. Few months down I purchased the stocks. Here is the performance since then -

5x returns in ~8 years.

—————————

In 2013, I had to take a home loan. Checked various banks, SBI was one of the two banks that had a unique home loan product called Max Gain. It was great for people who are in their own businesses.
You guessed it right, I bought SBI stocks.

1.7x returns in ~6 years. Not really bright returns. I feel it has more to do with this being a PSU, it has an excessive intervention by the Govt and is run by unprofessional staff.
Since getting the home loan, the few times I had to interact with them, my experience has been pathetic. There is a care-free attitude all around. They all make themselves look busy but no one seems interested in doing your work.
I plan to exit from it soon.

—————————

In 2018, I thought of using my newly acquired Fundamental Analysis skills and invested in Graphite India. This is the first stock I purchased where I have never bought anything and have never interacted with the company. Here is how it went -

Stock price has gone down by 75% and right now because of various other factors its future looks bleak.

I am not saying there is anything wrong with Fundamental/Technical Analysis. It has worked wonderfully for investors around the world.

I still learn and follow the excellent analysis/blogs of professionals like Gopal Kavalireddi , Deepak Shenoy but now - along with looking into fundamentals - I have made it a point to stick with stocks where I have a personal experience dealing with the company.

Whether I would buy SBI Card stock?

SBI Card was the first credit card that I got around 2007. In last 12 years of dealing with them, the services provided by them have been top-notch.
Charge-back requests were dealt with very professionally. Whenever I have to do a transaction during an odd time, I would get a verification call within 15 seconds (you read that right - 15 seconds), by their live transaction monitoring team. In case of a for-ex transaction the currency conversion rate by them was the best among all other credit card providers.

I would often tell my family, “SBI Card doesn’t look like a government run entity. The services are way too good and run professionally. I wish they had their own stock listed in the market.”

My wish seems to be have been fulfilled. SBI Card has recently come up with an IPO and I have invested in it. Even if I am not allotted the IPO, I will invest via the secondary market. I feel, due to the Corona Virus scare, it may not see a bumper listing but from a long term point of view , it may prove to be a great stock to own.

Happy Investing!

Soumi Dey,Updated 5y,What is the most powerful message in the book you have read?,"Bhagavad Gita.

I read this holy book not just because it is the soul of hindu religion but because it played a role of a mentor in my life.

This book gave me detail knowledge about life and the purpose of this human life.

If you ask me about the most powerful message i have learned from this book then there are several powerful messages.

Like:

1.Whatever has to happen will happen. We don't have control in many things then why to think about them? Instead of thinking about uncontrollable things, we should just focus on our own work. Whatever will happen will happen for good.

2.Attachments are the real cause of every pain.

3.There is nothing that a human can't do. If he believes that he can do it, that means HE CAN DO IT.

4. Knowing your inner self is more important than knowing the outer world.

5. God is the supreme creator of this whole universe.

Indrazith Shantharaj,2y,How can I learn technical analysis specially for intraday trading?,"I have studied high school (8th to 10th std) in a small remote village called Malladihalli.

It was a tiny village in one of the most backward districts in Karnataka. But it had many educational institutes, and it helped a lot of families get a good education at a very low price.

One person started all these things. His name is Malladihalli Raghavendra Swamiji, who taught yoga to Sadghuru.

One of my classmates/hostel mate/roommate from high school was troubling me to teach intraday trading to him.

He used to call me 1-2 times a month and pleaded with me to teach intraday trading.

But the problem is his personality and mindset are not suited for intraday trading.

He gets excited soon, he will lose his temper quickly and doesn't have analytical skills.

But he is a good person by heart and also works as a school teacher. So, I didn't want him to lose money by jumping into intraday trading.

But he is not in a mood or situation to listen to my advice. I had to do something. Otherwise, our friendship was at stake.

So I made a plan.

I asked him to come to Bangalore for 2-3 days (he stays in a small village near western ghats) and observe my intraday trading activities. If he still prefers to learn intraday trading after 2-3 days of observation, I am happy to teach him.

He came to my house on a Sunday. I took him to pyramid valley (a beautiful place for meditation in the outskirts of Bangalore), and we had some fun.

The next day, we were ready before the market opened. I told him that I would take each trade in front of him. I will mention the initial risk amount and explain all my actions in the live market.

On that day, Banknifty opened with a small gap near the previous day's high. It was a pure initiative buying setup (a market profile concept). So, I took a long trade with Banknifty futures (medium quantity).

After 10-15 minutes, Banknifty shot up by 200 points. I have a separate screen for charts, and the banknifty chart was displayed there. On my laptop screen, I opened my MTM screen and asked my friend.

Me: 'These numbers displayed in green is the profit. What should I do now?'

Friend: 'Sell immediately! you have already made so much of profit in 15 minutes'

Me: 'ok, but note down the profits now. I am not closing this, and I will hold the trade.'

My friend got confused, and he strangely looked at me.

After some time, the price corrected 60-80 points.

Friend: 'see, I had told you to close the trade. Now you are profits reduced by 40-50%'.

Me: 'That's fine. What would have done if you were in my position?'

Friend: 'I would have closed the trade now and pocked at least the remaining 50% profits'.

Me: 'That's wonderful, but I will do the opposite.'

After saying this, I added some more quantities to my long trade.

It was still 11.30-12. My friend has already started feeling restlessness. But I had clearly instructed my friend to sit in front of the computer until the market closes for the day.

It was a clear uptrend on that day, and Banknifty was going up.

My friend was going mad after seeing the profit numbers. He was scolding himself for suggesting closing the trade while he congratulated me for not following his advice.

Banknifty started giving a pullback at 2 PM. I asked him what to do now.

Friend: ' You made good money already. It looks like it will fall now. Please close the trade at least now. I am 100% sure I will be right this time!"".

Me: 'I do the exact opposite thing now. I will add some more positions'.

After saying this, I have bought some more quantity in banknifty.

My friend had gone mad and started walking in the room at a brisk pace. Every tick of fall raised his blood pressure, and he was having a tough time dealing with it.

To cut short the story, Banknifty closed at day's high, and I made good profits on that day.

My friend was exhausted by that time. I asked him to take a cold shower. After the shower, I took him to a good restaurant and started eating lunch.

I had told him that this is the lifestyle of an intraday trader and asked him whether he is still interested to learn intraday trading.

He did 'namaste using both hands and said he would focus on his job. He admitted that he would not be able to handle the emotions in the live market and apologized to me for troubling me to teach intraday trading to him.

Many newcomers will have the same story when they start intraday trading.

Most people face tough times to ride their profits and to avoid revenge trading in intraday trading.

But these two are the essential qualities required to make money in intraday trading.

Unfortunately, many people only highlight 'Technical Analysis' in intraday trading.

Without a doubt, technical analysis is important. But trading psychology and risk management play a crucial role than technical analysis in intraday trading.

Please note opportunity exists in all the time frames. But whenever we get into a lower timeframe, we get more opportunities. Still, we also get more noise, and there is a high possibility of facing successive failed trades (hence money management is essential).

So, all the general technical analysis concepts hold good in intraday trading as well.

Let us look at some of the valuable technical analysis concepts.

#1 ABCD Pattern

It is one of the oldest and simplest intraday trading strategies. New traders and even intermediate-level traders can quickly deploy this strategy.

Typically ABCD patterns start with a strong upside move.

When the market opened, Reliance stock rallied upside as buyers bought aggressively from point A and made new highs of the day (point B).

One should not take trade here as it has already rallied on the upside and wait for some correction due to profit booking.

After B, traders started booking profits, and also some sellers entered the market.

At point C, the price has found some support. Hence, a trader can plan a long trade above the green candle's high, keeping a stop-loss below the green candle's low.

The stock price surged from 2000 (C) to 2025 (D) around 11.20 AM, and you can also see a good volume spike at the same time.

It indicates a strong buyers' presence, and hence we can expect a strong close on the upside. Hence, it is better to trail our SL below every swing low.

The chart reveals that the trail SL has been hit at 2028 in the last hour of the trading session.

#2 Open Range Intraday Breakout Trading System (ORB Strategy)

ORB Strategy is developed by TOBY CRABLE, and it is one of the most famous trading strategies among intraday traders.

It is based on the concept “Amateurs open the market and professionals close the market.”

The first hour after the market opens is crucial and sets the base for any further activities for the rest of the day.

Usually, traders wait for 1-hour range completion.

If the price breaks on the upside, they opt for a long trade above the high of the 1-hour opening range, keeping a stop-loss a little below the breakout candle (or below the high of the 1-hour opening range).

The same logic for a short trade if the price breaks the low 1-hour range.

We can use MA, or ATR to trail the stop-loss.

The above image shows an example of an opening range breakout (ORB) trade in Bank nifty.

First, the price consolidated within a 1-hour range for some time. In the last few sessions, the price broke above the high of the 1-hour range and displayed a good move on the upside.

This strategy has offered a 50% accuracy and a risk-reward of 1:1.8 for Bank nifty in the last 10 years. Hence, this is a pretty good system to deploy in intraday trading.

Useful Rules in Intraday Trading

Below are some of the rules which are helpful in intraday trading:

Don't lose more than 10% of your capital on any trading day.
Don't risk more than 3-5% of your capital in one trade.
It's better to take a break from intraday trading if you are not feeling good (emotionally).
Always remember trading is just a probability game and not a prediction game.
It's impossible to catch all the excellent trade opportunities every day/time.
If you see the MTM profit screenshots of other traders, it will trouble your emotional balance. So follow your trade plan.
It's better to stick one trading system across different market conditions. Your learning curve will not improve if you keep on jumping from one strategy to another.
Avoid trading when you see a significant drawdown or when you get a few successive failed trades.
When you think you know everything in the market, the next day you lose big money.
If you lose money on any trade, then you have made a mistake. There is a lesson to learn (no matter what).
Your aim should be to make money in the market every day, not on other tasks like getting appreciation from others, getting more followers, etc.
There is no need to argue with anyone for any reason. You are right if you are making money in the market.
Profit in trading is inversely proportional to your ego.
Learn how to ride your profits. It is the most challenging task in trading.

New traders and even intermediate-level traders can quickly deploy this strategy.\n\nTypically ABCD patterns start with a strong upside move.\n\nWhen the market opened, Reliance stock rallied upside as buyers bought aggressively from point A and made new highs of the day (point B).\n\nOne should not take trade here as it has already rallied on the upside and wait for some correction due to profit booking.\n\nAfter B, traders started booking profits, and also some sellers entered the market.\n\nAt point C, the price has found some support. Hence, a trader can plan a long trade above the green candle\'s high, keeping a stop-loss below the green candle\'s low.\n\nThe stock price surged from 2000 (C) to 2025 (D)', 'result': {'fake': 0.1765, 'real': 0.8235}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""around 11.20 AM, and you can also see a good volume spike at the same time.\n\nIt indicates a strong buyers' presence, and hence we can expect a strong close on the upside. Hence, it is better to trail our SL below every swing low.\n\nThe chart reveals that the trail SL has been hit at 2028 in the last hour of the trading session.\n\n#2 Open Range Intraday Breakout Trading System (ORB Strategy)\n\nORB Strategy is developed by TOBY CRABLE, and it is one of the most famous trading strategies among intraday traders.\n\nIt is based on the concept “Amateurs open the market and professionals close the market.”\n\nThe first hour after the market opens is crucial and sets the base for any further activities for the rest of the day.\n\nUsually, traders wait for 1-hour range completion.\n\nIf the price breaks on the upside, they opt for a long trade above the high of the 1-hour opening range, keeping a stop-loss a little below the breakout candle (or below the high of the 1-hour opening range).\n\nThe same logic for a short trade if the price breaks the low 1-hour range.\n\nWe can use MA, or ATR to trail the stop-loss.\n\nThe above image shows an example of an opening range breakout (ORB) trade in Bank nifty.\n\nFirst, the price consolidated within a 1-hour range for some time. In the last few sessions, the price broke above the high of the 1-hour range and displayed a good move on the upside.\n\nThis strategy has offered a 50% accuracy and a risk-reward of 1:1.8 for Bank nifty in the last 10 years. Hence, this is a pretty good system to deploy in intraday trading.\n\nUseful Rules in Intraday Trading\n\nBelow are some of the rules which are helpful in intraday trading:\n\nDon't lose more than 10% of your capital on any trading day.\nDon't risk more than 3-5% of your capital in one trade.\nIt's better to take a break from intraday trading if you are not feeling good (emotionally).\nAlways remember trading is just a probability game and not a prediction game.\nIt's impossible to catch all the excellent trade opportunities every day/time.\nIf you see the MTM profit screenshots of other traders, it will trouble your emotional balance. So follow your trade plan.\nIt's better to stick one trading system across different market conditions. Your learning curve will not improve if you keep on jumping from one strategy to another.\nAvoid trading when you see a significant drawdown or when you get a few successive failed trades.\nWhen you think you know everything in the market, the next day you lose big money.\nIf you lose money on any trade, then you have made a mistake. There is a lesson to learn (no matter what).\nYour aim should be to make money in the market every day, not on other tasks like getting appreciation from others, getting more followers, etc.\nThere is no need to argue with anyone for any reason. You are right if you are making money in the market.\nProfit in trading is inversely proportional to your ego.\nLearn how to ride your profits.

Sayyam Luhadiya,Updated 4y,Why is investing important?,"My grandmother used to say how cheap the things were in her time, and how prices have grown since then. I hope most of us can relate to this.

Think about the milk you purchase and how its price has changed in a decade! We have a word for it, some geeks call it inflation. But there’s some simple math to understand how this jargon word is, in a way, killing your dreams.

I am fond of dosas, they are simple, crunchy yet soft, and so delicious and easy to make. There’s no reason to hate them!

I have Rs. 1,00,000 in cash, right now. And the price of a Dosa in my city is Rs.100. How many dosas can I buy if I spend my entire money on it?

Do the math - Rs.1,00,000/Rs.100 = 1000 Dosas.

Let’s say a year passed, I have the same money in my safe. Just to be specific, let’s say the inflation rate (rise in price) in the market is 10%. That means, after a year, the price of my Dosa will be - Rs.100 + Rs. 10 = Rs.110. How many Dosas can I buy now?

Do the math again - Rs. 1,00,000/Rs. 110 = 909 Dosas (approx)! I could buy 1000 Dosas in the previous year and now I can purchase only 909 Dosas.

Who ate my 91 Dosas!?

After a decade, the price of a Dosa will be Rs. 260 (approx), taking inflation compoundly. With this, I can buy only 384 Dosas. A long leap of faith from 1000 Dosas!

Is there a solution to it?

Let’s suppose, as and when I got my Rs. 1,00,000, I invested it in some asset, from where my money increased with 15% p.a. interest rate. I ended up with Rs. 1,15,000 in my hands, and Rs. 110 as the price of a Dosa in the market. How many Dosas can I buy now?

Math - Rs. 1,15,000/Rs.110 = 1,045! 45 extra Dosas!

After 10 years, I would have Rs. 4,04,555 money in my hands, with the price of Dosa as Rs. 260. If I do a simple calculation, I can buy 1,555 Dosas.

The above example is given by Dr Raghuram Rajan Sir.

Inflation is good for an economy, but for an individual point of view, it is making the money in your wallets losing its value. And to beat inflation, or if I say in nerdy terms, to hedge against inflation, we should know how to invest our money, because it’s not just for fun, it is for our necessity.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xlg9kb2im18tqhzw', 'title': 'Why is investing important?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My grandmother used to say how cheap the things were in her time, and how prices have grown since then.

Ashna,Updated 2y,What are the biggest scams and frauds today?,"Be Aware! Save yourself from UPI SCAM!

The scam happened with me and my brother.

Which Applications were used? PhonePe and OLX

How did it happen? We wanted to sell our FZ Sportbike and so we uploaded a picture on OLX. On the very second day, we got a call from a person. The voice of the person seemed very mature (probably of age around ’30s) and educated too (as he was speaking good English). At first, he said he want to buy the bike and he is okay with the price amount, and added that he will do some downpayment and the rest he will pay once he come to collect the bike. Since my brother was in class 10th last year, he never felt that he could be a trickster. Moreover, the guy pinged his Adhaar card (a govt. identity proof used in India) as proof to be a genuine guy. He then sent him a link like below for the amount Rs 10000/—

He was on the call during this whole scam,

He: “Click on the Pay button and you will receive Rs 10000/—”

My brother held for a second as he was confused.

My brother: “If you are going to pay me 10k then why is PhonePe asking me to pay.

He: “Focus on the message above the pay button, you will actually receive the amount after clicking the Pay button. This is normal since we are from the army and this is how our payment is being processed on UPI application”.

My innocent brother got agreed and clicked on the button………………

Thanks Devendra Chauhan for pointing out the below missed point via comments. I am updating now:

After he clicked the button, pop up appeared for adding the PIN. He added the PIN. During the whole process my brother was not okay, he kept on confirming the fraudster if it is okay, but the guy tried putting pressure that he has time constraint please do it fast . Go ahead it's absolutely fine. Thus, my brother added….

And guess what happened next? 10k went off within a second. My brother was shivering with fear and started saying to the guy that money got debited from my account instead of credit.

He: “I guess there is some issue with the payment gateway, Don't worry! You send me 5k more, and I will pay you back the whole 15k Rs”

My brother was still confused that why do I need to pay back again ?

He: “Don’t worry, your money is in safe hands. This is the normal way we do our transactions. We can’t do the payment directly otherwise I would have tried to give you back your 10k. You just send me 5k, and I will repay you 15k at one go.”

He had somehow completely overpowered my brother's conscience. My brother was already afraid of losing 10k and somehow wanted it back. So he called me. I still remember his voice that day, I smelled some sense of fear and shiver as it was very low.

I: “What happened, dear? Is everything okay? Why do you sound so nervous”

Brother(Almost in tears): “Please give me 5k Rs, I need it immediately.”

He was repeating the same line over and over. My heart started pounding and I shouted back at him out of nervousness.

I: “Why are you behaving so odd? What has happened? Tell me the truth!”

Then my brother explained the whole story. At that time even I was not aware of such UPI scams. But somehow my heart was not willing to trust that army guy as his logic was very weird that if we pay him 5k, he will return us our 15k back.

Thus, I was sure that our 10k is gone and we have been tricked by some random guy. I asked my brother to immediately block that person and not pick his phone at all.

We finally confessed this scam in front of our parents that evening. Our parents didn't thrash us. They were more concerned for their son's lost self-confidence than monetary loss. From that very day, my brother stopped using applications such as UPIs, OLX, etc.

Looking back to the previous year, I feel that we are more cautious and mature while doing online payments (Mostly we prefer direct bank transfer). We even avoid doing advertisements for our old products on OLX.

The whole reason for writing the answer is to make everyone aware of such scams. Trust me, you won’t have any sense of doubt about the trickster because of his high confidence during your conversation on call.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jzx36scgn2byoh50', 'title': 'What are the biggest scams and frauds today?', 'score': {'original': 0.99525, 'ai': 0.00475}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Be Aware!

Franklin Veaux,2y,"How do billionaires pay for expensive things (like a 6-figure watch, 6-figure vacation, 6-figure shopping trips…etc) or SUPER expensive things (like $50-million jet or $100-million yacht) if their money is held up in stocks?","Let me let you in on a secret I learned at a business development seminar.

If you’re rich, you never ever ever ever spend your money on anything if you can help it. When you take 6-figure vacations or buy a $150,000,000 yacht, you do it with other people’s money.

Specifically, you use your stock as collateral to take out a loan, then you spend the borrowed money on your yacht. If the interest rate is low, which it will be (billionaires don’t pay 24.99% on a loan like poor people do), and the rate of growth of your wealth is higher than the interest rate on the loan, you’d have to be a complete and utter idiot to spend a dime of your own wealth on that yacht. It would literally cost you more to buy the yacht with your own money than to borrow money, buy the yacht, and pay back the loan. Isn’t compounding wealth great?

In fact, you may be able to take a tax write-off on the loan! Between that and the fact your net worth appreciates at a rate higher than the interest rate on the loan, you may get the loan for free…or even come out ahead.

Linh Nguyen,Updated 1y,What is the best brokerage for beginners?,"There are those that invest in order to generate money, while others invest in order to build or protect their financial security. Prioritize your financial needs and make sure the brokerage you choose can meet those demands.

You should pay careful attention to the commissions and costs associated with the markets that are most relevant to you. Think about whether or not the brokerage's available technology suits your investing preferences, whether you're a long-term investor or frequent trader.

For investors, a brokerage is much more than just a place to make deals. Find a broker like 𝖵𝗂𝖼𝗍𝗈𝗋𝗂𝖺 𝖦𝗋𝖺𝖼𝖾 𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖽𝗌𝖺𝗒 who will help you become a better investor by providing you with high-quality research and educational resources.

Finally, don't forget how critical it is that you have access to real-time customer service. Some brokerages place a premium on this feature, offering round-the-clock access to human agents by phone and online chat. But there are also companies that would rather put their attention where it belongs: on their technology, which means they offer no more than email or text chat as customer support.

In light of this, I will suggest that you hire a licensed broker by the name of 𝖵𝗂𝖼𝗍𝗈𝗋𝗂𝖺 𝖦𝗋𝖺𝖼𝖾 𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖽𝗌𝖺𝗒 to assist and manage your portfolio in the market, and that you have access to monitor your account while she handles the trading and maintenance of your brokerage account.

Prakarsh Gagdani,Updated 5y,Why can't everyone make money in the stock market when they can easily get to know the holdings of successful investors?,"This is a very smart question.

Successful investors do a lot of research on Company, sector, economy and other things to arrive at buying decision.

Asim Qureshi,Updated 6y,Why did Nokia fail?,"Nokia’s failure was something that just had to happen - Nokia, realistically, couldn’t have done much about it.

In 2007, around half of all mobile phones sold were Nokia phones. These guys were massively dominant.

Below is my last Nokia, which I bought in 2007. It was a fantastic smartphone.

Less than 10% of all phones sold were smartphones, but even in that growing space Nokia, with its Symbian, had dominance.

But in 2007 something happened that you can’t really blame Nokia for. A nut job, Steve Jobs, made this insanely great smartphone that didn’t even have a keyboard, the iPhone. Not only that, he made buying apps so easy that people would actually buy them, making smartphones so much more useful.

And then, to make matters worse, Google decided to partner with every smartphone manufacturer in the world via Android, which would emulate the iPhone. And they didn’t care whether they made any money or not so gave the software for free.

I mean, what were Nokia supposed to do? It’s far more difficult changing a legacy software, like Symbian, than making an essentially new one like Google did with Android. And given they were so dominant in both hardware and software, they couldn’t have really abandoned either.

Ok, in hindsight they should have adopted Android, but fat chance that was going to happen given Android was way behind, and a competitor.

And so the reason Nokia failed was because shit happens…","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/l40jawcdzk3uy8x7', 'title': 'Why did Nokia fail?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Nokia’s failure was something that just had to happen - Nokia, realistically, couldn’t have done much about it.\n\nIn 2007, around half of all mobile phones sold were Nokia phones.

Pramod Kumar,6y,Is it true that the main reason people lose money in the stock market is because they freak out and sell when their stock prices drop?,"Do People Sell Out When The Stock Prices Fall ? :

I wish it was true.

People do not sell out when the stock price falls. They just watch and convince themselves that the stock will rebound.

It does.

Then it plunges again.

(A) Not Taking Loss :

Now they get concerned. But are afraid to sell at price 20% lower than their buying price.

Their pride gets hurt by admitting that they made a losing investment.

So they wait.

Few months or few months down the line, they just stop caring.

The stock has now fallen to a level that it does not bother them. It is now lost more than 90% of the value and all hopes are given up.

The loss was not caused by investors freaking out and selling when the price fell.

The loss is caused by not selling while the stock kept on falling.

You have to get out of the losing stocks at the right time without being emotional about it.

Example:

Reliance Communications:

This stock traded for Rs. 844.70 in January 2008. It was a part of NIFTY index at that time.

Now it trades for Rs. 20.65 ( June 02, 2017 ) after touching a lifetime low of Rs. 18.10 on May 31, 2017.

The present price is just 2.5% of the high price.

And the people are still holding the stock and thinking wishfully that with the company paying off the debts, it will improve.

Surely it will improve maybe to Rs. 25 level before finding some other reason to fall to Rs. 15.

Surely one can forget about Rs. 800 levels.

There are many such horror stories and I have talked about them in few of my other answers. Just to name few of them:

Himachal Futuristics, Suzlon Energy, Jaiprakash Associates, DLF, Unitech, Kingfisher Airlines, Ramsarup Industries, IVRCL, GMR, GVK, LANCO , the list is pretty long. And I believe all of us have behaved exactly in the manner described above at some time.

The other reason of investors losing out is:

(B) Not Taking Profits:

I will quote this part from my another answer:

Remember that SBI came up with a rights issue priced at around Rs. 1590 per share in year 2008 .

A friend bought these shares at this price.

It crashed to Rs. 1100 in few months. Like most other people, he kept holding his position.

After October 2008, markets started recovering. I do not recall exactly when, but I got a call from him one day:

“ I have exited at 1600. Closed the trade today at 15:29 hrs. Thank God, I recovered the loss.”

SBI stock did not stop there. It went on to a high of Rs. 3500 around Deepavali time in year 2010.

When the opportunity came knocking, the investor was not there to open the door.

Missed out on great profits.

Waited endlessly when the price was moving down but did not have the patience when the trend had reversed in his favor.

What bad could have happened?

Maybe back to Rs. 1100. But you had been there and survived. Would have survived again. Having taken all the pain of losing, the investors miss out the pleasure of profits as they lack patience when they are right.

(C) Taking Small Profits:

I was talking to another friend a few days back. He is looking for ways to recover his losses of more than Rs. 20 lakhs in the markets.

He told me that he will be patient with his portfolio this time.

And sell the stock which increases in value by 20% and thus ensuring that his portfolio will never be in a loss.

I thought over for a moment and told him that he is bound to lose again.

Instead decide that you will get rid of the stock that declines by 20%.

Profits will come from those stocks which will rise by 100 or 200 % over time. If you get out of them with 20% profit and keep the losing ones forever, you can never be in profit.

He still does not agree with me.

Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but then almost everyone ( other than very few ) is a loser in the markets.

It is not the small profits which make money.

Big gains make the day.

Multibaggers like Infosys, Eicher Motors or Wipro will not give you anything if you got out after taking 20% profit.

Small profits combined with a big loss is a sure recipe to disaster.

To conclude:

Losses are not caused by investors freaking out and selling on decline.

They are caused by investors holding on to the losing stocks forever or longer than necessary.

Losses are caused by not waiting in profit.

Taking small profits looks good but ultimately some event causes a big loss and small profits are wiped out.

Losses are caused by emotion not by price declines though they have a small part in it.

And it applies to all, whether amateur traders or professionals.

Thanks Kirubakaran Rajendran for the question and I hope I have answered it to your satisfaction.

Thanks for reading.

Anonymous,5y,Have you ever invested all your money in one stock and gotten rich?,"I got stock options from my company, but I never sold the shares when the options vested. Over time, I also invested all my savings and started trading around what I though was a fair value for the company.

Prakarsh Gagdani,4y,How should one start investing in share markets from a young age?,"It is very cheering to see someone young interested in investing. I would suggest you first begin by gaining knowledge about the stock markets. You can do that by reading books (start with Intelligent Investor -Benjamin Graham), watching financial news channels daily, reading financial newspapers daily. Make a habit to listen to finance related podcasts wherever possible. There are many videos on available online that will teach you the basics of stock investing.

Once, you have got a pretty good hold on the subject, then you can register on an app or a website that will allow you to open a dummy account and hold a virtual portfolio with the help of virtual money. Transact on the dummy portfolio and check your total profit /loss each day. This could give you an idea of how you will perform in the real share market. Once you have practiced atleast 2-3 months on a dummy portfolio, you can begin investing in the stock markets. Initially, always invest only as much as you can afford to lose. Build on that amount incrementally over time. All the best.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r1ad5okly2v0s84c', 'title': 'How should one start investing in share markets from a young age?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It is very cheering to see someone young interested in investing.

Sachin Hooda,3y,How do I select the right mutual fund at an all-time high market?,"Thanks for A2A.

Very rarely we come across such a good question here.

Often people ask questions like —

Which is the best mutual fund to invest in the year 2021?

Which mutual fund will give me maximum returns this year?

Nobody wants to know how to select a good mutual fund by themselves. They just want to know the best fund and often end up putting their hard earned money in the top performing fund of last six months or a year at max.

Selecting a good mutual fund is not a rocket science. It is a pretty simple task, made to look difficult by the so called experts.

You have to check some parameters and compare the fund with its peers.

But there are few things to keep in mind before choosing a mutual fund

• Investment objective

• Time horizon

• Risk appetite

It is advised to keep the total number of funds between 3 to 5 for a balanced portfolio and for the ease of tracking.

We are taking Axis Blue Chip fund for the illustration.

As the name suggests it is a Large Cap fund.

Now first of all we will check it's past performance in comparison to its category and Benchmark ( Index).

Value of Rs 10000 invested 10 years ago.

The graph shows the returns over the past 10 years. We have to check the returns over the long time. 1–2 years returns do not tell the whole story.

Here the fund outperforms both the large cap category average and Benchmark Index.

Now we will check the risk factor.

Out of the 89 large cap funds Axis Blue Chip fund is among the least risk taking funds while giving the high returns.

Now let's check the Trailing Returns of the fund. Trailing returns are called point to point returns of a mutual fund.

Trailing returns are considered most relevant measures of the performance of a mutual fund.

Baring the last one year the fund has given good trailing returns which shows its strength.

Somemore ratios to check. Don't get nervous seeing so many of them. These are pretty simple terms, just check their definition on Google.

Alpha— Risk adjusted returns, more the better.

Beta- Volatility of fund, lesser is better.

R2- performance correlated to index, more than 85 is considered good.

Sharpe Ratio — Risk adjusted returns, higher is better.

Standard deviation- Shows volatility of a funds returns. Lesser is better.

Upside Capture Ratio- How the fund performed during uptrend markets.

Downside Capture Ratio- How the fund performed during down trend markets.

All screen shots- Morningstar India

The upside capture ratio is slightly less than the category, mainly because of not so good performance by the fund in the last one year.

But it has an excellent down side ratio which is more significant. It means the fund has performed very well in comparison to the category and Index during the bad times( market crashes).

If you are still reading this answer then I must tell you that the above mentioned process of selecting a good mutual fund might look cumbersome, but it is not.

If you understand all the ratios mentioned then it hardly takes a few minutes to select a mutual fund from any category.

If you are investing for long term via SIP then market level doesn't really matter. Even if you are doing lump sum, the procedure for selecting a mutual fund remains same.

The word of advice is- Ignore the Star Ratings, most of the times star ratings are biased.

I hope this answer is helpful.

Best of luck.

Kelly Pearson,3y,What are the best stocks to invest in given Coronavirus?,"Apple shares have been in pullback mode ever since the iPhone maker slashed its fiscal second-quarter revenue forecast on account of the coronavirus outbreak. The company pointed out that the shutdown of many of its own stores (as well as partner stores) in China, will hurt iPhone sales. At the same time, Apple's China-based supply chain has been ramping up at a slower-than-expected pace, which is expected to hamper production.

After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend CryptoExchangeFX Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) as it is relatively on for a while now (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now (total volume over 120 million dollars) where you get 20% profit of your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days. It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.

Investors were spooked by this guidance and sold Apple stock. But in the process, Apple stock is now cheaper than it was earlier this year.

Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
 of less than 23 is now lower than the 2019 average of nearly 25. Of course, Apple will face short-term headwinds because of the COVID-19 outbreak, but investors shouldn't ignore the positives.

For instance, Apple's manufacturing operations lie outside the Hubei province (from where the virus originated in Wuhan). Its supply chain is already back in action, as Apple pointed out that ""all of these facilities have reopened."" The company's primary contractor, Foxconn, recently updated that the production of Apple products in China should return to normal by the end of March.

Foxconn's factories are reportedly running at 50% capacity now, indicating that the coronavirus outbreak is going to have a significant impact on Apple's performance this quarter. But once production hits normal levels, Apple's prospects should start looking up, as it is sitting on a tremendous opportunity in the form of 5G smartphones.

The company is anticipated to launch a range of 5G iPhones this year at different price points. Additionally, Wedbush Securities reports that more than a third of Apple's 900 million iPhone installed base is ready for an upgrade this year. As a result, demand for Apple's iPhones should return to normal in due course.

But investors need to be prepared for short-term pain as China supplies 17% of its total revenue. That could dent Apple's financial performance and share price if the fallout of the novel coronavirus continues for a prolonged time. However, further stock price weakness could make Apple stock cheaper, giving long-term investors looking to take advantage of the 5G revolution better opportunities to buy the stock.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jvfq86whznckpd12', 'title': 'What are the best stocks to invest in given Coronavirus?', 'score': {'original': 0.9901, 'ai': 0.0099}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Apple shares have been in pullback mode ever since the iPhone maker slashed its fiscal second-quarter revenue forecast on account of the coronavirus outbreak.

Sahil Bhadviya,3y,What are the 10 principles of Warren Buffett for investment?,"Coronavirus has badly impacted the world economy. Stock market has fallen badly.
Most of the investors who have started investment in the past 3 years are currently in the loss. It is difficult to see the portfolio in red.
During such a difficult time, we tend to lose our calm and take emotional decisions. This could result in huge losses.
But we need to understand one thing- This is not the 1st time when the market has fallen badly. In fact, the year 2008 witnessed a fall of more than 50%.

So what can we learn from the past?

At this point in time, it is important to revisit the fundamentals. Learn from the experience of a wiser man who has spent more than 60 years in the world of investment.
Let’s revisit the principals of Warren Buffett and decode them to guide us in handling this difficult time.

Principle #1: “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.”

Meaning: In general, people tend to follow the herd. When markets are rising, everyone would jump in and start investing. The reason is greed. Everyone wants to earn quick money. This results in the overvaluation of the market. And when the market starts falling, people become fearful and end up withdrawing their investment. As a result, people end up in loss. Warren Buffett suggests that one should do the opposite. This is the time when everyone is fearful. The market has become undervalued. This is time to be greedy and invest. (But do not invest all the money in one go) Of course, this advice is for those who want to invest in the long term.

Principle #2: “Do not put all your eggs in one basket.”

Meaning: Never invest all your money in a single stock. Always diversify your investment. For those who do not have the knowledge to pick stocks, it is advisable to invest via mutual funds as they work on the principle of diversification.

Principle #3: “If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.”

Meaning: Do not spend crazy. No matter how much you earn, if you can’t save then you can’t create wealth. Hence, spend within limits. Optimize your expenses and invest them to create wealth.

Principle #4: “Honesty is an expensive gift. Do not expect it from cheap people.”

Meaning: Do not fall for Ponzi schemes. Do not invest anywhere without knowledge. A lot of people are willing to take advantage of your vulnerability. While investing in stocks, always check the management history. The recent cases of Vijay Mallya, Anil Ambani, Nirav Modi, etc. suggest that one should never invest in companies with dishonest management.

Principle #5: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price”

Meaning: Wonderful companies compound your wealth year-after-year. Poor quality businesses that are exceptionally cheap only grow your wealth once (when you sell them – hopefully for a profit). Note that Buffett does not say to buy great businesses at any price. “For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.”

Principle #6: “Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.”

Meaning: You can’t expect to get returns in a few weeks or months. It takes time to get a return on investment. You need to have patience. Those who can’t keep patience would lose money. Those who will keep patience would make money.

Principle #7: “The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble...We want to buy them when they're on the operating table.”

Meaning: Look out for great companies that are falling due to the current economic situation. Today, many quality stocks are available at a discounted price. This is a great opportunity to invest. Such events are rare. Ensure that you make the best use of this opportunity.

Principle #8: “The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.”

Meaning: Economic moat or competitive advantage is one of the most important parameters while investing in a stock. Always check- What is great about the company? Can it sustain the greatness for a long time? A company without a competitive advantage can’t sustain for long. A company with a competitive advantage will generate wealth for a long time.

Principle # 9: “You don’t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ.”

Meaning: Success in investing doesn't correlate with IQ. You don’t need to be a genius to create wealth in the stock market. If investing was all about knowledge, every finance and economic professor would be a millionaire. What you need is the temperament to control the emotions that get people into trouble in investing.

Principle #10: ""The most important investment you can make is in yourself.""

Meaning: Do not blindly trust anyone for stock tips or mutual fund tips. The best investment you can do is by educating yourself. First, understand how things work. How investment work. How the stock market work. If you invest in tips, you might earn profit in the short term but won’t be able to sustain it. Once you invest in knowledge, you will reap the benefits forever.

Those who are still concerned over the current economic situation, there is a message from Warren Buffett:

“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a fly epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”

Of course, this message was long ago.

Likewise, we have seen some terrible mishappenings in India in the last 40 years. Be it Harshad Mehta scam in 1992, Dotcom bubble in 2000, recession in 2008, attack on Parliament and Mumbai, various corruptions, Kargil War, Swine flu, etc. Yet, Sensex rose from the level of 100 to 42,000 before it recently fell to the level of 30,000 due to Coronavirus.

…Now you need to decide if it is the time to invest or withdraw.

Stock market has fallen badly.\nMost of the investors who have started investment in the past 3 years are currently in the loss. It is difficult to see the portfolio in red.\nDuring such a difficult time, we tend to lose our calm and take emotional decisions. This could result in huge losses.\nBut we need to understand one thing- This is not the 1st time when the market has fallen badly. In fact, the year 2008 witnessed a fall of more than 50%.\n\nSo what can we learn from the past?\n\nAt this point in time, it is important to revisit the fundamentals. Learn from the experience of a wiser man who has spent more than 60 years in the world of investment.\nLet’s revisit the principals of Warren Buffett and decode them to guide us in handling this difficult time.\n\nPrinciple #1: “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.”\n\nMeaning: In general, people tend to follow the herd. When markets are rising, everyone would jump in and start investing. The reason is greed. Everyone wants to earn quick money. This results in the overvaluation of the market. And when the market starts falling, people become fearful and end up withdrawing their investment. As a result, people end up in loss. Warren Buffett suggests that one should do the opposite. This is the time when everyone is fearful. The market has become undervalued. This is time to be greedy and invest. (But do not invest all the money in one go) Of course, this advice is for those who want to invest in the long term.\n\nPrinciple #2: “Do not put all your eggs in one basket.”\n\nMeaning: Never invest all your money in a single stock. Always diversify your investment. For those who do not have the knowledge to pick stocks, it is advisable to invest via mutual funds as they work on the principle of diversification.\n\nPrinciple #3: “If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.”\n\nMeaning: Do not spend crazy. No matter how much you earn, if you can’t save then you can’t create wealth. Hence, spend within limits. Optimize your expenses and invest them to create wealth.\n\nPrinciple #4: “Honesty is an expensive gift. Do not expect it from cheap people.”\n\nMeaning: Do not fall for Ponzi schemes. Do not invest anywhere without knowledge. A lot of people are willing to take advantage of your vulnerability. While investing in stocks, always check the management history. The recent cases of Vijay Mallya, Anil Ambani, Nirav Modi, etc. suggest that one should never invest in companies with dishonest management.\n\nPrinciple #5: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price”\n\nMeaning: Wonderful companies compound your wealth year-after-year. Poor quality businesses that are exceptionally cheap only grow your wealth once (when you sell them – hopefully for a profit). Note that Buffett does not say to buy great businesses at any price. “For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of', 'result': {'fake': 0.3631, 'real': 0.6369}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.”\n\nPrinciple #6: “Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.”\n\nMeaning: You can’t expect to get returns in a few weeks or months. It takes time to get a return on investment. You need to have patience. Those who can’t keep patience would lose money. Those who will keep patience would make money.\n\nPrinciple #7: “The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble...We want to buy them when they\'re on the operating table.”\n\nMeaning: Look out for great companies that are falling due to the current economic situation. Today, many quality stocks are available at a discounted price. This is a great opportunity to invest. Such events are rare. Ensure that you make the best use of this opportunity.\n\nPrinciple #8: “The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.”\n\nMeaning: Economic moat or competitive advantage is one of the most important parameters while investing in a stock. Always check- What is great about the company? Can it sustain the greatness for a long time? A company without a competitive advantage can’t sustain for long. A company with a competitive advantage will generate wealth for a long time.\n\nPrinciple # 9: “You don’t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ.”\n\nMeaning: Success in investing doesn\'t correlate with IQ. You don’t need to be a genius to create wealth in the stock market. If investing was all about knowledge, every finance and economic professor would be a millionaire. What you need is the temperament to control the emotions that get people into trouble in investing.\n\nPrinciple #10: ""The most important investment you can make is in yourself.""\n\nMeaning: Do not blindly trust anyone for stock tips or mutual fund tips. The best investment you can do is by educating yourself. First, understand how things work. How investment work. How the stock market work. If you invest in tips, you might earn profit in the short term but won’t be able to sustain it. Once you invest in knowledge, you will reap the benefits forever.\n\nThose who are still concerned over the current economic situation, there is a message from Warren Buffett:\n\n“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good.

Fernando Reyes,4y,"How can I make 50% of my investment of $2,000?","It has been more than an year since I started investing in cryptocurrencies. Following Warren Buffet’s advice of “Never Invest In Something You Don’t Understand”, I started reading more and more about cryptocurrencies to go get a sense of things before jumping into the world of cryptocurrencies.

Even today I am far from understanding cryptocurrencies completely, as it is a vast field. But I have learned enough to find my feet. When I started my learning stint, though there were lots of blogs and videos online, they were either very superficial or too deep. They were either too specific or too general. The learning path was not clear. After having spent almost an year in learnings I am writing this post so that newcomers like me will find it helpful and know enough to start exploring on their own. I have made it as a series of questions and answers. They are structured in the learning path I took. Most of the new users also might end up taking the same learning path and hence I felt that this order made sense.

A lot of people do not know there are so many ways to earn cryptocurrencies by investing legitimately in platforms like www.coastminers.tech where they can get double of their investment in 7 days without losing them(thank me later).

Before getting started with article, get a coffee or beer to keep your company. This is going to be a long article. I have addressed all the questions I faced. If there are a few things that you are familiar with, you can skip those questions and move to the next. You can also use this Table to Contents to skip to questions of your interest.

It took me more than two complete days to finish this article. So if you find anything useful, clap right away. Don’t wait to reach till the bottom of this article as this is going to be a very long one. If you reach the end of the article then you can clap 50 times because that is the max ;)

Let us get started now. See you at the bottom of this post.

What is cryptocurrency?

A digital currency in which code based on cryptography controls the generation of units of currency and verification of transactions for transfer of funds. A cryptocurrency is not backed by a government or a central bank of any country/countries. The account keeping is done in a distributed manner. Think of it as a distributed ledger one in which you can’t alter the order of transactions.

In short you can call it people’s money. Money created by the masses, for the masses and controlled by the masses.

Such money has various advantages compared to FIAT currency. That is the whole reason many banks and governments are opposing the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies takes the power out of centralised power centers, whether they are governments or central banks.

What is FIAT currency?

Currencies that are backed by a government are called FIAT currencies. So most of the currencies we are accustomed to like USD(United States Dollar), GBP(Great Britain Pound or Sterling Pound), AUD(Australian Dollar), CNY(Chinese Yen), JPY(Japanese Yen), INR(Indian Rupee) etc are all examples of FIAT currency. I had never heard of the term FIAT before learning about cryptocurrencies.

FIAT currencies have many disadvantages. They are centralised. These centralised agencies can make the existing money invalid just by a stroke of pen. Recently India carried out a massive demonetisation drive. They can print currency at will, leading to inflation. Inflation is stealing from the poor and gullible without their knowledge. You need agencies like Visa and Master-card to perform exchanges in business outlets. To store your own money you need to pay fees to banks while they make money in interests by lending out your money. If you want to transfer money across borders you need permissions from governments and pay huge fees to companies like Western Union. You pay your fees in percentages whereas it should have been only fee per transaction. The amount shouldn’t really matter.

FIAT lacks the characteristics of sound money. Cryptocurrencies fill most of these gaps. In addition to all these advantages it it also distributed which is a great advantage in itself, as we don’t need to trust any third party. All thanks to blockchains we are able to use this form of money called cryptocurrencies.

What is a blockchain?

Blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies. To be fair cryptocurrencies are one of the use-cases of blockchain. Blockchain is an irreversible(chain of order), incorruptible and distributed ledger of transactions. Incorruptible ledgers forms the basis of many valuable transactions. They might be in the field finance, record keeping in governments, international diplomacy or any record keeping of importance for that matter.

What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the first peer to peer electronic cash. Bitcoin solved a major problem in electronic cash called “double spending”. While there are many resources you can read about bitcoin, you should definitely start by reading the bitcoin whitepaper. Bitcoin is the torch bearer for cryptocurrencies. Most of the other cryptocurrencies owe it to bitcoin which proved that it was possible to build a secure, decentralised mechanism for storing and transferring value using internet.

For now just know that double spending is the risk that a digital currency can be spent twice. If the same money can be spent twice the currency will loose its value as it is not secure. Bitcoin addressed this problem and hence opened the flood gates of a completely new world order.

Who invented Bitcoin or who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

Satoshi Nakamoto is the inventor of Bitcoin. But who is Satoshi Nakamoto? This has been a long standing mystery and a very important one as well.

There are many people who believe that Satoshi Nakamoto should get a Nobel prize in Economics and Turing Award(can be considered as Nobel prize in the field of computers) for the same invention that is Bitcoin. This should highlight the potential of blockchains and cryptocurrencies for you.

What is an altcoin?

All cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are called Altcoins. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency. There are many other cryptocurrencies like clones of Bitcoin(claiming better features), Smart contract systems based cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies targeting specific fields and various other silly ones as well. All these cryptocurrencies are called altcoins(Alternate coins).

What is shit-coin?

A derogatory term used for a cryptocurrency that is deemed to be useless by an individual or a certain group of individuals. While many people reserve this term for useless projects/cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Maximalists consider all altcoins as shitcoins.

What is Bitcoin Maximalism?

Bitcoin fan-boys believe that Bitcoin is the one true coin and all other coins are useless. Bitcoin maximalists claim that there are no real world use-cases for other currencies. They believe that all the money, time and resources should be spent on improving Bitcoin as second layer solutions on Bitcoin network can be used for any kind of application. Hence rendering all other altcoins useless.

What are different altcoins available?

Currently there are more than 1900 altcoins available. Most of these coins are scams and rip offs. But you can find a lot of interesting projects in the top 300 altcoins. These gems have the potential to alter the path of humanity. At their current stage you can compare them to internet giants of pre 2000 era. Their real potential is yet to be realised. We might know of their consequences and their value only a couple of decades ahead.

Where can I check the list of all cryptocurrencies?

Is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin?

I am long on Bitcoin. In the long term I think Bitcoin has a lot of scope for growth. I think the Bitcoin bandwagon is just getting started and I will use every dip to buy a few more Satoshis.

Many people whom I respect are bullish on the prospects of Bitcoin. You can checkout bullish predictions by many popular crypto personalities on this blog post. Please note that many of these predictions are long term and doesn’t have anything to do with the short time dips or shoot ups.

Is this a good time to invest in Altcoins?

While I am bullish on Bitcoin I would suggest caution while investing in altcoins. Most of the altcoins have lost more than 80% from their all time highs around December last year. Many people feel that altcoins might loose further. So invest with caution and only in best projects that you trust for the long term. Don’t forget to set stop losses though. Know when to exit.

What is an exchange?

An exchange is a website where you can trade one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency. These are also generally called crypto-crypto exchanges to highlight that they don’t support on-ramping which is the ability to buy cryptocurrency directly using FIAT.

Can I buy cryptocurrencies with FIAT?

Earlier you could only buy Bitcoin with FIAT and then you had to move your bitcoins to a crypto-crypto exchange to buy other altcoins. But today there are many websites where you can buy many popular cryptocurrencies with FIAT directly.

What are popular exchanges to buy cryptocurrencies with FIAT in US?

If you are from US you can checkout Coinbase and Robinhood. Bittrex is also planning to start FIAT support in a phased manner. Listing of altcoins on coinbase is considered a big deal and there are instances of cryptocurrencies rising steeply in price just for the rumours that it is getting listed on Coinbase.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o0278bw4kaxmdeqi', 'title': 'How can I make 50% of my investment of $2,000?', 'score': {'original': 0.9515, 'ai': 0.0485}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It has been more than an year since I started investing in cryptocurrencies.

Following Warren Buffet’s advice of “Never Invest In Something You Don’t Understand”, I started reading more and more about cryptocurrencies to go get a sense of things before jumping into the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEven today I am far from understanding cryptocurrencies completely, as it is a vast field. But I have learned enough to find my feet. When I started my learning stint, though there were lots of blogs and videos online, they were either very superficial or too deep. They were either too specific or too general. The learning path was not clear. After having spent almost an year in learnings I am writing this post so that newcomers like me will find it helpful and know enough to start exploring on their own. I have made it as a series of questions and answers. They are structured in the learning path I took. Most of the new users also might end up taking the same learning path and hence I felt that this order made sense.\n\nA lot of people do not know there are so many ways to earn cryptocurrencies by investing legitimately in platforms like www.coastminers.tech where they can get double of their investment in 7 days without losing them(thank me later).\n\nBefore getting started with article, get a coffee or beer to keep your company. This is going to be a long article. I have addressed all the questions I faced. If there are a few things that you are familiar with, you can skip those questions and move to the next. You can also use this Table to Contents to skip to questions of your interest.\n\nIt took me more than two complete days to finish this article. So if you find anything useful, clap right away. Don’t wait to reach till the bottom of this article as this is going to be a very long one. If you reach the end of the article then you can clap 50 times because that is the max ;)\n\nLet us get started now. See you at the bottom of this post.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nA digital currency in which code based on cryptography controls the generation of units of currency and verification of transactions for transfer of funds. A cryptocurrency is not backed by a government or a central bank of any country/countries. The account keeping is done in a distributed manner. Think of it as a distributed ledger one in which you can’t alter the order of transactions.\n\nIn short you can call it people’s money. Money created by the masses, for the masses and controlled by the masses.\n\nSuch money has various advantages compared to FIAT currency. That is the whole reason many banks and governments are opposing the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies takes the power out of centralised power centers, whether they are governments or central banks.\n\nWhat is FIAT currency?\n\nCurrencies that are backed by a government are called FIAT currencies. So most of the currencies we are accustomed to like USD(United States Dollar), GBP(Great Britain Pound or Sterling Pound), AUD(Australian Dollar), CNY(Chinese Yen), JPY(Japanese Yen), INR(Indian Rupee) etc are all examples of FIAT currency. I had never heard of the term FIAT before learning about cryptocurrencies.\n\nFIAT currencies have many disadvantages. They are centralised. These centralised agencies can make the existing money invalid just by a stroke of pen. Recently India carried out a massive demonetisation drive. They can print currency at will, leading to inflation. Inflation is stealing from the poor and gullible without their knowledge. You need agencies like Visa and Master-card to perform exchanges in business outlets. To store your own money you need to pay fees to banks while they make money in interests by lending out your money. If you want to transfer money across borders you need permissions from governments and pay huge fees to companies like Western Union. You pay your fees in percentages whereas it should have been only fee per transaction. The amount shouldn’t really matter.\n\nFIAT lacks the characteristics of sound money. Cryptocurrencies fill most of these gaps. In addition to all these advantages it it also distributed which is a great advantage in itself, as we don’t need to trust any third party. All thanks to blockchains we are able to use this form of money called cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat is a blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies. To be fair cryptocurrencies are one of the use-cases of blockchain. Blockchain is an irreversible(chain of order), incorruptible and distributed ledger of transactions. Incorruptible ledgers forms the basis of many valuable transactions. They might be in the field finance, record keeping in governments, international diplomacy or any record keeping of importance for that matter.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the first peer to peer electronic cash. Bitcoin solved a major problem in electronic cash called “double spending”. While there are many resources you can read about bitcoin, you should definitely start by reading the bitcoin whitepaper. Bitcoin is the torch bearer for cryptocurrencies. Most of the other cryptocurrencies owe it to bitcoin which proved that it was possible to build a secure, decentralised mechanism for storing and transferring value using internet.\n\nFor now just know that double spending is the risk that a digital currency can be spent twice. If the same money can be spent twice the currency will loose its value as it is not secure. Bitcoin addressed this problem and hence opened the flood gates of a completely new world order.\n\nWho invented Bitcoin or who is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the inventor of Bitcoin. But who is Satoshi Nakamoto? This has been a long standing mystery and a very important one as well.\n\nThere are many people who believe that Satoshi Nakamoto should get a Nobel prize in Economics and Turing Award(can be considered as Nobel prize in the field of computers) for the same invention that is Bitcoin. This should highlight the potential of blockchains and cryptocurrencies for you.\n\nWhat is an altcoin?\n\nAll cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are called Altcoins. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency. There are many other cryptocurrencies like clones of Bitcoin(claiming better features), Smart contract systems based cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies targeting specific fields and various other silly ones as well. All these cryptocurrencies are called altcoins(Alternate coins).\n\nWhat is shit-coin?\n\nA derogatory term used for a cryptocurrency that is deemed to be useless by an individual or a certain group of individuals. While many people reserve this term for useless projects/cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Maximalists consider all altcoins as shitcoins.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Maximalism?\n\nBitcoin fan-boys believe that Bitcoin is the one true coin and all other coins are useless. Bitcoin maximalists claim that there are no real world use-cases for other currencies. They believe that all the money, time and resources should be spent on improving Bitcoin as second layer solutions on Bitcoin network can be used for any kind of application. Hence rendering all other altcoins useless.\n\nWhat are different altcoins available?\n\nCurrently there are more than 1900 altcoins available. Most of these coins are scams and rip offs. But you can find a lot of interesting projects in the top 300 altcoins. These gems have the potential to alter the path of humanity. At their current stage you can compare them to internet giants of pre 2000 era. Their real potential is yet to be realised. We might know of their consequences and their value only a couple of decades ahead.\n\nWhere can I check the list of all cryptocurrencies?\n\nIs this a good time to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nI am long on Bitcoin. In the long term I think Bitcoin has a lot of scope for growth. I think the Bitcoin bandwagon is just getting started and I will use every dip to buy a few more Satoshis.\n\nMany people whom I respect are bullish on the prospects of Bitcoin. You can checkout bullish predictions by many popular crypto personalities on this blog post. Please note that many of these predictions are long term and doesn’t have anything to do with the short time dips or shoot ups.\n\nIs this a good time to invest in Altcoins?\n\nWhile I am bullish on Bitcoin I would suggest caution while investing in altcoins.

Vinod Mahendroo,4y,Why has WeWork had such issues with its IPO?,"Like many Unicorns (Lyft, Uber, Peloton, Doordash, Postmates), there is no clear business model to generate the kind of outsize returns promised.

There is a direct competitor which is profitable, but alas, it has a valuation of $ 4.76 B today, which just won’t do for a company like WeWork which has raised $12.8B to date, and was valued at $47B before its debacle, starting with its S-1.

WeWork has tried to present itself as a technology company, but it is a real-estate arbitrage play, buying long term commercial leases and selling short term leases to its “members” who rent “workstations”.

It is poorly run - and mostly for the benefit of one person, CEO Adam Neumann and his family/friends.

Governance is abysmal. It is insulting for investors to see the company return an egregious payment of $5.39M to the CEO (for rights to “We”), change its S-1 to show the CEO reduce his special share voting rights from 120 x to 10 x (he still maintains total control), appoint a lady who was previously a consultant on their board and say that the Board, not Mrs. Neumann will choose Mr. Neumann’s successor, and present this as an improvement in governance.

Finally, as a company that lost $2 for every $1 it got in 1H 2019 Revenue, WeWork desperately needs cash. A minimum IPO raise of $3.5B was necessary to also kick-in a $6B loan facility (for a total of $9.5B). Without it, the company will be under duress.

To complicate things, Softbank is trying to raise its Vision Fund II. Softbank has marked up the value of its investments greatly in the recent past, and with Slack, Uber and WeWork so deeply under water, it must write down the value of its Vision Fund I investments at a most inopportune time.

The Saudi PIF and Mubadala had balked at the January funding of WeWork at $47B, and are unlikely to blindly follow Mr. Son in the future into Vision Fund II.

As a result, we saw the public spectacle of Softbank trying to get WeWork to delay the IPO, and WeWork trying to get Softbank to commit to buying 20–25% of the IPO float to try to prop up the price.

I’ve answered questions on WeWork’s likely future here How do you think the WeWork IPO will play out?, and their recent governance changes here Vinod Mahendroo's answer to What do you think of WeWork’s planned significant changes to its governance in advance of its NASDAQ listing?

I haven’t seen such an egregious display of naked ambition, BS/chutzpah and greed, since … well, since Juul insisted that mango bubble gum is an adult vaping flavor.

Thank you for the a2a.

And parents, please don’t let your children grow up to be like Mr. Neumann. The startup world needs common decency and business ethics more than ever today.

Luka Henigman,Updated 3y,What marketing tricks do people fall for every day?,"In 2018, Burberry set on fire £28.6million
 worth of their unsold products.

WTH? You may ask yourself

If I had £28,000,000 I wouldn’t throw it away and I’m sure you wouldn’t either. Think about the investments you could make, the 98 Lamborghini Aventador SVJs
 you could buy, or the impact you could have on charities & NGOs around the world.

But that’s exactly what Burberry did. They burnt £28,600,000 worth of unsold products to make sure that NONE of it would get discounted or into the hands of ordinary people.

And the reason behind their secret is simple:

ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY

There are only two things you can do to increase the perceived $value of a product.

Increase Demand (natural) ⬆️
Decrease Supply (artificial) ⬇️

An increase of demand is what will happen naturally when you create great products at fair prices.

Supply can be manipulated by decision and often will be as is the case with Burberry, De Beers, Supreme, and Ferrari just to name a few. In fact the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is another perfect example, they’re only making 900 of them -globally.

When demand is higher than supply the perceived value of the underlying product increases. No matter how you go about doing it.

By burning their unsold merchandise Burberry maintained the over-inflated value of the products they sold, and at the same time increased the perceived $value for any of their future product launches.

Through artificial scarcity, we are manipulated to believe that X is more valuable and scarce than what it actually is. Be it limited edition cars, designer clothing, or diamonds.

Their secret is the same.

Mark Daviis,Updated 2y,What are different investment strategies?,"An investment strategy is a defined approach to investing that shapes the choices an investor makes for his or her portfolio. Different investment strategies assume specific tactics based on fundamental beliefs. For instance, value investing seeks stocks that are undervalued and are selling for less than their true worth, whereas growth investing aims to find investment opportunities in companies that have high potential for growth. Those are just a few of the many investment strategies out there to choose from. This guide will break down the major investment strategies and help you decide which of them is likely to be a good choice for you.

How to Choose an Investment Strategy

There are a number of factors that go into choosing the investment strategy that will work best for you. One thing is to think about whether you want to choose an active or passive investing strategy. Active investing involves the frequent buying and selling of stocks. It requires hands-on management, often by a portfolio manager who can delve into various factors to forecast the market.

Passive strategies, on the other hand, are focused on buying and holding investments for the long haul. Proponents of passive strategies argue this cuts down on trading costs and increases tax efficiency. It also tends to be less risky than market-timing strategies, which can reap big rewards by trying to beat the market but also suffer big losses. Oftentimes, portfolios will blend active and passive investing.

All the resources you need to seamlessly flow through the experience of Mining with profit,Trading and Crypto Investment 24/7,also has a free bitcoin miming software and free Trading Bot software.A reliable technology platform and very easiest,most convenient platform for both beginners and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.They are a non-custodial platform, meaning that your crypto is secured.(www.cryptosbinary,com) made a breakdown of some of the most promising cryptocurrency tokens/coins that are most likely to birth highly attractive profits on ROI percentage profit after 10 days for both traders and investors.

Other factors you need to consider are your time horizon, such as how close you are to major life events like buying a house, having children or retiring. If you need income soon, you may not want to select long-term investments, for instance. Your risk tolerance is another consideration. Generally, you can tolerate more risk early in your career, and desire less risky, more stable investments as you move towards retirement. A strategy like income investing, which is based on generating a steady income, might be less risky than more subjective strategy like value investing.

Growth Investing

Growth investing is an investment strategy that focuses on building capital through buying equities that have the potential to increase in value. This is most commonly found in stocks where investors believe the value of the company, and thus the value of the shares they’ve purchased, is likely to go up.

Growth investing contains several sub-strategies. Two of the most common are short-term investments and long-term investments. Short-term generally means buying stocks and holding them for less than a year. Investors use short-term growth investments when they think a company’s value is likely to shoot up quickly. Long-term investments, on the other hand, are held for more than a year. Investors use these when they believe the company’s value will grow slowly and steadily over the years.

Growth investing can touch on numerous sectors, such as:

Emerging markets

Tech

Energy

Aerospace

Value Investing

Value investing, an investment strategy championed by Warren Buffett, focuses on seeking out stocks that you believe are intrinsically undervalued. By finding companies the market does not properly value, investors have the potential to post big gains when the market eventually corrects and the company becomes valued properly. This is a very subjective type of investing.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tawskghc9jzolf2m', 'title': 'What are different investment strategies?', 'score': {'original': 0.6113, 'ai': 0.3887}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'An investment strategy is a defined approach to investing that shapes the choices an investor makes for his or her portfolio.

Pramod Kumar,4y,What are the biggest lies told in stock market?,"Lies and Half Truths :

Stock markets are about great stories of fortunes being made. It is all about multi baggers and big gains.

With all these stories, the fact that about 90% of people lose money in the market remains unchanged.

There is not a single story teller who cares about these 90% people. There is not a single market expert who gives adequate and proper warning to these poor souls that the money can be lost.

They are so busy singing the songs of joy that they forget the sorrowful stories which are recent and the pain is still hurting.

Well, the market pundits may not be telling lies but surely they are not telling the truth either.

Let us look for the truth:

First the truth as is known to all.

We see that NIFTY is close to all time high and has gained over 14% in the last 365 days. This is the story everyone is gaga about.

People do not invest in NIFTY/SENSEX. They invest in various stocks.

Here the story becomes slightly different.

Out of 50 stocks in NIFTY Index, 25 are losers over the same period.

And these are the large cap losers which are part of NIFTY and were considered/ are considered as blue chip stocks.

The chips have fallen and the blues remain with the investors.

They do not take any consolation from the 14.25% gain in the index.

Looking at slightly broader market ( All Futures and Options Stocks ), the losers are 120 out of 197.

When 60% of stocks are losing, market gains do not mean much for the investors.

A look at some of the top losers in this category:

The stocks losing more than 50% in one year ( the year in which NIFTY gained 14.25%) are highlighted.

No one talks about this bitter truth that there are stocks which are bleeding away the investors’ wealth even while the trend is healthy and upwards.

To Summarize :

It is fashionable to tell good stories only. Stories of big gains look great.

The sad stories told by me are pessimistic and the market commentators like to sweep them aside. For them the euphoria of the big gains is everything. It feeds their chatter on TV business channels.

I do not care for the artificial exuberance as I know the people on ground who have lost money by the bucket loads even in this so called boom time.

The numbers do not lie.

With 60% or more stocks losing ( if we count small caps too, the number is surely above 60% ) , we can not call it a bull run.

That is one of the biggest lies of the stock market.

I know readers will have different views on this and they are welcome to their views.

If different views were not there, market would not exist.

Thanks for reading.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/w3i7b15nxhrukflg', 'title': 'What are the biggest lies told in stock market?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Lies and Half Truths :\n\nStock markets are about great stories of fortunes being made.

Stock Price,4y,"I want to invest 8k in stocks every month for long term, What are good companies from which I can buy shares every month?","It is always a bad idea to go for the companies that are evidently performing well in the stock market as it is a known fact that the ones that are making news are always the ones that an investor should avoid since there are more chances of it to collapse in the long-run. The safest stocks to invest are most commonly the companies dealing with consumer goods and utilities since these are the things that will always stay in business. However, that is not the case anymore, if you see in the long-run, telecommunication is one industry
 that is more likely to see large scale profitability in the long term.

The reliance on telecommunication and its demand from a consumer’s perspective is never going to go down. Therefore, it is profitable to look for the best telecommunication companies and invest in their stocks at the earliest. T-Mobile
 is one telecommunication
 company that is experiencing break-through performance in terms of subscription rates, in the first quarter of 2019 it had managed to attract more than 1million new customers to its business. Its customer services go beyond to mobile use as it has enabled its users to connect with great ease situated in any corner of the world. The company is currently experiencing the best era in terms of profitability, just recently it was reported to have had a 35% increase in its profits.

Barun Mohanty,3y,Why is the market not crashing when the Nifty PE is crossed 30? Is this a myth?,"You own a samosa center at your university. Your samosas are very tasty and the demand is too high. Your samosa business is growing bigger day by day.

Your samosa center is listed in the stock market. People are very optimistic about your samosa business. So, your share is trading at 100 rupees. But your earnings per share is 10 rupees.

So, the PE is 100/10 =10

Now, a pandemic happened.

People started thinking you would go out of the business as you can’t sustain it as you have operating costs to pay.

Now, your share price fell down. Your samosa company is trading at 5 rupees now.

Why? Because some people like teachers, admin staffs hold your shares and optimistic about your business as they have come to university regularly.

But your earnings per share become 1 as there are no students to consume your samosa. Now, samosa is consumed by the teachers and staff only.

Now, your PE is = 5/1 = 5

Now, the pandemic is almost over.

The university is going to reopen. Students feel optimistic about your company and started buying shares.

Now, your share is trading at 150 rupees. Why? Some people think students have not eaten your tasty samosas for a long time. So, when they come, they will consume 1.5 times more. Let’s say the student who was eating 2 samosas, will eat 3 samosas as he is craving for it for a long time.

But wait!

University is going to reopen. But it has not reopened yet. So, your earnings per share are still 1 rupee.

But your share price is 150 rupees.

So, the PE is = 150/1 = 150 (Highest PE ever recorded)

As you are going to do business as before, your earnings will go higher than 1 rupee and your PE (Share price/ Earning per share) will come down. Nobody knows what will happen to the price. It might get correct a bit but there is less chance it will fall down causing a market crash.

Penny Stocks,4y,What are some secrets about stock trading that you are willing to share?,"Investing in stocks has no successful scientific formula to ensure 100% profitability for any single investor or company. The secret lies in identifying the profitable companies
 that can offer profits in the future based upon their past performance in the stock market and also by evaluating the right price that can provide the right opportunity to grow for the individual stocks in the market.

Following are some secrets that can be profitable for an investor:

i. The quality of the company is vital to determining the future stock growth in the market. It is not necessary that the company is a big or a small enterprise, what is important is how has the company progressed and achieved its place in the industry. Company’s performance can be assessed through an in-depth scrutiny of past financial records that may be reflected through its ratios like, P/E Ratio, Return on Equity, Current Ratio etc.

ii. It is important to look for stocks that are strong enough to stay on hand for more than 10 years, if they do not show effective returns for a span of 10 years or more, these stocks are not the ones to be invested upon. Stock markets are meant for ensuring long term returns and do not look at the short term. The stocks that tend to reflect profitability in the long-term are the ones that an investor is looking for. Short term profits do not reflect upon a potentially profitable stock altogether. One should never rely upon the hype and propaganda regarding a single company just on the basis of current market happenings but one should focus upon his own individual homework first and then decide whether or not they should be investing in stocks.

iii. Another significant factor that most investors tend to overlook is how effectively a company is able to manage its existing resources. The resources of he company include financial resources, human resources, physical resources etc. that may be a major element in determining the overall performance of a company. If a company is able to effectively manage its resources at hand, it will be able to maintain that over a span of period in the future to give constant returns to its investors as well.

iv. One last and most essential secret that many investors tend to ignore in a stock market are the “Hot Stocks”. Hot stocks are the ones that every investor is talking about and is in the news for its trading volume or the volatility in their share prices at a specific point of time. These stocks are the ones that cause the stock markets to crash eventually. Mostly the news and media play a significant role in promoting about these hot stocks that have proven to be quite damaging for businesses and investors majority of the times.

The basic secret to finding a profitable stock
 is to carefully evaluate its growth over a certain period and then assess its performance for the long-term by taking all the above essential factors into account. The key is not to fall a victim to a Hot Stock and look for a company that will provide steady growth to your stocks and ensure its sustainability in the long-run.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/m5viabn3u1g27dch', 'title': 'What are some secrets about stock trading that you are willing to share?', 'score': {'original': 0.4549, 'ai': 0.5451}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Investing in stocks has no successful scientific formula to ensure 100% profitability for any single investor or company.

These stocks are the ones that cause the stock markets to crash eventually. Mostly the news and media play a significant role in promoting about these hot stocks that have proven to be quite damaging for businesses and investors majority of the times.\n\nThe basic secret to finding a profitable stock\n is to carefully evaluate its growth over a certain period and then assess its performance for the long-term by taking all the above essential factors into account.

The secret lies in identifying the profitable companies\n that can offer profits in the future based upon their past performance in the stock market and also by evaluating the right price that can provide the right opportunity to grow for the individual stocks in the market.\n\nFollowing are some secrets that can be profitable for an investor:\n\ni. The quality of the company is vital to determining the future stock growth in the market. It is not necessary that the company is a big or a small enterprise, what is important is how has the company progressed and achieved its place in the industry. Company’s performance can be assessed through an in-depth scrutiny of past financial records that may be reflected through its ratios like, P/E Ratio, Return on Equity, Current Ratio etc.\n\nii. It is important to look for stocks that are strong enough to stay on hand for more than 10 years, if they do not show effective returns for a span of 10 years or more, these stocks are not the ones to be invested upon. Stock markets are meant for ensuring long term returns and do not look at the short term. The stocks that tend to reflect profitability in the long-term are the ones that an investor is looking for. Short term profits do not reflect upon a potentially profitable stock altogether. One should never rely upon the hype and propaganda regarding a single company just on the basis of current market happenings but one should focus upon his own individual homework first and then decide whether or not they should be investing in stocks.\n\niii. Another significant factor that most investors tend to overlook is how effectively a company is able to manage its existing resources. The resources of he company include financial resources, human resources, physical resources etc. that may be a major element in determining the overall performance of a company. If a company is able to effectively manage its resources at hand, it will be able to maintain that over a span of period in the future to give constant returns to its investors as well.\n\niv.

Penny Stocks,4y,What are the common mistakes made by a first time investor in stock markets?,"Nobody really wishes to fritter away their hard-earned money, am I right?

If you aim on stepping into the stock market, however want to overcome common slip-ups, I suggest you read some points for you to avoid if you want to successfully execute your stock market strategy.

Not Having a Trading Strategy

Stock traders in the beginning of their careers may not develop a strategy prior to their trading.

Disregarding Risk Assessment

Never stop paying regard to your risk bearing, or your tolerance to persist on risk. Some individuals may not bear instability and the rises and falls affiliated with stock trading or more tentative trades. Other individuals may have to protect, daily interest incomes. Such investors with low-risk acceptance may be more affluent trading in the blue-chip traders of settled firms and must keep afar from more unpredictable increase/decrease or new companies trades.

Overlooking Your Time Sphere

If you are new in stock trading, you must avoid investing without setting up time duration. Find out how long the time duration, you have to stock up for a down payment on property, education or retirement.

Not Determining Stop Losses

Even though stock traders have to show tolerance and patience, they must not bear failure without action. Outline a price threshold, when in case the price exceeds/devlines you are not comfortable holding a trade.

Purchasing Stocks on Credit

Purchasing stocks on credit is a tactic maintained by experts in the share trading. They take money to purchase stock from a financial institution or stock agent. After the price of a share rise, they sell it and look after their cash and liabilities difference and gains. However if the price of a share does not increase and diminished instead, the financial institution or agent suppose them to give in additional amounts.

Franklin Parker,7y,"In general, how does a wealthy person with enormous blocks of stock actually trade it? Does Bill Gates just log on to his Fidelity account and place a sell order for $100 million of Microsoft stock? What skill does a broker contribute?","Thanks for the A2A! This is actually something I deal with in my job, so I can maybe shed some insight.

Short answer: NO. Not even close.

Longer answer: when liquidating or buying concentrated positions, there are a variety of techniques involved. Here are the basics:

First, depending on the needs of the client, hedging is in order. Usually the position gets collared (sell a call and use proceeds to buy a put), or a custom hedge is constructed using an investment bank (this would be a private transaction). Why hedge? Well, if we have decided to exit the position, why would we continue to take on significant risk while we execute the plan?

Second, we structure a plan to liquidate the position. Usually, this is simply done at pre-agreed upon prices over the course of months. Sometimes, however, you have to call a block broker
 to move the chunks you want to move.

Third, we execute and update the plan as it is in motion. Markets are very fluid, if we need to shift gears, we do so.

All of this requires planning and some skill. Brokers and traders become very important in these scenarios.

Penny Stocks,4y,Can I start investing in stocks with only $1500?,"You can invest in stocks with an amount as less as a $100 even, but that may only get you a single stock at a time but the number of stocks can multiply with the passage of time based upon the profitability.

The stock market is so vast that small amounts do not really count as a genuine trading bet even unless there is a big amount at stake, the stocks are considered to be non-profitable for the investor.

For such a minimal amount, no investment broker will be interested into guiding you with your trading decisions.

There are multiple rating websites that can help you in making a sound decision for your small investment. Also, if possible look for a company that is ensuring short term returns to gain quick returns on your money. This may be beneficial for you for such a small amount that may also lessen your risk of losing out on your investment in the stock market.

Stock Price,4y,Which Pharma stock to invest for a long term prospective?,"The best pharmaceutical stocks are the ones that generate significant revenue. These stocks either appear to be very profitable or guarantee returns in the future, with solid pipelines of drug candidates that should have the potential to generate more revenue

The reason why I would recommend you to invest in Pfizer is because this company ranks as one of the largest pharmaceutical companies across the world. It has claimed 10 revolutionary products and there is another long list of drugs which are generating hundreds of millions of dollars of yearly sales

The company without a doubt has a best pipeline. It also expects to win the FDA approval for tafamidis which will help the company treat a rare genetic disease transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. You will be happy to know that this company has over two dozen programs in phase 3 clinical studies

Pfizer also provides an attractive dividend to its investors with a current dividend yield of 3.4%. The divided when combined with enhancing the growth prospects in the near future would help the company deliver excellent returns to the investors or shareholders in the long run

In my point of view, Pfizer comes among the best big Pharma stocks especially for the long run investors to buy right now. Its fastest growing products have the capability to shine even brighter than they do now. Its four currently approved products will enjoy strong momentum in my opinion.

There is no way you can miss out on Pfizer’s remarkable dividend yield which is currently 3.38. I doubt that this dividend yield could decline over the next few years not because the company might reduce its dividend pay-out. Instead, in my point of view the stock would grow much faster than the company’s dividend hikes, and this might result in a lower yield

I also think that Pfizer might boost its dividend on a regular basis. Over the couple of years, this company has enhanced its dividend by almost 42 percent. I strongly believe that we will get to see the same kind of dividend growth in the near future.

If you want to think over the long term, you should not over-look the fact how important its dividend is. Since ten years, the company has seen 87 percent of the stock increase.

Stock Price,4y,How easy is it to get rich by investing in stocks?,"You may have heard the popular phrase “Nothing worth Having Comes Easy.” Yes, it’s true. I believe that stock investing is one of the contests you can play to build a strong wealth; however, that’s the half reality. Building your wealth through stock investment asks for heaps of endurance, restraint along with accepting the fact that you don’t have a shortcut to become rich. Although, there is a long way till it’s easy for you to say stocks investment made you rich, it’s still not impossible! As per stock professionals, it is among the most rewarding practices we can follow. And this is a contributing factor to my increased interest in stock investment after I graduated.

Following are some reasons stock investments could make you rich:

You don’t require too much of money to begin generating more money, not akin to when you have to purchase property along with bearing a regular mortgage.
The duration you need for stock trading activities is relatively less than establishing a conventional enterprise. Establishing a business requires you to wait prior when it begins generating profit, however, catching hold on the right stocks trading gives you profits as quick as you gobble on your favorite food! (Well, kind ofJ)
With trading, it’s absolutely fast cash, which enables you to draw your take more conveniently. (In contrast to selling lands, which requires more time to create and manage documentation.)
It is easy to find out how to yield gains out of the stock trading. Well, comparatively simple (Except for some individuals who just can’t get it right and that extend their duration of learning).

I recommend you a couple of best practices in order to learn stock trading soon, create your wealth and make the most out of it:

Be crystal clear about the do’s and don’ts of stock trading sooner than stepping into the trading universe
Spend your time researching and mastering the art of finding the right stocks
Last but not the least, know that when you fail, you lose your hard and cash, and thus you should be redundant!

Pramod Kumar,6y,"Is trading in a share market a good earning method? When we make someone lose, is it right?","The push cart vendor in the image above is selling Vegetables.

He trades in vegetables.

Buys them in whole sale market and sells in retail going door to door. He has developed expertise in sourcing his purchase, pricing his stock and also has regular customers. Based on these skills , he trades profitably everyday.

So does this guy:

This also is a trade.

Here the cost price is very low, effort is high and he is actually selling HAPPINESS for the child whose parents buy the balloon. Price of the end product relates to the value provided.

If one can make such trades profitably, then why not in Trading in Stock Markets.

Yes, it is a good earning method.

But you need to develop the skills required.

( a ) Like the vegetable seller buys at a right price and sells at another right price, you have to develop the skill to find the right entry and exit points for your trade. This is known in stock markets as — Technical Analysis.

(b) The vegetable seller selects good quality vegetables. He is also not carrying only one variety but some selected ones. You have to learn the skills of selecting the right stocks —- Fundamental Analysis. More number of vegetables / stocks is called Diversified Portfolio.

(c) If you happen to go to a market place of vegetable sellers, you are likely to notice one point— The selections are mostly same. Yes, few sellers stock some exotic and out of season vegetables, which are high priced, but generally it is same stock with everyone. This is known as following the trend.

(d) The exotic vegetables do sell at a high price but it is difficult to sell them. But if there is a sudden demand due to some wedding function/ other occasion. great profits are made. Such trades are known as Contrarian Trades.

(e) All other things being similar ( not same), the share market trader has the advantage of not having to go door to door. Stock exchange/ Broker do that for you.One can trade sitting at home. What else you can ask for ?

(f) If the sales of vegetables are slow on one day and some loss occurs, the vegetable seller does not give up. He is again there in the morning buying his stock. For him it is a business. A stock market trader also needs to have the same approach. It is a business.

I hope I have been able to answer your question.

Done rightly, trading in stock market can be a good method for earning money.

Thanks for reading.

How to invest $7,000 safely

If safety is what you're looking for then you will need to look for low-risk investments, though you should know that there are no guarantees in investing. Stocks, being naturally risky, will fluctuate in value. In exchange for taking on this risk, investors will generally be rewarded with the possibility of higher returns than they'd get from less risky investments. If you absolutely can’t risk any fluctuation, you’ll be better served with a savings account or a savings product, that typically carry virtually little to no risk. That said, you can't expect the kind of returns you might get from investing in ETFs made up of stocks, bonds, and real estate. In fact, interest rates have lately been so low that inflation is likely to outpace the interest rate, and in the long run, you’ll essentially be losing money by keeping your money stuck in one.

Government bonds typically come with less risk, but also provide comparatively low returns. Stocks behave a little like a penny tossed in the air; the more times you do it, the more likely it is you'll get to a one-to-one heads-to-tails ratio, and the longer you hold a stock, the more predictable the results will be. The range of outcomes tend to narrow over time, so in the past, those who held onto a variety of stock investments for more than a decade were most likely rewarded with returns that offset any short-term risk.

The conventional wisdom is the longer your investment horizon, the higher the ratio of stocks to bonds your portfolio can contain. If you don’t need to withdraw money in the short term, you can afford to ride the wave of the stock market.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4zx351rs0j9cplmy', 'title': 'Should I put my $7000 savings into the stock market?', 'score': {'original': 0.6402, 'ai': 0.3598}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Saving any amount of money isn’t easy and $7,000 is no small feat.

Indrazith Shantharaj,Updated 3y,Why do people trade in Options when they are risky and there are other options to make money from share market with lesser risk?,"Wonderful question!

We have below 3 trading instruments in the stock market:

Equity
Futures
Options

So, a trader should know how these trading instruments work.

Now assume a new trader has Rs. 2,00,000 in his trading account and he wants to make a trade with APOLLO HOSPITALS today (as on 20/06/2020 CMP 1370).

.

The current Market Price of APOLLO HOSPITALS is 1370.

So, the total shares he can buy is 146 (approx) with a capital of Rs. 2,00,000.

Now we will try to understand both the ‘Risk’ and ‘Reward’ from this trade.

Reward - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the upside. In this case, he will make a profit of Rs. 20,000 and his current portfolio value is Rs. 2,20,000.

Risk - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the downside. In this case, he will make a loss of Rs. 20,000 and his current portfolio value is Rs. 1,80,000.

.

The current Market Price of APOLLO HOSPITALS is 1370.

Image - Margin requirements information (as on 20/06/2020)

So, with a capital of Rs. 2,00,000, he can buy 1 lot (500 quantity).

(This info can be found in F&O Margin calculator from most of the broker sites)

Now we will try to understand both the ‘Risk’ and ‘Reward’ from this trade.

Reward - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the upside.

10% of 1370 (CMP) is 137.

Total Profit = 1 lot (500 quantity) X 137 = Rs. 68,500

In this case, his current portfolio value is Rs. 2,68,500.

Risk - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the downside.

10% of 1370 (CMP) is 137.

Total Loss = 1 lot (500 quantity) X 137 = Rs. 68,500

In this case, his current portfolio value is Rs. 1,31,500.

.

The current Market Price of APOLLO HOSPITALS is 1370.

One should look at the option chain for the nearest strike price on the NSE India website or with your broker terminal to get the LTP.

Image - APOLLO HOSPITALS Option chain CE/PE info at 1380 strike price (as on 20/06/2020)

So, with a capital of Rs. 2,00,000, he can buy 4166 (LTP of both CE and PE is 48) quantity (ignoring Lot size at the moment)

Now we will try to understand both the ‘Risk’ and ‘Reward’ from this trade.

Reward - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the upside.

Option LTP approximately increase by 75% of the change in the underlying price (Implied Volatility is also around 70–75% for this script).

10% of 1370 (CMP) is 137 (change in the underlying instrument) and 75% of 137 is 102.75.

So, Total Profit = 4166 quantity X 102.75 = Rs. 4,28,056

In this case, his current portfolio value is Rs. 6,28,056

Risk - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the downside.

In this case, LTP of 1380 CE will become zero.

Hence, this trader will lose his entire capital.

PS: I have considered only “Options Buying” as most the retail traders only do options buying and the above question is also relevant to option buying.

.

Summary:

Image - Capital size after the execution in Equity, Futures, and Options.

The above image is self-explanatory.

Most retail traders try their luck in options to make quick money.

(Apart from retail traders, institutions and some big traders also do options trading to hedge their portfolio. I am not mentioning them here as the intention of the question is different)

With other trading instruments (Equity and Futures), the risk is less, but the reward is also less!

Image - Thumb rule of risk-reward in 3 trading instruments

However, my sincere caution to all the retail traders is to master their trading skills before trying anything in options. The above explanation is only a theoretical assumption and in the live market options LTP may change due to other factors (like time for expiry, volatility, etc).

I hope this detailed explanation helps :)

.

Edit-1 (on 05/07/2020)

Thanks for 10K+ views.

I have received a few queries about Implied Volatility. Hence, I thought to clarify the same.

Implied Volatility (IV) is one of the most critical metrics to understand when trading options.

In simple terms, IV is determined by the current price of options contracts on a particular stock or future. It also represents the expected volatility of a stock over the life of the option.

Options that show high levels of IV will result in high-priced option premiums.

Each strike price of options will also respond differently to implied volatility changes. Usually, near-the-money strike price contracts are more sensitive to change in IV.

Stock Price,4y,"What types of stocks do you avoid investing in, and why?","Following are the four mainstream types of stocks that one should avoid investing for the sake of safeguarding the returns. These stocks are easily available into the market, one should be involved in swot to decide whether a particular investment will be profitable or not.

1. Low liquid Companies

There are some investments or stocks whose prices continuously decrease. Unfortunately, the investors cannot sell those investments as there are no buyers available. One should avoid investing in securities with less liquidity because exiting from a low liquid organization can create stressful conditions.

Generally, stockholders must stay away from companies that have average trade volume of less than ten lac. It is obvious that the higher the volume is, the better the situation of the company will be. In addition, alternative way to check liquidity of a company is to focus on the difference between bids and ask price. The higher the liquidity, the smaller is the difference.

2. High debt companies

Debts in the organizations are same as big holes in a spaceship. Unless and until, these holes are not filled then the ship is unable to move. One must avoid investing in companies that have a lot of liability found. Following the thumb rule, one must stay away from organizations with an equity/debt ratio that is greater than 1.

3. Falling knife category companies

Investment in organizations whose share price falling significantly and continuously (for example PND, PC Jewellers, Suzlon energy and Geetanjali etc) is not a good idea. There is always a reason why the stock prices are decreasing and the market punishes that company. Furthermore, there are a lot of listed companies in New York Stock exchange which could be explored.

4. Low visibility companies

There are a few companies in the New York Stock Exchange whose information is not so easily available on the financial websites or the Internet. This is mostly in the case of micro-cap or small companies. Looking into such companies with lower visibility could be a boring job for stockholders. In addition, there are various chances for data manipulation. So, if you are unable to cross check the information or when the reference sources does not seem reliable then one should avoid to invest in those companies.

Anbazhagan Ambrose,Sep 4,What are the risks of investing in the Indian stock market? What are the best options available for investing?,"My father’s generation wanted risk-free investments. They chose land (very good for their period), gold (again good considering no one sells gold in our households) and our good old LIC.

Even in my generation it took me sometime to understand the best risk-free investment scam of all times. LIC policies :)

Let us take an example of one policy. Jeevan Laabh. It says you “only” have to pay a monthly premium of Rs. 43,000 for 10 years only but by the end of 16th year you will get one crore. By investing only 52 lakhs, your money almost doubled in 16 years. Congratulations on becoming a crorepati. You just earned 6.3% returns on your investment.

Now you are someone like me who thinks working with Excel is the same as going on a hot date. So you decide to crunch the numbers.

Risk-free option - government bonds. Average return is 7.2%, gives 1.09 crores, about 9 lakhs more than LIC.

Wee risk option - debt funds, average return 8.1%, gives 20 lakhs more than LIC.

Small pinch of risk option - 85% debt, 15% index fund, average 10%, gives 45 lakhs more than LIC.

Medium pinch of risk option - 80% index funds, 20% debt fund, averages 12%, gives 78 lakhs more than LIC.

Big pinch of risk option - 50% index fund, 30% large cap, 20% mid cap, averages 14%, gives you 1.19 crores more than LIC.

Handful of risk option - Nifty 200 companies, averages 20%, gives you 3 crore more than LIC.

So you decide what you are willing to take on. By the way, inflation came and ate that magnificent 6.3% returns from LIC. Basically you ran hard to remain in the same place. So moral of the story is LIC also came with a risk, an assured risk at that.

Now let us come to the markets themselves. It is where fortunes are made and fortunes are lost. We want more on the credit column than in the debit column. That is not good book keeping I know but we are not bean counters, we are investors.

Best thing you should bring to the table - faith in your ability to learn, understand and analyze. Not faith in some finfluencer or TV guru, but absolute faith in your ability. Ability to balance things. Understand risks and react to them. Let me illustrate.

You had 1 lakh in 2007, were hearing about the hottest ticket in the town, RCom trading at Rs. 750.

Jump the bandwagon - You put the whole money in RCom and exited in 2023 with a grand total of Rs. 186. Not per share, but for all shares :(

One leg in, one leg out - You did bit of research, was not sure about CDMA so you wanted to bet with both CDMA and GSM. Half money in RCom and half in Bharti Airtel. Airtel is not a great stock, but you still managed to escape with 2.3 lakhs.

Deep thinker - spread the risk, so you put some for the hype, some for futuristic stuff like GSM and majority in plain boring business like BFSI and Consumer Durables. Your 1 lakh swelled up to 15 lakhs because you managed the risk well.

Mate, what about 40% large caps, 20% midcaps, 20% small caps and 10% micro caps? Ah, we are going to make a sensible investor out of you.

Compared to 15 years ago, being an investor now:

Advantages:

You have information at your fingertips, which we had to hunt hard back in 2007.
You have lot of technical tools like very advanced charting, screeners etc., which are mighty useful.
Learning has never been easier.
Ease with which you can do transactions.

Disadvantages:

The hype factory has grown exponentially due to social media.
“Get rich quick” scams, Telegram trading calls AND training programs :)
Too much of information, easy to lose focus.

So are the days of overvalued stocks like RCom over? Not at all, they are getting even worse. Yes, I am looking at companies like Olectra and pure EV plays. Moral of the story is do your own due diligence.

Risk will always be there. Learn to manage the risk, stay for long-term and you will make money.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ive73c04659w8o1u', 'title': 'What are the risks of investing in the Indian stock market?

Ah, we are going to make a sensible investor out of you.\n\nCompared to 15 years ago, being an investor now:\n\nAdvantages:\n\nYou have information at your fingertips, which we had to hunt hard back in 2007.\nYou have lot of technical tools like very advanced charting, screeners etc., which are mighty useful.\nLearning has never been easier.\nEase with which you can do transactions.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThe hype factory has grown exponentially due to social media.\n“Get rich quick” scams, Telegram trading calls AND training programs :)\nToo much of information, easy to lose focus.\n\nSo are the days of overvalued stocks like RCom over? Not at all, they are getting even worse. Yes, I am looking at companies like Olectra and pure EV plays. Moral of the story is do your own due diligence.\n\nRisk will always be there. Learn to manage the risk, stay for long-term and you will make money.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.6487
