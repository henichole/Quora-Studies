Uro≈° Raca,Updated Sep 10,What distinguishes Novak Djokovic from his contemporaries?,"He came from nothing. By the time he was 13 years old, he'd already gone through two wars between 1991 and 1999. The few tennis courts that Serbia had at the time were bombed to dust, including his favorite court on Mount Kopaonik, where he was first introduced to the sport.

It's not easy, as a kid, being hungry most of the time, losing your loved ones and watching your dreams and birthplace get shattered. Poverty was a problem as well as his country‚Äôs banned passport, so he couldn't travel to train on a higher level or compete as a youngster. That was a serious disadvantage right at the beginning.

Luckily for Novak, things started to change a bit and he was allowed to go abroad to foreign tennis academies. Before that he trained in empty swimming pools. His first coach and tennis Mom, Jelena Gencic who also taught Monica Seles, sent him to Nikola Piliƒá, an ex player and doubles grand slam champion, who had an academy of his own in M√ºnich, Germany. This is where Novak met players like Ernest Gulbis, Gilles Simon and many other prospects. The famous Goran Ivanisevic and Michael Stich, former Wimbledon champions, also went there.

Traveling with his father who was a rough disciplinarian was tough, but this helped him form a winner's mentality. Quiting in life was never an option. His mother worked 3 jobs, had to raise two of his brothers mostly on her own and send him and his father money. When that wasn't enough, they had to borrow money from loansharks which pretty much meant that Novak needed to win whatever event he was competing at to make sure all the debts were paid on time.

Standing in line for food, not having any options as a competitor while fighting a hostile crowd, staying in the cheapest, most dangerous ghettos while playing various tournaments turned him into the ultimate warrior.

He had early back and neck injuries, deviations in his nose that troubled breathing, was plagued by many allergies, survived serious food poisonings and coach sabotage before finally figuring things out in 2007. His struggles, mental and physical were still there but smaller until the end of 2010 when he started putting things in order. After winning the Davis Cup that year, Novak had one of the most impressive seasons in the sport‚Äôs history. In 2011 he won 10 titles (3 grand slams, 5 Masters and a couple other titles) with a 43 win streak and ended it with a record of 70‚Äì6 (92.1%). He had an even better season in 2015(best in tennis history) where he won 11 titles with 3 grand slams, 6 Masters, Tour Finals and another title, ending it with a record of 82-6(93.2%).

Some of his stand-alone achievements are:

Having won the most grand slams, 24.

Winning at least 3 titles at every slam.

Being the only man who has a positive record against the other two greatest players of all time, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Winning 30 consecutive Grand Slam matches and setting up a record of 16.950 ATP points.

Being in 6 consecutive GS finals, winning 5, of which 4 in a row on 3 different surfaces.

Winning 31 consecutive Masters matches.

Being in 6+ finals at each Grand Slam.

4 streaks of 3+ consecutive Grand Slam titles.

Having the highest winning percentage of all time at 83.3%.

Winning 10 Australian Open titles and I'm sure he'll add more.

Winning 39 Masters titles.

Winning 6 Masters in a single season.

Winning all 9 Masters and doing it twice.

Winning 13 hardcourt Major finals.

Winning 66 Elite tournaments.

Winning 3 Majors after being 2 sets down for the comeback of the year.

Winning a Major after being 2 sets down twice in the tournament.

Three-peat at 8 different elite tournaments.

Getting the double-elite title sweep.

25+ wins over each member of the Big Four and winning head-to-head record against all of them.

80%+ on all three surfaces

Highest hardcourt win percentage at 84.3% (88.6% at GS/Majors).

4 winning streaks of 26+ match wins at GS events.

6 seasons reaching 3+ Major finals.

6+ finals at each GS/Major.

9+ semifinals at each GS/Major.

34 five-set GS wins.

Over 80 wins at each Major.

55 singles Masters finals.

Dethroning 8 GS champions.

Earning a record 7 time year-end #1 and ITF player of the year.

In his career Djokovic has played 29% of his matches against top 10 players, while Federer has played 22.8% and Nadal 22.4%. Yet Djokovic has the highest win rate versus the top 10 at 69%.

Since 2011 Djokovic has won 20 slams, 33 masters, 4 ATP Finals and spent 373 weeks at world #1. Meanwhile, Nadal and Federer have won a combined 17 slams, 29 masters, 1 ATP Final and spent a total 132 weeks at #1, which is way less than half.

It starts making sense why he's the player of the decade and quite possibly our lifetime.

The list of his crazy achievements goes on and on as he keeps adding new records. These are just some to let everyone know that we are witnessing greatness.

There hasn't been a stronger player in terms of willpower and fitness.

He's the master of silencing the crowd, just look at the US Open 2011 & 2015 and Wimbledon 2014, 2015 & 2019. It doesn't matter if there's 15.000-30.000 fans booing, he still wins.

No other tennis star had to endure all that. He knows how to channel his inner wolf. üê∫

–ïdit: Novak is also a humanitarian. He makes very generous donations for those who need help the most. He has built many kindergartens, schools, playgrounds and shelters. In 2012 and 2016 he covered all the expenses for different teams representing his country including the special and para-Olympic teams. He has also financed the construction of their training centers. It's important to note that during the coronavirus outbreak he helped not only Serbian hospitals but the ones in Italy and Spain as well because they were hit the hardest. Back in 2014 when the horrific floods devastated the former Yugoslav region, he gave up all of his earnings from the Masters tournament in Rome and added extra resources from his Foundation to help repair the damage and provide housing. He did the same when we had flares, earthquakes and blizzards a couple of years before that and personally assisted the authorities in bringing all the necessary supplies. It's worth noting that he started a campaign with Maria Sharapova to help stop the Australian bushfires and repair the damage in 2019-2020. Unfortunately, people are quick to forget.

He loves kids and appreciates his fans more than any other athlete.

Novak gives his racket to the kid who was ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù him in his win over Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final of Roland Garros 2021 after being down 2‚Äì0, making it one of the greatest comebacks in all sports. They had a special moment after the match.

Making a ball boy's dream come true at the French Open 2014.

Other players have great respect and admiration for Novak and his sportsmanship. He's the quickest to applaud their effort and compliment their game on and off the court and the first to comfort them after a loss. Players such as Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev, John Isner, Alexander Zverev, Simona Halep, Dominic Thiem, Dennis Shapovalov, Riley Opelka, Borna Coric, Kei Nishikori, David Goffin, Yannick Sinner, Casper Ruud, Holger Rune, Thomas Etcheverry, Hyeon Chung, Hugo Dellien and many others see Novak as an inspiration and often seek advice from him. He's great friends with Vasek Pospisil, Juan-Martin Del Potro, Andy Murray, Maria Sharapova, Paula Badosa, Aryna Sabalenka, Serena Williams, Grigor Dimitrov, Fabio Fognini, Malek Jaziri, Nick Kyrgios, Gael Monfils, Simona Halep and all his fellow Serbian players, male and female. Former players and legends such as Boris Becker, Ivan Lendl, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Monica Seles, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Rod Laver, Andy Roddick, Tim Henman, James Blake, Barbara Schett, Laura Robson, Ivan Ljubicic and Mardy Fish think very highly of him.

In 2017 he gifted his own apartment in Paris to his countryman and Davis/ATP Cup partner Filip Krajinovic. Novak knew that France was always Filip‚Äôs favorite place outside of Serbia and believed in him when no one else did during that tough time in his life. He wanted his friend and colleague to feel at home there. They remain close to this day and often play doubles together. He shared his entire apparel with Nikola Cacic, a doubles player from his home country who idolizes him and helped Mirza Basic out by giving him his extra pair of shoes. Through 2021 and 2022 he covered all the expenses of training and coaching of his young compatriot Hamad Medjedovic. Hamad‚Äôs father said he couldn‚Äôt believe how generous Novak‚Äôs support was and that it won‚Äôt cost them anything. They often train together and Hamad considers Novak as his mentor. This is what it means to be a true leader.

Here's Novak with Nina Stojanovic. He promised to play doubles with her when she was a kid.

Praveen Karthikeyan,Updated 4y,Is Nadal unlucky to be born in the same era as Federer?,"Not just Nadal, all the three - Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are very very unlucky to have been born in the same era of others.

Let me start by a stat.

As of now, in the entire history of tennis, only 8 gentlemen have achieved career slam. In the open era, only four have done this.

Andre Agassi

Roger Federer

Rafael Nadal

Novak Djokovic

And we have three of them at the same period, three of the eight great players in the whole history of tennis are playing alongside at the same time, lucky for us, but completely unlucky for them.

Despite having played in the same era, they are the top 3 grand slam winners in the entire history.

Federer - 20 grand slams

Nadal - 19 grand slams

Djokovic - 16 grand slams

This clearly shows that hadn't at least one of em been there at the same time, the other two would have been beasts.

Despite having won huge number of grand slams, none of them has actually won a calendar slam( all 4 grand slams in a calendar year).

Nadal prevented Djokovic twice and Federer twice from a calendar slam.

Also they have records that are very very unlikely to be broken.

Nadal - 12 titles at a single surface clay

Federer - Has more than 5 titles in every surface other than clay‚Ä¶

Djokovic - Only player in the history of tennis to hold all four grand slam titles and all nine Masters in three different surfaces.

This shows how lucky we are to witness three legends of the game at the same time.

Yeah‚Ä¶.

This picture is and will be a gem forever in the tennis world.

EDIT 1: Djokovic moves to 15 grand slams defeating Nadal in the Australian open 2019 final‚Ä¶Yes,their dominance still continues.

EDIT 2: Nadal makes it again in French open, defeating Thiem and extending it to a whopping 12 Roland Garros titles.

Laurence Shanet,Updated 5y,Why was Serena Williams' outfit banned from the French Open?,"First the short version:

Q: ‚ÄúWhy was Serena Williams' outfit banned from the French Open?‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúBecause she (and Nike) wanted it to be.‚Äù

Now the longer version:

Q: ‚ÄúWhy was Serena Williams' outfit banned from the French Open?‚Äù

A: Well, the first thing to know is that it probably isn‚Äôt for the reasons you think it is, or for the reasons you‚Äôve been hearing people write about. And it isn‚Äôt for the reasons stated in any of the other answers here (at least as of this writing). It relates much more to ankles, calves, fabrics and technicalities than it does to prudishness, self-expression, body shaming or other hot button issues. It‚Äôs also not really about tennis authorities being so old fashioned or too caught up in tradition to stay with the times. And it‚Äôs not even about tennis‚Äôs aristocratic origins, and class indicators, as some answers have suggested.

Obviously, that‚Äôs going to require a little explanation. So here goes. Serena‚Äôs cat suit, while form fitting, isn‚Äôt really that different from what many athletes wear in some other sports. It‚Äôs fairly modest really. Here it is:

Not particularly scandalous, right? In fact, Serena herself wore a much more revealing outfit at the French Open in 2004. Take a look at that one, which was considered to be within the rules:

So all the talk about uptight French men telling women what to wear because they can‚Äôt handle people‚Äôs bodies seems like it isn‚Äôt the case, right?

So what could it be? Well, it turns out it has to do with a few piddly little rules and standards of both the women‚Äôs tour and the tournament itself. One of them is that although Serena‚Äôs 2004 catsuits weren‚Äôt considered too short, this year‚Äôs version was considered too long. What‚Äôs that, you say? How could that be? Well it turns out that Serena was in violation of a couple of rules that are well known on the tour but little known to the public, one of which is that leggings or tights can be worn but only until the middle of the calf at the longest. They also are supposed to be worn under a skirt or pair of shorts, no matter how short or tight those may be. Here‚Äôs a picture of Serena wearing form-fitting tights at Roland Garros that were perfectly legal and not banned.

Lastly, Roland Garros has a rule stated explicitly in their code that all players must wear clothing that is ‚Äúcustomarily acceptable tennis attire‚Äù. The catsuit in question is not customarily acceptable tennis attire. It doesn‚Äôt look like anything that tennis players have ever worn, and doesn‚Äôt try to be. Neither the shape, color, cut or material are in any way customary for tennis. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre scandalous or racy, just that they‚Äôre not typical. And the rule exists to keep players from just randomly wearing anything they want, and the tournament not being able to address it. Offices have similar standards, so it‚Äôs not really that unexpected or unreasonable.

Now obviously Serena is very familiar with these rules. She‚Äôs been on the tour for over 20 years and put together many an outfit that complied with them. So why would she suddenly forget or decide purposely to break them? The answer is fairly obvious once you look at her actions and those of the company that made the banned outfit: Marketing. Really smart marketing.

The outfit Serena wore works on many levels. First off, it‚Äôs really cool-looking. Secondly it recalls the super-powered outfit worn in the smash hit movie ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù, released just three months before Roland Garros and reprised in the most recent installment of Avengers, which was released just one month before Roland Garros. The movie contained messages of empowerment, and was loved by more than 100 million people around the world. What better imagery to associate herself with? Third of all it was, by her accounts, comfortable.

The only thing is that it was illegal. And she (and Nike) knew it. You can guess all you like about whose idea it was first (I have a pretty good idea myself). But the point is that both Serena and Nike knew going in that the outfit was unlikely to be allowed. The only time anyone had worn a full-length catsuit at a major tennis event previously, it had been banned that night. But is that actually a bad thing? If she wears an outfit and people talk about it a bit in the press because it‚Äôs cool and looks like Black Panther, then you get a little buzz, and a few days later it all dies down. However, if you make sure that said outfit breaks the rules, however petty, you run the chance of getting a much huger publicity benefit. Buying ads is expensive. But getting articles written about you is free. There‚Äôs a saying in the marketing world: ‚ÄúAdvertising is what you pay for. PR is what you pray for.‚Äù And that fits this case very well. It would have been a small win if Serena had worn her catsuit and gone about her business. But if it were to get censured or banned, then all of a sudden it‚Äôs a marketing bonanza! Not only do you get talked about for months in every news outlet and millions of online outlets (including this one), but you get to call out Serena‚Äôs heroism instead of just her fashion acumen.

Heck, you might even design a major ad specifically around the occurrence, that just by chance, coincidentally, through a total fluke of nature that no one could possibly have seen coming because it was such a huge surprise that no one expected in any way fit the scenario perfectly, as well as the entire new positioning of the company that was just being rolled out:

Oh my god, I can‚Äôt believe Nike got so lucky! Total coincidence. They couldn‚Äôt have expected any of this. I mean, the press releases probably aren‚Äôt a thing either. And the link that the OP included with the question refers to a business win that surely Nike couldn‚Äôt have seen coming: Nike had the perfect response to French Open's controversial decision to ban Serena Williams' catsuit that made her feel like a 'warrior princess'

It‚Äôs a lucky thing the suit just happened to break a few of those obscure rules, and that they had the perfect carefully-crafted response at the ready for when it did. I‚Äôm sure Nike and Serena didn‚Äôt design it with that in mind just to generate crass publicity. That would be out of the realm of possibility for a large marketing-savvy corporation like that, wouldn‚Äôt it? (Fortunately for them, the campaign wasn‚Äôt quite as impactful as it might have been, since they let her wear it and only banned it later, scuttling Nike‚Äôs initial Roland Garros PR attempts. I‚Äôm sure they would have been simply mortified if it had blown up during the tournament.)

And Nike is lucky they chose an actual superhero to wear the outfit, because the mere mortals on tour all know they would have been immediately punished if they‚Äôd even tried to masquerade as superheroes and wear that outfit themselves.

With great power comes great responsibility.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ph75be3kdjny16g0', 'title': ""Why was Serena Williams' outfit banned from the French Open?"", 'score': {'original': 0.5046, 'ai': 0.4954}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""First the short version:\n\nQ: ‚ÄúWhy was Serena Williams' outfit banned from the French Open?‚Äù\n\nA: ‚ÄúBecause she (and Nike) wanted it to be.‚Äù\n\nNow the longer version:\n\nQ: ‚ÄúWhy was Serena Williams' outfit banned from the French Open?‚Äù\n\nA: Well, the first thing to know is that it probably isn‚Äôt for the reasons you think it is, or for the reasons you‚Äôve been hearing people write about.

John Sew,Updated 3y,Why do some people say that Rafael Nadal‚Äôs tennis style of play is defensive?,"One of the beauties of Rafa‚Äôs game is his ‚Äúpercentage play‚Äù.

What is percentage tennis?

It is safe tennis. You don‚Äôt hit flat shots which have a high risk factor of either going into the net or sailing wide. You don‚Äôt look to clear the net by simply a few inches. You play to clear the net by a good few feet. To do that, you have to usually hit constant top spin shots. They sail up above the net, but also come falling down fast after that reach the high point. This either adds depth to a shot, or simply makes the ball bounce high if it lands short. In either scenario, the trajectory of the ball is difficult to tackle, especially because it is not the usual way the ball comes back to a player.

Needless to say, this is not an aggressive brand of tennis. Aggressive players usually hit flatter, faster shots and volley more. Federer is a good example. Federer is an extremely aggressive player. Nadal‚Äôs style is aggressive too, but not as aggressive. His focus is more on extracting mistakes and using bounce to displace his opponents (who often move further back to get the shot on a hittable level), and when he gets an open court, he can easily slam a winner.

Nadal also consistently stands far behind the basline when receiving serve. It‚Äôs obviously a much more defensive position, from where he takes a couple shots to come up to the baseline. If you look at Federer, he usually stands right around the baseline while returning serve.

Look at this difference in their receiving positions. It‚Äôs a classic aggressive/defensive contrast.

Lastly, if you look at Federer‚Äôs matches - most times, he outhits his opponents on winners. And even when he loses, it‚Äôs because he lands up with more errors. In contrast, Nadal may or may not have more winners, but he usually does far better in terms of unforced errors and that‚Äôs where he makes the difference count.

Both these approaches to playing the game have their own merits. After all, both these players have made their own style work incredibly. But yes, Nadal does have a more defensive approach, which relies on him making as few mistakes as possible. It‚Äôs really phenomenal though how he maintains the level of power and consistency with a constant top spin game.

ETA

Fun fact: Nadal‚Äôs phenomenal ability to hit so many ‚Äúbananas‚Äù is a result of his percentage play. Because he usually looks to clear the net more, he doesn‚Äôt catch the net-tape like most players do while hitting their forehands down the line. His higher margin of error comes into play here. And of course, it‚Äôs this top spin that he imparts on the ball that allows the ball to curve round the outside of the line to finally drop into it. He is not hitting a different forehand, but his forehand is just so well suited to hit this shot!

Look at the net clearance. Look at the curve. Look at the shot.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qdzi65jwoehfc3n7', 'title': 'Why do some people say that Rafael Nadal‚Äôs tennis style of play is defensive?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'One of the beauties of Rafa‚Äôs game is his ‚Äúpercentage play‚Äù.\n\nWhat is percentage tennis?\n\nIt is safe tennis.

You don‚Äôt hit flat shots which have a high risk factor of either going into the net or sailing wide. You don‚Äôt look to clear the net by simply a few inches. You play to clear the net by a good few feet. To do that, you have to usually hit constant top spin shots. They sail up above the net, but also come falling down fast after that reach the high point. This either adds depth to a shot, or simply makes the ball bounce high if it lands short. In either scenario, the trajectory of the ball is difficult to tackle, especially because it is not the usual way the ball comes back to a player.\n\nNeedless to say, this is not an aggressive brand of tennis. Aggressive players usually hit flatter, faster shots and volley more. Federer is a good example. Federer is an extremely aggressive player. Nadal‚Äôs style is aggressive too, but not as aggressive. His focus is more on extracting mistakes and using bounce to displace his opponents (who often move further back to get the shot on a hittable level), and when he gets an open court, he can easily slam a winner.\n\nNadal also consistently stands far behind the basline when receiving serve. It‚Äôs obviously a much more defensive position, from where he takes a couple shots to come up to the baseline. If you look at Federer, he usually stands right around the baseline while returning serve.\n\nLook at this difference in their receiving positions. It‚Äôs a classic aggressive/defensive contrast.\n\nLastly, if you look at Federer‚Äôs matches - most times, he outhits his opponents on winners. And even when he loses, it‚Äôs because he lands up with more errors. In contrast, Nadal may or may not have more winners, but he usually does far better in terms of unforced errors and that‚Äôs where he makes the difference count.\n\nBoth these approaches to playing the game have their own merits.

Matt Zietsman,Updated Jan 27,Who is the unluckiest player in the history of sport?,"Monica Seles

She was born in 1973 and before turning 20, Seles had racked up 8 Grand Slam Singles titles and 3 year-end final titles. Also keep in mind that:

This achievement took place during the Steffi Graf era - a player currently considered as one of the greatest, if not the greatest tennis player of all time.
No other player (male or female) has ever been able to win more than 6 Gland Slam titles before the age of 20 (which happened to be Steffi Graf after winning the only Calender Golden Slam in History in 1988)

In 1990, at the age of 16, Seles became the youngest ever French Open Champion and less than a year later she was ranked as the world number 1.

By the start of 1993, Seles had cemented herself as the top women's tennis player and heading into the season, she had won the French Open for three consecutive years and both the US Open and Australian Open in consecutive years (again worth remembering... she was still in her teens and had turned 19 just a few months earlier)

Then on April 30, G√ºnter Parche, an obsessed fan of Graf ran onto the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a knife between her shoulder blades. She was quickly rushed to a hospital and did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years.

When she finally returned to tennis a couple of years later. Seles managed to add one more Grand Slam to her tally but she was never the same.

So my questions now are?

How often is Seles mentioned during discussions about being the GOAT (‚ÄúGreatest of all time‚Äù)? Very rarely I‚Äôd say..
and how may things have been different if that teenager with 8 Grand Slam titles under her belt did not get stabbed on that awful day?

I‚Äôve compiled the below table just to illustrate how astounding Seles‚Äô achievements were when compared to those names we usually hear during discussions of the ‚ÄúGreatest of All Time‚Äù.

Lon Shapiro,5y,What does a tennis coach who is a former player know that he didn‚Äôt when he was a player? I‚Äôm referring to coaches like Stepanek (Djoko) and Ljubicic (Federer) but also many others. They weren‚Äôt great champions but are training legends. Why?,"Thanks for the A2A.

First, allow me a quick rant.

The statement ‚Äúthose who can do, and those who can‚Äôt teach‚Äù is one of the most misunderstood and often idiotic statements of all time.

Ivan Ljubicic was as high as #3 in the world, helped win Croatia the 2005 Davis Cup, won 10 titles, and beat the following world #1 players: Federer (x3), Nadal (x2), Djokovic (x2), Murray (x3), Safin (x2), Agassi (x2), Kafelnikov (x3), and Roddick (x4). He earned over $10 million in his career, and had one of the best backhands of all time.

It‚Äôs ridiculous not to acknowledge how amazing this guy was as a player. The only thing he didn‚Äôt do was win big at the Grand Slam level, mostly due to his relative lack of mobility.

Radek Stepanek was ranked as high as #8 in singles, winning 5 titles, and #4 in doubles winning multiple titles including the Australian Open and the US Open. He also had wins over Federer, Murray, Del Potro, Safin, Roddick, Nalbandian, and Davydenko. He earned over $11 million in his career and was one of the few serve and volleyers who succeeded during the modern era‚Äôs change to uniform court surfaces. If he had played in the 80s or early 90s, he might have had a shot at winning Wimbledon. He suffered from a chronic neck injury that caused him to miss six months just as he hit his highest singles ranking.

So, when you dismiss incredible players like Ljubicic and Stepanik as not being great champions, you are basically saying that only players who win Grand Slams and reach #1 in the rankings can be considered as ‚Äúthose who can.‚Äù

Now, on to the question ‚Äúwhat does a tennis coach who is a former player know that he didn‚Äôt when he was a player?‚Äù

There are three parts to this answer, and only one of them has anything to do with knowledge of the game. They have to do with the maturation process that players go through as they get older and what it takes to become a great coach, which has almost nothing to do with being a former Grand Slam winner.

First, as players mature, have a family and eventually retire, they start to become aware that they are not the center of the universe. It is almost impossible for an elite athlete not to be totally focused on themselves and their sport on a 24/7 basis.

Look at Murray and Djokovic. Once they got married and had kids, their focus went to other things. This happens to every player at every level.

Except Roger Federer, who is a freak of nature. His ability to continue to play at his level while helping to raise two sets of twins is miraculous. He even got injured running a bath for his daughters.

Who‚Äôs the other guy who‚Äôs still playing unbelievably well? You guessed it, Rafael Nadal, the bachelor.

As a player stops focusing only on themselves, their awareness of others grows, and possibly characteristics like empathy and compassion ofthen develop. Without those two characteristics, a great player can‚Äôt be a great coach, because they won‚Äôt have the patience or provide the emotional support to help their student get through the toughest hurdles.

In fact, people who have suffered the most to achieve some level of success, but were prevented from reaching the very top (due to injury, fewer physical blessings, or the slightest lack of confidence or concentration) are the most tuned into what is needed to become the best.

The second aspect of being a great coach is their ability to build trust, bond with and provide emotional support for their client. In some cases, being a former top pro allows them to build camaraderie with their client. In some cases, it is a parent. But however this bond gets built, it usually requires a top coach to travel with the player on a year round basis. And not everyone wants to do that.

Lendl started coaching Murray, and helped the Scot to his greatest achievements. But he just didn‚Äôt want to travel on the circuit all the time, so he stopped after a couple of years.

At different times in a player‚Äôs career they will need a different type of support. When Lendl coached Murray, the dour faced Czech was probably strong on tactic and strategy, but not a font of emotional support.

After they split up, and Murray went through some injuries, requiring a lot of patience and caring, he found that by hiring Amelie Mauresmo, which was a huge shock as she became the first woman to coach a top male player.

Finally, former Grand Slam level players like Ljubicic, Stepanek and Lendl may give them a slightly better understanding of how potential opponents think and how they react under different kinds of pressure.

In the same way that a singer with a range of three octaves can imagine writing a melody using their vocal range, a player who has played at the highest level may see patterns or ways to exploit an opponent that lower ranked players may not understand.

I‚Äôm not saying this is the only way a coach can be successful. Nadal‚Äôs uncle was a professional soccer player, and he still figured out enough about tennis to help Rafa become one of the greatest players of all time.

But rest assured that someone who is used to the fame and pressure of playing at at a professional level will have more insights than a person who was never involved in a sport at an elite level.

Think about all the great basketball coaches who didn‚Äôt make it to the NBA. They were still playing college ball, and trying to make up for their lack of height or quickness by knowing the game and anticipating situations. It wasn‚Äôt like their basketball career ended in middle school or on a recreation league at a ...

Nathan Stanish,1y,Did Roger Federer ever lose at Wimbledon during his prime?,"Best example? The 2008 Wimbledon final.

There‚Äôs a reason this match is widely considered the greatest match in the history of tennis. Federer was in ridiculous shape, he was riding a 65-match winning streak on grass, had just won his last grass tournament without dropping a set or a service game, and had won the last 5 Wimbledon's (personally dispatching Nadal in the last 2). He was 27-years-old and already lauded as the king of grass.

Nadal, by contrast, was 22-years-old, had clawed his way to his first grass court title as a warm-up to Wimbledon, and had never won a grass court match against Federer.

But right from the get-go, Nadal was incredible. He took the first two sets 6‚Äì4 6‚Äì4, absolutely dazzling on court with sheer athleticism. Federer took the hint and upped his game, clawing his way back into the game for a tiebreaker in the 3rd set that he won 7‚Äì5. Some players would have buckled under the pressure, Federer refused. The fourth set was even crazier, Nadal blasted to a 5‚Äì2 lead and Federer, unperturbed, saved multiple championship points to win another tiebreaker, this time 10‚Äì8.

Then came the 5th set. Both players were dialed in, both players knew everything was on the line, and both players fought tooth-and-nail for every point. It wasn‚Äôt until the 15th game of the set that Nadal broke Federer‚Äôs serve and held for the win.

Some believe that was the beginning of the end for Federer. I disagree. He still won the US Open that year, won the 2009 French Open for the first (and only) time, and took back Wimbledon in Nadal‚Äôs absent. Federer may have lost his Wimbledon streak, but he never lost his grass court crown.

Djokovic did not beat Federer at Wimbledon until Federer was 33 and slowing down. In my opinion, only Nadal beat Federer in his prime at Wimbledon.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/n6lfk2wpsqet9y8v', 'title': 'Did Roger Federer ever lose at Wimbledon during his prime?', 'score': {'original': 0.9976, 'ai': 0.0024}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Best example?

Obada Barry,Updated 10y,What is Roger Federer like in real life?,"I know my answer to this question is kind of late, but I will throw in my own experience.

I met Roger Federer in February 2011 during the Dubai Tennis Tournament.
At the time, I was a member of the Aviation Club, the same place that hosts the tournament. One of the nice perks of being a member is that we share the lockers with the players during the tournament. We get to see them train in the gym. The tennis courts are covered during the tournament to give the players some privacy. I still managed to see Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic practice a couple of times.


So what is Roger Federer like in real life?

First of all, he is tall! Really tall! I am 175 cm, and yet Roger Federer felt like a giant next to me. Maybe it is the celebrity thing, I am not sure. All I can say that this man in reality is bigger than what he looks like on TV.
He did not feel intimidating though, and he did not look down at any one around him.

Roger would come into the lockers each day, take off his Rolex, and take a shower. His trainer would accompany him regularly. Roger seemed happy, calm and focused most of the time.

Every once in awhile, a guy will come in with his kid and ask for an autograph and a photo with Roger, to which Roger happily agrees.
There was this French family one day who spoke with Roger for an extended period, and although Roger‚Äôs time was very valuable, the talk seemed to be very positive.

Generally, things were going very well‚Ä¶ until the final vs Djokovic!

Roger lost that game 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3, and it was the first time I saw Roger in this way. Obviously, losing a final is not exactly fun, and you could clearly see this on Roger‚Äôs face! He managed to take a very quick shower, pack his stuff and leave, while Djokovic remained until midnight celebrating in the Rainbow Room as I recall.

The most interesting thing was that some fan got into the locker with his son, and Roger agreed to take a picture with the guy and his son, sign an autograph, and have small talk with total strangers. All of this is after losing a final! I thought that was something else!

I think Roger Federer is an awesome person. He is nice, calm and humble. If you see him on the street one day, I am sure he‚Äôll be more than happy to take a picture with you.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2n1dl7ks0ie4f6bg', 'title': 'What is Roger Federer like in real life?', 'score': {'original': 0.8982, 'ai': 0.1018}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I know my answer to this question is kind of late, but I will throw in my own experience.\n\nI met Roger Federer in February 2011 during the Dubai Tennis Tournament.\nAt the time, I was a member of the Aviation Club, the same place that hosts the tournament.

Katelyn Rose Villacres,Updated 5y,What is it like to be a ballboy or ballgirl at the US Open?,"It truly is an experience like no other. As a ballperson (they no longer officially use the term ‚Äúballboy,‚Äù since adults are also considered for the position), there are quite a few perks to being a part of the job.

Let‚Äôs start with obtaining the job in the first place:

In order to earn the title of ‚ÄúUS Open Ballperson,‚Äù you must attend tryouts to be considered for the position. You must have good hand-eye coordination, amazing stamina, the ability to sprint if and when necessary, a sense of urgency, at least a basic understanding of tennis scoring, and the ability to roll and catch a ball.
Once you make it past the first stage of tryouts, you must attend callbacks. You will receive a specific date and time to attend this session, and, similar to tryouts, you must perform well for consideration. My friend and I both made it to the callback stage and she was cut from the crowd. You need to exhibit the same qualities that you possessed at tryouts, but show that you understand your responsibilities as a ballperson.
Once you get the job, there is a massive number of paperwork you need to fill out. Most of the documents are provided online, but I assume that filling out paperwork applies to any job. In addition, you will need to receive a credential from the US Open in order to attend any sessions. This year, there was a week specifically designed to receive your credential early, and I was one of the first rookies to take advantage of the opportunity.
There are multiple training sessions that you must attend. For rookies, you must attend at least four training sessions. I attended six in order to understand the position better. It might just be me, but I truly did enjoy these sessions. Then, there will be one mandatory session a few days prior to the start of the US Open. On this day, you get your paycheck (yes, you get paid for training), your call time for your first day, and your uniform.

Now, let‚Äôs get into life once you‚Äôve officially become a ballperson:

You‚Äôre a walking advertisement for Polo and Ralph Lauren. And we all know how their products aren‚Äôt exactly cheap‚Ä¶ And as a result, you get uniforms like this:

(The shoes are the best part, though I must warn you that they aren‚Äôt very comfortable)

These uniforms are simply cute and professional while simultaneously providing comfortable material for strenuous activities.

In total, you get a pair of white shoes, two pairs of socks, two skorts (or shorts for boys and men), two shirts, and either a hat or visor. And, if you get lucky like myself, you might also obtain two wristbands. This year, most rookies didn‚Äôt get their wristbands because they ran out of stock halfway through uniform distribution. I, however, did.

The total uniform has a value around $500, all for free.

UPDATE: I‚Äôm not sure about previous years, but this year they gave jackets and sweatpants to ballpeople who show commitment and stay for the entire event.

The jackets cost about $300, while the sweatpants cost $150.

Did I mention that the uniform was cute?

And free?

You get to work alongside some amazing tennis players, although it does depend on how good of a ballperson you are and how long you‚Äôve worked there for. As a rookie, I don‚Äôt expect to work a Federer match simply due to my lack of experience. Oh, well! Maybe next year. (Update: I may have exaggerated a bit in terms of my skill. If you tuned in to the women‚Äôs semifinals, I made it to Arthur Ashe for the Serena Williams vs. Anastasija Sevastova match.)
The staff can be strict at times, but they‚Äôre also compassionate and understanding. This year, the US Open switched from throwing to rolling, and it was a shock for the veterans. However, the ballperson staff has ensured that the change was implemented smoothly (though, for some reason I still have trouble rolling a ball smoothly).
Although the job is minimum wage, you get a credential with $25 loaded onto it daily. You can go to any location in the site for food and simply scan your credential. Therefore, instead of simply earning $13 an hour, you can add the daily amount of $25 to that total solely for food.
There are two positions as a ballperson: the net and the back. The net is in charge of collecting any balls that hit the net and servicing the player during changeovers. The back is in charge of servicing players the balls after every point, providing towels, and holding up the umbrella for them. In short, the ballpeople are there to facilitate the match and to ensure that the players are being treated well.
As implied, being a ballperson is no easy task. It requires an immense amount of discipline, attention, passion and athleticism. You also need to understand tennis well and how tennis is scored. Without these skills, you likely won‚Äôt make it past callbacks.

Overall, it truly is a job that I‚Äôm glad I managed to get. The tryout process is strenuous and tiring; my friend was cut at the callback stage despite knowing more about tennis than I did. However, once you get the job, the experience is truly worth it. If you are considering trying out to be a US Open ballperson, I would highly recommend it.

EDIT (8/25/18): Wow, this is the first answer I‚Äôve written on Quora that has gotten immense feedback! Thanks for the positive comments and upvotes; I‚Äôm glad you all enjoyed my answer! I also decided to add some points that I missed when writing this answer for the first time.

~~~~~~~

EDIT (8/31/18): Two thousand upvotes??? That‚Äôs incredible! Thanks for the positive response to everyone who sees this! I guess I should post a little update for you guys: I‚Äôm good enough at my job, because I‚Äôve been upgraded to a swing, and I had the opportunity to work during the Venus vs. Giorgi match a few days ago.

As a ballperson (they no longer officially use the term ‚Äúballboy,‚Äù since adults are also considered for the position), there are quite a few perks to being a part of the job.\n\nLet‚Äôs start with obtaining the job in the first place:\n\nIn order to earn the title of ‚ÄúUS Open Ballperson,‚Äù you must attend tryouts to be considered for the position. You must have good hand-eye coordination, amazing stamina, the ability to sprint if and when necessary, a sense of urgency, at least a basic understanding of tennis scoring, and the ability to roll and catch a ball.\nOnce you make it past the first stage of tryouts, you must attend callbacks. You will receive a specific date and time to attend this session, and, similar to tryouts, you must perform well for consideration. My friend and I both made it to the callback stage and she was cut from the crowd. You need to exhibit the same qualities that you possessed at tryouts, but show that you understand your responsibilities as a ballperson.\nOnce you get the job, there is a massive number of paperwork you need to fill out. Most of the documents are provided online, but I assume that filling out paperwork applies to any job. In addition, you will need to receive a credential from the US Open in order to attend any sessions. This year, there was a week specifically designed to receive your credential early, and I was one of the first rookies to take advantage of the opportunity.\nThere are multiple training sessions that you must attend. For rookies, you must attend at least four training sessions. I attended six in order to understand the position better. It might just be me, but I truly did enjoy these sessions. Then, there will be one mandatory session a few days prior to the start of the US Open.

Daniel Drummond,5y,Should tennis umpire Carlos Ramos be temporarily suspended from working Grand Slam events after the debacle at this year's U.S. Open?,"Quite the opposite - he should be praised by anyone who loves the sport, and encouraged to train new officials.

Serena Williams is a superstar in tennis. That‚Äôs not only praise for her skill and experience, but also a focus for the real problem. The problem is superstars who expect to get away with bad behavior, just because they are popular and successful. Carlos Ramos is a veteran official who has worked many important tournaments, including Wimbledon and the French Open for women‚Äôs tennis.

Serena Williams chose to behave in a grossly unprofessional manner, and brought the consequences on herself.

It is Serena Williams who owes an apology to umpire Carlos Ramos

Keep in mind that Mr. Ramos did not lose his temper and punish Ms. Williams. What happened was that Serena‚Äôs coach was signaling her from the stands, and Mr. Ramos followed the rules correctly for the code violation - Serena‚Äô s coach even admitted to the media that he got caught coaching Serena. Serena‚Äôs reaction was defiant and well out of line:

‚ÄúThis is unbelievable. Every time I play here I have problems.

'I didn't get coaching, I didn't get coaching. I didn't get coaching. You need to make an announcement that I didn't get coaching. I don't cheat, I didn't get coaching. How can you say that?

'You owe me an apology. You owe me an apology. I have never cheated in my life. I have a daughter and I stand for what is right for her and I've never cheated. You owe me an apology.‚Äù

FULL TRANSCRIPT: Serena Williams' entire outburst in US Open final

Remember that at this point Ms. Williams has only received a warning, nothing else. And we know from her coach that Williams, perhaps accidentally, broke that rule. Demanding the official not only reverse the call but apologize is out of bounds for an athlete. And blowing up like that over a warning only highlights how badly Ms. Williams over-reacted.

Later, Ms. Williams lost her temper and destroyed her racket, for which she received a point penalty, which again is completely by the rules:

There is no way any sane person can blame anyone but Serena Williams for that action. That is 100% on Ms. Williams.

But rather than take a moment to get her temper under control, Ms. Williams decided to blame the official, Mr. Ramos:

‚ÄùYou will never, ever, ever be on another court of mine as long as you live. You are the liar. When are you going to give me my apology? You owe me an apology.

'Say it, say you're sorry. Then don't talk to me, don't talk to me. How dare you insinuate I was cheating? You stole a point from me. You're a thief too.'‚Äù

FULL TRANSCRIPT: Serena Williams' entire outburst in US Open final

Take a good look at that. Ms. Williams is not only falsely blaming Mr. Ramos for her own violation of the rules, she is threatening him (promising he won‚Äôt be able to officiate any matches where she plays) and no-doubt bullying.

In football, baseball, or basketball, an athlete behaving that way would get a big fine and a suspension. And under the tennis rules, it absolutely constitutes verbal abuse. Here is what the rule says regarding verbal abuse of an official:

(i) Players shall not at any time directly or indirectly verbally abuse an official, opponent, sponsor, spectator or any other person within the precincts of the tournament site. Verbal abuse is defined as any statement about an official, opponent, sponsor, spectator or any other person that implies dishonesty or is derogatory, insulting or otherwise abusive.

ii) Violation of this section shall subject a player to a fine up to $20,000 for each violation. In addition, if such violation occurs during a (m)atch, the player shall be penalized in accordance with the Point Penalty Schedule.

~ ATP Rulebook 2017[4] (bold added)

Note also that Mr. Ramos is not given the discretion to simply warn Ms. Williams: the rule specifically says ‚Äú the player shall be penalized in accordance with the Point Penalty Schedule‚Äù, and following the two previous code violations, that unavoidably means a game penalty.

Rather than realize she had brought this on herself, and stop the damage done at that point, nor stop and realize that she owed Ramos an apology for her outbursts, Ms. Williams went nuclear:

'Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Because I said you were a thief? You stole a point from me. I'm not a cheater. I told you to apologise to me. Excuse me I need the referee, I don't agree with that.‚Äù

FULL TRANSCRIPT: Serena Williams' entire outburst in US Open final

And when the tournament officials explained that the decision was fair and appropriate, Williams decided to blame her poor behavior on sexism:

‚ÄúThis is not right... [INAUDIBLE]... He said I was being coached but I was not being coached. That's not right. You know me. You know my character. This is not fair. This has happened to me too many times. This is not fair. To lose a game for saying that is not fair. Do you know how many men do things that are much worse than that? This is not fair.

'There are a lot of men out here that have said a lot of things and because they are a man it doesn't matter. This is unbelievable. No I don't know the risk because if I say a simple thing, a thief, because he stole a point from me.

'There are men out here that do a lot worse and because I'm a woman you're going to take this away from me. That is not right. And you know it and I know you can't admit it, but I know you know that is not right. I know you can't change it but I'm just saying that is not right.‚Äù

FULL TRANSCRIPT: Serena Williams' entire outburst in US Open final

Regarding the sexism claim by Ms, Williams, Kelichi Asika (in an answer to a similar question) observed that the claim is laughable:

‚Äúin all the four Grand Slams this year there were a total of 128 code violations given for reasons such as racket/equipment abuse, coaching, time violation, unsportsmanlike conduct etc. 85 (66.41%) of those violations were given to men and 43 (33.59%) of them were given to women.

In this year‚Äôs US Open:

In the women‚Äôs singles tournament there were 11 fines in a total of 297 sets (0.037 per set).
In contrast, in the men‚Äôs singles tournament there were 16 fines in 460 sets (0.034 per set).‚Äù

Was the game penalty handed to Serena Williams in the 2018 US Open Final reasonable?

It should also be understood that Ms. Williams has anger management issues which have shown up in past tournament conditions:

Serena Williams also has a history of very bad behavior during tournament play.

US Open 2009: Serena Williams loses to Kim Clijsters after 'foul-mouthed' outburst

US Open 2011: Sam Stosur lifts crown after Serena Williams rants at umpire in women's final

It‚Äôs up to the officials whether further discipline is appropriate for Ms. Williams, but I‚Äôd like to address the damage done by such bullies to officials. Mr. Ramos is neither rich nor famous, he‚Äôs just a person who loves the sport enough to endure abuse from bullies in order to protect the sport‚Äôs integrity. What bothers me, however, is that high-profile athletes hurt the sport by pushing for a double standard - rules which are applied only to the ‚Äòlittle people‚Äô. Never forget that Ms. Williams did not lose to a wall, but to a talented newcomer Naomi Osaka. Ms. Williams essentially wanted the officials to help her win the tournament, and that is unconscionable behavior. Apart from the code violations, the bullying by established players for unethical advantage is one of the things against which good officials must fight. Safety, sportsmanship and fair play are the ideals which all officials must put above any other concern, but it‚Äôs very difficult for an official to endure harassment in public from famous and egotistical bullies. Serena Williams demanding an official ignore the rules is the same as Bryce Harper (of the Washington Nationals* MLB team) demanding umpires only call a strike zone he likes, or Ndamukong Suh (of the Detroit Lions NFL team) demanding officials ignore his brutal violence against other players. It takes guts for an official to penalize a popular player who goes out of bounds, and it‚Äôs the responsibility of everyone who believes in the integrity of the sport to support good officials.

This is not fair.\n\n'There are a lot of men out here that have said a lot of things and because they are a man it doesn't matter. This is unbelievable. No I don't know the risk because if I say a simple thing, a thief, because he stole a point from me.\n\n'There are men out here that do a lot worse and because I'm a woman you're going to take this away from me. That is not right. And you know it and I know you can't admit it, but I know you know that is not right. I know you can't change it but I'm just saying that is not right.‚Äù\n\nFULL TRANSCRIPT: Serena Williams' entire outburst in US Open final\n\nRegarding the sexism claim by Ms, Williams, Kelichi Asika (in an answer to a similar question) observed that the claim is laughable:\n\n‚Äúin all the four Grand Slams this year there were a total of 128 code violations given for reasons such as racket/equipment abuse, coaching, time violation, unsportsmanlike conduct etc. 85 (66.41%) of those violations were given to men and 43 (33.59%) of them were given to women.\n\nIn this year‚Äôs US Open:\n\nIn the women‚Äôs singles tournament there were 11 fines in a total of 297 sets (0.037 per set).\nIn contrast, in the men‚Äôs singles tournament there were 16 fines in 460 sets (0.034 per set).‚Äù\n\nWas the game penalty handed to Serena Williams in the 2018 US Open Final reasonable?\n\nIt should also be understood that Ms. Williams has anger management issues which have shown up in past tournament conditions:\n\nSerena Williams also has a history of very bad behavior during tournament play.\n\nUS Open 2009: Serena Williams loses to Kim Clijsters after 'foul-mouthed' outburst\n\nUS Open 2011: Sam Stosur lifts crown after Serena Williams rants at umpire in women's final\n\nIt‚Äôs up to the officials whether further discipline is appropriate for Ms. Williams, but I‚Äôd like to address the damage done by such bullies to officials. Mr. Ramos is neither rich nor famous, he‚Äôs just a person who loves the sport enough to endure abuse from bullies in order to protect the sport‚Äôs integrity. What bothers me, however, is that high-profile athletes hurt the sport by pushing for a double standard - rules which are applied only to the ‚Äòlittle people‚Äô. Never forget that Ms. Williams did not lose to a wall, but to a talented newcomer Naomi Osaka. Ms. Williams essentially wanted the officials to help her win the tournament, and that is unconscionable behavior. Apart from the code violations, the bullying by established players for unethical advantage is one of the things against which good officials must fight. Safety, sportsmanship and fair play are the ideals which all officials must put above any other concern, but it‚Äôs very difficult for an official to endure harassment in public from famous and egotistical bullies. Serena Williams demanding an official ignore the rules is the same as Bryce Harper (of the Washington Nationals* MLB team) demanding umpires only call a strike zone he likes, or Ndamukong Suh (of the Detroit Lions NFL team) demanding officials ignore his brutal violence against other players. It takes guts for an official to penalize a popular player who goes out of bounds, and it‚Äôs the responsibility of everyone who believes in the integrity of the sport to support good officials.\n\n(*team corrected, Evan Joz caught the mistake)"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.987066667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pete Wong,Updated 6y,Why is Roger Federer so popular?,"On court:

After decades of players with bad behaviors, i.e. Connors, McEnroe, NƒÉstase, etc it was refreshing to finally see someone displayed toughness without loudness or my gosh rudeness. Quiet determination, and he has gotten quieter as he mature.
Roger seems to genuinely enjoy the game, not just the competition. He pursues excellence by behaving like an engineer in search of last bit of extra efficiency, and he seems to enjoy that process.

Roger‚Äôs approach to tennis was like Nikki Lauda‚Äôs approach to driving, winning by understanding the game. At age 34, he modified his backhand, at 32, he modified his net game.
Being an all court player, he displays a wide variety of shots, which made watching him more fun.
Apparently graceful even in defeat, if he was bitter with Nadal, Roger has done a great job hiding it. Gentlemen‚Äôs sport, remember?

Off court:

Seems to get along well with his rivalries, not only Nadal, but Nadal‚Äôs family reportedly enjoy Roger‚Äôs company.
Always seems to have a smile ready, and seemingly enjoy the media, he approaches media in a humble and low key ways, and rarely, if ever, put his foot in his mouth. Even his jokes, although not always funny, but always appeared to be good-natured.
No enemy, and good at staying out of controversy or trouble.
Happy family man popping out babies in regular intervals. Not an actress/model chaser, do not trade in for something skinnier ever few years.

SO, a good-natured family man that enjoys and excels at doing what he does. An apex competitor that has no apparent enemy on or off the court. For an increasingly aging first world audiences, an old man owning generations of younger players.

Jeffrey Lee,6y,How did Rafael Nadal gain so much popularity?,"The main reason why Rafael Nadal is popular is because he challenged Federer in a time where everyone though Fed was invincible. An added bonus was that both were, and still are, extremely respectful to each other. But that‚Äôs the slightly boring reason everybody knows already. Here‚Äôs the fun part:

Nadal is popular because he is a model player, relatable, and his style of play is scintillating to watch.

In his autobiography, ‚ÄúRafa‚Äù, Nadal recounts his uncle forcing him to tend to the clay courts he played on, as well as absolutely forbid him to smash his racket. Viewers have watched and noted throughout the years his odd yet good behavior of never breaking a racket out of rage, something even the usually emotionless Federer has done in the past. Nadal also shows the utmost respect to other players, often calling Federer ‚Äúthe perfect player‚Äù. Of course, it helps that Nadal is VERY attractive and has huge muscles. ;)

In addition, Nadal is relatable. Much like Stan the Man Wawrinka, who is described as ‚Äúworkman-like‚Äù, Nadal does many of the things that regular people do. He doesn‚Äôt have a private jet; he flies commercial instead. In his autobiography, he recounted one of the times he struggled to fit his trophy in one of the overhead compartments of the plane. During the Olympics, to the amazement of his fellow players, he washed his own clothes. In addition, he, much like a majority of tennis, has become tired of reporters asking him about his ‚Äúbromance‚Äù with Federer. In one interview, he even sarcastically replied something to the effect of ‚ÄúOh yes, I love him and I want to kiss him‚Äù to roaring laughter.

Last but not least, Nadal‚Äôs style of play is ridiculously fun to watch. Everyone loves a player who can chase down balls consistently and hit winners from anywhere on the court. Many times, the opponent will have driven Nadal off the court and hit a shot that would have been a clear winner to any other opponent, but WHAM! Nadal obliterates the ball back, leaving the opponent unable to do anything but trudge back to the baseline. Add in dropshots, slices, and tweeners, and you get a complete player who everyone wants to watch.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0tnlo75k3hdfwvmx', 'title': 'How did Rafael Nadal gain so much popularity?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The main reason why Rafael Nadal is popular is because he challenged Federer in a time where everyone though Fed was invincible.

Pranav Mukund Vinchurkar,Updated 9y,Why does a player get three or four tennis balls from ball boys and choose two among them for serve?  What is that they look for in selecting the balls to serve?,"First of all I will answer how actually tennis ball works. It has compressed air inside it that is under high pressure which makes the ball tough and on the outer side is fur.


The amount pressure inside the ball is responsible for its bounce and height of that bounce. With time the pressure inside reduces and hence new balls are taken many times during matches.
The fur outside the ball is reason for its different speed after bounce. Obviously cause of friction.With time the furr also gets eroded due to friction.


Now most tennis players like me learn all this through practice and not through physics, but these are the questions a player solves while selecting the ball in their mind:


What shots the opponent cant play well? If he can play the bounce well and ground badly then player chooses pressure less balls. This makes ball lay low and go fast. Opponent won't be able to play it. Fur in this case doesn't matter but generally more fur is preferred cause the ball goes fast with it on hard surfaces. The ball kind-of slides because of the fur.
What shots can we play well? If we are extremely good at top spin (top spin is when the ball goes with a certain projectile and spins or bounces more, this happens cause you Roll the ball) then we choose hard ball with more pressure so that it will bounce well and move fast. If we play flat then we can choose any ball with fur cause we don't care about the bounce. Fur will make it go faster and for flat players, faster the better.
What court are we playing on?


This is really important cause we always want ball to travel fast. So the court will decide the amount of fur on the ball.

These all basic points are taken into consideration while serving and choosing the right ball to win.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lzfj3hxtg0b9cp86', 'title': 'Why does a player get three or four tennis balls from ball boys and choose two among them for serve?

Hardik Vijayvargiya,6y,What have you learned from Rafael Nadal?,"Although I belong to the opposite camp and am a huge admirer of Roger Federer, you just can‚Äôt really sit back and not hail a man of the stature of Rafael Nadal. Here are the things that one can learn from Rafael Nadal:

Anyone can reach the top, through hard work and perseverance.

Nadal‚Äôs rise to the top is not only significant because of the man he dethroned (Federer), but also because he never gave up. It is easy to get intimidated by those at the top.

Federer‚Äôs overwhelming dominance was unchallenged and he marched his way through to grand slams after grand slams, burying any competition in the process. Nadal was the cog, between Federer and complete dominance, as he handed him consecutive defeats in 2005 (semis), 2006, 2007 and 2008 finals of the French Open. People will argue that Nadal was the clay sensation, but he did it on grass as well.

After a disappointing defeat in the 2007 Wimbledon Final in a grueling 5 setter, Nadal came back strong and defeated Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, in five of the most epic sets in men‚Äôs tennis history.

Excelling at multiple fronts is possible.

Nadal is the prime example of utter domination in your preferred field and maintaining that level outside. With a jaw-dropping 10 French Open titles, Nadal has undoubtedly established himself as a clay legend. But Nadal also has his name on 2 Wimbledon, 2 US Open and 1 Australian Open titles and a host of other titles on different turfs.

It is easy to go down, but very difficult to pick yourselves up and regain your previous stature.

There have been a number of times that people had deemed Nadal as down and out, but every time he came back stronger. His early exit against Lukas Rosol in the 2012 Wimbledon, brought about an avalanche of setbacks and injuries for the Spaniard and people wrote Nadal off.

But he came back strong in 2014 and defeated Lukas Rosol at the same stage in Wimbledon. After a string of poor performances in 2015 and 2016 mostly due to injuries, it seemed like the end of an era.

But Nadal prevailed, fighting off opponents with injured knees and elbows sometimes and hit back again this year, with the juggernaut facing just one defeat on clay on his way to a 10th French Open, reminding of vintage Nadal in the process.

Always give back something to the society, whenever you can.

Nadal has excelled on the philanthropy front as well and has set up tennis academies across the world to support budding talent in tennis. He has an academy at Anantpur, India as well and pays regular visits to inspire children.

Talent makes you a king, sportsmanship and humble nature make you a legend.

Nadal has always been in the good books of his peers and fans, due to his humble nature and the ability to give appreciation where it is due. Federer vs Nadal is one the most epic rivalries in sports history, but never have the two men spoken ill of each other.

Nadal‚Äôs admiration for Federer and the rest of his peers for that matter, even after facing heart breaking losses against them, make him a legend.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fvz2ndam60s9pc7h', 'title': 'What have you learned from Rafael Nadal?', 'score': {'original': 0.41065, 'ai': 0.58935}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Although I belong to the opposite camp and am a huge admirer of Roger Federer, you just can‚Äôt really sit back and not hail a man of the stature of Rafael Nadal.

Rob Bull,2y,What determines a ball to be out in tennis?,"Tennis uses the Hawk Eye system, very successfully, to determine whether the ball is in or out. As the boundary lines are about the same width as a compressed tennis ball striking the ground, the ball is considered in if any part of it touches any part of the line.

The ball is out if no part of the ball touches the line:

The umpire and linesmen/lineswomen can call a ball out any time they like, but if a player uses Hawk Eye to challenge a decision, then Hawk Eye gets the final say.

Hawk-Eye is built from a network of 10 cameras around the court that capture 60 high-resolution images per second. At least five cameras cover every bounce of the ball.

Players are given unlimited opportunities to challenge a call in each set at Wimbledon.

However, once three incorrect challenges are made, that player can‚Äôt challenge again until the next set.

If the set goes to a tiebreak, an extra challenge is awarded to each player.

It rarely happens, but the umpire can reject a challenge if it is an ‚Äúunreasonable request or... not made in a timely manner‚Äù, according to the International Tennis Federation rules.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/oyl2wt75buce8dij', 'title': 'What determines a ball to be out in tennis?', 'score': {'original': 0.9929, 'ai': 0.0071}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Tennis uses the Hawk Eye system, very successfully, to determine whether the ball is in or out.

Lon Shapiro,Updated 5y,Why didn‚Äôt Federer play his best tennis at the Australian Open 2018?,"Considering that he hadn‚Äôt lost a set until the final, and only had one rough patch of play in his first set against Berdych, maybe we should rephrase the question to ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt Federer play his best tennis in the AO 2018 Final?‚Äù

The short answer is, aside from a serving lapse when he lost he serve twice (and almost three times) in a row when serving at 3‚Äì2 in the fourth, Federer played at a very high level but was forced to adapt his game to the demands placed by his opponent.

Casual fans are probably asking themselves what happened to all the big backhand winners and the forays to the net? The answer is, this final was completely different from last year, where Federer's brilliant play, especially off the backhand return, won him the title.

Taking nothing away from Federer and his incredible achievements, this was a match where Cilic's play determined the outcome. Here are the factors that gave Cilic control of the second and fourth sets and a chance to break serve at the start of the fifth set:

After a poor start, Cilic started taking chances on every shot, and during the second and fourth sets he played the best tennis I've ever seen him play. Unlike his victory in the 2014 US Open semis, Cilic forced Federer into defensive situations from almost the first ball in each rally.
The depth, placement and pace of Cilic's ground strokes (his average backhand was faster than Federer's average forehand) seemed to ignore the laws of physics. He seemed to be playing within one foot of the lines on almost every shot. No matter how well Federer hit a shot, Cilic just hit it back harder. There were a number of long exchanges where Federer was crushing his backhand cross court, and it had absolutely no effect on Cilic. When Federer finally opened up the court by hitting up the line, Cilic not only got there, he hit huge shots in response.
Unlike Nadal, who returns and rallies from far behind the baseline, Cilic is very good at Federer‚Äôs strategy of staying close to the baseline in rallies, and then stepping up into the court when he gets a ball he could attack. This tactic takes time away from your opponent, and with Cilic‚Äôs greater pace, Federer was the one who was under pressure all the time. There were some amazing points where both Federer and Cilic were hitting ground strokes of the half volley at the baseline (one of Federer's most amazing abilities) to maintain control of the point.
Cilic has improved his first and second serve over the last few years. When it was on, he was able to control the points from the first shot on, and Federer was doing everything in his power just to keep the ball in play. During the second and fourth sets, his serve was good enough that Federer missed a couple of shots where he tried to step in and attack the return. I think this made Federer get a little tight, and hope that Cilic would make enough errors to lose the match, instead of Federer winning the match.

To his credit, Federer recognized how well Cilic was playing, so he did everything he could to stay in points in the hope that his opponent would cool off:

He chipped most of his backhand serve returns, taking hardly any chances to rip returns on break points, hoping Cilic would make an error. If the match had stayed close in the fifth, I think Federer would have finally understood that his only hope to win would be to take chances.
He sliced a lot of backhands, trying to make Cilic work to get down on low balls. In the first set, this worked as Cilic made a lot of errors. There was a match stat that showed Federer was hitting slice backhands over 60% of the time. This is much tougher for tall players, and, in the case of Cilic, a means of wearing down an opponent who had played six hours and 400 points more than Federer throughout the tournament. However, when Cilic got hot, he started to punish the slices, and Federer started hitting more topspin backhands (the TV graphic showed that the ratio was 50‚Äì50 in the second set). I don‚Äôt know the ratio of the later sets, but there were so many rallies where each player was trying to outhit the other, I would say it was similar to the second set. As I wrote above, Cilic was covering the court so well and hitting so big, fans underestimated how well Federer was actually hitting the ball. I think a lot of his shots would have been winners or forced weak returns against pretty much any other player.
Federer hit a lot of balls into the middle of the court, to take away angles from Cilic, and also to jam him. Tall players have long arms, so when they run wide for a ball, it allows them to stretch out and hit in total freedom. If you don‚Äôt hit a winner against them, they may hit a winner off your shot. Federer learned this the hard way. After hitting a large number of aces wide of the forehand in the deuce court, Cilic hit a couple of massive cross court winners, which forced Federer to change his serving patterns. In spite of this, Federer hit some gutsy second serves, especially a wide one in the deuce court that came on a break point in the fourth set.

The one thing that kept Federer on top was his fantastic serve. And the reason he won is the difference between Cilic and prime Djokovic in the consistency and depth of their serve returns. Cilic took a few chances and hit some huge winners, but missed or got aced on tons of points. At the 2011 US Open, Federer served 11 aces against Djokovic; at AO18, he hit 24 against Cilic.

On the other hand, Cilic simply couldn‚Äôt keep playing at his other worldly level for five sets. Whether it was a case of getting nervous, finally running out of gas, or the law of probabilities catching up to him, Cilic started missing a lot of first serves and began to make errors in the fifth set. Once Federer got up a break, Cilic's energy level dropped and he made too many errors to stay competitive in the last three games of the match.

Conclusions

Cilic played two sets at the same level as Del Porto‚Äôs 2009 US Open Final. They are very similar in size and style, and at their best are part of a very small group of players who move well enough and have enough power to neutralize Federer‚Äôs forehand and force him to play defense on most of the points. But Federer is so good and so consistent, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to maintain that level of play over an entire match as evidenced by Federer‚Äôs head-to-head record against these great players: 9‚Äì1 vs Cilic; 18‚Äì6 vs Del Potro; and 20‚Äì6 vs Berdych.

NOTES:

Federer‚Äôs path to the title might have also devalued his play in the eyes of casual fans. Last year, he beat three Top Ten players (Nishikori, Wawrinka, Nadal) in five set matches, with an expected quarter final match against then #1 Murray. This year, none of the top seeded players made it far enough to create the same quality matches, so people thought he had an easy draw.

In reality, Federer‚Äôs side of the draw should have been incredibly hard, filled with players who have either beaten Federer, won Slams or are more than ten years younger: Zverev (#4); Thiem (#5); Goffin (#7); Wawrinka (#9); Del Potro (#12); Djokovic (#14); Berdych (#19); and Raonic (#22). 10 of the 16 seeds have won matches against Federer. Aside from Djokovic (22‚Äì23), Alexander Zverev (3‚Äì2), and Thiem (1‚Äì2) who are basically tied with Federer in head-to-head matches, the rest of the field combined to win 22 matches against Federer (22‚Äì115).

Compare that to the top half of the draw. Aside from Nadal, only Tsonga (6‚Äì11), Kyrgios (1‚Äì1) and Isner (2‚Äì5) have even won matches against Fed. He is a combined 41‚Äì0 against the remaining seeds.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cq7w5u8m1ykbsj4z', 'title': 'Why didn‚Äôt Federer play his best tennis at the Australian Open 2018?', 'score': {'original': 0.15033333333333, 'ai': 0.84966666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Considering that he hadn‚Äôt lost a set until the final, and only had one rough patch of play in his first set against Berdych, maybe we should rephrase the question to ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt Federer play his best tennis in the AO 2018 Final?‚Äù\n\nThe short answer is, aside from a serving lapse when he lost he serve twice (and almost three times) in a row when serving at 3‚Äì2 in the fourth, Federer played at a very high level but was forced to adapt his game to the demands placed by his opponent.\n\nCasual fans are probably asking themselves what happened to all the big backhand winners and the forays to the net?

Whether it was a case of getting nervous, finally running out of gas, or the law of probabilities catching up to him, Cilic started missing a lot of first serves and began to make errors in the fifth set. Once Federer got up a break, Cilic's energy level dropped and he made too many errors to stay competitive in the last three games of the match.\n\nConclusions\n\nCilic played two sets at the same level as Del Porto‚Äôs 2009 US Open Final. They are very similar in size and style, and at their best are part of a very small group of players who move well enough and have enough power to neutralize Federer‚Äôs forehand and force him to play defense on most of the points. But Federer is so good and so consistent, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to maintain that level of play over an entire match as evidenced by Federer‚Äôs head-to-head record against these great players: 9‚Äì1 vs Cilic; 18‚Äì6 vs Del Potro; and 20‚Äì6 vs Berdych.\n\nNOTES:\n\nFederer‚Äôs path to the title might have also devalued his play in the eyes of casual fans. Last year, he beat three Top Ten players (Nishikori, Wawrinka, Nadal) in five set matches, with an expected quarter final match against then #1 Murray. This year, none of the top seeded players made it far enough to create the same quality matches, so people thought he had an easy draw.\n\nIn reality, Federer‚Äôs side of the draw should have been incredibly hard, filled with players who have either beaten Federer, won Slams or are more than ten years younger: Zverev (#4); Thiem (#5); Goffin (#7); Wawrinka (#9); Del Potro (#12); Djokovic (#14); Berdych (#19); and Raonic (#22). 10 of the 16 seeds have won matches against Federer. Aside from Djokovic (22‚Äì23), Alexander Zverev (3‚Äì2), and Thiem (1‚Äì2) who are basically tied with Federer in head-to-head matches, the rest of the field combined to win 22 matches against Federer (22‚Äì115).\n\nCompare that to the top half of the draw. Aside from Nadal, only Tsonga (6‚Äì11), Kyrgios (1‚Äì1) and Isner (2‚Äì5) have even won matches against Fed. He is a combined 41‚Äì0 against the remaining seeds."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.150333333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vijay Singh,Updated 8y,What is your favorite tennis moment?,"
For me, this is it. 4th set tie break 2008 Wimbledon final.
To understand the significance of this point one must know little about the Federer-Nadal Rivalry and the build up to this match.

Federer was the reigning champion and almost untouched on grass courts. He won his first Wimbledon in 2003 and was on his way to win sixth one. He was looking strong and hadn't dropped a set on his way to the final.
Nadal won his first French open in 2005 and since then their rivalry has only intensified. Nadal was also showed great promise, reached finals of major events consistently (winning many of them) and had reached his 4th consecutive finals. Previous Wimbledon results when they played each other:
2006 - Fed beat Nadal in 4 sets.
2007 - Fed beat Nadal in 5 sets
2008 - Huge expectations were riding on his game.

Before this match, together they had won 14 of the last 16 slams amongst them. Federer was playing to win 6th Wimbledon title in a row (that Borg missed) and Nadal was playing to become the third man in open era to win French and Wimbledon in the same year (after Borg and Laver). Before the final Federer and Nadal had played 3 times in the year 2008, all three clay court finals which Nadal won. Their head to head was 11-6. But Nadal was thirsty for a victory on grass. Federer stood tall with 65 straight wins on grass courts.

The game started and the unexpected thing happened. Federer lost the first two sets 6-4. Mind you Federer had beaten Nadal before twice in 5 setter games (Wimbledon 07 and Miami 04) and one of them (Miami) was where he came back from 2 sets down. Could he repeat the feat?



The third set began and each held his serve till the rains interrupted at 5-4 Federer leading. This is when Mirka walked upto Federer and said ‚ÄúYOU are Roger Federer‚Äù to invigorate him. Even the ever composed, Toni Nadal chose to have a siesta in the locker room and shake of the anxiety. The match resumed and Federer managed to pull the third set from Nadal 7-6 (5) in the tie break.

The fourth set began and each player held his serve till 6-6. The future of the holy grail of tennis was to be decided on this tie break. It began and after a few points Federer found himself trailing 5-2 with Nadal to serve. If Nadal held his serves Fed was done. But Nadal got nervous and double faulted and put a weak backhand into the net. The score moved to 5-4. Federer also held his two serves; Federer leads 6-5. Federer now had a set point and Nadal had to hold his serves to keep himself alive which he did; score progressed to 7-6 in favour of Nadal. Nadal on match point and Federer holds his serve 7-7 with a great serve followed by mini break (my heart break); 8-7 to Nadal. But this was no ordinary break Nadal had just hit the best pass of the match. Fed was almost sure of winning this point but Nadal is not letting him have his way. He clinches his point out of Federers claws. What this point meant to both was clearly seen on their faces, Federer was almost destroyed and in despair and Nadal had almost felt the trophy.


(Kindly watch the videos)

But the drama was not over it. Federer is Federer and is known for his magic. This was THE moment. He came up with this own stroke of genius and it was most elegantly done. And this pass was my favourite tennis moment. My heart never ran faster and I have never felt more relieved.

Nadal had everything in his favour. He likes to serve from the left side of the court to Federer backhand forcing him out of the court and having the court empty for the winner. He did exactly that. Served on Fed backhand, Fed chipped and he came in another shot into Federer backhand and Nadal was at the nets. Fed had to pass him or else it was all over. If he did he would be in the fifth set with a great 5 setter record and his surging confidence from winning the last two sets would help him in the fifth. Nadal on the contrary could second guess himself for not converting the 3rd and the 4th sets. To raise the stakes, it was set point and match point and Championship point for Nadal. Fed had to pass him, he had to pull the rabbit out of the hat.

And He DID. He pumped in disbelief and clawed his way back to push the match into a fifth set.


This was the greatest match I have seen. Finally the better man won.
""I tried everything,"" said Federer. ""But Rafa's a deserving champion, he's the worst opponent on the best court.""

""I must congratulate Roger,"" Nadal said. ""He's still the No1, he's still the best, and he's won five times here. But now I have won, and that's very important to me.""



This should sum it up:


Hills spokesman Graham Sharpe said: ""What you have here are two players at the peak of their powers and popularity. ""They are almost a tennis soap opera - traditional Federer appeals to the mums and dads with his cardigan, and Nadal is the modern sex symbol, appealing to kids with his sleeveless vests.

He‚Äôs only 19, but he‚Äôs already reached World No.1 (making him the youngest ATP No.1 ever) and won his first Grand Slam, becoming the youngest Grand Slam winner since Nadal in 2005, and the 7th-youngest ever. We‚Äôve had plenty of new players pick up speed over the last few years, like Medvedev, Tsitsipas, and Zverev, but none of them have been this good so early.

Part of the reason other players haven‚Äôt had a chance to shine is because Nadal and Djokovic keep dominating. Alcaraz is one of the few players to give them a run for their money in every match. Look no further than the Madrid Open, where Alcaraz beat Nadal and Djokovic (arguably the two greatest clay court players of all time, especially Nadal) back-to-back on clay. Nobody has ever beaten those two back-to-back on clay. In fact, Alcaraz was the first teenager to ever beat Nadal on clay. That‚Äôs big.

But Alcaraz is more than that, he‚Äôs also an amazing role model in tennis. Rafael Nadal was Alcaraz‚Äô idol growing up, and he strives to demonstrate the same sportsmanship as Nadal in every match. It shows.

Alcaraz never smashes his racket, never attacks his collegues in interviews, and regularly extends grace to his opponents during a match. On multiple occasions, Alcaraz has even replayed points because it was a close call and his opponent was frustrated. Very few players do that.

That‚Äôs the kind of attitude and example the Big 3 set, and it‚Äôs very encouraging to see another tennis star carry it forward. We need more humble, compassionate, earnest players on court who can show their fans what it looks like to lose with grace and win with grace.

Sharing a warm handshake with one of his biggest rivals, Jannik Sinner. Usually, you meet at the net, but Sinner came over to Alcaraz‚Äô side instead.

And in terms of playing style, Alcaraz is also a very complete player.

His athleticism is unbelievable. Like Nadal when he first debuted, Alcaraz has a habit of wearing his opponents down with sheer stamina and speed. He somehow sprints to the ball every point, always stretching for that next return, forcing another mistake from his opponent.
His groundstrokes are top-tier. Alcaraz has impressive strength, especially for only 19, and slams his forehands and backhands to the back of the court forcing his opponents furhter toward the baseline. He has consistency similar to Djokovic‚Äôs, and over time it will only improve.
His shots are very diverse. One of Alcaraz‚Äô favorite moves is his drop shot. He has a well-disguised, light drop shot that often ends a point after his opponents are pushed too far back to get to the net again. Federer liked doing that too.

Overall, I‚Äôm excited for Alcaraz‚Äô career. He‚Äôs got a lot of experience already and certainly enough confidence. Couple that with his playing style, and he should win a lot of Grand Slams before he retires.

And more importantly, he‚Äôs a good role model for players and fans alike.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j67p1k54t3qd9wfg', 'title': ""Is Carlos Alcaraz the future of men's tennis?"", 'score': {'original': 0.26105, 'ai': 0.73895}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes.

Vibhakar T S (‡≤µ‡≤ø‡≤≠‡≤æ‡≤ï‡≤∞‡≥ç ‡≤ü‡≤ø ‡≤é‡≤∏‡≥ç),7mo,What are your thoughts on Carlos Alcaraz's stunning Wimbledon 2023 title win?,"It's a Sport defining moment.

I regard this win as a change of baton from an already legend to a legend in making.

Having seen how Medvedev plays, I was surprised how Carlos humbled him in straight sets in semifinals. It asked me to watch the big final. Even before the match started, I thought this took me back to 15 years, where a similar thing had happened. A young sensation in Nadal was up against an established Federer, who had won 5 consecutive Wimbledon titles till that point. And here Alcaraz was against Djokovic, who hadn't lost a Wimbledon title since 2018 and is a phenom on Grass courts.

The first set lasted for what, just 34 minutes. Djokovic was at his usual best and thrashed the youngster in no time. Many would've felt ‚ÄúIs it going to be another easy final win for Novak?‚Äù at that point. Alcaraz struggled a bit in the first set and in the start of the second set. He needed to turn the things, and turn them quickly.

Slowly Alcaraz started to get into his grooves. He started returning the serves well. And the crowd was literally behind him. Obviously irked Djokovic like always. Novak being Novak gave back to the crowd with his gestures. But with the progression of the game, Djokovic looked lost. He looked tired very soon, which was highly unexpected. And then, Djokovic committed a lot of unforced errors, actually throughout the match from there.

The second set went to the tiebreaker. Djokovic hadn't lost a tiebreaker in his last 9 games. In a thrilling tiebreaker, Alcaraz held his nerve and got the better of Novak. The Serbian looked lost. He is always cheerful when he plays and likes to give it back to the crowd instantly. But for the remainder of the game, he was so silent. It was probably the first time I'd ever seen Novak not being himself.

In the third set, Alcaraz displayed his best form. He just thumped the World no.2. Alcaraz was leading 3‚Äì1 when that incredible game happened. The game lasted for 26 minutes. 13 deuces happened and none liked to give away the game. Eventually, Alcaraz double broke it for a huge cheer from the crowd. For the first time, Djokovic looked under pressure in Wimbledon, in a very long time.

A commentator perfectly remarked the moment and said ‚ÄúNow Djokovic is feeling how it's like to play against himself‚Äù. It was so apt. Alcaraz was on a different level. The most impressive trait from Carlos was his return, which is very strong BTW. His forehand is mighty dangerous and he has terrific speed. He can cover the court very well. He was particularly good with his disguised drop shots.

Garfia claimed the third set. Djokovic took a break of more than 6 and a half minute to rejuvenate himself. A much needed break indeed. He came back and played better. The Spaniard was at his best. But Djokovic displayed his strength and equalised the match by winning the fourth set. It's believed that as the match goes deep, into the fifth set, Djokovic‚Äôs chances of winning increases manifold. But here, Novak was facing himself !

The fifth set was thrilling. The crowd was literally behind the Spaniard. The 20-year-old hit some wonderful aces. His strong serve was too hot to handle for Djokovic. There was also a peculiar problem throughout the game for the Serbian. He missed out too many loosener and struggled to cope with the balls that bounced a bit more.

Alcaraz was so good at hitting the ball in the gaps. His running forehand reminded me how Nadal returns the ball, genuinely. Garfia played some outrageous shot, including the shot of the match where he returned a well placed ball from Novak and produced a more empowered return which had no answer from the 23-Grandslam winner.

Towards the end, Alcaraz looked confident. Very rare for an athlete when against Novak in the fifth set of a match. As Djokovic hit the net, Carlos fell and couldn't believe what he had achieved, very similar to how Nadal celebrated his 2008 Wimbledon win against Federer. Finally, the GOAT was brought down ! Alcaraz won his first ever Wimbledon, at the age of just 20.

The Spaniard has 2 Grandslam titles already at the age of 20, in two different surfaces, despite being injury prone. It was his best game till date. Watching him play confirmed of a greatness. Without a doubt, he's a legend in the making. The World No.1 embraced his coach, who was emotional in the moment and was happy for the youngster.

Novak too‚Äå, was emotional. The crowd which was against him as usual, won the battle against Novak. It was probably a but too much for even a mental freak like Djokovic that he shed tears towards the end of his final speech and thanked the family for being with him.

Will remember this game for a long time.

Alcaraz, you beauty !

On a side note, Alcaraz did what I exactly expected from him.

Nathan Stanish,1y,What made Rafael Nadal a fan favorite?,"When he first came around, Nadal had three big things going for him.

For one, he was young. One of the youngest players on tour, proving himself as one of the toughest players on tour despite only being 17. Fresh new players winning big games at such a young age is a big draw to tennis, as fans love to see a new star.

Nadal was arguably the greatest teenage player in the history of tennis.

But besides his age, Nadal was a warrior.

Every rally, every point, every game, was a battleground and Nadal would never be the one to give up. Unlike Federer, who relied on quick points and winners to clinch his games, Nadal relied on sheer grit and determination. He was fast, strong, and had ridiculous endurance. As long as the point was within reach, he absolutely refused to stop. Fans loved that. It made for exciting rallies and some unbelievable shots.

Still, there was one more characteristic of Nadal‚Äôs play that set him apart. He was a true sportsman.

Nadal never smashed his racket, no matter how frustrated he got. He stayed serious and focused in every game, refusing to let deficits or mistakes ruin his mindset. Sure, he wasn‚Äôt one to applaud his opponent after a good point, but he was also not one to criticize or mock his opponent for any reason. And when the match was over, he shared a handshake and left with his dignity intact, no matter the result.

Fans loved that too. Compared to Federer, who at the time was still a bit of a hot head, Nadal was the sportsmanlike one who always respected his opponents.

Historically, that was unusual for a tennis star. Sure, Stefan Edberg shared that mentality but more famous players like John McEnroe were notorious for tantrums and poor sportsmanship. Nadal helped influence the standard we have now, where all of the Big 3 consistently demonstrate sportsmanship on and off the court.

I first learnt about my school offering the chance to be a ball boy when I was in Year 7, at the tender age of 11. Back then, it was the first year to allow Year 7‚Äôs to join, as before that only Year 9‚Äôs and up were deemed to be up to the task. The first year was very difficult, and this was not helped by the fact that the person who took charge of our vigorous training was an angry Scottish woman who would immediately kick you out if you committed the cardinal sin of rolling twice between serves (when the player has a second serve, any movement out of the corner of their eye could distract them.) This was not a joke - I actually saw it happen on at least one occasion, with the offender (a fellow Year 7) being led off in tears.

The training began in January, in preparation for the tournament in late June, and consisted of 2‚Äì3 hours each week of intensive training, first with the teachers as players, and later on, at a local tennis club. The attrition rate is normally around 50‚Äì60% of people leaving or being kicked and over time, those of us who managed to stick the training found our runs and rolls to be second nature - I still instinctively have to tell myself not to jump to get the ball when it hits the net while watching Wimbledon on the TV!

A further aspect of our training was to learn how to deal with the tricky players. If a player drops a racket, wants chilled or room-temperature water, wants us to hide their towel because the ‚Äúflash of white distracts them‚Äù (I‚Äôm looking at you, Wozniacki) or some other OCD trait, we have to accommodate them as best we can.

Wozniacki at Eastbourne this year - very scary woman.

After the first year of training, I only managed to make it two days into the main tournament before being kicked out. No matter, I was hooked, and couldn‚Äôt wait to be better next years.

The subsequent years of ball crew meant I got progressively better and better at knowing instinctively where and when the balls go at the end of each point, and I found myself more and more able to adapt quickly to a player‚Äôs preference, even in extreme cases like just before this shot was taken:

Me looking very grumpy - I was so embarrassed when my mates pointed this out after the fact.

I can‚Äôt remember the exact circumstances of this, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I had had to run off to re-string one of the player‚Äôs rackets (that is - take it to the racket stringer somewhere in the player‚Äôs building) and by the time I came back, I had no clue whatsoever what was going on so I was just trying to look sensible and cogent.

I can still remember the acute pressure and anticipation I felt when the announcer called my team onto centre court for the first time and 8000 people gave us a round of applause as we ran into position. It was exhilarating!

This past year, I managed to make it onto centre most days, and if not centre, then a ‚Äòshow court‚Äô at least. I was very pleased with my performance, and if this year does turn out to be my last (as I‚Äôve just left secondary school - the school that provides the ballcrew), then I‚Äôm glad I managed to crew on finals day for some of the best players around.

I leave you with a brief recap of what goes through ball boy and girls‚Äô minds on a daily basis while crewing.

Dodgy mum‚Äôs camera quality alert

Is this the end of the game? - ok it‚Äôs going to be even number of games so the balls switch sides, that means next game the players come off. Make sure the crew at the back of the court can get the umbrellas open and that they‚Äôre awake. Also the reserve might need to go off court to get a ball so keep an eye on her behind me. Is this a one-sided game? - it is, so the game will probably go quickly. Also it‚Äôs men playing so mind out for awry aces. When‚Äôs ball change? - ok 3 games away, that means that the players should stay on for ball change unless it‚Äôs a new set which it looks like it might be so bear that in mind. Ah shit the scoreboarder has messed up so I‚Äôll have to keep the score in my head. Also the just keep an eye on the umpire as it looks like it might rain and they‚Äôll have to call off play. Etc etc‚Ä¶

And this is even before I actually go anywhere near a tennis ball.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1fej4y3alwg2bzin', 'title': ""What's it like to work as a ball boy?"", 'score': {'original': 0.50905, 'ai': 0.49095}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I have just recently finished my tenure as a Ball Boy for the Eastbourne International tennis tournament after being part of it for four years running.

RC,Updated 8y,Who is Roger Federer?,"ROGER FEDERER is a Phenomenal Tennis Player, a True Legend. Many commentators and players regard Federer as the greatest tennis player of all 
time..

Federer holds several records of the Open Era
: holding the world No. 1 position
 for 302 weeks (including 237 consecutive weeks
); winning 17 Grand Slam
 singles titles; reaching each Grand Slam final at least five times (an all-time record); and reaching the Wimbledon
 final ten times.

Not only having a high Sportsman Spirit, he is a True Gentleman.
One such incident happened recently.

This incident is from US Open 2015. This time the Swiss ace ended up surprising them on the court but not just by playing.On 3rd September 2015, after his second round victory over Belgium‚Äôs Steve Darcis, Federer was out for practice at Flushing Meadows, only to find the court in a mess with towels and bottles strewn around.

While the other players, expecting the court to be cleaned by the staff left it as it is, Federer here took sportsmanship to a whole new level and helped dispose of the bottles and towels in the bins provided.

Pat Cash,Updated 7y,Tennis: ,"I wrote an answer to a similar question called: What is it like to win Wimbledon?. It's very similar as Wimbledon is a Grand Slam.

What it's like to win a Grand Slam and/or Wimbledon is one of the common question I get asked in interviews. Strangely, it's also one of the worst and most difficult to explain simply.

I think the feeling of achieving the dream you had as a child, the thing you want more than anything, what you've been working towards almost your entire life is near impossible to describe.

There are so many emotions involved that it's very difficult to put into words. However, I suppose the quick and easy way to explain the feeling for me is that it's a combination of tremendous pride and joy. Pride as I achieved the goal that I was aiming for when I was a young kid. Joy because I got to share that moment with my friends, family and coaching staff.

I also consider myself lucky, despite my many injuries, as I had the right attributes to be able to reach my goal. Many people have dreams, goals and ambitions that just don't go together. For instance I love playing guitar but I just don't have the talent or commitment to sound like Eddie Van Halen no matter what I do.

I think anyone can have a similar feeling to what I had when winning a grand slam. It's about finding your true passion and combining that with your natural talents. Honestly listening to yourself and working towards and with something you love.

Also, here is my Wimbledon celebration climb which was quite controversial at the time. I think it says a lot about how I was feeling at the time. It starts around the 10.40 minute mark.

- - - -

Soon I‚Äôll be sharing a more in depth interview I did on winning Wimbledon (I‚Äôll update this post). I also share talks I have with other tennis stars like Sampras, Safin, Emerson, etc., in my newsletter. If you‚Äôre interested consider signing up here

Vibhakar T S (‡≤µ‡≤ø‡≤≠‡≤æ‡≤ï‡≤∞‡≥ç ‡≤ü‡≤ø ‡≤é‡≤∏‡≥ç),2y,"Among Nadal, Federer and Djokovic, who do you believe will have the most grand slams at the end of their careers?","First of all, congrats to Novak Djokovic on winning the 20th grandslam title. Right now, the guy is on a different level.

Earlier in the year, he won the 9th Australian open title at his favourite den.
He won his second French open title by beating the king of clay Rafael Nadal in the semis and became only the third player after Roy Emerson and Rod Laver to win all the grandslam titles at least twice.
Now, he has won his sixth Wimbledon title, third in a row. He has also become the first player after Rod Laver to win the first three grandslam titles in a year.

With his win at Wimbledon, he has equaled the number of grandslam titles with his counterparts. Now, each of the big 3 have 20 grandslam titles each..!

It's one of the greatest era of tennis and the three greats have certainly made the sport more interesting with their play.

An important factor as to decide who would end their career with most grandslams would be ‚Äòthe age factor‚Äô.

Djokovic is 34, Nadal is 35 and Federer is 39 as of now. Certainly, Djokovic has a big advantage here.

I genuinely believe that Federer's reign in the tennis world is up and he's over trying to get some titles before his body finally gives up. In my opinion, he would retire with 20 grandslam titles intact.

Nadal, if remains fit, can win 4‚Äì5 titles in my opinion. With clay court being his favourite, he might win 2‚Äì3 titles there and might somehow grab a couple of titles somewhere.

Djokovic, has the best chance of winning more titles among the three. He's almost a robot and is consistently winning or at least challenging his opponents in each and every tournament. He can win 8‚Äì9 titles going by his fitness, current form and age factor.

So, according to me, it's Djokovic who's going to finish with more grandslams among the big 3.

Give me your opinions.

Randy Watkins,5y,Do feminists actually believe that Serena Williams would stand a chance against Novak Djokovic?,"Some of them do seem to believe that. For example, here is a quote from olympic swimmer and nine time medalist Leisel Jones: ‚ÄúFemales are just as good at sport as men are - if not better.

‚ÄúWe can go back to Serena Williams. If you put Novak Djokovic next to her, I think Serena Williams would flog him every single day over.‚Äù

This quote amazes me coming from an athlete of this caliber. It seems her ability to reason has been clouded by her passion for physical equality between men and women. I agree wholeheartedly with life equality, but that's not the question. The question is, are men physically dominant? Specifically, in sports, are the men at the top of their game, better than the women at the top of their game?

Does Leisel Jones think she can beat Michael Phelps at any event or distance in swimming? All she has to do is compare her times with his, and it is obvious that she cannot. The question cannot arise with any intelligence in sports such as weightlifting, 100 yard dash, running marathons, or any sport with measured time or weight.

It would be a much better question in bowling, darts, auto racing, archery, skeet shooting, chess, poker, golf, and even ultra distance swimming. Tennis, however, does not fall into this category.

I understand why some people ask the question if they do not closely follow tennis. Strategy, belief and mental fortitude play significant roles in tennis. But only when and if strength, endurance and power are fairly close.

Novak vs. Serena is a complete and total mismatch. Novak is equivalent to Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal, and the three of them dominate the rest of the men's field. Please understand, it is just a simple fact that Serena Williams has zero chance of beating any of those three players unless they had a major injury. Yes, you heard correctly‚Ä¶Zero. It would never be close on any day or on any surface. It would be complete and total dominance. Even Serena knows this. When being interviewed for an exhibition match against Andy Murray, she said she would do well if she won a single game.

The men serve faster, hit ground strokes much harder, move much faster and dominate in court coverage.

Seems pretty close,no?

By now you must have realised what I have done wrong. :P

The units haven't been shown.

The tennis serve is in miles/hour.

The ball is in kilometres/hour.

Using km/hour as a reference, the fastest tennis serve is 263 km/hour.

That's atleast 100km/hour faster than Akhtar's express pace.

To out that in context, a batsman has 0.44 seconds to face Akhtar's fastest ball.

But if he were to bowl at Groth's serve, the batsman will have 0.27 seconds to react, which nearly impossible to face unless you are lucky.

Typical of teenagers, I had to shake her out of bed (Westin Hotel) at 10 AM to get going for the day and she somehow dragged herself out and got ready. When we went downstairs we saw 2 cars parked in front of the hotel with the ABN Amro logo and 2 guys waiting around. We asked them and were told that they were waiting for Mr. Federer.

Excitedly we hung out in the lobby and he came down a few minutes later carrying his own tennis kit and alone. I encouraged my daughter to go up to him which she did and addressed him in Swiss German (we live in Switzerland). He chatted with her happily for a few minutes, signed an autograph and posed for a picture until his entourage came down. Remember that he was on his way to play a final, which would normally leave most sportsmen tense and stressed and hardly wanting to be accosted by a teenager in the hotel lobby!

Pat Cash,Updated 5y,What are some tips for a good tennis serve?,"The serve is one of the 6 basic strokes
 in tennis and is the only one that a player has total control over. This makes it one of the most important strokes in the game. It is also the most technically complex out of the 6 core strokes which is why many players struggle with it.

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to coach Mark Philippoussis
 and Greg Rusedski
, two of the great servers in tennis, and I‚Äôll give you some beginner tips on how to improve your serve below. By the end of this post you‚Äôll be able to serve as well as them‚Ä¶ Just kidding ;) But the principles and tips will at least bring you closer.

Fundamental mechanics of tennis.
All strokes in tennis (including the serve) are a sequence of motions referred to as a ‚Äúkinetic chain‚Äù. It begins at a player‚Äôs feet, extending through the legs, hips, chest, shoulders, arm, and wrist to the racquet as it impacts the tennis ball. The kinetic chain allows the build up, storage, and transfer of energy to generate power for your shot.

Biomechanically
 sound tennis technique comes from your kinetic chain working in concert. Bad technique and injuries are the result of dysfunctional movements within your body‚Äôs kinetic chain.

What does this mean?

Essentially it means you want all parts of your body to work together and in harmony. In other words the correct amount of rotation, up/down movement, side-to-side movement, and forward/backward momentum will result in the best possible serve technique.

Now that you understand the basic technical principles let's move on to the tips.

General serve tips.
Before I get specific here are a few general things to keep in mind: A) stay relaxed, B) keep your technique simple, and C) don‚Äôt worry too much about how to move your arm as this‚Äôll take care of itself if the fundamental serve technique is good.

Serve stance.
Before starting, make sure you‚Äôre standing behind the baseline. Next place your feet in a side on stance where if you drew an arrow between the tips of your feet it‚Äôd point towards your opponent (this may feel a little strange at first but will help with power) like this:

Serve Grip.
Finally, grip the racket in your dominant hand using a continental grip (like you‚Äôd hold a hammer) and hold the tennis ball in your non-dominant hand. Now you‚Äôre ready to start serving.

How to serve step-by-step.
The core elements and movements of a serve can be broken down into stance, take back, ball toss, swing, contact point and follow through. I‚Äôll walk you through each of these below.

For the purpose of this instruction I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre right handed. Here is how to serve in eight steps:

Step 1: Begin your service motion by holding your racket and ball in front of you.
Step 2: Start your momentum forwards by leaning towards the opponent, toss the ball in the air with your non-dominant arm while dropping your racket arm straight back. The ball toss and backswing happen simultaneously.
Step3: Now your body should be in a ready position, fully coiled and ready to unload.
Step 4: As the ball moves into striking position above your head start uncoiling by driving up through your legs, rotating your body, and pulling your non-dominant arm down.
Step 5: Continue extending and uncoiling as your racket arm whips up and around following the rest of your body.
Step 6: At this stage your body and head position
 should be facing or almost facing the net as you pull down and make contact with the tennis ball.
Step 7: As you continue the follow through your body should be falling forward and to the left as your racket arm whips through the ball and slightly to the right.
Step 8: Finally, as you finish your serve motion you‚Äôll land on your left foot in in the court while your dominant arm finishes it‚Äôs swing on the left side of your body (if you‚Äôre right handed).

John Isner serve.

Taylor Dent Serve.

Goran Ivanisevic Serve.

If you‚Äôve followed the steps and watch the gifs closely you‚Äôll see that despite their different styles and minor differences the fundamental movements are almost identical. The reason I picked these examples is because they illustrate best practice principles that the average player (and other pros for that matter) should follow.

Surya Kiran Tiruvuri,2y,What's the most underrated achievement in tennis?,"In 1997 a 16 year old Martina Hingis became the youngest ever in the tennis history to become a world number 1. She also became the youngest ever to win 3 slams in an year. She is also the youngest ever to win a unique achievement of winning all 4 slams in doubles in a calendar year and she did that at the age of 17.

These records will probably never be broken. She also made a record 6 consecutive Australian open finals winning 3 of them and losing 3 of them. All these happened before the age of 21.

She spent 200+ weeks at number in Tennis before retiring at the age of 21.

Nathan Stanish,Updated 1y,"Was Andy Roddick truly an exceptional tennis player, or did he take advantage of a lull in top-tier talent between Pete Sampras' retirement and Roger Federer's ascendence?","He was absolutely exceptional.

When Roddick was only a teenager, he beat three Grand Slam winners: 29-year-old Pete Sampras (14 Grand Slams), 29-year-old Michael Chang (1 Grand Slam, and then World No.1 Gustavo Kuerten (3 Grand Slams). Roddick ended up winning 3 titles and rose to World No.15 in his first full year as a pro. That‚Äôs an incredible start to a teenager‚Äôs tennis career. Keep in mind, Federer had turned pro two years before, and didn‚Äôt win his first title until after Roddick‚Äôs.

That‚Äôs why, when his career started out, many fans considered Roddick the next brightest star of tennis. Eventually, Federer came into his own and took that top spot, but Roddick didn‚Äôt fall off. He continued to compete with the Big 3 for the next 10 years on tour. Fun fact: Roddick still holds a winning record over Novak Djokovic, 5‚Äì4. Admittedly, his last match against Djokovic was in 2010, before Djokovic became nearly unbeatable in his 2011 and 2015 seasons, but it‚Äôs still a solid feat.

Now, it‚Äôs true that Roddick never did manage to win a Grand Slam in the Big 3 era. He made it to three Wimbledon finals, but never had the juice to pull out a win. Nevertheless, he proved himself on court. Like most players in the 2000s, 2010s, and even 2020s, he suffered from playing in the toughest tennis era ever.

Laurence Shanet,5y,Was the game penalty handed to Serena Williams in the 2018 US Open Final reasonable?,"I had originally not replied to this question because I thought Carey Page‚Äòs reply covered it so well. But after commenting on another answer, a number of users asked that I post my comment as an answer here. So here are some thoughts:

The problem with many people‚Äôs criticisms of Ramos, and with their understanding of what happened in this match can be explained by the difference between what fans and commentators have seen, and what they think they‚Äôve seen. I don‚Äôt mean this as an attack; it‚Äôs part of how the human brain works. Let me explain what I mean.

The racquet smash: When someone says that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen many rackets smashed without any violations handed out.‚Äù, I believe that they believe that, and that they could have sworn they‚Äôve seen it frequently. And I believe they‚Äôve heard other people say that. But the fact is that it almost never happens. In fact, I‚Äôd ask you to do a search for a televised Grand Slam match from the last three years, and find more than one instance of a racquet being smashed to the point of being broken, and no code violation being handed out. The reason I say this is that the umpires are given specific guidelines for the assessment of racquet abuse, and they actually can get in trouble from their supervisors when they don‚Äôt hand one out. There is far more likelihood of suspected corruption when they don‚Äôt call this than when they do, because it has been considered standard since the current code violation system has become codified. There are certain things left to an umpire‚Äôs discretion, but breaking a racquet is not one of them. And neither is the code violation progression of warning, point, game, match. So if you see a player break a racquet on their second code violation, you can bet they got the point penalty. I‚Äôll go as far as to say you‚Äôll have a very hard time finding a current instance of it not happening. But I‚Äôm open to changing my mind if you can find a bunch. Please submit video links here if you can find instances of it.

The coaching violation: Similarly, there has been a lot of talk about how rampant coaching is among the pro ranks. And that much is true. However, the line that ‚Äú100% of the players do it 100% of the time‚Äù could not be more false. (Also even if it were true, the ‚Äúeverybody does it‚Äù defense doesn‚Äôt hold water with speeding tickets, school fights or any kind of cheating in life, and it also doesn‚Äôt here either.) During the regular tour year, most WTA events actually allow courtside coaching. And the women become quite used to it. There is also frequent coaching from the sidelines, although some of it is more subtle than others. But every player on tour knows that the rules against it are more strict at the Slams, and the incidence goes down somewhat. Further, every single player on tour knows that Ramos is famously strict about coaching from the stands. His application of the rule to Serena was totally consistent with similar calls that he‚Äôs made in high profile tournaments against Nadal and other top players. The thing is that most players and coaches know this, and simply don‚Äôt do it when Ramos is calling the match. Whether Patrick had a momentary memory lapse or simply thought he was above Ramos‚Äôs rule, he made what amounts to a rookie error. And Ramos has consistently called people on it. So it wasn‚Äôt overstepping and it wasn‚Äôt unexpected. The fact is that there wasn‚Äôt a single video (or even a still frame) of Osaka‚Äôs coach, Sascha Bajin, doing any coaching in this match. That‚Äôs because he didn‚Äôt do it. (But again, if you can find any footage of Bajin making any kind of signal during the match, please post it here.) That‚Äôs not to say he never has, but he was too smart to do it in this situation. Signalling a player from courtside in an internationally televised Slam final with Ramos in the chair is tantamount to flipping Ramos the bird. It‚Äôs just asking for it. So once again, I‚Äôm sure you feel like you‚Äôve seen coaching happen a lot. Or more likely just heard other people say it. But it‚Äôs not the case here. And if anything, Osaka‚Äôs coach would have had more to say in this instance, because he‚Äôs Serena‚Äôs former coach and hitting partner! He had all kinds of insight into Serena‚Äôs game. But he didn‚Äôt risk his charge‚Äôs match, because he knew what every other person on the tour knows: that Ramos is likely to call it as he has many times before. Regardless of how often it is cited overall in other venues by other umpires, coaching at a Slam on Ramos‚Äôs court is going to get called. It‚Äôs not bad officiating. In fact, the tour regards him as one of their best because he does this. They only wish the other umpires had the spine to do it more often and more consistently themselves, just as Ramos does.

The verbal abuse code violation: The first misunderstanding that viewers have is the idea that Ramos had a choice about what punishment to give Serena. They could have sworn they‚Äôve seen players do more and get off with less. But this is because they don‚Äôt understand the code violation system. With two code violations already under her belt, Ramos didn‚Äôt just decide to penalize her a game. He HAD to. After two code violations, he can do only one of two things; give a game penalty, or act like there is no code violation at all and do nothing. He is no longer allowed to give her a warning. She used that up when Patrick gave her signals. That‚Äôs how the system works. It‚Äôs not a judgment call. Rather than say something to Serena as many suggest, which would have broken the protocols and potentially gotten him sanctioned for not following procedure, he allowed her to continue and repeatedly abuse him for a while, because he didn‚Äôt want to default her. But she was relentless. She would not stop repeating her accusations and demands. There was no chance he could say that he didn‚Äôt hear or see what she was saying. She forced his hand. The game penalty was not out of the blue at all. It came after a warning and a point penalty, and after him not responding to a barrage of abuse over multiple changeovers.

And here is where the other misunderstanding that casual fans have comes into play. There is the mistaken belief that somehow curse words are the worst thing ever. But no one believes this apart from religious zealots and young children. What really matters is WHAT is said, and HOW it is said. The Grand Slam rulebook specifies that any attack on an umpire that ‚Äúimplies dishonesty or is derogatory, insulting or otherwise abusive‚Äù is a code violation. The fact that he let her say it repeatedly first, and didn‚Äôt hand out the code violation until after multiple repetitions was lenient in and of itself. Just because some other (male) players use words like ‚Äúfuck‚Äù or ‚Äúshit‚Äù more often when yelling doesn‚Äôt automatically make what they said worse. Impugning the umpire‚Äôs character or honesty (which ironically is what Serena said made her upset in the first place when she mistakenly thought he did it to her) is why that part of the code exists at all in the first place; to protect the integrity of the sport and its officials and prevent them from accusations like the one Serena made. Because they can be career ending and damage the entire game. Saying things like that is serious business not only in tennis, but in almost every sport, and that‚Äôs why you so rarely hear it done. And the combination of that and actual threats, while missing a few curse words that people are wrongly focused on, was far more egregious than anything I can remember seeing go unpunished in the modern men‚Äôs game. But again, please feel free to find any footage at all of a man repeatedly and aggressively both calling the umpire dishonest or a cheater, and threatening him or his livelihood, and then not getting a code violation. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs harder to find than you think. And that you haven‚Äôt actually seen the men do worse once you know how the rules are written and why. It‚Äôs not Ramos who did something that you don‚Äôt do in Slam finals. It‚Äôs Serena. She was the one who tried to abuse her power as the most prominent figure in tennis, and assumed she could operate above the rules that bind every other player. The reason this instance seems so isolated is that, after receiving both an official warning and a point penalty, almost no other players continue to play fast and loose with the rules. But when they do, they are always penalized for it. If people want to assert otherwise, it‚Äôs important to supply specific examples, which no one has been able to do yet.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5fanw3txksobyhiq', 'title': 'Was the game penalty handed to Serena Williams in the 2018 US Open Final reasonable?', 'score': {'original': 0.3812, 'ai': 0.6188}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I had originally not replied to this question because I thought Carey Page‚Äòs reply covered it so well.

Andrew Bryk,10y,What is Roger Federer like in real life?,"I don't think there is a better way to describe what a mensch Roger Federer is than this fan's touching story. Credit to Mashable for the story - Fan's Touching Story Will Make Roger Federer Your Favorite Athlete 

The whole story of how I got to meet Roger Federer and how it was: Well, I had cancer in 2011/2012, and there's this foundation called the Make A Wish Foundation. They grant wishes to kids, teens and yound adults who have life-threatening diseases. I made my wish in 2012, and my wish was to meet Roger Federer. I waited for more than a year, and I didn't really know if they were gonna be able to grant me this wish (you have second and third options) since Roger has such a busy schedule and it was taking such a long time. In June I was told that ESPN was doing a piece on high school tennis and they were gonna film a bit of my school tennis team. So I went there and we had practice and in the end they told us we had a culminating activity that would kinda test our knowledge of tennis. They gave us an iPad to watch something, and it was the Wimbledon 2012 match point (that already got me like really excited) but then after Roger falls to the ground they cut the video and Roger shows up in a kind of home made video or something, and he says ""Hi Beatriz, I heard you're a big fan of mine, so I'm inviting you with your family to come watch me play at Wimbledon. Go pack your bags, have a safe trip, and I'll see you there!"" (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) I freaked out so so so badly. I couldn't believe it haha. All I could think was ""OMG ROGER FEDERER KNOWS MY NAME!"" Haha.




So, yeah, this was on a Monday, and my flight to London was on that Thursday (I barely had any time to freak out) and I live in the US so... But yeah, then I found out ESPN was doing a piece on my wish and it's actually gonna air in August :) anyway, I got there and the very next day I met Roger! First I went to the nike house, where players get their gear and everything, and they actually gave me lots of stuff, all white since it was Wimbledon. Then we went to the All England Club where I was actually gonna meet him. We were waiting on the place where players eat and hang out. However, the guys from ESPN told me we might not see him that day because schedules change a lot. So I wasn't expecting anythint, just sitting watching some practices and someone calls my name. I turn and it's FREAKING ROGER FEDERER. He comes up, gives me a hug and a kiss and then sits down and starts talking to me very naturally. I was trying hard not to freak out haha. We talked for about 10-15 minutes (which I was told later he wasn't supposed to do. He was just supposed to come and say hi and then go to practice but he's a perfect human being and talked to me for a while!) oh my gosh this is getting very long haha. After that he went to practice, but he told me to go change, because I was gonna watch his practice from inside the court and maybe we could hit a little bit after he was done. He told me that he would send someone to take me to the court because like no one is allowed in the courts except the players and coaches. So I changed and went there, and I was waiting for someone to come take me to the actual court when I hear someone call my name and oh my god it's Paul Annacone. He sent PAUL ANNACONE to get me. So I go to the court and am introduced to Sev and Steph, and then sit there watching his practice with Hewitt (!!!!).

After his practice he tells me we're gonna hit for a while and Sev says ""but she doesn't have a racquet"" and Roger is like ""she can use one of mine"" (!!!!!!!) so he reaches into his bag and gives me one of his racquets to hit with (!!!!!!). I was really scared because I'm not like amazing at tennis, I'm pretty good, but not out of the ordinary, and even if I was, it was freaking Roger Federer. But Paul and Roger told me not to be scared, it was so cute haha. So we hit for a bit, then he told me to come up and volley and he went up too. Paul told me not to be scared of Roger in the net 'cause it was all pressure, he wasn't even that good haha. Then he served and oh my gosh it's fast even though he wasn't even close to full speed. After that he went over the net, shook my hand and gave me a kiss on the cheek (!!!!!!). Then we walked (and talked) together to the other court where he was going to practice more with Hewitt. I watched this second practice and then after they were done Roger came up to me and said ""well that's my day"" and we talked for a bit more, and then he said ""I'll see you on Sunday"" (this was a Friday) and I freaked out because oh my gosh I was gonna see him again!!! So yeah that was it for this day. On Sunday the guys from ESPN told me I was gonna take a tour of the grounds, even though I had already taken one when I went to London for vacation. The more time at Wimbledon the better haha. But then when I'm waiting to take the tour I find out that the people who are giving me the tour are the Chairman of Wimbledon (!!!!!!) and Roger (!!!!!!!). Like, OH MY GOD. So yeah, they took me around, and to the walk the players take to get to Centre Court, and then to actual Centre Court, with everything being explained to me by Roger and the Chairman. After we got to Centre Court Roger had to leave earlier than us because he had his press conference (which I was going to), so he left us there to see a bit more of Centre Court. AND on his way out he talked to the main guy that gets Centre Court ready, to let me actually go there. Like, I stepped on the grass on Centre Court because of Roger. He's perfect oh my god. And then we took a while there so his manager called the girl from ESPN to ask her if we were going because Roger was waiting for me to start the press conference (!!!!!!!!!!). OMG HE IS PERFECT. So we went to the press conference and saw everything, and then on my wait out I passed Roger and he was like ""So did you like it? Me getting grilled by the press?"" He's always so dorky and funny haha. And then the people from ESPN took us to the players lounge because Roger was gonna sign some stuff for me after he had done all of his interviews (a lot of them) and gotten a award (you know, just usual stuff).

I was sitting there waiting for him and it was amazing because I saw soooo many other players. Tsonga asked to get one of the chairs in our table actually haha. I saw Murray, Nadal, Haas, Ferrer, Benneteau, Tipsarevic, Serena, Wozniacki, Radwanska, Lisicki, like, so many of them from up close. It was like heaven for a tennis fan haha. But then Roger finished his interviews and sat at out table with us. I had so many things for him to sign but I knew he was busy so I just took 4 pictures (one for each one in my family) and then 4 blank papers and my tennis bag, and gave for him to sign. He actually addressed the blank papers to each one of us, it was so perfect. In mine he wrote a bit more, and even a happy birthday!! (Did I mention it was my 18th birthday??) And then he asked me ""is that it?"" and I said ""yes"" and he was like ""are you sure? Don't be embarrassed about it."" He's so amazing and kind. So I gave him the rest of the stuff to sign. And he was just sitting there signing and chatting with me, but his manager was telling the guys from ESPN that he needed to go eat lunch, and Roger probably knew he had to, but he would have stayed there the whole day, just talking to us. He stayed a lot more than he had to for sure. But then the people from ESPN tried kinda finishing things up so that he could leave before his manager freaked out. So he went around the table hugging my mom, my dad and my sister, and then it was my turn. He told me I had been through a lot and hugged me really hard and I just started crying so so so much in his shoulder (it was around that time that the picture from my avi was taken haha) He was like ""awnn"". Then when I let go of him I was still like sobbing and I turned to him and he was kinda tearing up :') I thanked him and then he went.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/i9awob4lg7rst1pk', 'title': 'What is Roger Federer like in real life?', 'score': {'original': 0.59615, 'ai': 0.40385}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I don\'t think there is a better way to describe what a mensch Roger Federer is than this fan\'s touching story.

Abhishek Nambiar,5y,What do you think was the major problem with yesterday‚Äôs tennis match between Serena and Osaka?,"Serena‚Äôs unwarranted outburst and everyone‚Äôs focus on her ‚Äòplight‚Äô while Naomi wept after winning the championship

Serena was given three penalties in the match :

Coaching (later admitted by her coach
) - Her coach‚Äôs claims that ‚Äúeveryone does it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it less of a violation. She received a warning for this.
Racquet Abuse - She received a point penalty for breaking her racquet and started next game at 15‚Äì0. What is most absurd is that she knew she‚Äôd lose a point if she breaks her racquet, yet claims that the umpire ‚Äòstole‚Äô the point from her!
Verbal Abuse - Serena called the umpire a ‚Äòliar‚Äô and a ‚Äòthief‚Äô for stealing her point. She received a game penalty for it, leaving Osaka one game away from victory.

Personally, I feel the verbal abuse was a slightly harsh call, because it was the penultimate game of a Grand Slam final. The umpire though, withdrew himself from external factors and went by the book, which cannot be argued with.

Serena taking the coaching as an ‚Äòattack on her integrity‚Äô is a personal problem. Players‚Äô personal problems were not accounted for when the rules of the game were decided. If she wants to play on court, she follows the rules.

Sport > Player

‚ÄúI have never cheated in my life‚Ä¶you are the liar‚Ä¶you stole a point from me‚Ä¶you are a thief too‚Äù

Clearly, she doesn‚Äôt believe that Tennis is bigger than her

This behaviour from Serena is not uncommon. She had a forgettable exit from the 2009 US Open
. She yelled at a lineswoman in the semifinal, which resulted in a point penalty on match point and thus, she lost the point and match

Her comment back then -

""An apology? From me? Well, how many people yell at lines people?""

No doubt she is a legend. Perhaps the greatest woman to hold a tennis racquet. But she does not have the right to assume she is greater than the game and abuse officials.

On the other hand, Naomi Osaka clearly outplayed Serena. Her shots were not dramatic, she only stuck to the basics and delivered a smooth performance

This frustrated Serena!

Less than two months after losing the Wimbledon final, it was a repeat for her. Even before the first warning, she was netting the ball quite frequently. The angst of not winning another Grand Slam after coming so close and getting penalties at the same time was enough for someone with her history of outbursts to revolt back!

And what did Naomi get after the win?

A lot of boo‚Äôs! Seriously? She just created history by being the first Japanese to win a Grand Slam!

Just after winning a frickin‚Äô Grand Slam

Look at her face. I‚Äôm sure she must have dreamed of this moment

Just for comparison, here is Serena after her first Grand Slam title - US Open ‚Äò99.

Everyone made sure it was not the night of Osaka‚Äôs win. But the night of Serena‚Äôs unfair defeat

Perhaps this is not the finish we were looking for today, but Serena, you are quite a champion of champions, and Naomi, welcome to the big stage.

- Katrina Adams, President of USTA

Honestly, that sounds more like a condolence rather than a congratulations to Naomi.

A lot of former players have tweeted that there should be a change in the rules and that the umpire was too harsh. Till then, Serena has to follow the rules if she plays at the Flushing Meadows. Period.

All in all, this match will definitely be remembered for years to come and not for the right reasons. Dozens of Grand Slam trophies do not offset unsportsmanlike conduct.

Personally, I will never be able to admire Serena as much as I admire Nadal, Federer or Wawrinka. It is just sheer pleasure to watch them, both on and off court

‚ÄúHonestly, I would have been happy to lose‚Ä¶.There are no draws in tennis. I would have been equally happy to share this (his trophy) with Rafa‚Äù

- Federer, after winning Australian Open 2017

Subash Raj,Updated 8y,What are some traditions at Wimbledon?,"The Mystery-Man who always occupies Seat No 7

For the past decade and a half, this man occupies the seat number 7 in the player's box at the center court. In his signature goatee and a cowboy hat, the cameras pan on to him quite often. Year, after year.

Who is he?

He is 79 year old, David Spearing. He has been a steward, at the Wimbledon, since 1974 and now acts as a host to the player's entourage at the center court, which he has been doing for the past decade and a half.





PS: During the QF match featuring Serena, Alan Wilkins (yes, the cricketer who also does tennis commentary) asked Vijay Amritraj about him and also indicated that he cannot recall his name.

Simply Tennis. No Advertisements.

Pic: Wimbledon, with no sponsor background.

Unlike other tournaments, where most of the real estate including the net is taken up by sponsor logos - Wimbledon has absolutely nothing.

Pic: That Gael Monfils dive in the top right is a great advertisement for Longines. Wouldn't you agree?

White, white and always white

Unlike other tournaments, where the officials do not really bother much about player outfits, Wimbledon is a place where officials call the shots and the players have to follow suit.

Andre Agassi, who created a niche for himself with long hair and ""weird' colored clothing tried to rebel against Wimbledon and during the earlier years of his career, he boycotted the tournament.

Pic: Yes, that is Agassi, and yes those are denim shorts !

But eventually he had to relent.

After all, this was Wimbledon.

And none other than Roger Federer, even after winning the event multiple times made the mistake of making the officials unhappy, all because his shoes weren't up to the mark. And Federer - had to listen.

After all, this was Wimbledon.

Pic: No, Roger - No, Orange in shoes please.


Royalty on the court

Wimbledon is the only grand slam which is attended by the royalty and the English Royal family has a strong connection with the club.

Pic: Queen Elizabeth II interacting with the players during Wimbledon 2010

The players also have to bow to the royalty, if they are present in the court. Since 2003, however, the bowing tradition is done only if the queen or the prince are present in the royal box.

Pic: Federer bowing to Prince Charles during Wimbledon'12.

During the post-match interview, Federer remarked:

They do brief you. So I guess you don‚Äôt do anything stupid. You behave!!




First match on Center Court goes to defending champions

The matches on the Center Court are kicked off by the defending champion of the Gentleman's Singles. In 2015, this would be Novak Djokovic.

This is a privilege which the defending champion gets as he gets to play on fresh and unused grass surface for his opening match. As the tournament progresses, the grass dries off, specially near the service lines.


No Tennis Please - this is Wimbledon

Grand slams carry on for a period of two weeks, starting from a Monday and ending with the finals on the following second Sunday. Generally, in the first week, most of the lower ranked players get eliminated. And beginning the middle Sunday, excitement starts building up as people start looking forward to more competitive matches and 'Sunday', being a holiday, they finally have some more time for Tennis.

But what happens at Wimbledon?



""Blimey! Have you gone bollocks? What are you doing here on the middle Sunday. We don't play Tennis here. Don't ya all know that? This is Wimbledon. Go home and have some English tea. Off you go now. See ya tomorrow.""



Ok. May be that wasn't a great imitation with the British accent. But, nevertheless, yes, there is actually no tennis at Wimbledon during the middle Sunday. A lot of players, including John McEnroe and Novak Djokovic have protested against this. The English weather often interrupts the tournament and at times causes havoc in the schedule.

But hey, this is a tradition. How can this be changed?

Strawberries & Cream

During the Victorian England times, Strawberries were a fashionable thing to eat. And they were in season when Wimbledon used to take place. Many fans started considering Wimbledon as 'Tennis in an English garden"", and strawberries and cream just had to be there.

Pic: They do look delicious. Don't they.

Goutham Harsha,Updated 10y,What is Roger Federer like in real life?,"The following article is an essay about Federer, written by Rick Reilly (in 2007), who is a featured columnist for ESPN Sports. This should give a fair idea as to what the man is in real life.

Roger Federer is decent, humble and kinder than Aunt Bee. He is constantly saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a normal guy.‚Äù All his winning shots were just ‚Äúlucky.‚Äù Well, finally, opponents are starting to take his word for it.

Do you realize this man, whom most experts say is the greatest tennis player to ever live, actually goes to restaurants and sometimes waits in line?

He doesn‚Äôt have a full-time coach. Has no tattoos. His entourage is a joke. His publicity agent, his scheduler, his hitting partner and his girlfriend are all the same person. And she‚Äôs not even a lingerie model! Just an ordinary, very nice Swiss miss named Mirka. Derek Jeter has more babes than belts!

Federer flies commercial. Doesn‚Äôt own a jet. Here‚Äôs a guy who has dominated his sport far more than Tiger Woods has over the last three years, yet Tiger has a 155-foot yacht and Federer doesn‚Äôt even own a dinghy.

Federer made an estimated $28 million last year, yet he doesn‚Äôt own a house, just two ‚Äúflats,‚Äù he says. He won four ATP honors in one day last week‚ÄìPlayer of the Year, Humanitarian of the Year, Fans‚Äô Favorite and the Sportsmanship Award for 2006‚Äìyet he has no trophy room. The hardware just piles up on his dining room table.

At 25 Federer has won 10 Grand Slam events yet still stays in the same hotel as the tour schmoes. Roger, you‚Äôre an immortal! Rent a mansion! Do you realize that when Tiger played at a tournament in Tucson in February he not only rented a house, but he also had all the furniture removed and his own brought in, so he could be more comfortable? Wake up and smell the indulgence!
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to overlive,‚Äù Federer says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to be too big. It‚Äôs got to feel right when you go to bed at night.‚Äù

Tell you what a sucker Federer is, when he‚Äôs done practicing, he picks up his own bench area. ‚ÄúNot many guys on tour do that,‚Äù says Federer‚Äôs best friend, Yves Allegro. ‚ÄúIn fact, most don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù That‚Äôs the other thing‚Äìthis guy Allegro. Federer plays doubles with him a few times a year just to put some folding money in his friend‚Äôs pocket. Nowadays your average tennis superstar would rather join the Elks club than play doubles. But not Federer. Even if the doubles comes right after his singles match, he plays. It would be like Tiger playing the Sheboygan Ladies Par 3 Annual after winning the Masters. ‚ÄúHow can I pay him back?‚Äù Allegro says. ‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt even let me buy him dinner!‚Äù

You have to be who you are, Rog, and you are a heavenly body. Start acting like it! ‚ÄúI tell him all the time,‚Äù says his agent, IMG‚Äôs Tony Godsick, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too nice.‚Äù

Too Nice Example No. 1: Federer sometimes throws pizza parties for the ball boys at tournaments because he was one himself. And he attends!

Too Nice No. 2: The other day he was in L.A. and called Pete Sampras out of the blue to see if he wanted to hit. No, no, no, Roger! He calls you! And you put him off for a week before you call him back!

Too Nice No. 3: I sent an e-mail to Godsick on Monday morning at eight, asking for a one-on-one interview. By four, I was sitting across from Federer. Eight hours? Barry Bonds will put a reporter off for eight years! There were two chairs in the interview room. A large, cushy one with armrests and a plain straight-backed one. He looked at me sheepishly and said, ‚ÄúWould you mind very much if I took the larger chair? I am very tired from my match.‚Äù

Hello? Roger? Monster sports Goliaths don‚Äôt ask. Monster sports Goliaths plop down in the big one, then put their feet up on the smaller one.

Lon Shapiro,Updated Feb 5,Who would have won between Federer and Djokovic at the French Open if they both played during their prime?,"In 2011, Djokovic had the greatest season of his career, way better than what he did in 2015 and after. There is no comparison between the level of competition in 2011 and 2015 or any year after.

In 2011, Nadal was 25 and in his prime as the #1 player in the world. Federer was 29, turning 30 that August, and still formidable. That year Djokovic went 70‚Äì6, with 10 titles and 3 grand Slams.

If you include the 2010 Davis Cup Finals, Djokovic went on a 66‚Äì2 run (97.0%), including 43 straight wins, with 3 Slams and 10 titles out of 12 tournaments played.

Injuries and fatigue slowed him down at the tail end of the season, resulting in four losses. Otherwise, it would have been the greatest season by any of the Big 3.

Who was the best in their tip prime, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, or Novak Djokovic?
This question has been raised many times before, with slightly different wording. You chose the phrase ‚Äútip prime,‚Äù which needs to be defined. Most tennis players and sports writers define ‚Äúprime‚Äù as being that period in an athlete‚Äôs career where they reached the top of their game (as evidenced by winning a Slam or achieving their highest ranking) and continuing until their age starts to limit them physically. Since we are focusing on these three all-time greats, we should compare them to what other all-time greats do at the start of their careers. Most multiple Slam winners win their first title before they turn 23 (List of Grand Slam singles champions in Open Era with age of first title - Wikipedia.) Federer won his first slam just before he turned 22. Djokovic won his first slam four months before he turned 21. Nadal won his first Slam as he turned 19. I believe that once a player wins a slam we have to consider that the beginning of their prime. (On the other hand, some players - Wawrinka, for example - underachieve for years before they finally combine the right attitude, training and coach to break through mentally and play their best tennis. They may have passed their physical peak, but the breakthrough is where you have to measure their prime.) I would also argue that a player‚Äôs prime ends at 28 years of age. The proof is that only a handful of the greatest players of the Open Era have won more than one slam after the age of 28. The exceptions are Laver, Rosewall, Newcombe, Connors, Sampras, Agassi, Wawrinka, Federer and Nadal. Djokovic turned 29 as the 2016 French Open began and won that event. He hasn‚Äôt won another title since then. If you want to know who is the greatest player of the three in their ‚Äúprimes,‚Äù the answer is clear. I did a deep dive into this subject by looking at each of the players‚Äô head-to-head records during their prime. The margins are very, very close, but the order still comes out the same as their grand slam records: 1) Federer; 2) Nadal; and 3) Djokovic: Lon Shapiro's answer to At their peaks, how would you rank Nadal, Djokovic and Federer? For those people who argue for Djokovic, the biggest problem is he only dominates Federer and Nadal during his magical 2011 season, staying #1 for 53 weeks starting in July 2011. He was passed by Federer in 2012, regains #1 for 48 weeks in November 2012 and gets passed again by Nadal in October 2013. That‚Äôs only a total of 101 weeks at #1 while Federer and Nadal are in their primes. (Djokovic‚Äôs longest streak at #1 (122 weeks) comes between July 2014 and November 2016, at precisely the worst periods of Nadal‚Äôs and Federer‚Äôs play.) Nadal is ranked #1 on three separate occasions (2008, 2010, 2013) for a total of 141 weeks. That puts him clearly above Djokovic. Federer was ranked #1 (with Nadal #2), between July 2005 and August 2008, again in 2009, and again in 2012, approximately 221 weeks. For those who want to use the ‚Äúweaker era‚Äù argument, Nadal from age 19 to 22 was a far greater opponent than the older, weakened versions of Nadal and Federer from 2014‚Äì2016. His record is still clearly better than Djokovic. So what is a ‚Äútip prime?‚Äù My guess is you are describing what most people call a player‚Äôs ‚Äúpeak.‚Äù The difficulty with the word peak is to know where to draw the lines that define it. Is it one match? Is it one tournament? Is it a season? An entire year? Or some arbitrary number of months or year? The next problem is to compare one player‚Äôs peak to another. Djokovic might have had an amazing 2015 season, but Nadal (20 losses, no Slams past the quarters) and Federer (11 losses, including Seppi, Kyrgios, Wawrinkia, Ramos-Vinolas) were not playing anywhere near their old level. A lot of people have written about which player had the greatest single season, and most of them focus on Federer 2005, Federer 2006, Djokovic 2011, Connors 1974, McEnroe 1984, and Laver 1969 in the Open Era. Because you asked for the ‚Äútip prime,‚Äù I would like to analyze the best portion of each player‚Äôs best seasons. Here are the greatest seasons for these players: Federer (2005), Federer (2006), Nadal (2008), Nadal (2010), Djokovic (2011), Nadal (2013), and Djokovic (2015). There are amazing things to be pulled from parts of each of these seasons. Here are the all-time peaks for each player. I‚Äôll list them in reverse order: Honorable Mention, Nadal 2010: Nadal was 71‚Äì10, won 3 Grand Slams and 7 titles overall. However, this is the biggest what-if season. Nadal was recovering from the injuries that ended his 2009 season. He came back to the circuit, losing in the finals of Qatar, before defaulting in the Australian Open quarter-finals. Was he unwise to come back so quickly, or did he get hurt during the tournament? What makes this season special is Nadal might have won the calendar Slam, as he went on to with the next three Grand Slams. Nadals‚Äôs tip prime: starting with Monte Carlo, Nadal went was 42‚Äì3 (93.3%), with 3 consecutive Slams and 6 titles out of 9 tournaments. #6 Djokovic 2015‚Äì2016: Djokovic was 82‚Äì6, won 11 tournaments, with 3 Grand Slams and the ATP Finals. While others regard this one of the all-time great seasons, it happened against a greatly diminished Nadal and a 34-year-old Federer who beat him three times that year. He had a bad loss that year against Karlovic in Qatar. But the worst thing was blowing his chance to win a calendar Slam by losing to Stan Wawrinka in the finals of Roland Garros. In 2016 (again with Nadal and Federer no longer a factor), he won the Australian and the French to hold all four titles at the same time. But bad losses kept popping up every third week, so he never had a real run of invincibility. And after winning the French, he only won one more tournament the rest of the year, while Murray took over the #1 ranking. Djokovic‚Äôs tip prime: From the 2015 Australian Open to the 2016 French Open, Djokovic won all four Slams, compiling a record of 118‚Äì8 (93.6%), and winning 12 of 16 tournaments. #5 Nadal 2013: Nadal was 75‚Äì7, won 10 tournaments and 2 Grand Slams. It doesn‚Äôt boast the same gaudy numbers as Federer and Djokovic‚Äôs best seasons, but there are a number of reasons I ranked it fourth overall: 1.¬†For the second time in his career, he came back from an injury that sidelined him since Wimbledon 2012 and regained the #1 ranking 2.¬†After being dominated by the younger Djokovic, he reversed their psychological dynamic beating the #1 player at the French, the Rogers Cup and at the US Open. Nadal‚Äôs tip prime: starting at the Brazil Open, Nadal played himself back into shape, winning two of three Slams, compiling a record of 56‚Äì2 (96.5%) and winning 10 out of 12 tournaments. #4 Nadal 2008: Nadal was 82-11, won 8 tournaments, 2 Grand Slams and the Olympic Gold Medal. While the overall season isn‚Äôt regarded as highly as some of the others, there‚Äôs a fantastic streak in the middle marked by the following special achievements: 1.¬†In spite of a freak loss to Juan Carlos Ferrero in Rome, Nadal won the last two clay court tournaments and finished it with one of the most dominating performances in the history of finals at Roland Garros, beating Federer 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì0. 2.¬†Nadal made a rare seamless transition to grass, winning the Artois Championships, followed by his legendary 9‚Äì7 in the fifth win over Federer at Wimbledon 3.¬†Nadal was still getting beaten by a lot of different players on hard courts that year, but put together a terrific run where he won the Canadian Open and then the Bejing Olympics. Nadal‚Äôs tip prime: starting with a Davis Cup match in April, Nadal won two consecutive Slams, plus a Gold Medal on three different surfaces, compiling a record of 52‚Äì2 (96.2%) and winning 8 out of 10 tournaments. Because Nadal won three ‚Äúmajors‚Äù (most people consider the Olympics almost as important as the Slams), on three different surfaces, I gave it the slightest edge over 2013. #3 Federer 2005‚Äì2006: Federer won 11 titles, and 2 Grand Slams. His 81‚Äì4 record makes this season as close as a tennis player will ever come to perfection because: 1.¬†Federer held at least one match point in three of his losses (Safin 9-7 in the fifth, Gasquet 7‚Äì6 in the third, and Nalbandian 7‚Äì6 in the fifth). That‚Äôs three points away from being 84‚Äì1, with 13 titles and the chance to win 3 Grand Slams and the Masters finals. (The only match where he didn‚Äôt have a chance to win was a four-set loss to Nadal at the French Open.) 2.¬†In the fall, Federer was injured in a training session, suffering torn ligaments in his ankle. After pulling out from Madrid, Basel and Paris and being confined to a cast and crutches for several weeks, Federer agreed to go to Shanghai for the Masters Finals after five top players pulled out due to injury or family matters. He was unsure if he would be able to play even two days from the start of the tournament, and somehow hobbled through the tournament before losing to Nalbandian in the finals. 3.¬†The loss ended his 35-match winning streak, and broke his record of 24 consecutive finals won. 2005 Roger Federer tennis season - Wikipedia 4.¬†In 2006, he won the Australian Open and another 15 straight matches. Federer‚Äôs tip prime: from the French Open semi-finals until his loss in the 2006 finals at Dubai, Federer won three consecutive Slams, compiling a record of 50‚Äì1 (98.0%), and winning 7 titles out of 8 tournaments. Or, you could count until his loss in Monte Carlos for a 68‚Äì2 (97.1%), winning 9 of 11 tournaments. Either way, it‚Äôs razor close to being the all-time best run of invincibility, but I still think it‚Äôs only number three. #2 Djokovic 2011: people overlook this season, focusing on 2015. But there is no comparison between the level of competition in 2011 and 2015. In 2011, Nadal is 25 and in his prime as the #1 player in the world. Federer is 29, turning 30 that August, and still formidable. Djokovic was 70‚Äì6, with 10 titles and 3 grand Slams. Injuries may have slowed him down, losing 4 matches to end the year, but here‚Äôs why it is by far his all-time best season: 1.¬†Djokovic was 7‚Äì16 head to head against Nadal, including 0‚Äì8 on clay. Djokovic was playing so great, he beat the Spaniard twice on the dirt, and went 6‚Äì0 overall against Nadal that year. 2.¬†In December 2010, Djokovic led Serbia to its first Davis Cup title, giving him a burst of confidence that would carry him to his greatest heights. 3.¬†Adding his 2 Davis Cup singles wins, Djokovic ran off 43 straight wins to start the 2011 season, for the fifth longest win streak in history. 4.¬†Federer bested Djokovic in four tough sets at the French Open semi-finals, which ended his streak, but he came back and won 15 straight matches, including Wimbledon, before retiring against Murray in the finals at Cincinnati. 5.¬†Djokovic recovered again to win the U.S. Open, hitting the riskiest (luckiest?) serve return winner I‚Äôve ever seen when down match point in the semis against Federer. Djokovic‚Äôs tip prime: Including Davis Cup, Djokovic went on a 66‚Äì2 run (97.0%), including 43 straight wins, with 3 Slams and 10 titles out of 12 tournaments played. Or, if you want to cut off his record before the second loss, Djokovic went on a 58‚Äì1 run (98.27%), with 2 Slams and 9 titles out of 11 tournaments. #1: Federer 2006‚Äì2007: Federer won 12 titles, 3 Grand Slams and the ATP Finals. His 92‚Äì5 record is .005 lower than 2005, but is even more incredible, as only two players in the world won matches against him, a 20-year-old Nadal, already the greatest clay court player in history, and a rising Andy Murray, about to enter the top 15. The season is notable for the following reasons: 1.¬†Out of 17 tournaments, he only lost one match that wasn‚Äôt in the finals. 2.¬†Out of his 5 losses, four would come against Nadal, of which 3 were on clay. (He beat Nadal once on grass and once indoors that year). 3.¬†Federer held match point against Nadal in the finals of Rome, but lost 7‚Äì6 in the fifth set. 4.¬†This might have been Federer‚Äôs best chance to win the calendar Slam, reaching a fourth set tie breaker in the final against Nadal. Federer‚Äôs tip prime: Federer started the season 32‚Äì1, winning the Australian and three other titles. After losing three clay court finals to Nadal including the French, Federer won 3 consecutive Slams, compiling a 59‚Äì1 record (98.33%), including 41 straight wins, and won 10 titles out of 11 tournaments played. Notes: the difference between Federer and Djokovic‚Äôs best runs really comes down to microscopic differences: 1) Djokovic lost to Federer at Roland Garros, instead of getting the chance to test Nadal; and 2) Federer was up two sets to love and match point at the US Open; and 3) Federer won three consecutive Slams while losing only one match over a period of seven months, while Djokovic won three non-consecutive Slams while losing two matches over a nine month period.

But the thing that makes this season so special is because he went 6‚Äì0 against Nadal and 4‚Äì1 Federer that year. No one has ever dominated against that level of competition.

There is only one problem.

He lost to Federer in the semifinals at the French Open that year. At his absolute peak. Against a guy 5 1/2 years older.

People just don‚Äôt remember how good Federer was.

In his prime, Federer was the second best player in the world on clay. Federer lost to Nadal in the semis and then three consecutive French Open finals between 2005 and 2008.

From 2005 up until the fourth round of the 2009 French Open, Nadal won 81 straight matches on clay and went 139‚Äì3. Only two players in the world beat him. One was Juan Carlos Ferrero and the other was Roger Federer, who did it twice. During that time, Djokovic was 0‚Äì10 against Nadal.

Even after he ‚Äúretired‚Äù from clay for two years in 2017 and 2018 to preserve his energy for Wimbledon, Federer could still play on the dirt. In 2019, he decided to play the French Open and reached the semis, losing to Nadal.

So not only do we have evidence of how good Federer was by using Nadal at his most invincible at a measuring stick, we have direct evidence.

[Update] Over the last six years, Djokovic has had a remarkable run of success, winning 12 majors after the age of 30, including 2 French Open titles. His performance has been an incredible feat of endurance, training and recovery discipline and a dedication to improving his game to make up for deteriorating physical skills.

Once again, we have to use Nadal as the standard for comparison. After the 2014 French Open, Nadal‚Äôs physical level fell off due to all his injuries and his grueling style of play. The following two years saw his ranking drop as low as #10 and he didn‚Äôt win a major again until the 2017 French Open. During that time, he added a new coach and had to change his style to play shorter points to preserve his body. As a result, he is a combined 0‚Äì13 against Djokovic and Federer on grass and hard courts since 2015.

Taking into account these physical limitations, there is no way to claim that Nadal‚Äôs level of play on clay from 2017‚Äì2022 was as good as it was from 2005‚Äì2013. And yet, he still beat the brakes off Djokovic.

In the 2020 French Open final, a rested Nadal gave Djokovic the worst loss of his career: 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì2, 7‚Äì5. In 2021, Nadal was hampered by a foot injury at the end of a loss to Djokovic at Roland Garros. Nadal tried to come back to the tour after resting 3 months, played two matches and then sat out the rest of the year.

The only way to judge the performance of an all-time great player is by the level of his competition.

That‚Äôs why Djokovic‚Äôs greatest clay court match was losing to Nadal 9‚Äì7 in the fifth in the 2013 Roland Garros semifinals. Nadal was basically still invincible on the red clay back then.

Federer‚Äôs highest level of clay court play was in the period of 2006‚Äì2008, when Nadal was at the height of his clay court powers, winning 81 matches in a row.

Federer served for the match against Nadal in the fifth set in the 2006 finals at Rome, and played a competitive 4-set match a couple of weeks later at Roland Garros. Just watch the highlights to see the level of speed with which these guys covered the court back then.

In 2007, Federer beat Nadal in the finals of Hamburg, breaking Nadal‚Äôs 81-match winning streak.

Could 2013 Djokovic have beaten 2006‚Äì2007 Federer on clay? There‚Äôs no way to know.

All we have is that one match in 2011 when Federer beat Djokovic at the absolute height of his career. Later that year, Federer had two match points against Djokovic at the U.S. Open, so I don‚Äôt think Federer‚Äôs play at the French was an aberration.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7ubatc392l8xwj0s', 'title': 'Who would have won between Federer and Djokovic at the French Open if they both played during their prime?', 'score': {'original': 0.36075714285714, 'ai': 0.63924285714286}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""In 2011, Djokovic had the greatest season of his career, way better than what he did in 2015 and after.

Otherwise, it would have been the greatest season by any of the Big 3.\n\nLon Shapiro\n ¬∑ 5y\nWho was the best in their tip prime, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, or Novak Djokovic?\nThis question has been raised many times before, with slightly different wording. You chose the phrase ‚Äútip prime,‚Äù which needs to be defined. Most tennis players and sports writers define ‚Äúprime‚Äù as being that period in an athlete‚Äôs career where they reached the top of their game (as evidenced by winning a Slam or achieving their highest ranking) and continuing until their age starts to limit them physically. Since we are focusing on these three all-time greats, we should compare them to what other all-time greats do at the start of their careers. Most multiple Slam winners win their first title before they turn 23 (List of Grand Slam singles champions in Open Era with age of first title - Wikipedia.) Federer won his first slam just before he turned 22. Djokovic won his first slam four months before he turned 21. Nadal won his first Slam as he turned 19. I believe that once a player wins a slam we have to consider that the beginning of their prime. (On the other hand, some players - Wawrinka, for example - underachieve for years before they finally combine the right attitude, training and coach to break through mentally and play their best tennis. They may have passed their physical peak, but the breakthrough is where you have to measure their prime.) I would also argue that a player‚Äôs prime ends at 28 years of age. The proof is that only a handful of the greatest players of the Open Era have won more than one slam after the age of 28. The exceptions are Laver, Rosewall, Newcombe, Connors, Sampras, Agassi, Wawrinka, Federer and Nadal. Djokovic turned 29 as the 2016 French Open began and won that event. He hasn‚Äôt won another title since then. If you want to know who is the greatest player of the three in their ‚Äúprimes,‚Äù the answer is clear. I did a deep dive into this subject by looking at each of the players‚Äô head-to-head records during their prime. The margins are very, very close, but the order still comes out the same as their grand slam records: 1) Federer; 2) Nadal; and 3) Djokovic: Lon Shapiro's answer"", 'result': {'fake': 0.0014, 'real': 0.9986}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'to At their peaks, how would you rank Nadal, Djokovic and Federer? For those people who argue for Djokovic, the biggest problem is he only dominates Federer and Nadal during his magical 2011 season, staying #1 for 53 weeks starting in July 2011. He was passed by Federer in 2012, regains #1 for 48 weeks in November 2012 and gets passed again by Nadal in October 2013. That‚Äôs only a total of 101 weeks at #1 while Federer and Nadal are in their primes. (Djokovic‚Äôs longest streak at #1 (122 weeks) comes between July 2014 and November 2016, at precisely the worst periods of Nadal‚Äôs and Federer‚Äôs play.) Nadal is ranked #1 on three separate occasions (2008, 2010, 2013) for a total of 141 weeks. That puts him clearly above Djokovic. Federer was ranked #1 (with Nadal #2), between July 2005 and August 2008, again in 2009, and again in 2012, approximately 221 weeks. For those who want to use the ‚Äúweaker era‚Äù argument, Nadal from age 19 to 22 was a far greater opponent than the older, weakened versions of Nadal and Federer from 2014‚Äì2016. His record is still clearly better than Djokovic. So what is a ‚Äútip prime?‚Äù My guess is you are describing what most people call a player‚Äôs ‚Äúpeak.‚Äù The difficulty with the word peak is to know where to draw the lines that define it. Is it one match? Is it one tournament? Is it a season? An entire year? Or some arbitrary number of months or year? The next problem is to compare one player‚Äôs peak to another. Djokovic might have had an amazing 2015 season, but Nadal (20 losses, no Slams past the quarters) and Federer (11 losses, including Seppi, Kyrgios, Wawrinkia, Ramos-Vinolas) were not playing anywhere near their old level. A lot of people have written about which player had the greatest single season, and most of them focus on Federer 2005, Federer 2006, Djokovic 2011, Connors 1974, McEnroe 1984, and Laver 1969 in the Open Era. Because you asked for the ‚Äútip prime,‚Äù I would like to analyze the best portion of each player‚Äôs best seasons. Here are the greatest seasons for these players: Federer (2005), Federer (2006), Nadal (2008), Nadal (2010), Djokovic (2011), Nadal (2013), and Djokovic (2015). There are amazing things to be pulled from parts of each of these seasons. Here are the all-time peaks for each player. I‚Äôll list them in reverse order: Honorable Mention, Nadal 2010: Nadal was 71‚Äì10, won 3 Grand Slams and 7 titles overall. However, this is the biggest what-if season. Nadal was recovering from the injuries that ended his 2009 season. He came back to the circuit, losing in the finals of Qatar, before defaulting in the Australian Open quarter-finals. Was he unwise to come back so quickly, or did he get hurt during the tournament? What makes this season special is Nadal might have won the calendar Slam, as he went on to with the next three Grand Slams. Nadals‚Äôs tip prime: starting with Monte Carlo, Nadal went was 42‚Äì3 (93.3%), with 3', 'result': {'fake': 0.1238, 'real': 0.8762}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'consecutive Slams and 6 titles out of 9 tournaments. #6 Djokovic 2015‚Äì2016: Djokovic was 82‚Äì6, won 11 tournaments, with 3 Grand Slams and the ATP Finals. While others regard this one of the all-time great seasons, it happened against a greatly diminished Nadal and a 34-year-old Federer who beat him three times that year. He had a bad loss that year against Karlovic in Qatar. But the worst thing was blowing his chance to win a calendar Slam by losing to Stan Wawrinka in the finals of Roland Garros. In 2016 (again with Nadal and Federer no longer a factor), he won the Australian and the French to hold all four titles at the same time. But bad losses kept popping up every third week, so he never had a real run of invincibility. And after winning the French, he only won one more tournament the rest of the year, while Murray took over the #1 ranking. Djokovic‚Äôs tip prime: From the 2015 Australian Open to the 2016 French Open, Djokovic won all four Slams, compiling a record of 118‚Äì8 (93.6%), and winning 12 of 16 tournaments. #5 Nadal 2013: Nadal was 75‚Äì7, won 10 tournaments and 2 Grand Slams.

Nadal was basically still invincible on the red clay back then.\n\nFederer‚Äôs highest level of clay court play was in the period of 2006‚Äì2008, when Nadal was at the height of his clay court powers, winning 81 matches in a row.\n\nFederer served for the match against Nadal in the fifth set in the 2006 finals at Rome, and played a competitive 4-set match a couple of weeks later at Roland Garros. Just watch the highlights to see the level of speed with which these guys covered the court back then.\n\nIn 2007, Federer beat Nadal in the finals of Hamburg, breaking Nadal‚Äôs 81-match winning streak.\n\nCould 2013 Djokovic have beaten 2006‚Äì2007 Federer on clay? There‚Äôs no way to know.\n\nAll we have is that one match in 2011 when Federer beat Djokovic at the absolute height of his career. Later that year, Federer had two match points against Djokovic at the U.S. Open, so I don‚Äôt think Federer‚Äôs play at the French was an', 'result': {'fake': 0.9972, 'real': 0.0028}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'aberration.', 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 29, 'credits': 1998637, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""In 2011, Djokovic had the greatest season of his career, way better than what he did in 2015 and after. There is no comparison between the level of competition in 2011 and 2015 or any year after.\n\nIn 2011, Nadal was 25 and in his prime as the #1 player in the world. Federer was 29, turning 30 that August, and still formidable. That year Djokovic went 70‚Äì6, with 10 titles and 3 grand Slams.\n\nIf you include the 2010 Davis Cup Finals, Djokovic went on a 66‚Äì2 run (97.0%), including 43 straight wins, with 3 Slams and 10 titles out of 12 tournaments played.\n\nInjuries and fatigue slowed him down at the tail end of the season, resulting in four losses. Otherwise, it would have been the greatest season by any of the Big 3.\n\nLon Shapiro\n ¬∑ 5y\nWho was the best in their tip prime, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, or Novak Djokovic?\nThis question has been raised many times before, with slightly different wording. You chose the phrase ‚Äútip prime,‚Äù which needs to be defined. Most tennis players and sports writers define ‚Äúprime‚Äù as being that period in an athlete‚Äôs career where they reached the top of their game (as evidenced by winning a Slam or achieving their highest ranking) and continuing until their age starts to limit them physically. Since we are focusing on these three all-time greats, we should compare them to what other all-time greats do at the start of their careers. Most multiple Slam winners win their first title before they turn 23 (List of Grand Slam singles champions in Open Era with age of first title - Wikipedia.) Federer won his first slam just before he turned 22. Djokovic won his first slam four months before he turned 21. Nadal won his first Slam as he turned 19. I believe that once a player wins a slam we have to consider that the beginning of their prime. (On the other hand, some players - Wawrinka, for example - underachieve for years before they finally combine the right attitude, training and coach to break through mentally and play their best tennis. They may have passed their physical peak, but the breakthrough is where you have to measure their prime.) I would also argue that a player‚Äôs prime ends at 28 years of age. The proof is that only a handful of the greatest players of the Open Era have won more than one slam after the age of 28. The exceptions are Laver, Rosewall, Newcombe, Connors, Sampras, Agassi, Wawrinka, Federer and Nadal. Djokovic turned 29 as the 2016 French Open began and won that event. He hasn‚Äôt won another title since then. If you want to know who is the greatest player of the three in their ‚Äúprimes,‚Äù the answer is clear. I did a deep dive into this subject by looking at each of the players‚Äô head-to-head records during their prime. The margins are very, very close, but the order still comes out the same as their grand slam records: 1) Federer; 2) Nadal; and 3) Djokovic: Lon Shapiro's answer to At their peaks, how would you rank Nadal, Djokovic and Federer? For those people who argue for Djokovic, the biggest problem is he only dominates Federer and Nadal during his magical 2011 season, staying #1 for 53 weeks starting in July 2011. He was passed by Federer in 2012, regains #1 for 48 weeks in November 2012 and gets passed again by Nadal in October 2013. That‚Äôs only a total of 101 weeks at #1 while Federer and Nadal are in their primes. (Djokovic‚Äôs longest streak at #1 (122 weeks) comes between July 2014 and November 2016, at precisely the worst periods of Nadal‚Äôs and Federer‚Äôs play.) Nadal is ranked #1 on three separate occasions (2008, 2010, 2013) for a total of 141 weeks. That puts him clearly above Djokovic. Federer was ranked #1 (with Nadal #2), between July 2005 and August 2008, again in 2009, and again in 2012, approximately 221 weeks. For those who want to use the ‚Äúweaker era‚Äù argument, Nadal from age 19 to 22 was a far greater opponent than the older, weakened versions of Nadal and Federer from 2014‚Äì2016. His record is still clearly better than Djokovic. So what is a ‚Äútip prime?‚Äù My guess is you are describing what most people call a player‚Äôs ‚Äúpeak.‚Äù The difficulty with the word peak is to know where to draw the lines that define it. Is it one match? Is it one tournament? Is it a season? An entire year? Or some arbitrary number of months or year? The next problem is to compare one player‚Äôs peak to another. Djokovic might have had an amazing 2015 season, but Nadal (20 losses, no Slams past the quarters) and Federer (11 losses, including Seppi, Kyrgios, Wawrinkia, Ramos-Vinolas) were not playing anywhere near their old level. A lot of people have written about which player had the greatest single season, and most of them focus on Federer 2005, Federer 2006, Djokovic 2011, Connors 1974, McEnroe 1984, and Laver 1969 in the Open Era. Because you asked for the ‚Äútip prime,‚Äù I would like to analyze the best portion of each player‚Äôs best seasons. Here are the greatest seasons for these players: Federer (2005), Federer (2006), Nadal (2008), Nadal (2010), Djokovic (2011), Nadal (2013), and Djokovic (2015). There are amazing things to be pulled from parts of each of these seasons. Here are the all-time peaks for each player. I‚Äôll list them in reverse order: Honorable Mention, Nadal 2010: Nadal was 71‚Äì10, won 3 Grand Slams and 7 titles overall. However, this is the biggest what-if season. Nadal was recovering from the injuries that ended his 2009 season. He came back to the circuit, losing in the finals of Qatar, before defaulting in the Australian Open quarter-finals. Was he unwise to come back so quickly, or did he get hurt during the tournament? What makes this season special is Nadal might have won the calendar Slam, as he went on to with the next three Grand Slams. Nadals‚Äôs tip prime: starting with Monte Carlo, Nadal went was 42‚Äì3 (93.3%), with 3 consecutive Slams and 6 titles out of 9 tournaments. #6 Djokovic 2015‚Äì2016: Djokovic was 82‚Äì6, won 11 tournaments, with 3 Grand Slams and the ATP Finals. While others regard this one of the all-time great seasons, it happened against a greatly diminished Nadal and a 34-year-old Federer who beat him three times that year. He had a bad loss that year against Karlovic in Qatar. But the worst thing was blowing his chance to win a calendar Slam by losing to Stan Wawrinka in the finals of Roland Garros. In 2016 (again with Nadal and Federer no longer a factor), he won the Australian and the French to hold all four titles at the same time. But bad losses kept popping up every third week, so he never had a real run of invincibility. And after winning the French, he only won one more tournament the rest of the year, while Murray took over the #1 ranking. Djokovic‚Äôs tip prime: From the 2015 Australian Open to the 2016 French Open, Djokovic won all four Slams, compiling a record of 118‚Äì8 (93.6%), and winning 12 of 16 tournaments. #5 Nadal 2013: Nadal was 75‚Äì7, won 10 tournaments and 2 Grand Slams. It doesn‚Äôt boast the same gaudy numbers as Federer and Djokovic‚Äôs best seasons, but there are a number of reasons I ranked it fourth overall: 1.\xa0For the second time in his career, he came back from an injury that sidelined him since Wimbledon 2012 and regained the #1 ranking 2.\xa0After being dominated by the younger Djokovic, he reversed their psychological dynamic beating the #1 player at the French, the Rogers Cup and at the US Open. Nadal‚Äôs tip prime: starting at the Brazil Open, Nadal played himself back into shape, winning two of three Slams, compiling a record of 56‚Äì2 (96.5%) and winning 10 out of 12 tournaments. #4 Nadal 2008: Nadal was 82-11, won 8 tournaments, 2 Grand Slams and the Olympic Gold Medal. While the overall season isn‚Äôt regarded as highly as some of the others, there‚Äôs a fantastic streak in the middle marked by the following special achievements: 1.\xa0In spite of a freak loss to Juan Carlos Ferrero in Rome, Nadal won the last two clay court tournaments and finished it with one of the most dominating performances in the history of finals at Roland Garros, beating Federer 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì0. 2.\xa0Nadal made a rare seamless transition to grass, winning the Artois Championships, followed by his legendary 9‚Äì7 in the fifth win over Federer at Wimbledon 3.\xa0Nadal was still getting beaten by a lot of different players on hard courts that year, but put together a terrific run where he won the Canadian Open and then the Bejing Olympics. Nadal‚Äôs tip prime: starting with a Davis Cup match in April, Nadal won two consecutive Slams, plus a Gold Medal on three different surfaces, compiling a record of 52‚Äì2 (96.2%) and winning 8 out of 10 tournaments. Because Nadal won three ‚Äúmajors‚Äù (most people consider the Olympics almost as important as the Slams), on three different surfaces, I gave it the slightest edge over 2013. #3 Federer 2005‚Äì2006: Federer won 11 titles, and 2 Grand Slams. His 81‚Äì4 record makes this season as close as a tennis player will ever come to perfection because: 1.\xa0Federer held at least one match point in three of his losses (Safin 9-7 in the fifth, Gasquet 7‚Äì6 in the third, and Nalbandian 7‚Äì6 in the fifth). That‚Äôs three points away from being 84‚Äì1, with 13 titles and the chance to win 3 Grand Slams and the Masters finals. (The only match where he didn‚Äôt have a chance to win was a four-set loss to Nadal at the French Open.) 2.\xa0In the fall, Federer was injured in a training session, suffering torn ligaments in his ankle. After pulling out from Madrid, Basel and Paris and being confined to a cast and crutches for several weeks, Federer agreed to go to Shanghai for the Masters Finals after five top players pulled out due to injury or family matters. He was unsure if he would be able to play even two days from the start of the tournament, and somehow hobbled through the tournament before losing to Nalbandian in the finals. 3.\xa0The loss ended his 35-match winning streak, and broke his record of 24 consecutive finals won. 2005 Roger Federer tennis season - Wikipedia 4.\xa0In 2006, he won the Australian Open and another 15 straight matches. Federer‚Äôs tip prime: from the French Open semi-finals until his loss in the 2006 finals at Dubai, Federer won three consecutive Slams, compiling a record of 50‚Äì1 (98.0%), and winning 7 titles out of 8 tournaments. Or, you could count until his loss in Monte Carlos for a 68‚Äì2 (97.1%), winning 9 of 11 tournaments. Either way, it‚Äôs razor close to being the all-time best run of invincibility, but I still think it‚Äôs only number three. #2 Djokovic 2011: people overlook this season, focusing on 2015. But there is no comparison between the level of competition in 2011 and 2015. In 2011, Nadal is 25 and in his prime as the #1 player in the world. Federer is 29, turning 30 that August, and still formidable. Djokovic was 70‚Äì6, with 10 titles and 3 grand Slams. Injuries may have slowed him down, losing 4 matches to end the year, but here‚Äôs why it is by far his all-time best season: 1.\xa0Djokovic was 7‚Äì16 head to head against Nadal, including 0‚Äì8 on clay. Djokovic was playing so great, he beat the Spaniard twice on the dirt, and went 6‚Äì0 overall against Nadal that year. 2.\xa0In December 2010, Djokovic led Serbia to its first Davis Cup title, giving him a burst of confidence that would carry him to his greatest heights. 3.\xa0Adding his 2 Davis Cup singles wins, Djokovic ran off 43 straight wins to start the 2011 season, for the fifth longest win streak in history. 4.\xa0Federer bested Djokovic in four tough sets at the French Open semi-finals, which ended his streak, but he came back and won 15 straight matches, including Wimbledon, before retiring against Murray in the finals at Cincinnati. 5.\xa0Djokovic recovered again to win the U.S. Open, hitting the riskiest (luckiest?) serve return winner I‚Äôve ever seen when down match point in the semis against Federer. Djokovic‚Äôs tip prime: Including Davis Cup, Djokovic went on a 66‚Äì2 run (97.0%), including 43 straight wins, with 3 Slams and 10 titles out of 12 tournaments played. Or, if you want to cut off his record before the second loss, Djokovic went on a 58‚Äì1 run (98.27%), with 2 Slams and 9 titles out of 11 tournaments. #1: Federer 2006‚Äì2007: Federer won 12 titles, 3 Grand Slams and the ATP Finals. His 92‚Äì5 record is .005 lower than 2005, but is even more incredible, as only two players in the world won matches against him, a 20-year-old Nadal, already the greatest clay court player in history, and a rising Andy Murray, about to enter the top 15. The season is notable for the following reasons: 1.\xa0Out of 17 tournaments, he only lost one match that wasn‚Äôt in the finals. 2.\xa0Out of his 5 losses, four would come against Nadal, of which 3 were on clay. (He beat Nadal once on grass and once indoors that year). 3.\xa0Federer held match point against Nadal in the finals of Rome, but lost 7‚Äì6 in the fifth set. 4.\xa0This might have been Federer‚Äôs best chance to win the calendar Slam, reaching a fourth set tie breaker in the final against Nadal. Federer‚Äôs tip prime: Federer started the season 32‚Äì1, winning the Australian and three other titles. After losing three clay court finals to Nadal including the French, Federer won 3 consecutive Slams, compiling a 59‚Äì1 record (98.33%), including 41 straight wins, and won 10 titles out of 11 tournaments played. Notes: the difference between Federer and Djokovic‚Äôs best runs really comes down to microscopic differences: 1) Djokovic lost to Federer at Roland Garros, instead of getting the chance to test Nadal; and 2) Federer was up two sets to love and match point at the US Open; and 3) Federer won three consecutive Slams while losing only one match over a period of seven months, while Djokovic won three non-consecutive Slams while losing two matches over a nine month period.\n\nBut the thing that makes this season so special is because he went 6‚Äì0 against Nadal and 4‚Äì1 Federer that year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one has ever dominated against that level of competition.\n\nThere is only one problem.\n\nHe lost to Federer in the semifinals at the French Open that year. At his absolute peak. Against a guy 5 1/2 years older.\n\nPeople just don‚Äôt remember how good Federer was.\n\nIn his prime, Federer was the second best player in the world on clay. Federer lost to Nadal in the semis and then three consecutive French Open finals between 2005 and 2008.\n\nFrom 2005 up until the fourth round of the 2009 French Open, Nadal won 81 straight matches on clay and went 139‚Äì3. Only two players in the world beat him. One was Juan Carlos Ferrero and the other was Roger Federer, who did it twice. During that time, Djokovic was 0‚Äì10 against Nadal.\n\nEven after he ‚Äúretired‚Äù from clay for two years in 2017 and 2018 to preserve his energy for Wimbledon, Federer could still play on the dirt. In 2019, he decided to play the French Open and reached the semis, losing to Nadal.\n\nSo not only do we have evidence of how good Federer was by using Nadal at his most invincible at a measuring stick, we have direct evidence.\n\n[Update] Over the last six years, Djokovic has had a remarkable run of success, winning 12 majors after the age of 30, including 2 French Open titles. His performance has been an incredible feat of endurance, training and recovery discipline and a dedication to improving his game to make up for deteriorating physical skills.\n\nOnce again, we have to use Nadal as the standard for comparison. After the 2014 French Open, Nadal‚Äôs physical level fell off due to all his injuries and his grueling style of play. The following two years saw his ranking drop as low as #10 and he didn‚Äôt win a major again until the 2017 French Open. During that time, he added a new coach and had to change his style to play shorter points to preserve his body. As a result, he is a combined 0‚Äì13 against Djokovic and Federer on grass and hard courts since 2015.\n\nTaking into account these physical limitations, there is no way to claim that Nadal‚Äôs level of play on clay from 2017‚Äì2022 was as good as it was from 2005‚Äì2013. And yet, he still beat the brakes off Djokovic.\n\nIn the 2020 French Open final, a rested Nadal gave Djokovic the worst loss of his career: 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì2, 7‚Äì5. In 2021, Nadal was hampered by a foot injury at the end of a loss to Djokovic at Roland Garros. Nadal tried to come back to the tour after resting 3 months, played two matches and then sat out the rest of the year.\n\nThe only way to judge the performance of an all-time great player is by the level of his competition.\n\nThat‚Äôs why Djokovic‚Äôs greatest clay court match was losing to Nadal 9‚Äì7 in the fifth in the 2013 Roland Garros semifinals. Nadal was basically still invincible on the red clay back then.\n\nFederer‚Äôs highest level of clay court play was in the period of 2006‚Äì2008, when Nadal was at the height of his clay court powers, winning 81 matches in a row.\n\nFederer served for the match against Nadal in the fifth set in the 2006 finals at Rome, and played a competitive 4-set match a couple of weeks later at Roland Garros. Just watch the highlights to see the level of speed with which these guys covered the court back then.\n\nIn 2007, Federer beat Nadal in the finals of Hamburg, breaking Nadal‚Äôs 81-match winning streak.\n\nCould 2013 Djokovic have beaten 2006‚Äì2007 Federer on clay? There‚Äôs no way to know.\n\nAll we have is that one match in 2011 when Federer beat Djokovic at the absolute height of his career. Later that year, Federer had two match points against Djokovic at the U.S. Open," so I don‚Äôt think Federer‚Äôs play at the French was an aberration."""""," 'aiModelVersion': '1'}""",0.360757143

Fahad Siddiqui,6y,Do you think that Federer can end 2017 as Number 1? What's the probability as a percentage?,"Federer is scheduled to play Basel (ATP 500), Shanghai (Master‚Äôs 1000), Paris (Master‚Äôs 1000) & ATP World Tour Finals (1500 points). If Federer wins all these 4 tournaments, he will end up securing 4000 points for himself, and along with that the no.1 position.

Nadal on the other hand is scheduled to play for 4500 points. That‚Äôs almost as many points as he won during the clay season this year. Winning any 2 tournaments along with deep finishes in the other 3 would be enough to help him secure the no.1 position (he will also play Beijing 500 in addition to all the tournaments mentioned above).

As things stand now, Federer has 7,505 points in the singles race which puts him 1,860 points behind Nadal‚Äôs 9,365. With around 4000 points remaining, I would say that the situation is ripe for a neck to neck finish. All Nadal has to do is win 2,140 points from the remainder of the tournaments and he is through.

But winning 2,140 points is not as easy as it sounds especially since all these tournaments are played in indoor courts which are pacier and thus Nadal‚Äôs least-favorite surface.

Here is the breakdown of points accumulated by Nadal post US-Open since 2010:

2010 - 1,510 points (won in Japan Open 500, 3rd round in Shanghai, Finals in ATP WTF)

2011 - 290 points (3R loss in Shanghai, 2 Round Robin losses in ATP WTF)

2012 - 0 points (Season ended after Wimbledon)

2013 - 2,020 points (Finals in Beijing and ATP WTF, SFs in Shanghai and Paris)

2014 - 225 points (suffering with appendicitis, he pulled out of Paris and ATP WTF)

2015 - 1,920 points (Finals in Beijing and Basel, SF in Shanghai, Paris and ATP WTF)

2016 - 225 Points (Hampered by injuries. Pulled out of the remainder of the season after Shanghai Open)

As we can see, Nadal has failed to accumulate 2,140 points in the last 6 seasons. He struggles to make finals or even semi finals here. He actually even failed to win these tournaments during his peak. 2 bad tournaments coupled with a stellar Federer season-end sweep could result in Federer sneaking ahead in the race.

That being said, it is unfair to assume that Federer will sweep all the tournaments that he will play in. Usually this is the part of season dominated by Djokovic and Murray. It will be interesting to see how Federer performs with both of them out of the picture. All it takes for Federer to lose the race is one bad tournament. For him to finish as world no.1, he has to partake in all these tournaments and end up winning them or making the finals (and praying Nadal sucks).

Here is the breakdown of points accumulated by Federer post US-Open since 2010:

2010 - 3,210 points (won Basel, Stockholm 250 and ATP WTF, Final in Shanghai, SF in Paris)

2011 - 3,000 points (Won Basel, Paris and ATP WTF. Did not play Shanghai)

2012 - 1,460 points (Final in Basel and ATP WTF, SF in Shanghai, Did not play Paris)

2013 - 1,150 points (Finals in Basel, SF in ATP WTF & Paris, 3rd round in Shanghai)

2014 - 2,860 points (Won in Basel and Shanghai, QF in Paris, Finals in ATP WTF)

2015 - 1,635 points (Won in Basel, 3rd round in Paris, 2nd Round in Shanghai, Finals ATP WTF)

2016 - 0 Points (withdrew after Wimbledon)

Even though Federer is more consistent in this part of the season, it is still advantage Nadal. This season, Nadal is as fit as he could be. That means Nadal is going to play all these tournaments and there will be no walk outs and withdrawals from his end.

Whenever Nadal play all the tournaments, he ends up winning at least 1,500 points. That is likely going to be the case this season as well. Therefore, for Federer to clinch the ranking, he would have to win more than 3,300 points. A feat he has not achieved in the last 7 seasons! (I haven‚Äôt seen the records prior to 2010)

The only seasons where Federer has won more than 1,860 points than Nadal during this time of the season in the last 7 years were in the years 2011 and 2014. During both these seasons, Nadal did not play all the tournaments. He was unfit. That will not be the case this season.

Federer is still hanging in there with an outside chance to clinch the ranking, but it is unlikely that he will win all the 4 tournaments. For Federer to end as year end no.1, he is going to need the best he has ever performed during this time of the season. It appears unlikely! The probability, therefore, is quite low.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/69e5jktqng8bodzx', 'title': ""Do you think that Federer can end 2017 as Number 1?

2. Ace-King combination

Anna Kournikova hasn‚Äôt won a single Professional Tournament in singles in the whole professional career. Poker players named the Ace-King combination after her because it looks good but almost never wins.

3. ‚ÄúMixed handedness‚Äù

Rafael Nadal plays with his left hand even though he was born right-handed. His uncle taught him to hold a tennis racket with his left hand when Nadal was 12 years old. He explained it to Rafael that the left-handed players can enjoy an advantage over their right-handed opponents because they‚Äôre uncomfortable to play with as they strike into the opposite direction and can make the ball whirl in an inconvenient for the right-handed players way.

4. Tennis during the Second World War

In 1943, in summer, Moscow Open Tennis Tournament should have been taken place, but it appeared that there were no tennis balls anywhere in Moscow. The only factory that was producing tennis balls, ‚ÄúKrasniy Treugolnyk‚Äù (‚ÄòRed Triangle‚Äô) was located in Leningrad (today‚Äôs St. Petersburg) that was under siege at that time and was almost destroyed during German bombardments. Russians managed to find tennis balls in the destroyed storehouses of the factory. However, they were all drained and covered with mold. Therefore, they had to pump up those balls full with the help of ultra-thin needles and then whiten them.

Vibhakar T S (‡≤µ‡≤ø‡≤≠‡≤æ‡≤ï‡≤∞‡≥ç ‡≤ü‡≤ø ‡≤é‡≤∏‡≥ç),Updated 2y,"Why did Novak Djokovic struggle in plexicushion hard court surface in Japan Olympics, which look similar to Rod Laver arena in Australia?","Novak Djokovic was touted to be the favourite to win the Olympic gold this time around in tennis. It was no surprise as he was in a red hot form coming into the tournament.

He had won his favourite Australian open earlier in the year, French open by beating the favourite Rafael Nadal and Wimbledon open.

Add to that, the legendary players like Nadal, Federer and Murray (in the middle) pulling out of the games. It was literally supposed to be a cakewalk for the World no.1.

And till semifinals, there was no sign of any unexpected result. He hadn't dropped a set till then.

But..

On the given day of semifinal, how good was Zverev ! He beat the world no.1 after being 1‚Äì6, 1‚Äì3 down..!! He had the nerves of steel.

As a result, Djokovic‚Äôs dream of achieving the golden slam came to an end.

In the bronze medal match too, he lost against Busta of Spain after giving a tough fight. He pulled out of the mixed doubles bronze medal match due to an injury suffered in the men's singles bronze medal match. So, he had to leave the games empty handed.

Now, here are some of the reasons why, I feel, Djokovic failed in the games-

Playing too many tournaments without break - Yes. He has been playing many tournaments without a break. As soon as he won the French open, he sensed an opportunity of achieving the golden slam. He hence participated in Wimbledon open and won there too. While his body needed rest, he didn't listen to it and took part in the games.
Hectic Olympic schedule - In Olympics, there would hardly be any rest day. The players will have to play in consecutive days for most of the games. Add to that his age. He's 34 and it's difficult to sustain the calmness for a longer period of time.
Playing both singles and mixed double events - I guess that's the biggest reason for his failure. He could've avoided playing in mixed doubles. The schedule was already tough and playing one more game daily for about couple of sets would've led him to heavy fatigue.
Opponent better on the day - Of course, Djokovic is a master on hard courts. But the new generation players are very very good on hard court. They can beat any player on hard courts on the given day. The examples of recent support the fact (Tsitsipas beating Nadal in Australian open 2021).
Crowd (!?) - This is on a funnier note. Djokovic rises to his own when the crowd tried to demoralise him. But due to no crowds in the stadium, there was no factor of demoralisation for the Serbian. Somewhere it would've played a part in his loss.

Here's what Djokovic had to say about his journey in the Games-

‚ÄúI do have a regret for not winning a medal for my country and opportunities missed both in mixed doubles and singles and, yeah, I just didn't deliver yesterday and today.

The level of tennis dropped also due to exhaustion, you know, mentally and physically.

Djokovic told to reporters.

He's a champion player and is known for the comeback. I'm pretty sure he'd comeback in style at US Open where he would be having an opportunity of achieving a rare calender slam.

Randy Watkins,5y,Should Naomi Osaka give back the US Open title in solidarity with Serena Williams?,"This is an extremely leading question that assumes the following:

Mr. Ramos (the chair umpire) treated Serena unfairly.
Mr. Ramos ill-treated Serena because she is a woman.
After decades of enforcing rules consistently across gender lines, Mr. Ramos singled out Serena Williams, the most notable female figure in the sport, in front of millions of viewers, to administer unfair punitive measures.
Chair umpires should not enforce the rules at the US Open final.
Professional tennis treats women so unfairly that solidarity is necessary to fight for their cause.
Naomi Osaka should feel she did not earn the U.S. Open title but rather received it unjustly in a manner that is an oppression to women everywhere.
Those who scream the loudest should be rewarded for their ridiculous behavior.
Serena William‚Äôs harsh reaction to an umpire professionally and correctly enforcing the rules is a great example for impressionable female players everywhere.

Instead of elaborating on the absurdity of these assumptions, I offer the following:

Naomi Osaka has revered Serena Williams for most of her life. She always dreamed of playing against her idol in a major final and winning a tough competitive match. She stated on a talk show after the final, that she was crying because she felt the crowd may be booing her because they did not get the winner they wanted. She felt so privileged that Serena recognized she was crying and consoled her. She didn‚Äôt understand what was going on mainly because during the match she was extremely focused on what she had set out to accomplish.

She stated that she will go back and review everything so she can understand what happened. When she does, it would be reasonable for her to lose her reverence for Serena and lower her opinion of her idol, but I doubt that she will.

She fulfilled her dream of winning the major title against Serena Williams, but instead of joy, she experienced sadness and pain. Instead of experiencing the thrill of victory, she felt compelled to apologize for winning. This caused because Serena threw a tantrum, not because she was being treated unfairly, but because she was getting soundly beaten in a major final.

I think the answer to the question above is completely obvious.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lw6r4iyfukj1zogv', 'title': 'Should Naomi Osaka give back the US Open title in solidarity with Serena Williams?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This is an extremely leading question that assumes the following:\n\nMr. Ramos (the chair umpire) treated Serena unfairly.\nMr. Ramos ill-treated Serena because she is a woman.\nAfter decades of enforcing rules consistently across gender lines, Mr. Ramos singled out Serena Williams, the most notable female figure in the sport, in front of millions of viewers, to administer unfair punitive measures.\nChair umpires should not enforce the rules at the US Open final.\nProfessional tennis treats women so unfairly that solidarity is necessary to fight for their cause.\nNaomi Osaka should feel she did not earn the U.S. Open title but rather received it unjustly in a manner that is an oppression to women everywhere.\nThose who scream the loudest should be rewarded for their ridiculous behavior.\nSerena William‚Äôs harsh reaction to an umpire professionally and correctly enforcing the rules is a great example for impressionable female players everywhere.\n\nInstead of elaborating on the absurdity of these assumptions, I offer the following:\n\nNaomi Osaka has revered Serena Williams for most of her life.

Lon Shapiro,6y,Why has Grigor Dimitrov not lived up to his potential?,"There is a whole generation of incredible players (Gasquet, Tsonga, Berdych, Nishikori, Verdasco, Monfils, Goffin and Raonic, etc) who have fallen short of the Big Four in terms of breaking into the top rankings or winning Slams. Dimitrov is just one more great player who, for various reasons, has been unable to break through.

Calling Dimitrov ‚ÄúBaby Fed‚Äù is not only unfortunate because of the ridiculous extra pressure it put on him as a young player, but is inaccurate on many levels (even though it is a tidy literary trope we are all guilty of using):

Technique: Dimitrov‚Äôs one-handed backhand is super wristy and looks much closer to Richard Gasquet. His serve isn‚Äôt a weapon like Federer‚Äôs. And he is not as comfortable flattening out his forehand and taking balls on the rise. Also, Federer is unique among players for his ability to hit offensive shots off the half volley when an opponent hits a deep serve return or groundstroke.

Style: Dmitrov is one of those guys who can do a lot of things really well, but doesn‚Äôt have one single unique attribute that is outstanding. To have early success, a player needs to do something at an other worldly level which means he only has to focus on playing one way. Examples are Becker‚Äôs serve on grass, Chang‚Äôs legs on clay and Nadal‚Äôs topspin forehand and fighting spirit on clay. Guys like Dmitrov and David Goffin don‚Äôt have the weapons to blow someone off a court, like Tsonga did at age 23 to Nadal at the 2008 Australian Open.

Dmitrov just turned 26 and is still figuring out how to play the big points. At present, he has reached two semi-finals at the Slams, compared to none for Stan Wawrinka at the same stage of his career.

Training: Dmitrov, like many young players, enjoyed a spectacular rise in the rankings on the strength of their natural talent and youthful energy. As other players learned his game, the matches get tougher and he begin to feel the grind of the tour. In 2015, he started working with Larry Stefanki, a coach famous for getting Roddick into the shape of his life when his ranking started to drop off. Dmitrov.

Mental Toughness: Like many young stars, Dmitrov wasn‚Äôt ready for primetime as soon as pundits thought he was. It is very rare for young players to reach the top without going through a period of taking some knocks and paying their dues. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are geniuses and freaks of nature. Even all-time greats like Agassi and Sampras have had great early results, then fell back until they matured more.

Dmitrov destroyed world #3 Andy Murray in straight sets at the 2014 Wimbledon quarter-finals, then had a competitive 4-set match with world #1 Djokovic in the semis, and reached #8 in the world at 23. He lost focus, firing his coach, and started losing. Over the last year and a half, he started to climb back into the top 10, so his trajectory seems pretty normal to me.

Surfaces: Back in the old days, before the surface and balls speeds were adjusted to be more uniform, players who were specialists on a particular surface (especially grass and clay) could sneak up on the field a win Slam titles. In spite of Sampras‚Äô dominance at Wimbledon, ...

Nathan Stanish,1y,What do you think of Roger Federer's retirement from tennis at 41?,"We all knew it was coming, but it‚Äôs still sad to see.

Somehow, none of us wanted to believe the Federer era was over. We all wanted to see one last run at Wimbledon, one Grand Slam match, and one last battle against Djokovic or Nadal. Alas, it wasn‚Äôt to be.

Only Federer could keep us believing he could come back. He‚Äôs 41 years old now, and hasn‚Äôt been on tour in over a year. Yet millions of fans around the world still waited with bated breath for the announcement that he was back in form and winning again. That‚Äôs what happens when you witness Federer pull off the greatest comebacks in the history of tennis.

How many people thought Federer was washed up and ready to retire after 2016? He was turning 35, struggling with knee and back injuries (and later surgery), failed to win a single title for the first time since 2000, and even fell out of the Top 15. He just couldn‚Äôt keep up. Then the magic happened.

Federer roared back into action with an unbelievable 2017 season, winning his 18th and 19th Grand Slams, including a record 8th Wimbledon. Along the way, he beat Nadal in all 3 of their meetings and managed a 54‚Äì5 record, rising to No.2 and proving he was far from retiring. And it only continued into 2018, when he won his 20th Grand Slam at the Australian Open, and finally reclaimed his spot as No.1 in the world, becoming the oldest No.1 in ATP history.

Federer reigned in the Top 3 all the way through 2019, after making another historic run at Wimbledon to reach the finals. 37 years old and he was still one of the best players in the world, only narrowly losing to Novak Djokovic after nearly 5 hours on court.

Finally, things slowed down in 2020 as he underwent more surgery, and it seemed like Federer was winding down for a long-overdue retirement. Or so we thought. Sure enough, Federer bounced back in 2021 to make one last run at Wimbledon, becoming the oldest quarterfinalist (39!) in the Open era, and defying expectations one last time. Then surgery hit again, he stopped playing for a year, and now he‚Äôs officially decided to retire from tennis.

What a career. At least, in a fitting swan song, Federer will be playing his last matches at the Laver Cup, alongside Djokovic, Nadal, and Murray, marking the first time the Big 4 plays together and the last time we‚Äôll ever see them together on the tour.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kn51lvpm8odhuc0r', 'title': ""What do you think of Roger Federer's retirement from tennis at 41?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9718, 'ai': 0.0282}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'We all knew it was coming, but it‚Äôs still sad to see.\n\nSomehow, none of us wanted to believe the Federer era was over.

Sri Krishna,Updated 10y,What is your favorite tennis moment?,"Ok, I'm going to pick a pretty unconventional, but nevertheless exhilarating tennis moment. Something that just turned the sagging fortunes of a man around. After winning that crucial point , somehow everything sorted itself out and That man went on to win the Tournament, thus becoming the 6th ever person to achieve a career Grand slam. Yes that person is the Swiss Maestro, Roger Federer and the Tournament was French Open 2009. To fully understand and appreciate the gravity of that moment, that shot, lets quickly recap what preceded it.

BACKGROUND

The year 2008 is a sort of a watershed year in tennis. 2 very significant things happened:

Roger Federer, who dominated the game like it was nobody's business for the past 4 years ushering in an era of absolute dominance never before seen on a tennis court, fell from his throne and his invincibility waned rapidly




The meteoric surge of Rafael Nadal from a clay court genius to an all court player.


Nadal manhandled Federer in the Roland Garros 2008 final that year handing him the worst defeat of his career in a Grand Slam(6-1,6-3,6-0), thus thwarting the Swiss Maestro's 3rd consecutive attempt to capture the title.

Then, Wimbledon happened. Roger Federer who was on an unbeaten 5 tournament streak at SW 19 lost in 5 excrutiatingly closely fought sets to Rafael Nadal in the finals. Nadal was the crowned the new King. The King of the lawns and beyond, The world no.1 was finally his.

Federer somehow managed to save himself the blushes and went on to take the US Open 2008, thus saving what had been quite an ordinary year by his standards(1 SF, 2 Finals, 1 GS.. Yeah, ordinary)


ENTER THE YEAR 2009

A year that would prove to be iconic in more than one way.

We Fed fans were hoping Fed would be back to his winning ways. But Oh well, that was not the script that was in store for us. The script was a bit more tortuous, more dramatic.

Federer and Nadal met yet again in the finals of the Australian Open and Nadal dealt Federer yet another 5 set death blow. This was their 3rd final in less than a year, all 3 having been won by Nadal. This humiliation was further capped by a public meltdown where Federer just broke down, sobbing uncontrollably.
The nightmare would just not end. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide.



Wait, did you think things couldn't get any worse?! Oh, but it did.
Yet. Another. Meltdown. In a match against Djokovic at Miami, Federer just went nuts and smashed his racquet, shattering its frame completely. Federer . Never. Smashes. Racquets. Bizarre. Just Bizarre. This was the Rock Bottom. Federer was mentally crushed. So were his fans.

On top of that Federer told the press he was looking forward to clay!. This in particular tickled my funny bone. Talk about Bizarre statements. He couldn't do jack squat on Hard courts, what could he do on his weakest surface, especially when Nadal was in the form of his life?! Frankly as a fan, there were 0 expectations.

CLAY SEASON 2009

Madrid Masters happened. Federer and Nadal again in the finals. On clay. We know how that goes. I didn't even bother watching. So it did surprise me(to put it mildly) when I learned he beat Nadal in straight sets!!.. And his finger wag after the victory. It indicated something. This man was back from the dead.

Yeah, don't mess with me.

But this victory did nothing to boost my expectations for The French Open. I fully expected Nadal to win RG for the 5th consecutive time and after last year's finals I had reconciled myself to the very plausible idea that Federer may never win the French.

But then came the mother of all surprises, in the form of ROBIN ""GODSEND"" SODERLING. He packed Rafa off in 4 sets becoming the first man ever(the only man till now) to take down Rafa at the French.

Now, this French Open was Federer's to take. The Draw was wide open.

Federer was to play Tommy Haas in the fourth round of the French Open, a day after Soderling vanquished Nadal. I expected it to be a breeze. But boy, was I in for a shock.

FIrst set, Federer served admirably, and yet ended up losing 7-6.

Second set Roger was shanking left, right and centre.. putting on an ugly, unwatchable performance and in that process, losing that set too..

Federer was down two sets to love, apparently following Rafa on his way out.

The errors continued to flow thick and fast even in the 3rd set.

So finally we arrive at ""The Moment""

THE MOMENT


It was 4-4 in the 3rd set. Federer was serving .Tommy was up 2 sets to love. And another spate of errors from helped Tommy go up break point.

It was 30-40. Staring down the barrel now.

Federer was hanging by a thread and Tommy was on the cusp of a legendary victory.

A rally ensues at Break Point and on predictable lines, Tommy takes control of it. Federer runs around his backhand and WHAM!! He takes a wild crack at the ball, inside-out Forehand, My heart almost sank..I think it actually stopped beating for a second or two..I expected it would go out like many other balls from Federer did that day! But it catches the line. Oh! It catches the frikkin line!!! Unbelievable. What a shot at what a crucial juncture. I'm telling you, had he lost that point, Roger would have been knocked out. The relief on Federer's face said it all.

Yeah that's the look.

That Forehand liberated him, it set his mind free, it reminded him of who he was. He got out of jail there. It was the magic potion which he so badly needed. From that point on I knew , this match was over and Federer was gonna stomp over Haas, which was precisely what happened and order was restored at last.

And of one more thing I was pretty certain once that Forehand went in:

The French Open was coming home baby! Yeah! Finally!!

Sweet kiss of accomplishment

If Roger Federer has to credit any one single shot that brought him eternal glory and immortality, it has to be this insane inside out Forehand against Haas on Break point. The single most important shot he has ever hit.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4i6nckhpjy5mfuw1', 'title': 'What is your favorite tennis moment?', 'score': {'original': 0.79966666666667, 'ai': 0.20033333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Ok, I'm going to pick a pretty unconventional, but nevertheless exhilarating tennis moment.

Before the official inauguration and in  private... we put the video  on for Rafa... the 50 best points of his  career.

Vikram Balaji,5y,What do you think was the major problem with yesterday‚Äôs tennis match between Serena and Osaka?,"I don't wish to delve into the hyperbolic tantrums thrown by Serena, as we are used to seeing her go off her rocker in a defeat. But what was repugnant to me was the distasteful, detestable gesture of the US Crowd, and some of the organizers.

Katrina Adams, The chairman of the board and president of USTA , started out by saying,

Perhaps this is not the finish we were looking for today, but Serena, you are quite a champion of champions, and Naomi, welcome to the big stage.

I was shocked to hear these words from the madam president. She was more focused on consoling Serena for the defeat than congratulating Naomi for putting up an inspiring performance to defeat the greatest women's tennis player of all time.

No wonder, we all like to see our favorite players win. No wonder, we all get shattered when someone pulls an upset of this sort, but to explicitly express that before such a large crowd, so as to bring down the morale of the young champion was completely in bad taste. Perhaps, the president must have exercised a little bit of discretion in making such unseemly statements.

In fact, Serena herself did not show much grace in defeat. She extended a cursory congratulations to her nemesis and started engaging with the crowd. Some of her words,

I'm sure that's not what we came to expect, and I'm sure we shall get through this quickly, (With a craned face)

Ostentatiously exposed her puerility and lack of grace in defeat. But I don't have much problems with that, because as players, we tend to let our emotions take the best of us.

However, the major problem, according to me, was the lack of respect showed by the disgraceful US crowd. They time and again booed the young champion and made her feel bad for defeating the best player in women's history.

After all, was it the fault of the young champion? The first player ever to win a Grand Slam for Japan? She was thoroughly embarrassed for no fault of hers. She felt so bad that she started out by apologizing to the crowd for defeating Serena.

She even sidestepped the question of how it felt to defeat her own role model Serena. This clearly shows that the young champion was deeply hurt. She hung her head in shame and would have probably cursed herself for defeating Serena.

Thanks to the US Crowd.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/homw9egl3q4f1t27', 'title': 'What do you think was the major problem with yesterday‚Äôs tennis match between Serena and Osaka?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I don't wish to delve into the hyperbolic tantrums thrown by Serena, as we are used to seeing her go off her rocker in a defeat.

Elyse Scott,05-Jan,Is Rafael Nadal's loss against Jordan Thompson an indication that he is not ready to compete at the Australian Open?,"Unclear right now. He had pain in the area of his hip surgery, and he looked off as the third set progressed. He said it was not the same kind of pain that he experienced last year, so it could be muscular. That match was much more physical than the other two, which he won pretty easily, and it was the first time he played two days in a row.

I‚Äôm being optimistic and think that this is something, in the past, he would have played through. But when you‚Äôve had surgery, every pain in the area is scary. It takes a while for you to trust that the injury won‚Äôt reoccur.

I, personally, would have liked to see him skip this part of the season and start on the clay in South America (kinder on the body, especially the joints).

Nathan Stanish,Updated 1y,What is Rafael Nadal's best victory?,"That‚Äôs a tough call. In my opinion, it‚Äôs his 2022 Australian Open win over Daniil Medvedev.

There‚Äôs a lot of backstory to this win.

For one, Nadal had just missed half of the 2022 season for a recurring foot injury that had bothered him for months. This was the same foot injury that had bothered him, off-and-on, since 2005 thanks to a rare birth defect, and Nadal was almost ready to finally throw in the towel and retire, so that he could get the necessary surgery.

But instead, Nadal decided to return to the tour, making his comeback at the 2021 Mubadala World Tennis Championship, where he promptly lost in straight sets to Andy Murray. Then, he followed that up with a 3-set loss to Denis Shapovalov. Overall? Not great.

Still, Nadal was determined. He always has been. He dusted himself off, kept up the training, and launched himself into the 2022 season with everything he had.

Nadal started the 2022 season by winning in Melbourne without dropping a set, although he never faaced a seeded opponent and faced a few tiebreakers. Next up was the Australian Open, which looked like a much bigger challenge.

The Australian Open was Nadal‚Äôs least successful Grand Slam. He‚Äôd only won it once, and that was 13 years ago. If you had to pick a Grand Slam tournament he was least likely to win, this was the one.

Worst of all was his opponent: Daniil Medvedev, the same man who dispatched Novak Djokovic in straight sets at the US Open. That‚Äôs the same Novak Djokovic who won the first three Grand Slams of the year. Medvedev wasn‚Äôt supposed to stand a chance, but he won handily. The last time Nadal faced Medvedev, Daniil won in 3 sets. And that was only a year ago, on hard court. For a 35-year-old man trying to make a comeback from a foot injury, this was worst-case-scenario in many ways.

But it got worse. At his age, Nadal needed a quicker match. He couldn‚Äôt afford to rely on endurace against an opponent 10 years younger, especially on a faster hard court surface like the Australian Open. Instead, Medvedev dominated the first set (6‚Äì2) and polished off the second set with a close tiebreaker.

Nadal, the 35-year-old player just coming off a season-ending injury‚Ä¶ was now down 2 sets against the man who destroyed Djokovic in straight sets at the last Grand Slam. Again, this was worst-case scenario.

But never underestimate Rafael Nadal. His mental strength is unparalleled on the tour. He started fighting back, breaking Medvedev for a 6‚Äì4 win in the third set, then maintain that momentum in th fourth set for another 6‚Äì4 win, then finally battled his way to a 7‚Äì5 win in the deciding set. That match took 5 and a half hours, far longer than Nadal would have liked, but he did it. And thanks to that win, Nadal lead the Grand Slam race for the first time in his entire career.

That win really boosted Nadal‚Äôs 2022 season, as well. His wins at the Australian Open contributed to a 20-match winning streak, his best start to a season ever. Only an injury broke the streak. And later that year, Nadal beat Djokovic himself at the French Open, before winning his 22nd Grand Slam, increasing his lead. I don‚Äôt think anybody expected that from him, not after the injuries he‚Äôs suffered.

Fans and analysts, ever since Nadal debuted, have questioned his potential longevity. His style was so physically demanding, so dynamic, that surely he couldn‚Äôt keep it up as long as Federer or Djokovic could keep up. These wins proved them all wrong. Even at 35, even at 36, Nadal could still compete with the best and the youngest talent on the tour. Yes, his style is physically demanding and for an ordinary player, shouldn‚Äôt be sustainable. But Nadal is no ordinary player. He is a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon and one of the greatest sportsman in history. Bravo Nadal.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2g0rijawydtcsuxn', 'title': ""What is Rafael Nadal's best victory?"", 'score': {'original': 0.29195, 'ai': 0.70805}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'That‚Äôs a tough call.

Racket Kingdom,10-Feb,"In tennis, how long do you have to call the ball out after it lands?","In tennis, the rule states that calls (out or let) must be made immediately after the ball has gone out of play, but before either opponent has had the opportunity to return the shot. This means you have a very limited window to make the call.

Here are some key points to remember:

""Immediately"" is the key word: Don't wait to see if your opponent will hit the ball, call it out as soon as you know it's out.
Don't call before the ball lands: This can be seen as unsportsmanlike and potentially give your opponent an advantage.
Late calls have consequences: If you call late and your opponent has already started their swing, the point might be replayed or even awarded to your opponent.
Doubles vs. Singles: In doubles, you can still call a ball ""out"" if your partner lets it bounce first. However, this option doesn't exist in singles.

Remember, sportsmanship and fair play are crucial in tennis, so be honest and call the ball as soon as you know it's out.

Lon Shapiro,4y,How do you rate the tennis skills of Stanislas Wawrinka?,"To unpack this question, we need to break down Wawrinka‚Äôs game into three categories: technique; movement and conditioning; and, mental toughness.

#1: TECHNIQUE

Stan Wawrinka doesn‚Äôt get the acclaim of the Big 3, but one could argue that his ball striking abilities are better than any player of his generation. If he has time to set up and hit the ball, he can outhit anyone.

Just look at what he did in the 2015 French Open, as he crushed Federer and Djokovic. In that tournament, his opponents‚Äô attacking shots were muted by the heavy, slow conditions. Wawrinka had time to set up and he simply hit them off the court.

Backhand: Wawrinka is one of only two players with a one-handed backhand who has been able to consistently step in and attack Nadal‚Äôs high bouncing cross court topspin forehands (The other was Ljubicic, who is 6‚Ä≤4‚Ä≥ - Federer has only done it for the last three years). He is also one of the only players ever who could consistently dominate Djokovic in backhand to backhand rallies.

I‚Äôve written about his backhand before: Lon Shapiro's answer to Who on the professional tour has the best one-handed backhand?

From a technique perspective, I would use Wawrinka as the ideal model to from which to learn the topspin backhand. His stroke is simple, compact and rock solid, regardless of whether he hits a low ball or a high ball.

Wawrinka is one of the few players in the world whose backhand is so good that he doesn‚Äôt even need to run around it to hit inside out forehand. In his matches against Djokovic, he could hit winners with his cross court backhand, or crush untouchable balls up the line.

While Federer has more variety and a far better slice backhand, Wawrinka‚Äôs topspin backhand is able to neutralize Djokovic, and that says a lot.

Forehand: Wawrinka hits a semi-western forehand like most of his contemporaries, but his swing is simpler and more compact than Djokovic:

Serve: Wawrinka is shorter than his Big 3 competitors, but he is the only one who is capable of hitting 130 mph. If he is hitting in those bombs consistently, he becomes very tough to break. Also, his kick second serve is good enough to give him time to set up and crush his first shot off the ground.

While he can generates power effortlessly, his slice serve isn‚Äôt at the same level as Federer, so he doesn‚Äôt dominate opponents as thoroughly as the Swiss #1.

Wawrinka is in the top 10 this year in 2nd serve points won, and fewest double faults, but he is #72 in 1st serve percentage, which drags down his percentage of service games won (#12 overall). If Wawrinka gets hot with his first serve, those are the tournaments when he can become a monster.

Serve Return: This has been Wawrinka‚Äôs biggest weakness, as he rarely drives the ball on the first serve. Because he chips the ball so much, players gain the advantage in rallies and hold serve easier.

Interesting notes about Wawrinka vs Djokovic: In 2013, when Djokovic was battling for #1, Wawrinka put his game together and forced the Serb to go to the distance at the Australian Open (12‚Äì10 in the 5th) and the US Open (6‚Äì4 in the 5h). While enjoying one of his greatest tennis seasons ever in 2015, Djokovic got manhandled by Wawrinka at the French Open, and lost again to Wawrinka in the 2016 US Open finals.

Wawrinka is now 34 years old, and in the midst of a long come back from injuries and jumped from 66 at the start of the year to his current ranking of 23.

Meanwhile, Djokovic has had a dominant run at #1, but has shown vulnerability in the early matches of tournaments. He is also battling a left shoulder injury.

These two players play a night match at the Open today, September 1st. If there‚Äôs some humidity, the conditions could be very slow and it would give Wawrinka the chance to use his power to pull off a huge upset.

I think this might be Djokovic‚Äôs toughest match. Unless his body lets him down, he has been unbeatable in the late rounds of Grand Slams, winning 4 of the last 5.

#2: MOVEMENT & CONDITIONING

Wawrinka has never been a great mover. This weakness is highlighted by his lack of success at Wimbledon, where the combination of fast courts and poor footing helps players like Djokovic, Federer and Nadal even though Wawrinka hits the ball harder than they do.

Wawrinka has won titles at the Australian, French and US Open, but has never gone past the quarters on grass. Movement is why Murray won enough to be considered for a while as part of the Big 4, while the Stanimal has only been considered a possible spoiler.

Wawrinka struggled for many years when he was young because his poor movement was magnified by poor conditioning.

#3: MENTAL TOUGHNESS

What I love about the Stan Wawrinka story is the fact that a super talented player could struggle on the circuit for years, and then finally transform himself to become a Grand Slam champion. This is the rarest type of career trajectory, and is a source of hope for anyone who struggles at their craft for years.

Wawrinka cracked the top 50 at age 21, then made the jump to the top 20 by age 23, a rise similar to other attacking players, whose games take longer to jell than defensive players. He stayed stuck at that level for 5 years, and then everything changed when he hired Magnus Norman as his coach in 2013. From there, he jumped into the top 10, won three Slams and reached a career high ranking of #3.

He stayed in the top 5 for four years until he was slowed down by a knee injury in 2017, when he stopped playing after Wimbledon and didn‚Äôt play again until the 2018 Australian Open. He struggled for a good part of the year, dropping as low as #261, and ending the year at #69.

Wawrinka is famous for pointing to his head with his finger, to affirm the mental toughness he worked so hard to gain so late in his career.

Can he do it again at age 34 and get back into the top 5?

Tonight‚Äôs match against Djokovic will give us a much better idea if he can scale the mountain again.
