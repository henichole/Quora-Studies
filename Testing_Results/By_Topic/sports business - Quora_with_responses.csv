Brock Pan-Yellow,1y,What sport has the lowest life expectancy?,"Wingsuit proximity flying.

Take a moderately safe activity, and make it waaaaaay less safe.

Brock Pan-Yellow,Updated 1y,How much do professional sports balls cost?,"The most expensive is an Official NBA basketball by Spalding. $170.

This is an Official NFL american football by Wilson. $99.

Here’s an Official MLS soccer ball by Adidas. $99.

Official MLB baseball by Rawlings. $27 (for Souvenir version). Unofficial similar quality ball ~$4.

Pro V1 golf ball by Titleist. It’s one of many balls that pros are allowed to hit. But it’s the one used by the most pros. $52/dozen.

Wilson US Open tennis ball. $2-$3 when you buy in bulk.

Official box lacrosse / field lacrosse ball. Also $2–$3 in bulk.

Table tennis balls. Under $1 each in bulk.

And I know you didn’t ask about pucks. But as the 4th biggest sport in the US, here is an Official NHL hockey puck. Similar to a baseball, the souvenir version with a team logo is overpiced at $15. Exact same thing without the stamp, $1-1.50.

It’s made of vulcanized rubber. They’re very easy to manufacture. The basic disc shape and vulcanized rubber compound has gone unchanged for about 150 years.

See that waffle-iron pattern on the outside edge? That represents the sum total of engineering that has gone into hockey pucks over the last century and a half. It helps us grip the puck a bit easier with our sticks.

With other sports, you can pay more money to use the same quality ball as the pros. For hockey, you can buy the same thing the pros use at the hardware store.

Whether you play novice or NHL, in 1919 or 2019, you play the game with the exact same puck.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/91hgudeswni6vcm3', 'title': 'How much do professional sports balls cost?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The most expensive is an Official NBA basketball by Spalding. $170.\n\nThis is an Official NFL american football by Wilson. $99.\n\nHere’s an Official MLS soccer ball by Adidas. $99.\n\nOfficial MLB baseball by Rawlings. $27 (for Souvenir version).

Ty Doyle,Updated 1y,Why do so many highly paid professional athletes end up bankrupt only a few years after retiring from their sport?,"There are four main reasons:

Divorce is fairly common for professional athletes in the years immediately following their retirements, and divorce is of course a great way for someone to become materially poorer.
Only the very top professional athletes retire with actual “I can do nothing and live a baller lifestyle until I die” money. Don't get me wrong, many major sport athletes with decent careers can have enough in the bank to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, but players who have lived the high life during their playing days sometimes have difficulty making the transition to living on a budget. Further, as many athletes have spent their entire lives focused on sports, those who need money often don't have good ways to make a living once their playing days are done.
Most professional athletes enter the sporting world with little financial literacy because they're young and/or didn't grow up with money. Because of this, many athletes place their trust in others, often family members, to manage their finances. Unfortunately, managers sometimes turn out to be bad with money or dishonest, and there are too many sad stories of fortunes being lost or stolen. There's also a common theme of athletes investing in high-risk ventures like restaurants and commercial real estate that frequently fail.
Finally, especially with athletes who grew up poor, there's often pressure for the young person who has struck it rich to support those who didn't find similar success. Everyone hears the stories of the top draft pick buying mom a house or of the player who has a few old friends with him at all times, but many players are quietly subsidizing an incredible number of people back home. An aunt wants an apartment in a nicer neighborhood? A nephew wants to go to private school? A cousin wants a new car? A friend has medical bills? They're all going to the same place for cash, and as a result, there's sometimes not as much money left as one might expect at the time a player retires.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/68wv7hsexz5t3nrk', 'title': 'Why do so many highly paid professional athletes end up bankrupt only a few years after retiring from their sport?', 'score': {'original': 0.9752, 'ai': 0.0248}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""There are four main reasons:\n\nDivorce is fairly common for professional athletes in the years immediately following their retirements, and divorce is of course a great way for someone to become materially poorer.\nOnly the very top professional athletes retire with actual “I can do nothing and live a baller lifestyle until I die” money.

Ty Doyle,1y,Should females be paid the same as males in sports?,"Athletes are entertainers, and entertainers should be paid without regard to their gender and based solely on their abilities to generate revenue from those they entertain.

Just as example, if Beyoncé invites some less popular male artist to be an opening act on her tour, no one would seriously say “that man should be paid just as much as Bey because he sings, too, and traveling around the country and singing is hard work no matter who does it.” Just about everyone would recognize that since people are filling up stadiums and parting with lots of their money primarily to see Beyoncé, she should be the one taking home most of the cash.

The same thing is true with sports. There are some female athletes who make more money than men, and that's because they're bigger draws, i.e., people want to spend money specifically to see them play. But if female athletes are not selling lots of expensive tickets, then they shouldn't be paid the same as the male athletes who do.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/t8chsqawp3mb27dj', 'title': 'Should females be paid the same as males in sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.9984, 'ai': 0.0016}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Athletes are entertainers, and entertainers should be paid without regard to their gender and based solely on their abilities to generate revenue from those they entertain.\n\nJust as example, if Beyoncé invites some less popular male artist to be an opening act on her tour, no one would seriously say “that man should be paid just as much as Bey because he sings, too, and traveling around the country and singing is hard work no matter who does it.” Just about everyone would recognize that since people are filling up stadiums and parting with lots of their money primarily to see Beyoncé, she should be the one taking home most of the cash.\n\nThe same thing is true with sports.

Steven Haddock,1y,"Why was wrestling the first sport that got the ""pro wrestling"" treatment (staged matches, gimmicky fighters) instead of other sports?","Largely because the sport became predictable and boring.

In the early 20th century, professional wrestling was 100% legit and drew massive crowds, being almost as popular as boxing.

But as the sport developed, it became stratified. Top wrestlers were so good that they pretty much never lost. Legitimate wrestling was pretty predictable, unlike boxing where a lesser fighter at least had a shot going in. Moreover, two top wrestlers, fighting legitimately, would barely move within the confines of the ring.

Strangely enough, another sport was having this exact same problem as one team started to dominate the sport in the 1930s, beating all comers. Audiences started to get bored. So they came up with a new way of entertaining people.

The Harlem Globetrotters, founded in 1927, were soon better than any other barnstorming team. As audiences started to get bored, the team started clowning around on the court when they had a big lead. Audiences loved it. The Globetrotters remained a competitive team well into the late 1940s, regularly beating NBA clubs. However, by the 1950s, they started losing players to the NBA so they went to being clowns full time. It’s a formula that’s worked for over 90 years.

As wrestling audiences dwindled, promoters were intrigued by the tactics of barnstorming teams like the Globetrotters to drum up interest in the sport.

Wrestling got it’s first official superstar in 1941 when George Raymond Wagner, who to that point had been a middle-card wrestler of no great talent but was able to keep matches entertaining, entered the ring in Eugene, Oregon with a new persona. Trading on a nice haircut and fairly good looks, he transformed himself into a legend.

Gorgeous George. With his immaculately coiffed bleached blonde hair and flowing colourful fringed robes, Raymond became one of the early “heels” or guy you loved to hate. He came into the ring with a pretentious arrogant attitude and treated the whole thing as beneath his dignity. Audiences ate it up.

Promotors realized that the thing missing from the top wrestlers was personality - they were amazing athletes but boring people. The sport soon became all about selling the sizzle and as audiences grew, so did the money wrestlers could be paid. Unfortunately, this also led to situations where wrestlers had to be so visible that they had to be working six days a week and travelling in between, making legit wrestling pretty much impossible. To avoid serous bodily injury, everything started to be staged but instead of having a static match, wrestlers started flying around the ring. Again, the fans ate up the new style and local promoters started making even more money.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o0dbh4yt5isa9k6l', 'title': 'Why was wrestling the first sport that got the ""pro wrestling"" treatment (staged matches, gimmicky fighters) instead of other sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Largely because the sport became predictable and boring.\n\nIn the early 20th century, professional wrestling was 100% legit and drew massive crowds, being almost as popular as boxing.\n\nBut as the sport developed, it became stratified.

Adam Fayed,13-Oct,Why do top level athletes go broke after their career?,"Many people watched the David Beckham documentary on Netflix.

One thing that I find interesting is how he reacted to earning his first 50,000 Pounds.

He said he spent that 50,000 Pounds straight away on flash cars.

Many of his teammates said he was regularly broke by the weekend!

Now clearly, things worked out for Beckham in the end, unlike Mike Tyson, who went broke after earning 500million+.

Probably, he eventually got more serious about managing money, earned much more than he expected, and had good advisors.

For others,they become broke because they:

Get used to earning loads of money and just spending it
Earn less in retirement after 35, unlike the likes of Beckham and Michael Jordan
Can’t say no to hangers-on
Their relationship with money isn’t right. This especially tends to be the case if they have never had much money growing up.

The last point is often crucial and doesn’t just apply to sports stars.

Studies in the US show that over 90% of those earning over six figures are broke.

John Cate,2y,Why didn't Dan Marino (football player) win a Super Bowl?,"This has been asked many times on Quora.

Put simply, the Dolphins were a subpar organization that did a very poor job of player personnel during Marino’s time as a player. They never had a good defense and did an atrocious job of scouting running backs. Marino covered for a lot of the deficiencies. But he couldn’t drag them all the way to the mountaintop.

In a vacuum, I think Dan Marino was the greatest quarterback who ever played the game. He just worked under circumstances that prevented him from ever winning a championship.

The Dan Marino era Miami Dolphins never won a Super Bowl. Should more blame for that be placed on the team surrounding Marino, or does Dan Marino himself deserve the lion’s share of the blame?
Most of the blame is due to the Dolphins’ organization during Marino’s time there. By the time the team came under Jimmy Johnson’s control, Marino was way past his prime, and while he was still effective right until near the end, he wasn’t the Marino of the 1980s anymore. The problem he had with trying to win a championship was simple—the Dolphins had serious deficiencies throughout the prime of his career that Marino was able to partially overcome, but when he got to the playoffs against good teams, these deficiencies could be, and were, exploited. Most of the Marino-era Dolphins teams were solid on the offensive line and featured the “Marks Brothers” at wide receiver, Mark Duper and Mark Clayton. A little-known fact during Clayton’s career, and I don’t know if it’s still true or not, but Marino-to-Clayton was the most prolific touchdown-pass combination in history—accounting for more TD’s than even Montana-to-Rice. When Marino in 1984 threw for 5,084 yards and 48 touchdowns, those records stood for about a quarter of a century before Manning and Brady, playing under different rules, finally broke them. In their own time, those records were outliers on the order of Bob Beamon when he jumped 29′2.5″ at a time when no one else had even cleared 28 feet. Of course, none of that helped the fact that the Dolphins’ defense sucked donkey balls throughout Marino’s career. I remember a talking head on TV once lamented the sad state of the Miami defense, stating that they’d gone from the “No-Name Defense,” the name for the Dolphins’ outstanding unit of the 1970s, to the “No Defense” of the 1980s. Between 1984 and 1997, the Dolphins ranked higher than 16th in total defense just twice, finishing 7th one season and 10th in another. They had a top-five defense in 1998 and 1999, but Marino was 37 and 38 by that time. Between 1985 and 1989, five of his best seasons, they ranked between 23rd and 26th in defense every year. In 1984, when they were 19th, he took them to the Super Bowl. He had to play a loaded 18–1 49ers team at Stanford Stadium and lost, though. Tied into that problem was the fact that the Dolphins never ran the ball effectively. Miami’s leading rushers during this era included people like Troy Stradford, Sammie Smith, Mark Higgs and Karim Abdul-Jabbar (no, not the basketball player). Smith is the one who I remember best. One time, he fumbled twice in a game and caused the Dolphins to lose, then cried afterward when the fans chanted “Sammie Sucks” at him. After the Dolphins cut him, he became a cocaine dealer and sucked at that too—he got caught and served seven years in prison. Anyway, their failure to run the ball effectively when needed meant that they couldn’t ever keep their mediocre defense off the field for any length of time. So Dan Marino couldn’t run the ball and he couldn’t play defense, and while he was in his prime, his organization never built a team around him that could cover these deficiencies. That being the case, coach Don Shula did what gave him the best chance to win—he rode Marino like he was Secretariat. And if the NFL of the 1980s had today’s rules about pass defense, he’d have won championships anyway. But it didn’t. (If they had modern rules back then, Marino would have thrown for 6,000 yards.) I don’t know what more Marino could have done. He could have spoken out more, but if he’d done that, he’d been throwing his teammates under the bus, and that’s not right, either. I’m sure he spoke quite often to management about the issue, and all they did was keep sending more Troy Stradfords and Sammie Smiths. (There must have been something about great QBs and mediocre RBs named Sam back then; John Elway had one named Sammy Winder.) Sometimes a great player gets denied a championship, and it’s not a failing on his part. Ty Cobb didn’t miss a ring because his .366 average wasn’t good enough, he didn’t get one because the Tigers’ pitching let too many other people hit .366 against them. Charles Barkley didn’t miss because he wasn’t good enough, but because when he was finally on a team good enough to win one, he had to get past MJ and Scottie for it. And Dan Marino didn’t because his 61,361 yards and 420 TD passes weren’t enough, but because his golden arm and the men he was throwing to were the only part of his teams that was any good. Seriously, can anyone say with a straight face that if Marino had been born 15 years earlier and ended up on his hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, he wouldn’t have won at least as many championships as Terry Bradshaw did?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tuarpz8ws93ql6kb', 'title': ""Why didn't Dan Marino (football player) win a Super Bowl?"", 'score': {'original': 0.99715, 'ai': 0.00285}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This has been asked many times on Quora.\n\nPut simply, the Dolphins were a subpar organization that did a very poor job of player personnel during Marino’s time as a player.

Steven Haddock,3y,Why do the best players in professional sports sometimes go unnoticed?,"It’s what other people call the SportsCenter effect.

Let me tell you a secret - coaches don’t watch SportsCenter. Coaches watch game film.

Coaches watch each player and see, if at the moment they’re being looked at, they’re doing what they were supposed to be doing.

So let’s take my favourite sport of football. On SportsCenter you will see bone crushing tackles, quarterbacks making near impossible throws, quarterback sacks, and running backs breaking free after seemingly being stopped.

What you won’t see on SportsCenter are missed tackles because the tackler was trying to knock a guy down, quarterbacks throwing interceptions into triple coverage, defensive linemen falling for obvious screens or draws, or running backs losing possession of the ball because they wouldn’t go down.

So players who merely do what they’re supposed to do don’t get on SportsCenter. A running back makes a really good block. A defensive lineman pushing an offensive lineman back into the running hole so it doesn’t open up. A cornerback forcing the running back to the inside so the linebacker can line up the back. A safety dropping into deep zone coverage so as not to give the quarterback an easy deep throw. A linebacker spying the quarterback so he can’t break out of the pocket.

But coaches watch the game film. They know how good these players are.

So Frank Gore gets to be the #3 rushing leader merely by holding onto the ball when he carries it and getting tough yards. Larry Fitzgerald gets to be the #2 receiver of all time by running disciplined patterns and drawing double coverage, when he isn’t blocking on running plays.

One player who I had never heard of until he was chosen for the NFL top 100 was Jonathan Ogden, a Hall of Fame offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens. Here’s how Michael Strahan described him when he was chosen:

Mike Jones,3y,"Do you agree with the nationwide cancellations, such as college and professional sports events, closings, and work from home requests because of the coronavirus, or have authorities overreacted, or acted too soon? Why or why not?","Agree 100%. If anything, it’s been too slow. Take a look at this graph to understand the main reason why:

The point isn’t so much reducing the total number of people who get the disease (though if we can do that, that’s great) but as reducing the number who have it at one time. We can’t suddenly significantly increase the capacity of the American health care system. We can add a bit, but pretty much when all the hospital beds are full, they’re full.

The impact of the disease if we don’t have so many cases at one time that they exceed the limits of the health care system to handle them will be much smaller. Fewer deaths. As a second-order effect, more time to develop effective treatments or perhaps even a vaccine.

Second, the “compound interest” effect comes into play. Changing the effective rate of infection (by reducing the number of contacts where it can spread early in the epidemic has a much larger effect on the spread of the disease than doing it later when there’s already a larger pool of infected people. That’s another reason to err on the side of “too early”.

Finally, this is going to generate plenty of cases of the “remediation paradox”. Y2K was a classic example of this. In the early 1990s, people started predicting terrible things would happen if we didn’t do a lot of work to remediate the problem. One group of people set to work on remediation and did an enormous amount of work over the next few years. Another group pooh-pooh’ed the predictions as “alarmist” and said there was nothing to worry about. Due to the efforts of the first group, the actual effects were minimal. But a lot of people in the second group adopted the attitude of “See, we were right! There was nothing to worry about all along!”

I fully expect the people now who are saying that we’re overreacting are going to have the same attitude if our “overreactions” actually do limit the spread of the disease.

We can’t suddenly significantly increase the capacity of the American health care system. We can add a bit, but pretty much when all the hospital beds are full, they’re full.\n\nThe impact of the disease if we don’t have so many cases at one time that they exceed the limits of the health care system to handle them will be much smaller. Fewer deaths. As a second-order effect, more time to develop effective treatments or perhaps even a vaccine.\n\nSecond, the “compound interest” effect comes into play. Changing the effective rate of infection (by reducing the number of contacts where it can spread early in the epidemic has a much larger effect on the spread of the disease than doing it later when there’s already a larger pool of infected people. That’s another reason to err on the side of “too early”.\n\nFinally, this is going to generate plenty of cases of the “remediation paradox”. Y2K was a classic example of this. In the early 1990s, people started predicting terrible things would happen if we didn’t do a lot of work to remediate the problem. One group of people set to work on remediation and did an enormous amount of work over the next few years. Another group pooh-pooh’ed the predictions as “alarmist” and said there was nothing to worry about. Due to the efforts of the first group, the actual effects were minimal. But a lot of people in the second group adopted the attitude of “See, we were right! There was nothing to worry about all along!”\n\nI fully expect the people now who are saying that we’re overreacting are going to have the same attitude if our “overreactions” actually do limit the spread of the disease. And if they don’t limit the spread of the disease, those people will be criticizing us for not having acted sooner.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9998

Colin Riegels,Updated 1y,"If you were rich investor looking to buy a sports franchise, which league/team would you choose?","Leeds United in the English Premier League.

Leeds are a terrible team. They narrowly avoided relegation last year. As English Premier League clubs go, they are probably pretty cheap to buy. And EPL clubs are pretty valuable just for being in the EPL. The league earns more than the next three largest football leagues in Europe combined, and continues to grow in revenues.

Why Leeds? The key is demographics. Leeds sit in the largest metropolitan area outside of London. Elland Road (their ground) sits in what is basically the twin cities of Leeds and Bradford, with nearby Castleford and Wakefield. The combined population of this metropolitan area is over three million.[1] And Huddersfield and Halifax are not far away. And unlike other large British cities like London, Manchester, or Liverpool (or Edinburgh or Glasgow) - there is no second Premier League club for them to share their fan base with. They have this giant population centre all to themselves (no, Bradford City fans, you do not count).

If I was an oligarch looking for somewhere to stuff my billions, I’d buy Leeds United. You wouldn’t have to plough very much money into them to make them considerably better than they are now. You have a rich stream of guaranteed TV money so long as you don’t get relegated. And as an added bonus, Leeds United do have quite a storied history to drone on about.

Purushottam Kumar,1y,What sports ministry has done in the last 8 years to improve the sports infrastructures and facilities in India?,"India’s population is 1.35 billion. The humongous population is blessed with the tradition of physical activity passed to them by their ancestors. Moreover, 104 million tribal population (2011 Census) meant that Indians should be winning more and more medals over the years. The tribal population is supposed to be more in touch with physical labour than the average globetrotter in the concrete jungles of the cities.

In spite of so much richness, we could not get to our full potential. The missing link between potential and medals was a synchronised effort by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS) and sports authorities. PM Modi arrived, he saw the gap, and asked his MYAS to bridge it. And the Ministry did it in atremendous fashion.

Strengthened infrastructure in sports

India has more than 100 sports facilities designed to cater to international level sporting events. However, most of them were running in a dilapidated state. If you would visit any SAI centre before 2014, there was a higher chance of you meeting with a bovine animal than finding an athlete engaged in his/her practice. Nothing against bovines, but there is a place for everything and that place should have been reserved for players.

Under the National Sports Policy, 2014, MYAS promoted the development of adequate sporting infrastructures across the country. Through the Urban Sports Infrastructure Scheme (USIS) and Panchayati Yuva Krida Aur Khel Abhiyan (PYKKA) Scheme, efficient infrastructures on local levels were laid out. Giving more teeth to the SAI Training Centre Scheme (STC) along with the Come and Play Scheme opened the gates for the renovation of SAI centres.

Since sports are a state subject, Union governments have little power to improve infrastructure. However, through revised programmes, MYAS involved private players which led to an increase in the in-house training and coaching facilities. Currently, Rs 9,069 crore is being spent on developing sports-related infrastructure under the National Infrastructure pipeline (NIP). Major Dhyan Chand Sports University, having been built at the cost of Rs 700 crore in Meerut is another shining jewel in India’s sports infrastructure brochure.

Moreover, to encourage sports culture, MYAS contributed to the Smart City Mission as well. Cities are being encouraged to take up organisation of a mega sports event, something which is considered below their capacity. This would help in the sudden increase in efficient transportation and telecommunication systems serving the designated sports facilities. These facilities will give a sudden upshoot to their infrastructure which will be sustained and upgraded according to future needs.

Result oriented specific schemes

MYAS launched schemes specifically designed to promote athleticism in the country. Under Khelo India, 1000 young athletes are chosen every year. For the next 8 years, they are provided with Rs 5 lakh per year scholarships. It has also taken 20 Universities and 200 million children in the age group of 10-18 under its fold. Gender equality and social inclusiveness are the main focus of this scheme as it aspires to create a fit population ready to take up extreme sports challenges. At the same time, through University involvement, they will have a backup plan in case their sports career goes haywire.

Similarly, to increase India’s Olympic prospects, MYAS launched the TOPS Scheme. Under this scheme, each candidate having promising talent is provided training (including foreign), equipment, and a coaching camp among others. Besides these benefits, a monthly stipend of Rs 50,000 is being provided to them. Over the years, the government has spent Rs 1,200 crore on athletes according to the Sports Authority of India (SAI). This spending involves spending on Annual Calendar for Training and Competition (ACTC) as well. In fact, in the Tokyo Olympics, all 54 athletes were part of TOPS and the government rallied behind them, leaving no stone unturned for their success.

Moreover, to find worthy players, initiatives such as Sports Talent Search Portal, National Sports Award Scheme and other initiatives were launched. Riding on the encouragement through the aforementioned schemes, India returned with 7 medals from the Tokyo Olympics.

All round development of all sports

Before 2014, Cricket was the dominating theme of Indian sports. No matter how much they tried, other sports just could not get the required support from the government. Things started to change under Sarbanand Sonowal as the MYAS started to witness a shift in its approach. But, it took some time to improve the mindset of bureaucrats handling MYAS. Until then, Budget allocation for MYAS did not increase by a substantial amount.

Soon, the system was in place. Various schemes like Khelo India, and TOPS among others were announced. Not one scheme differentiated athletes based on their skills. Whether you are using a Tennis or Badminton racket, MYAS facilitates equal treatment. As soon as it was ensured that every sport would be given equal treatment, the budget allocation was put in place. Over the years, India’s cumulative sports budget as well as allocation to different institutions rose by remarkable margins.

On the back of renewed focus on their respective sports, the country knows that Virat Kohli is not the only star of Indian sports. Today Sakshi Malik, Phogat sisters, Neeraj Chopra, Nikhat Zareen, Lakshay Sen, PV Sandhu, and Deepak Punia among others are dominating the Indian sports spectrum. Their individual fame is a reflection of the growth their respective sports have made during the last 8 years.

Institutional support to strength

You may provide funding, you may provide infrastructure, and you may provide political will. However, to effectively execute any plan, a proper managerial structure is required. This is what was lacking in sporting bodies. Their financial and other problems were exacerbated by corruption and other irregularities at the top level, which further used to percolate to the bottom.

Under the Modi government, respective sports ministers took a top-down approach to strengthen the functioning of sporting bodies. Under Vijay Goel, an Empowered Steering Committee (ESC) was formed in January 2017. It was tasked with preparing an action plan for India’s success in the next 3 Olympic Games. To increase women’s participation in sports, MYAS formed a special committee to solve their grievances.

Similarly, to establish sports as an institutional phenomenon, MYAS advocated for opening Sports Universities. In 2018, PM Modi laid the foundation of a Central University in Imphal, Manipur. It provides a specialised degree in sports. In December last year, the Prime Minister inaugurated Major Dhyan Chand Sports University in Meerut. The infrastructure built with Rs 700 crore consists of modern and state-of-the-art sports infrastructure including synthetic Hockey ground, Football ground, Basketball, Volleyball, Handball, Kabaddi ground, Lawn tennis court, Gymnasium hall, Synthetic running stadium, Swimming pool, Multipurpose hall, and a Cycling Velodrome.

Leaders were constantly in touch with athletes

Sports is ruthless, it’s brutal, either you perform or perish. If you win you are a hero, if you perish, no one gives a damn about you. This used to be the norm in the pre-2014 era. Post-2014, players were given their deserved respect. The introduction of an Olympic medallist (Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore) in MYAS proved to be vital in changing the attitude. Ministers started to listen to the grievances of players and stayed with them during their ups and downs.

MYAS roped in PM Modi as well. Time and again PM Modi conveyed to them that the whole nation is with them. His phone calls to Neeraj Chopra and the Hockey team are still a fresh event for us Indians. He is someone who fulfils his promise made to individual players as well. PM Modi had promised P V Sandhu that he would be eating ice cream with her and after she returned from Tokyo, PM Modi invited her for an ice cream session. Whenever a team or player shows exhilarating resolve, PM Modi is right there to congratulate them, no matter whether they lost or won.

Sports are an evolved necessity of the human body. But, professional sports are a different game altogether. You have to act like a ruthless animal while competing, and come out as a decent human after the competition. This monkey balance takes a tremendous toll on the body and mind. That’s where intervention by MYAS is making the difference. Under Anurag Thakur, Indian sports sector is in safe hands.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ucxtio29pmjd7heg', 'title': 'What sports ministry has done in the last 8 years to improve the sports infrastructures and facilities in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.5691, 'ai': 0.4309}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'India’s population is 1.35 billion.

If you win you are a hero, if you perish, no one gives a damn about you. This used to be the norm in the pre-2014 era. Post-2014, players were given their deserved respect. The introduction of an Olympic medallist (Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore) in MYAS proved to be vital in changing the attitude. Ministers started to listen to the grievances of players and stayed with them during their ups and downs.\n\nMYAS roped in PM Modi as well. Time and again PM Modi conveyed to them that the whole nation is with them. His phone calls to Neeraj Chopra and the Hockey team are still a fresh event for us Indians. He is someone who fulfils his promise made to individual players as well. PM Modi had promised P V Sandhu that he would be eating ice cream with her and after she returned from Tokyo, PM Modi invited her for an ice cream session. Whenever a team or player shows exhilarating resolve, PM Modi is right there to congratulate them, no matter whether they lost or won.\n\nSports are an evolved necessity of the human body. But, professional sports are a different game altogether. You have to act like a ruthless animal while competing, and come out as a decent human after the competition. This monkey balance takes a tremendous toll on the body and mind. That’s where intervention by MYAS is making the difference. Under Anurag Thakur, Indian sports sector is in safe hands.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.5691

Why are elections important in a democracy?
Elections are a fundamental and essential component of a democracy for several reasons: 1. Representation: Elections allow citizens to choose their representatives in government. Through the electoral process, people have a say in who will make decisions on their behalf and represent their interests. 2. Accountability: Regular elections hold elected officials accountable for their actions and decisions. Knowing that they can be voted out of office in the next election encourages politicians to act in the best interests of their constituents. 3. Peaceful Transfer of Power: Elections provide a peaceful and orderly mechanism for the transfer of power. In a democracy, leaders are typically chosen through elections rather than through force or violence. 4. Popular Sovereignty: Elections uphold the principle of popular sovereignty, meaning that the authority and legitimacy of the government come from the consent of the governed. The people have the ultimate power to decide who governs. 5. Public Participation: Elections encourage citizens to engage in the political process, become informed about important issues, and exercise their civic duties. Voting is a way for individuals to have a direct impact on the direction of their country. 6. Choice and Diversity: Elections offer a choice among different candidates and political parties. This diversity of options ensures that a wide range of perspectives and interests can be represented in government. 7. Transparency: The electoral process is generally transparent, with clear rules and procedures for voting and counting ballots. This transparency helps maintain the integrity of the democratic system. 8. Responsive Government: Elected officials are motivated to respond to the needs and concerns of their constituents because they depend on their votes for re-election. 9. Conflict Resolution: In societies with diverse opinions and interests, elections provide a peaceful and structured way to resolve political conflicts. Citizens can express their preferences at the ballot box rather than through violence or upheaval. 10. Innovation and Progress: Competitive elections can drive innovation and progress as candidates and parties propose new policies and ideas to win the support of voters. 11. International Relations: Democracies that hold free and fair elections are often viewed more positively by the international community. They are seen as stable and reliable partners in global diplomacy. 12. Legitimacy: Elected governments derive their legitimacy from the electoral process. This legitimacy is essential for governments to implement policies and make decisions that affect the lives of their citizens.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/la92kq5vh1uprsfo', 'title': 'Which is the sport that earns the most money in the world?', 'score': {'original': 5e-05, 'ai': 0.99995}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Soccer, known as football in most parts of the world, is widely considered the sport that earns the most money globally.

Amanda Kevin,8mo,How is travel paid for in away games for sports teams?,"Travel for away games for sports teams varies depending on the size and budget of the team.

Generally, teams will cover the cost of transportation by charter bus or plane, as well as lodging and meals for the players and staff.

For teams with smaller budgets, it often comes down to individual players or parent sponsorships to cover any additional costs.

In some cases, travel can be limited or nonexistent due to financial restrictions, which can create an uneven playing field.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mg7dlyfjze2pcv86', 'title': 'How is travel paid for in away games for sports teams?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Travel for away games for sports teams varies depending on the size and budget of the team.\n\nGenerally, teams will cover the cost of transportation by charter bus or plane, as well as lodging and meals for the players and staff.\n\nFor teams with smaller budgets, it often comes down to individual players or parent sponsorships to cover any additional costs.\n\nIn some cases, travel can be limited or nonexistent due to financial restrictions, which can create an uneven playing field.', 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 1, 'credits': 1998463, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Travel for away games for sports teams varies depending on the size and budget of the team.\n\nGenerally, teams will cover the cost of transportation by charter bus or plane, as well as lodging and meals for the players and staff.\n\nFor teams with smaller budgets, it often comes down to individual players or parent sponsorships to cover any additional costs.\n\nIn some cases, travel can be limited or nonexistent due to financial restrictions, which can create an uneven playing field.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0

Steven Haddock,1y,Why won't the NFL expand?,"Expansion is unlikely to bring in any extra television money (the market is saturated already) and means there will be more teams to share the money with. Television money is the “bread and butter” of NFL finances with gate receipts and merchandise being the “gravy”.
Having 32 teams allows two 16 team conference with four 4-team divisions. Adding two more teams will mean 17 teams per conference, which will just mess things up. Adding eight teams is pretty much out of the question.
The NFL would actually prefer teams move from saturated markets to non-saturated markets. If the Jets moved from New York to Oklahoma City, the league would consider that a “win” because it’s not like they don’t already have a team there. They don’t care there’s no team in Oakland because most people in Oakland already support the 49ers anyway. If the Bills or the Packers moved, that would suit them just fine (although they’re unlikely to). No-one in the NFL cares if Jacksonville keeps its team. When you look at the best markets for an expansion team, those would be where teams already played (San Francisco, St. Louis) then, in order, Mexico City, London (England) and Toronto. There are a couple of other U.S. cities that could support a team, but they’re few and far between.
The league isn’t in need of money. Leagues often expand to get quick cash (expansion saved the CFL in the 1990s, although all the expansion teams except one failed, and it moved to Montreal). None of the NFL teams are struggling financially.
It’s clear that there’s no risk posed by a new league. “Upstart” leagues generally don’t last more than a couple of years and even NFL efforts (like NFL Europe) tend to be short lived. The last big shock expansion was in the 1960s and that was entirely due to the risk posed by the AFL. Before that, it was the AAFC, which actually played better football than the NFL (The LA Rams started out as the Cleveland Rams until the Browns started playing and became more popular).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8fc2smu9bihry7e5', 'title': ""Why won't the NFL expand?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Expansion is unlikely to bring in any extra television money (the market is saturated already) and means there will be more teams to share the money with.

Typically, the team's meals are catered for convenience, ensuring that the players and staff can focus on the game without worrying about their empty stomachs.

Now, imagine this: a swarm of hungry football players storming the local fast-food joint, fighting over the last burger like it's the Lombardi Trophy.

Although that might be quite the spectacle, it's far from reality.

NFL teams understand the importance of proper nutrition and teamwork.

Therefore, they usually arrange for their meals to be catered, providing nutritious options that fuel their performance and maintain a sense of unity within the team.

Ty Doyle,1y,Why won't the NFL expand?,"There are a few major issues:

First, the number of current teams (32) is a good one, because it allows for 2 conferences with 4 divisions of 4 teams apiece. Adding one or two teams only creates awkwardness, so the league would likely have to be committed to going to 36 teams, which would be 2 conferences with 3 divisions of 6 teams apiece.
Second, the sweetest plum for the league is its TV contracts, which are split among the franchises. As things are situated right now, there really isn’t a major media market in the US that is without an NFL team. In a perfect world, would the NFL be in Portland, Austin/San Antonio, St. Louis, Orlando, OKC, and maybe have a second team in Chicago if the Bears move to a suburban stadium? Sure. But none of those additions would increase the value of NFL TV deals in a material manner, so you’d be cutting the pie into more pieces without growing it much. That’s not smart business. Thus, unless the NFL can take big swings - such as moving into Canada, Mexico, or the UK - the current setup is likely good enough.
Finally, the NFL has always been very good about using the threat of a team leaving a current market to apply pressure on that market to fund new stadiums, etc. For example, the threat of “we’re going to L.A.” got new stadiums built across the country during the period when the City of Angels had no team. If the league is oversaturated, then that takes the threat away, e.g., some city being threatened with a team leaving if it doesn’t fork over half a billion dollars knows that the league isn’t really going to let a team move to Boise or Anchorage, etc. It’s smart business for the league to try to keep a waitlist for teams, and try to accommodate cities first with existing franchises that don’t have solid stadium situations/are underperforming in the money department.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/u4pgqk7hx239eiwj', 'title': ""Why won't the NFL expand?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'There are a few major issues:\n\nFirst, the number of current teams (32) is a good one, because it allows for 2 conferences with 4 divisions of 4 teams apiece.

If the league is oversaturated, then that takes the threat away, e.g., some city being threatened with a team leaving if it doesn’t fork over half a billion dollars knows that the league isn’t really going to let a team move to Boise or Anchorage, etc. It’s smart business for the league to try to keep a waitlist for teams, and try to accommodate cities first with existing franchises that don’t have solid stadium situations/are underperforming in the money department.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9987

However, the city has had trouble retaining its sports teams in recent years.

Lauren Nile,9mo,What NBA team travels the most?,"The answer to this question is ultimately dependent on the season's schedule of games.

Generally speaking, teams in the Western Conference need to travel more because they have more opponents that are far away geographically.

For example, the Los Angeles Lakers typically have more travel than the Miami Heat, as the Lakers have to travel to cities farther away like Portland, Sacramento, and Oakland.

As a result, the Lakers have traveled more total miles than the Heat.

Another factor to consider is the type of playoff format used by the NBA.

Depending on the format and the bracket for the playoffs, teams may have to travel longer distances to complete games.

Using analytics-based techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is possible to measure the travel patterns of each team and determine who has traveled the most as the season progresses.

AI can also be used to analyze the factors that affect each team's travel, such as the location of the opponents, the playoff format, and the length of the travel.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/g7wu86tihkxsb902', 'title': 'What NBA team travels the most?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The answer to this question is ultimately dependent on the season's schedule of games.\n\nGenerally speaking, teams in the Western Conference need to travel more because they have more opponents that are far away geographically.\n\nFor example, the Los Angeles Lakers typically have more travel than the Miami Heat, as the Lakers have to travel to cities farther away like Portland, Sacramento, and Oakland.\n\nAs a result, the Lakers have traveled more total miles than the Heat.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the type of playoff format used by the NBA.\n\nDepending on the format and the bracket for the playoffs, teams may have to travel longer distances to complete games.\n\nUsing analytics-based techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is possible to measure the travel patterns of each team and determine who has traveled the most as the season progresses.\n\nAI can also be used to analyze the factors that affect each team's travel, such as the location of the opponents, the playoff format, and the length of the travel."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1998441, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""The answer to this question is ultimately dependent on the season's schedule of games.\n\nGenerally speaking, teams in the Western Conference need to travel more because they have more opponents that are far away geographically.\n\nFor example, the Los Angeles Lakers typically have more travel than the Miami Heat, as the Lakers have to travel to cities farther away like Portland, Sacramento, and Oakland.\n\nAs a result, the Lakers have traveled more total miles than the Heat.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the type of playoff format used by the NBA.\n\nDepending on the format and the bracket for the playoffs, teams may have to travel longer distances to complete games.\n\nUsing analytics-based techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is possible to measure the travel patterns of each team and determine who has traveled the most as the season progresses.\n\nAI can also be used to analyze the factors that affect each team's travel, such as the location of the opponents, the playoff format, and the length of the travel."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0

Elizabeth John,10mo,"Do NFL (NHL, MLB, NBA) franchises have their own planes when they travel to other cities?","The short answer to this question is yes.

All professional sports franchises in the U.S., including NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA teams, have their own airplanes for travel to away games.

This is done for a variety of reasons, including cost effectiveness, comfort, and convenience.

From a technical point of view, chartering an aircraft for long-distance trips is often more cost effective than buying airline tickets for the entire team.

Additionally, chartering an aircraft allows teams to tailor their travel arrangements to their specific needs, such as carrying additional cargo and extra personnel.

This convenience is especially beneficial when teams have multiple away games in a short period of time.

Rafayy (EazyCash.xyz),13-Jan,Why does Los Angeles have two NFL teams?,"Los Angeles has two NFL teams: the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers. The presence of two NFL teams in Los Angeles is the result of separate franchise relocations.

Los Angeles Rams: The Rams were originally based in Los Angeles but moved to St. Louis in 1995. In 2016, the team returned to Los Angeles after receiving approval from the NFL to relocate. The Rams' return was part of the league's effort to re-establish a presence in the nation's second-largest media market.
Los Angeles Chargers: The Chargers were originally based in Los Angeles before moving to San Diego in 1961. In 2017, the team announced its decision to relocate back to Los Angeles and share the newly constructed SoFi Stadium with the Rams. The move was also seen as a response to the changing dynamics of the NFL landscape.

Mike Burch,Updated 6mo,What is the only U.S. city to win all four major professional sports championships in the same sports year?,"To my knowledge no U.S. city has won championships in all four major professional sports (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL) in the same year.

The U.S. city that came the closest was Philadelphia in 1980:

The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies won the World Series. This was the Phillies’ first World Series win, after a century of futility. The franchise had started out as the Philadelphia Quakers in 1883, but had never won a championship. After the free agency era began, the Phillies made 38-year-old Pete Rose baseball’s highest-paid player, and he teamed up with Mike Schmidt, Steve Carlton and Tug McGraw to lead the Phillies to their first-ever World Series triumph.
The 1980 Philadelphia Eagles played in the Super Bowl (in January 1981), but lost to the Oakland Raiders.
The 1980 Philadelphia Flyers played in the Stanley Cup Finals, but lost to the New York Islanders.
The 1980 Philadelphia 76ers played in the NBA Finals, but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.

That was the closest a U.S. city came to winning championships in all four major professional sports in the same year.

New York came close, with a series of miracles, as mentioned by Wes Wilde in the comments.

The “Miracle” Mets aka the “Amazing” Mets won the 1969 World Series despite being underdogs.
The 1968 New York Jets won the 1969 Super Bowl, but I think we can count that, since the question didn’t specify the teams having to play in the same season. This was another underdog team with Broadway Joe Namath’s “miracle” prediction being fulfilled.
The 1969 NBA finals were between the Lakers and Celtics. The Knicks won the NBA championship in 1970, but I think we can count that since part of the season was in 1969. There was yet another miracle, as Willis Reed hobbled onto the court to lead the Knicks to a world championship.
However the Montreal Canadiens swept the New York Rangers in the 1969 NHL playoffs, 4-0, and the Rangers didn’t make it to the Stanley Cup finals.

Frank Hamet contributed:

Detroit was a city of amazing “firsts” in 1935-1936.
The Detroit Tigers won their first World Series.
The Detroit Lions won their first NFL championship.
The Detroit Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup.
No other city has won the championship games/series for three of the four major North American sports in the same sports season. Unfortunately Detroit didn’t have an NBA team back then.
However, in the comments Hank Durkin mentioned that Detroit also had the great Joe Louis, giving Detroit four world champions! But the Brown Bomber didn’t become world champion until June 22, 1937. Still, in terms of championships actually won, Detroit appears to be the leader, for now.

Baltimore also came close, although it couldn’t sweep the four sports, not having an NHL team. This was noted by Leonard Knighton in the comments:

“The Baltimore Orioles and Colts won championships for their 1970 seasons. The Bullets went to the NBA finals in the 1970-71 season but lost to the Bucks. No NHL team in Baltimore.”
In the comments Colin Scoggins noted: “Though Baltimore did not have an NHL Team, the Baltimore Clippers AHL Team won the title in the 1970–71 Season.”

Rick Tan contributed:

The Tampa Bay Lightning won the Stanley Cup in 2020, then again in 2021.
The Tampa Bay Bucs won the Super Bowl in Feb. 2021 (for the 2020 season).
The Tampa Bay Rays made it to the World Series in the fall of 2020, but lost to the Dodgers.
There is no NBA team in Tampa, but the Orlando Magic are just down the road. However, the Magic never came close to winning anything in the decade of the 20’s.

Nat Fowler contributed:

1986 — Patriots lose to the Bears in the Super Bowl, the Celtics win the NBA Championship and the Red Sox lose (barely) in the 1986 World Series to the Mets.

Kevin aka Catamount says Boston came the closest to a sweep, but it took seven to eight years:

2004 Red Sox win the World Series.
2004 Patriots win the Super Bowl in Jan. 2005.
2007 Red Sox win the World Series.
2008 Celtics win the NBA Championship.
2011 Bruins win the Stanley Cup.

That’s a bit of a STREEEEEEETCH. Can any city do better than seven to eight years?

Peter Lockwood contributed:

If you include MLS for 5 sports, Los Angeles teams won 14 championships in 15 years, 2000 to 2015!

Derek Walker contributed:

Los Angeles has MLB and NBA (‘20), plus NFL (‘21 season).

Julian Alexander Lopez contributed:

1978 Pittsburgh Steelers, 1979 Pittsburgh Steelers, 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates
2013 Chicago Blackhawks, 2015 Chicago Blackhawks, 2016 Chicago Cubs
2016 Cleveland Cavaliers, almost 2016 Cleveland Indians

Steven Terry contributed:

Oakland A’s in ‘74
Warriors in ’75
Raiders in ‘77
No NHL team at that point

David Gamsby contributed:

I think this falls off the radar because people are focused on cities, but the start of the millennium was a golden age for sports fans in Northern New Jersey. The Giants, Nets and Devils all played their home games at the NJ Meadowlands and the Yankees were a short trip away in the Bronx.

In a four year span, each major sports team reached their championship game with three teams doing it the same year twice. In total there were 9 championship appearances with three won. If you include the 99 baseball season, the NYY won the World Series that season, making it 4 championships and 10 appearances in 5 years.

1999 - 2000

New Jersey Devils win the Stanley Cup

New York Yankees win the World Series

New York Giants lose the Super Bowl

2000 - 2001

New Jersey Devils lose the Stanley Cup

New York Yankees lose the World Series

2001 - 2002

New Jersey Nets lose the NBA finals.

2002 - 2003

New Jersey Devils win the Stanley Cup

New Jersey Nets lose the NBA finals

New York Yankees lose the World Series

John Makens contributed a “reverse championship sweep” or “cellar sweep”:

What about Detroit? They have come close to that as well. Except at the opposite end. As in, What City with all four Major League Sports has collectively the WORST records in their respective sports? This past year could be a record.
The NFL Lions were at the bottom of the barrel, as always, at 3–13.
Then the NBA Pistons accomplished one of the worst records of the 21–22 season at 23–59.
The NHL Red Wings were the best of the four, but still only managed 6th Place in their Division.
And lastly, the MLB Tigers are currently 30 games BELOW .500.
So for all four Major League Sports in Detroit, The Lions were last in their Division, the Pistons second to last in the Eastern Conference, the Wings were the best managing 6th place in their 8 team division, and the Tigers are currently dead last in their Division. Oh, its a sad day to be a sports fan in Detroit. And it almost always is, especially with Football, as football is KING, and a Super Bowl win is ten times better than any other respective championship!

This is particularly true in the United States, where most teams rely on the national network of commercial airlines to get them to their destinations.

Teams have arrangements with the airlines to offer special rates, discounts, and extra seats for their staff, players, and support personnel.

This allows teams to travel quickly, conveniently, and cost-effectively to away games with minimal disruption to their regular schedule.

Ajay Kumar,25-Sep,How do NFL teams make money?,"NFL teams generate revenue through a variety of sources, and their financial success is crucial for their sustainability and competitiveness. Here are some of the primary ways NFL teams make money:

Television Contracts: The largest source of revenue for NFL teams is television contracts. The NFL negotiates lucrative broadcasting agreements with networks such as CBS, NBC, FOX, and ESPN. These contracts provide substantial income to the league, which is then distributed among the teams.
Ticket Sales: Game-day revenue, including ticket sales, is another significant income source. NFL teams sell tickets for regular-season games, preseason games, and any playoff games hosted at their stadiums. Luxury suites, premium seating, and season ticket packages also contribute to ticket revenue.
Merchandise Sales: NFL teams earn money through the sale of team merchandise, including jerseys, hats, shirts, and other fan gear. This includes both in-stadium sales and sales through official team websites and retail partners.
Sponsorships and Advertising: Teams enter into sponsorship agreements with various companies and brands. These agreements can include naming rights for stadiums, advertising during games, and partnerships that extend beyond the field. These sponsorships often come with significant financial benefits.
Licensing and Trademarks: NFL teams earn royalties from licensing their logos, names, and trademarks to manufacturers for the production of various products, such as video games, apparel, and collectibles.
Concessions and Hospitality: Revenue is generated from concessions, catering, and hospitality services at stadiums and arenas. This includes food and beverage sales, luxury suite rentals, and hosting special events.
Parking: NFL teams charge for parking at their stadiums, especially on game days. Parking fees contribute to overall revenue.
NFL Ventures: The NFL as a league entity operates various ventures, including the NFL Network, NFL Films, and NFL RedZone. These ventures generate revenue that is distributed among the teams.
International Games: Some teams participate in international games, including those in London and Mexico City. These games can create additional revenue opportunities and expand the NFL's global reach.
Playoff Revenue: Successful teams that make the playoffs earn additional revenue from postseason games. This includes ticket sales, concessions, and other game-related revenue.
Community and Fan Engagement: Some teams generate income through community programs, fan engagement events, and youth football initiatives, often in partnership with sponsors.
Investment Income: Teams may also earn money through investments in various financial instruments, although this is not typically a primary revenue source.

It's important to note that revenue distribution in the NFL is subject to league rules and revenue-sharing agreements among teams to promote competitive balance. While some revenue streams, like national TV contracts, are shared equally among all teams, others depend on factors such as market size, stadium revenue, and team success.

Eddie Gaedel of the St. Louis Browns, who went up for a single at-bat on August 19, 1951, which resulted in a walk, at which point he was subbed for a pinch runner.

Team manager Bill Veeck was trying to get publicity for the team to upstage their much more successful cross-town rival the Cardinals. He realized in a normal stance, a little person would have a strike zone of only about 1.5 inches, making it impossible to strike him out. After trying to throw one strike against Gaedel, who was ordered to “just stand there”, the pitcher broke out laughing and deliberately walked him.

The next day, Major League Baseball banned little people from the sport. Gaedel retired with an OBP of 1.000.

Vibhakar T S (ವಿಭಾಕರ್ ಟಿ ಎಸ್),1y,Which sports has seen the most one-sided dominance by any team for a reasonably long period of time?,"India's dominance in Hockey, 1928–1964.

Let's recall the fact that in 1920s and 1930s, India used to be a colonial state ruled by the British. They had to manage all their expenses themselves. They had no aid from British. They had to develop infrastructure, equipments, and other necessary things by themselves.

And in such a situation, they played their first Olympics in 1928 in Amsterdam. India were in Division A, that had the teams like Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria. In their four group matches, the Indian team beat,

Austria 6–0.
Belgium 9–0.
Denmark 5–0.
Switzerland 6–0.

The goal difference of India was 26–0. And in final, they beat the home team Netherlands 3–0 and sealed the gold medal in their very first appearance. Major Dhyan Chand, the star of the show, had claimed a whopping 14 goals to his name (The second highest goal scorer had a mere 7 goals to his name). Even Firoze Khan had scored 5 goals in the tournament.

In 1932, the Indian hockey team landed in Los Angeles for their second Olympics. The tournament had lack of participation due to many teams boycotting the tournament. India were grouped with Japan and USA. India beat Japan 11–1 and USA 24–1. They bagged their second consecutive gold medal in field hockey in Olympics.

1936 posted a tougher challenge for the team. They weren't in the best of the form. Some very strong teams like Germany and Netherlands took part in the tournament. So, it was gonna be a tough task for the Indian team. India played in Group A that had the teams like Japan, Hungary and United States. In their three group stage matches, they beat,

Hungary 4–0.
USA 7–0.
Japan 9–0.

The goal difference of India was 20–0. Much like 1928, they hadn't conceded a goal till the knockouts. Even in semifinals, they beat France comfortably by 10–0. They met Germany in the finals. They trashed the home side 8–1 and won their third consecutive gold medal in Hockey Olympics. Throughout the tournament, India conceded just a goal and scored a whopping 38 of them.

From 1936 to 1948, no Olympic games took place due to World war 2. By 1948, a lot of things were changed. The then colonial India was split into two nations, India and Pakistan, both of which were the top Hockey teams. The Great Britain also had a really good team. So, Olympics was to witness the Hockey glory yet again.

India were in the Group A that had the likes of Argentina, Spain and Austria. In their group stage matches, they beat,

Austria 8–0.
Argentina 9–1.
Spain 2–0.

They finished group stage with no loss and a goal difference of 18. In semifinals, they beat The Netherlands 2–1 in a close counter. In finals, they faced the home side Britain and trashed them 4–0 to claim their fourth consecutive gold medal. India had defeated all the home sides in their final appearances, which was interesting. And this was the team without Dhyan Chand (As he had retired) and yet had the quality to dominate the sport.

The 1952 Olympics in Helsinki had an interesting Tennis type knockout rounds. In the preliminary round, India had gotten a bye. In quarterfinals, they faced Austria and beat them 4–0. In semifinals, they beat The Great Britain 3–1. In finals, India beat The Netherlands 6–1 and claimed their fifth consecutive gold medal in Hockey Olympics.

The 1956 Olympics in Melbourne had the traditional groups. India were in the group that had the likes of Singapore, Afghanistan, and USA. In the group stage matches, India didn't break much sweat as expected. They beat,

Afghanistan 14–0.
USA 16–0.
Singapore 6–0.

With a goal difference of 36 (No goal conceded), they played semifinals against Germany. They beat them 1–0 and made it to the finals. In the finals, they beat Pakistan 1–0 and clinched their sixth consecutive gold medal in Hockey. Yep, Sixth consecutive gold medal !!

1960 Olympics took place in Rome. India were the defending champions and had won all their finals in the last 6 appearances. India was in Group A that had the likes of New Zealand, Netherlands and Denmark. In their group stage matches, they beat,

Denmark 10–0.
The Netherlands 4–1.
New Zealand 3–0

In quarterfinals, India beat Australia 1–0. In semifinals, India beat The Great Britain 1–0. In finals, India lost (!!!!????) to Pakistan 1–0 and settled for Silver. It was the first ever loss for India in an Olympics Hockey final. India's gold medal streak was over. Yet, they claimed the silver medal.

The 1964 Olympics took place in Tokyo. India were in Pool B that had six other teams like Spain, The Netherlands, Germany, Malaysia, Belgium, Canada and Hong Kong. In their group stage matches, they won five games and held on for two draws. It was the first instance of an Indian team drawing an Olympic match.

They beat Belgium 2–0.
They drew 1–1 with Germany.
They drew 1–1 with Spain.
They beat Hong Kong 6–0.
They beat Malaysia 3–1.
They beat Canada 3–0.
They beat The Netherlands 2–1.

They topped their group with 5 wins and 2 draws. In semifinals, India beat Australia 3–1 and qualified for their eighth final in a row. In finals, they had a rematch of 1960 Olympics with Pakistan. India beat Pakistan 1–0 and got back their gold medal. It was their seventh instance of winning the gold medal in Hockey Olympics.

From 1928 to 1964,

India won 7 gold medals
India won a silver medal
They had won 30 consecutive games in Olympics from 1928 to 1960.
They won a total of 40 games, drew only 2 games and lost just one game.
They scored a whopping 219 goals and conceded just 14 goals in the period.

That's simply an incredible level of dominance.

The modern version of the sport, however, originated in England in the 19th century and quickly spread to other parts of the world. Today, soccer is played in over 200 countries and is governed by the international governing body, FIFA.

One of the reasons for soccer's popularity is its simplicity. The game only requires a ball and a goal, and can be played in a wide variety of settings, from grassy fields to concrete streets. This makes it accessible to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds, and helps to foster a sense of community among players and fans.

Another factor contributing to soccer's popularity is its global reach. The sport is played at all levels, from amateur pick-up games to professional leagues. Major international competitions, such as the World Cup and the European Championship, are watched by millions of people around the world and bring together fans from different countries and cultures.

Soccer also has a unique emotional and cultural significance for many people. For fans, supporting a team can be a way of connecting with their heritage, expressing their identity, and feeling a sense of belonging. For players, the sport can be a way of realizing their dreams and ambitions, and a source of personal and collective pride.

The popularity of soccer is reflected in its massive global market. The sport generates billions of dollars in revenue each year from merchandise sales, broadcasting rights, and sponsorship deals. Major clubs, such as Real Madrid and Manchester United, have millions of fans and are valued at billions of dollars.

In conclusion, soccer is the most popular sport in the world because of its simplicity, global reach, emotional significance, and huge market. The sport has a rich history and continues to inspire and bring together people from all over the world. Whether you are a player, a fan, or simply a spectator, soccer has a special place in the hearts and minds of millions of people worldwide.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r9exhzcwmsylfjnk', 'title': 'What is the most popular sport in the world?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The most popular sport in the world is association football, also known as soccer in some countries.

Ty Doyle,1y,Why does it seem like there are so many players who don’t really warrant the investment who continue to be signed to massive contracts in the NBA?,"This is more a product of the NBA having a maximum salary than anything else. The NFL, for example, has a team salary cap, but within that cap, there is no ceiling for an individual player. So if, for example, Kansas City wants to pay Patrick Mahomes $105 million a year (roughly 1/2 of the team cap), it's free to do so.

In contrast, the NBA has a more flexible team salary cap, but also caps what star players may be paid as a percentage of that cap. Because of this unique arrangement, salaries among superior players are bunched up: true superstars (players like LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo who are perpetual MVP candidates and who fans of even other teams pay to see play) wind up being underpaid relative to their true value, while players who are very good but not at an elite level nevertheless get max deals because teams wind up having to retain their stars.

Fashion Needles,06-Sep,What does an NFL team need to win a championship?,"Winning an NFL championship, such as the Super Bowl, is a complex and multifaceted achievement that requires a combination of factors, including talent, teamwork, strategy, and luck. Here are some key components that an NFL team typically needs to win a championship:

Talent and Skill: A championship team needs talented and skilled players at various positions, including a capable quarterback, skilled offensive and defensive linemen, playmaking receivers, and a strong secondary on defense. Individual player talent is crucial for success.
Effective Coaching: Effective coaching is essential for any championship team. This includes a knowledgeable head coach who can develop a winning strategy, motivate players, and make in-game decisions. The coaching staff plays a crucial role in preparing the team for success.
Depth and Resilience: Injuries are a part of football, and depth on the roster is critical to handle injuries and maintain performance throughout the season. Championship teams often have the ability to adapt and recover from setbacks.
Team Chemistry: Strong team chemistry and camaraderie among players can foster trust, communication, and a collective sense of purpose. A united and cohesive team is more likely to succeed.
Effective Game Planning: Coaches and players must be able to execute game plans effectively. This includes offensive and defensive strategies tailored to opponents' strengths and weaknesses.
Performance in Critical Moments: Championship teams often excel in critical moments, including late-game situations and playoff matchups. The ability to perform under pressure is a hallmark of champions.
Balanced Offense and Defense: Successful teams have both a strong offense and a formidable defense. While some teams may emphasize one side of the ball more than the other, a balanced approach is often ideal.
Special Teams Excellence: Special teams play can have a significant impact on field position and momentum. Championship teams have reliable kickers, strong returners, and disciplined coverage units.
Luck and Timing: Luck and timing can play a role in a team's championship run. This includes factors like favorable playoff matchups and fortuitous bounces during games.
Preparation and Adaptation: Teams that are well-prepared for opponents and can adapt to changing circumstances during games have an advantage. This involves studying film, scouting opponents, and making in-game adjustments.
Fan Support: While not a direct on-field factor, passionate fan support can boost team morale and create a home-field advantage, especially in playoff games.

It's important to note that winning an NFL championship is highly competitive, and many factors come into play. Even with all these elements in place, success is never guaranteed, as the NFL is known for its parity and the unpredictability of outcomes. Championship teams often have a combination of these factors working in their favor, but the road to a championship is challenging and demanding.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q5cdwg62slzmjtok', 'title': 'What does an NFL team need to win a championship?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Winning an NFL championship, such as the Super Bowl, is a complex and multifaceted achievement that requires a combination of factors, including talent, teamwork, strategy, and luck.

Ajay Kumar,16-Sep,"What if the NFL had continued to dominate the American sports landscape, maintaining its position as the most popular professional sports league in the country?","The NFL has long been one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States, and its continued dominance of the American sports landscape has significant implications across various areas:

Economic Impact: A continued dominance of the NFL would mean that it remains a major driver of economic activity. This includes revenue from ticket sales, merchandise, advertising, broadcasting rights, and related industries such as sports betting.
Media Landscape: The NFL's popularity heavily influences the media landscape. Networks and digital platforms that broadcast NFL games would continue to command high advertising rates, and the league's media partnerships would remain lucrative.
Player Salaries: Players in the NFL, particularly star athletes, would likely continue to command some of the highest salaries in professional sports.
Youth Participation: Football's popularity at the professional level often influences youth participation in the sport. If the NFL continued to dominate, it might lead to sustained interest among young athletes, as well as continued investment in youth football programs.
Fantasy Sports and Gambling: The NFL is a major driver of fantasy sports and sports betting. Its continued dominance would mean sustained growth in these industries.
Cultural Impact: Football, including the NFL, plays a significant role in American culture. It influences everything from Super Bowl Sunday traditions to the broader conversation around sportsmanship, concussions, and player activism.
International Expansion: The NFL has been exploring international markets. Continued dominance might lead to further expansion of American football in other countries, potentially making it a global sport.
Challenges and Controversies: The NFL has faced various challenges and controversies, including issues related to player health and safety, domestic violence incidents involving players, and debates over player protests. Maintaining its dominance would likely mean an ongoing spotlight on these issues.
Competition: Other sports leagues would continue to compete for viewership and revenue, which could lead to innovations, changes in strategy, and efforts to challenge the NFL's position.
Evolution of the Game: The NFL would likely continue to evolve its rules, technologies, and the overall fan experience to maintain and enhance its appeal.

It's important to note that while the NFL has maintained its popularity for many years, the sports landscape can change over time. Factors such as demographics, societal trends, and emerging sports could impact the NFL's dominance in the future. Additionally, the NFL would still face challenges in addressing issues like player health and safety, which have garnered significant attention in recent years.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mchzkq9g8db64o7s', 'title': 'What if the NFL had continued to dominate the American sports landscape, maintaining its position as the most popular professional sports league in the country?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The NFL has long been one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States, and its continued dominance of the American sports landscape has significant implications across various areas:\n\nEconomic Impact: A continued dominance of the NFL would mean that it remains a major driver of economic activity.

Mr. Boom Boom,Updated 1y,"In terms of profitability, where does Jerry Jones' acquiring of the Dallas Cowboys rank among the greatest deals in sports history?","In the purview of hindsight 33 years later, it sure does look like a master stroke of genius. However, this isn’t the real explanation to the financial success of the Dallas Cowboys.

If we view the reality when Jones had decided to purchase the Cowboys for the 1989 $130 mm price tag. The common wisdom of the day was gloomy that judged as too wreckless of a venture investors should pass on - and did. Jones wasn’t praised as a genius but laughed at as a joke of a businessman on the first day he was owner of the Dallas Cowboys. It was reported at the time of the sale, the Dallas Cowboys were losing more than $1mm a month. This was a very large amount of money by the standards of that era.

Jones is by nature a risk taker. He admits he has gone financially broke at least two times because of failed business risk investment. It was also reported that Jones invested everything he owned at the time to complete the deal to own the Dallas Cowboys. In other words, Jones had no fallback if the Dallas Cowboys had blew up in his face - as predicted by common wisdom in the US business community of that day.

Fortunes didn’t turn right away after Jones bought the team either. The Cowboys cash flow was still very poor. This restricted the franchise ability to meet its payroll and creditors on time in payments. The team was losing on the field and sold out a very small fraction of its home games. The fortunes of the Dallas Cowboys (and the NFL) turned for the better when the NFL had decided to reform its business model through comprehensive revenue sharing, investment in stadiums, and a league salary cap. Jones was the point man in the advocacy to reform.

NFL Properties LLC, the league's business and marketing arm, had filed a $300 million lawsuit that challenged licensing and sponsorship agreements involving Jones and Texas Stadium that included private contracts with Nike, AT&T, Dr Pepper, American Express and Pepsi. The suit had contended those arrangements violated NFL Properties LLC' centralized licensing and marketing role for the league. In response, Jones filed a $700 million lawsuit charging that NFL Properties' centralized role violated federal antitrust laws. The suit had claimed the Texas Stadium sponsorships didn't involve Cowboys trademarks and were consistent with NFL Properties LLC rules. A settlement was reached.

This settlement had inspired other NFL franchises to change their positions on stadium investment which was commonly believed to be bad business. After all, the final settlement had shown none were prevented from doing the same sale of stadium advertising that Jones was doing. New stadiums, existing stadium major renovations and stadium naming rights had become the new normal in the NFL. 33 years later, an NFL stadium has evolved into a major source of revenue for NFL and non NFL events.

It is signficant changes in the way the NFL does business over the last 33 years that has resulted in the bottom #32 franchise at near $3 billion in estimated value today. It is this value standard of the #32 franchise that has driven the estimated value of the Dallas Cowboys into the stratosphere. Jones deserves some of that credit and is in the HOF for that effort. However, anybody that is familar with events within those 33 years also knows that it wasn’t just luck or without a struggle in changing hearts and minds.

Jones doesn’t have to be personally liked to earn high respect from his business peers among NFL owners. This is where emotional fandoms get it commonly wrong about Jones. If you were one of 32 NFL owners, you would be most thankful Jones, the business and marketing talent, is your peer because he is going to likely demonstrate how to increase your own profits.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/krqhwvbu0g47znci', 'title': ""In terms of profitability, where does Jerry Jones' acquiring of the Dallas Cowboys rank among the greatest deals in sports history?"", 'score': {'original': 0.89075, 'ai': 0.10925}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""In the purview of hindsight 33 years later, it sure does look like a master stroke of genius.

However, this isn’t the real explanation to the financial success of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nIf we view the reality when Jones had decided to purchase the Cowboys for the 1989 $130 mm price tag. The common wisdom of the day was gloomy that judged as too wreckless of a venture investors should pass on - and did. Jones wasn’t praised as a genius but laughed at as a joke of a businessman on the first day he was owner of the Dallas Cowboys. It was reported at the time of the sale, the Dallas Cowboys were losing more than $1mm a month. This was a very large amount of money by the standards of that era.\n\nJones is by nature a risk taker. He admits he has gone financially broke at least two times because of failed business risk investment. It was also reported that Jones invested everything he owned at the time to complete the deal to own the Dallas Cowboys. In other words, Jones had no fallback if the Dallas Cowboys had blew up in his face - as predicted by common wisdom in the US business community of that day.\n\nFortunes didn’t turn right away after Jones bought the team either. The Cowboys cash flow was still very poor. This restricted the franchise ability to meet its payroll and creditors on time in payments. The team was losing on the field and sold out a very small fraction of its home games. The fortunes of the Dallas Cowboys (and the NFL) turned for the better when the NFL had decided to reform its business model through comprehensive revenue sharing, investment in stadiums, and a league salary cap. Jones was the point man in the advocacy to reform.\n\nNFL Properties LLC, the league's business and marketing arm, had filed a $300 million lawsuit that challenged licensing and sponsorship agreements involving Jones and Texas Stadium that included private contracts with Nike, AT&T, Dr Pepper, American Express and Pepsi. The suit had contended those arrangements violated NFL Properties LLC' centralized licensing and marketing role for the league. In response, Jones filed a $700 million lawsuit charging that NFL Properties' centralized role violated federal antitrust laws. The suit had claimed the Texas Stadium sponsorships didn't involve Cowboys trademarks and were consistent with NFL Properties LLC rules. A settlement was reached.\n\nThis settlement had inspired other NFL franchises to change their positions on stadium investment which was commonly believed to be bad business. After all, the final settlement had shown none were prevented from doing the same sale of stadium advertising that Jones was doing. New stadiums, existing stadium major renovations and stadium naming rights had become the new normal in the NFL. 33 years later, an NFL stadium has evolved into a major source of revenue for NFL and non NFL events.\n\nIt is signficant changes in the way the NFL does business over the last 33 years that has resulted in the bottom #32 franchise at near $3 billion in estimated value today. It is this value standard of the #32 franchise that has driven the estimated value of the Dallas Cowboys into the stratosphere. Jones deserves some of that credit and is in the HOF for that effort. However, anybody that is familar with events within those 33 years also knows that it wasn’t just luck or without a struggle in changing hearts and minds.\n\nJones doesn’t have to be personally liked to earn high respect from his business peers among NFL owners.

Story 2 Solution.,6mo,"What are your thoughts on the future of major sports networks? Do you think they will all eventually merge into one company or two? If not, why not?","I think the future of major sports networks is likely to be a mix of consolidation and fragmentation. On the one hand, we are seeing a trend towards consolidation, as major media companies like Disney, Amazon, and Apple acquire sports rights and launch their own streaming services. This is likely to continue in the coming years, as more and more fans cut the cord and move to streaming services.

On the other hand, we are also seeing a trend towards fragmentation, as new streaming services emerge to cater to niche audiences. For example, there are now streaming services dedicated to specific sports leagues, such as the NFL, NBA, and MLB. There are also streaming services dedicated to specific sports genres, such as combat sports, esports, and golf.

I think it is possible that the major sports networks will eventually merge into one or two companies. However, I think it is also possible that they will continue to exist as a mix of large and small companies, each with its own niche audience. Ultimately, the future of major sports networks will depend on the preferences of sports fans and the evolution of technology.

Here are some factors that could lead to consolidation of major sports networks:

* The rising cost of sports rights. As the popularity of sports continues to grow, the cost of acquiring sports rights is also increasing. This is putting a strain on the finances of many sports networks, and it could lead to mergers as companies look to pool their resources.

* The decline of cable TV. As more and more fans cut the cord and move to streaming services, the traditional business model of sports networks is under threat. This could lead to mergers as companies look to scale their operations and reach a wider audience.

* The rise of new technology. The development of new technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, could create new opportunities for sports networks. However, it could also lead to fragmentation, as new streaming services emerge to cater to niche audiences.

Here are some factors that could prevent consolidation of major sports networks:

* The competitive nature of the sports media industry. Sports networks are fiercely competitive, and they are unlikely to give up their independence without a fight.

* The importance of local sports coverage. Major sports networks often have a strong focus on local sports coverage. This is important to many fans, and it could prevent them from switching to national streaming services.

* The regulatory environment. The government could intervene to prevent the consolidation of major sports networks. This is unlikely to happen, but it is a possibility.

Ultimately, the future of major sports networks is uncertain. It is possible that they will eventually merge into one or two companies. However, it is also possible that they will continue to exist as a mix of large and small companies, each with its own niche audience.I

1. Lack of a Strong Supporting Cast:

• The Dolphins struggled to encompass Marino with a consistent and dominant supporting cast throughout his career. While Marino was undoubtedly one of the most productive passers in NFL history, he often lacked a dominant guard, an elite running game, or a reliable hostile line to complement his abilities.

• In the NFL, championships are typically won by teams with a balanced approach, where both the offense and guard play crucial jobs. Marino's Dolphins frequently had one without the other.

2. Tough Competition:

• Marino played in an era loaded up with legendary quarterbacks and dominant teams. Any semblance of Joe Montana, John Elway, and others were formidable competitors in the quest for Super Bowl titles.

A stable coaching staff can be essential for a team's drawn out progress, and Marino's frequent openness to new systems may have frustrated his championship prospects.

2. MVP Distinctions:

3. 1984 Season:

• Marino's 1984 season is often regarded as perhaps of the greatest single season by a quarterback in NFL history. He set records for passing yards and touchdowns in a solitary season and drove the Dolphins to the Super Bowl, where they were defeated by the San Francisco 49ers.

4. Legacy Past Football:

• Marino's contributions extend past the field. He has been active in charitable endeavors and has built a strong post-football career in broadcasting and business.

Mano TechHub,24-Sep,How do NFL teams make money?,"NFL teams make money from a variety of sources, including:

Television and streaming rights: The NFL has incredibly lucrative television and streaming rights deals with major networks and streaming providers. This is by far the largest source of revenue for NFL teams.
Ticket sales: NFL games are some of the most popular sporting events in the world, and tickets can be very expensive. Teams generate significant revenue from ticket sales, especially for premium games like playoff games and Super Bowls.
Merchandise sales: NFL merchandise is also very popular, and teams generate revenue from the sale of jerseys, hats, and other items.
Corporate sponsorships: NFL teams also have sponsorship deals with a variety of companies. This can include things like naming rights for stadiums and practice facilities, as well as product and service endorsements.
Local revenue: Teams also generate revenue from local sources, such as concession sales and parking fees.

It is important to note that NFL teams share most of their revenue with each other. This is known as revenue sharing. This system helps to ensure that all teams are financially stable, even if they are not very successful on the field.

Amanda Kevin,09-Oct,What sports teams are famous for not travelling well?,"As an expert in property image enhancement, I must say that when it comes to sports teams notorious for not traveling well, there are a few that immediately come to mind.

One team that stands out is the Stay-at-Home All-Stars.

These athletes have perfected the art of not venturing outside the comfort of their home turf.

Whether it's a fear of unfamiliar surroundings or simply a lack of wanderlust, they prefer to keep their performances confined to their own backyard.

Another team that deserves a mention is the Jet Laggers.

These individuals seem to be perpetually affected by the woes of time zone changes and long flights.

It's as if their athletic abilities diminish the moment they step foot outside their home city.

Perhaps they should consider investing in some travel-sized coffins for their players to rest in during away games.

In all seriousness, though, every team has its ups and downs when playing away from home.

It's the nature of the game, and the true champions rise above these challenges.

So, let's not be too hard on these teams and instead appreciate the excitement and unpredictability that comes with sports, both at home and on the road.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/w31lq678yrtnhxpz', 'title': 'What sports teams are famous for not travelling well?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""As an expert in property image enhancement, I must say that when it comes to sports teams notorious for not traveling well, there are a few that immediately come to mind.\n\nOne team that stands out is the Stay-at-Home All-Stars.\n\nThese athletes have perfected the art of not venturing outside the comfort of their home turf.\n\nWhether it's a fear of unfamiliar surroundings or simply a lack of wanderlust, they prefer to keep their performances confined to their own backyard.\n\nAnother team that deserves a mention is the Jet Laggers.\n\nThese individuals seem to be perpetually affected by the woes of time zone changes and long flights.\n\nIt's as if their athletic abilities diminish the moment they step foot outside their home city.\n\nPerhaps they should consider investing in some travel-sized coffins for their players to rest in during away games.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, every team has its ups and downs when playing away from home.\n\nIt's the nature of the game, and the true champions rise above these challenges.\n\nSo, let's not be too hard on these teams and instead appreciate the excitement and unpredictability that comes with sports, both at home and on the road."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1998355, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""As an expert in property image enhancement, I must say that when it comes to sports teams notorious for not traveling well, there are a few that immediately come to mind.\n\nOne team that stands out is the Stay-at-Home All-Stars.\n\nThese athletes have perfected the art of not venturing outside the comfort of their home turf.\n\nWhether it's a fear of unfamiliar surroundings or simply a lack of wanderlust, they prefer to keep their performances confined to their own backyard.\n\nAnother team that deserves a mention is the Jet Laggers.\n\nThese individuals seem to be perpetually affected by the woes of time zone changes and long flights.\n\nIt's as if their athletic abilities diminish the moment they step foot outside their home city.\n\nPerhaps they should consider investing in some travel-sized coffins for their players to rest in during away games.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, every team has its ups and downs when playing away from home.\n\nIt's the nature of the game, and the true champions rise above these challenges.\n\nSo, let's not be too hard on these teams and instead appreciate the excitement and unpredictability that comes with sports, both at home and on the road."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0

Tony Twillie,1y,How does the salary cap impact NFL teams' ability to compete for championships?,"The salary cap is designed to even the playing field for all teams in the NFL. It makes it such that no team has a financial advantage over another, so a larger market team with deeper pockets can’t be at an advantage over a smaller market team.

Also, there is a minimum cap spend - that is less known. Every team has to spend a minimum amount of money, so one team can’t gain a financial advantage of keeping a low cap and then reaping a larger financial benefit.

It affects teams both positively and adversely at the same time. The positive, as mentioned, is that no team can simply purchase a “winning” roster, or stockpile all the talent. The negative is that at some point, some players’ value may rise so much that you can no longer afford to keep them, thus potentially weakening a very strong team. This would be a major issue in competing for championships, as you can’t keep players when their value exceeds what you can afford to spend on them, while continuing to field a strong roster.

Every team has a few star players who will take up a significant portion of the salary cap, then a large number of good players and role players. The best teams are the ones who can mine the most talent for the least expenditure.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j2cuv31hia8sbo5q', 'title': ""How does the salary cap impact NFL teams' ability to compete for championships?"", 'score': {'original': 0.7241, 'ai': 0.2759}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The salary cap is designed to even the playing field for all teams in the NFL.

Michael W.,1y,How does making it into the National Football League (NFL) playoffs or the Super Bowl affect a team's revenue?,"Less than you might think.

The NFL shares TV revenue, as well as all other media revenue. They used to share something like 40% of gate receipts with visiting teams - it might be more now and I believe that I recall that it was different during COVID when teams in different places had different rules for fans in the seats. So you get your home game receipts, now with an average of 9 regular season games in 2022 and 2021.

But you do have to share home game revenue in the playoffs, and the Super Bowl revenue doesn’t go to the team but to the stadium owner (who may or may not be affiliated with the team) because it’s at a neutral site.

The biggest thing that does affect revenue is winning. Put a bad team on the field and your attendance will suffer until you turn things around. And some teams - like Detroit or Jacksonville - manage to be miserable for years.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ps1elj827t6minrh', 'title': ""How does making it into the National Football League (NFL) playoffs or the Super Bowl affect a team's revenue?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Less than you might think.\n\nThe NFL shares TV revenue, as well as all other media revenue.

Peter Badovinatz,1y,Will the NFL ever have another league compete with them?,"Not sure how you mean this. If you mean will the US ever have another American Football (gridiron) league to compete with the NFL?

No. It won’t.

If you mean will another sport challenge the NFL (National (American) Football League) for number one on the US sports scene? Well, that’s a different question and one without as clear an answer. But I’m not really interested, at this point only the NBA (National Basketball Association) can challenge it. MLB (Major League Baseball) will stay in the top three. For the readers outside the US, soccer will not overtake the Big Three. Some claim that MLS (Major League Soccer) is already more popular than the NHL (National (Ice) Hockey League), but that’s only based on attendance. In terms of TV contracts, value of teams and the like, the NHL is still well ahead of MLS. But ice hockey is facing some head winds, so we’ll see.

But, there’s an easy determinant. If I’m a baseball, basketball or ice hockey star in Europe or elsewhere outside of North America, where do I go for stardom and riches? MLB, the NBA and NHL (if, somehow, you do want to play gridiron, there is only one choice, you find your way into a major college program and then train up to play in the NFL.) If I’m a super talented American soccer player, where do I want to play? Europe. NOT in MLS.

But back to the first point. Why is the impossibility of a true gridiron league to compete with the NFL so clear?

Money. What else?

Ok. The Dallas Cowboys are ‘worth’ an estimated US$7.64 billion (yup, with a ‘B’, we’re talking US$7,640,000,000 just to ensure our terms are clear.) The Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots and New York Giants are all worth over US$5 billion each, approaching US$6 billion. For comparison, the top English Premier League soccer teams (e.g., the Manchester clubs, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool) are in the US$3 to US$4 billion range.

Back to the NFL. Unlike the English Premier League and other soccer leagues, there is no process of promotion and relegation for gridiron. There is, in other words, no pyramid.

What does this mean? The NFL is the richest sports league in the world and it’s a ‘closed’ system. Unlike the English Premier League or other soccer leagues, you can’t start cheap and invest wisely and build your way up. Like Gretna did in Scotland to rise from obscurity the Scottish Premier League and the UEFA Cup before it all collapsed. The only way in is to buy an expansion franchise, and that only if the league decides to offer one, or to buy an existing team. The expansion fee is said to be US$1 billion… Just to buy the RIGHT to then spend at least another billion actually creating a team. Or, if you want to buy the Dallas Cowboys? Pony up US$8 billion…

Informally, the major US University (NCAA, ‘college’) programs act as the ‘minor’ leagues for the NFL. If anyone thinks the top college teams can compete with the NFL teams… get over it. Over 70% of the players on NFL rosters were drafted in the first four rounds of the annual draft. About 13% were originally undrafted. But that means that most of the players on college teams have little hope of playing in the NFL.

Back to point. For a competitor league to challenge the NFL, it will need to put out a product that matches and in some ways surpasses the existing offering. But…

What do the stats above tell us? It tells us that there is no pool of NFL-quality players sitting on their asses every weekend during the season. Sure, your cousin Jake might have the size of an NFL tight end… but does he have the speed? The discipline? Does he have the all-consuming drive? The, uh, talent?

I’m hearing some of you in the back of the room grunting “what about the AFL?” (American Football League, founded 1959.) It challenged the NFL so successfully that the leagues merged in 1970!

Sure. That was a loooong time ago.

Okay. In 1959, the NFL was not the juggernaut it is today. MLB ruled the sports roost, the NBA and NFL were also-rans. Arguably, collegiate gridiron surpassed the NFL in popularity for the sport. The AFL had some advantages that do not exist today:

The post-WWII US economy had made the country rich. More importantly, it spread the wealth across the country. This meant that there were a number of cities and investors with the wherewithal to build competitive teams. Cities that’d been denied NFL franchises could host one (e.g., Boston, Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, Buffalo, Houston, Miami, Oakland.)
Salaries in the NFL at the time were relatively low. Which meant that players were easily lured by throwing cash at them. In their first few years they were able to outbid the staid NFL teams for top college players, such as Billy Cannon and Joe Namath.
There were only three television networks, and the NFL was tied to CBS. ABC saw an opportunity and signed a deal with the new AFL from its inception. This was new, in that ABC paid a single fee to the league and that was shared among all of the teams. (Teams also got amounts around each game, but the innovation was the sharing.) The AFL also put players’ names on the jerseys, another innovation that made them recognizable, and ABC used multiple and mobile cameras.
All of this kicked off the NFL becoming the “made for TV” extravaganza that it is today as CBS and the NFL followed suit to compete.
But, really, if you locked in a network, you locked in viewers. They had nowhere else to go. And, back to the economy. More people could afford larger, color televisions, which made the games more entertaining to watch.

These factors no longer hold. Salaries in the NFL are sky high, players drafted in the first round are getting signing bonuses of around US$20 million each. That’s before they even set foot on the playing field. Who is going to bankroll not just one, but an entire draft’s worth of such signings to create a competitive league, like the AFL did in the mid-1960s?

Another factor is that most cities that CAN host NFL teams now do. There aren’t that many cities that aren’t already served by an NFL team. Sure, San Diego is butthurt about losing the Chargers, but it’s harder to tell how Oakland feels with the Raiders decamped to Las Vegas. But given that NFL teams are franchises, and not ‘clubs’ in the sense of most soccer leagues around the world, if a city can make the bribery extreme enough, they can probably get a team. But, in all honestly, most have come to see it’s not really cost-effective (we’ll see how the Raiders work out in Vegas.)

So we lack a ready set of cities and investors that can pay the ridiculous sums to one, suck the best players out of the NFL, and two, create infrastructure (stadiums, etc.) for them. The factors that allowed the AFL to compete just don’t exist anymore.

The only thing that can destroy the NFL is the NFL.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/uvf7zqml5a62s4it', 'title': 'Will the NFL ever have another league compete with them?', 'score': {'original': 0.9029, 'ai': 0.0971}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Not sure how you mean this.

In terms of TV contracts, value of teams and the like, the NHL is still well ahead of MLS. But ice hockey is facing some head winds, so we’ll see.\n\nBut, there’s an easy determinant. If I’m a baseball, basketball or ice hockey star in Europe or elsewhere outside of North America, where do I go for stardom and riches? MLB, the NBA and NHL (if, somehow, you do want to play gridiron, there is only one choice, you find your way into a major college program and then train up to play in the NFL.) If I’m a super talented American soccer player, where do I want to play? Europe. NOT in MLS.\n\nBut back to the first point. Why is the impossibility of a true gridiron league to compete with the NFL so clear?\n\nMoney. What else?\n\nOk. The Dallas Cowboys are ‘worth’ an estimated US$7.64 billion (yup, with a ‘B’, we’re talking US$7,640,000,000 just to ensure our terms are clear.) The Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots and New York Giants are all worth over US$5 billion each, approaching US$6 billion. For comparison, the top English Premier League soccer teams (e.g., the Manchester clubs, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool) are in the US$3 to US$4 billion range.\n\nBack to the NFL. Unlike the English Premier League and other soccer leagues, there is no process of promotion and relegation for gridiron. There is, in other words, no pyramid.\n\nWhat does this mean? The NFL is the richest sports league in the world and it’s a ‘closed’ system. Unlike the English Premier League or other soccer leagues, you can’t start cheap and invest wisely and build your way up. Like Gretna did in Scotland to rise from obscurity the Scottish Premier League and the UEFA Cup before it all collapsed. The only way in is to buy an expansion franchise, and that only if the league decides to offer one, or to buy an existing team. The expansion fee is said to be US$1 billion… Just to buy the RIGHT to then spend at least another billion actually creating a team. Or, if you want to buy the Dallas Cowboys? Pony up US$8 billion…\n\nInformally, the major US University (NCAA, ‘college’) programs act as the ‘minor’ leagues for the NFL. If anyone thinks the top college teams can compete with the NFL teams… get over it. Over 70% of the players on NFL rosters were drafted in the first four rounds of the annual draft. About 13% were originally undrafted. But that means that most of the players on college teams have little hope of playing in the NFL.\n\nBack to point. For a competitor league to challenge the NFL, it will need to put out a product that matches and in some ways surpasses the existing offering. But…\n\nWhat do the stats above tell us? It tells us that there is no pool of NFL-quality players sitting on their asses every weekend during the season. Sure, your cousin Jake might have the size of an NFL tight end… but does he have the speed? The discipline? Does he have the all-consuming drive? The, uh, talent?\n\nI’m hearing some of you in the back of the room grunting “what about the AFL?” (American Football League, founded 1959.) It challenged the NFL so successfully that the leagues merged in 1970!\n\nSure. That was a loooong time ago.\n\nOkay. In 1959, the NFL was not the juggernaut it is today. MLB ruled the sports roost, the NBA and NFL were also-rans. Arguably, collegiate gridiron surpassed the NFL in popularity for the sport. The AFL had some advantages that do not exist today:\n\nThe post-WWII US economy had made the country rich. More importantly, it spread the wealth across the country. This meant that there were a number of cities and investors with the wherewithal to build competitive teams. Cities that’d been denied NFL franchises could host one (e.g., Boston, Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, Buffalo, Houston, Miami, Oakland.)\nSalaries in the NFL at the time were relatively low. Which meant that players were easily lured by throwing cash at them. In their first few years they were able to outbid the staid NFL teams for top college players, such as Billy Cannon and Joe Namath.\nThere were only three television networks, and the NFL was tied to CBS. ABC saw an opportunity and signed a deal with the new AFL from its inception. This was new, in that ABC paid a single fee to the league and that was shared among all of the teams. (Teams also got amounts around each game, but the innovation was the sharing.) The AFL also put players’ names on the jerseys, another innovation that made them recognizable, and ABC used multiple and mobile cameras.\nAll of this kicked off the NFL becoming the “made for TV” extravaganza that it is today as CBS and the NFL followed suit to compete.\nBut, really, if you locked in a network, you locked in viewers. They had nowhere else to go. And, back to the economy. More people could afford larger, color televisions, which made the games more entertaining to watch.\n\nThese factors no longer hold. Salaries in the NFL are sky high, players drafted in the first round are getting signing bonuses of around US$20 million each. That’s before they even set foot on the playing field. Who is going to bankroll not just one, but an entire draft’s worth of such signings to create a competitive league, like the AFL did in the mid-1960s?\n\nAnother factor is that most cities that CAN host NFL teams now do. There aren’t that many cities that aren’t already served by an NFL team. Sure, San Diego is butthurt about losing the Chargers, but it’s harder to tell how Oakland feels with the Raiders decamped to Las Vegas. But given that NFL teams are franchises, and not ‘clubs’ in the sense of most soccer leagues around the world, if a city can make the bribery extreme enough, they can probably get a team. But, in all honestly, most have come to see it’s not really cost-effective (we’ll see how the Raiders work out in Vegas.)\n\nSo we lack a ready set of cities and investors that can pay the ridiculous sums to one, suck the best players out of the NFL, and two, create infrastructure (stadiums, etc.) for them. The factors that allowed the AFL to compete just don’t exist anymore.\n\nThe only thing that can destroy the NFL is the NFL.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9029
Sporbit,03-Nov,What processes drive a sports team's off-field strategic decisions?,"A sports team's off-field strategic decisions are driven by a combination of factors, and they can vary depending on the specific sport, the team's goals, resources, and circumstances. Here are some of the key processes that influence these decisions:

Ownership and Leadership Vision: The team's owner or ownership group and senior leadership set the overarching vision and goals for the organization. Their personal preferences, financial objectives, and commitment to winning can heavily influence the team's strategy.
Market and Fan Base: The team's location and the size and demographics of its fan base can impact off-field strategies. Teams may make decisions to cater to local preferences and maximize their appeal to fans.
Financial Considerations: Managing the team's finances is a critical aspect of off-field strategy. This includes setting budgets, determining ticket prices, securing sponsorship deals, and managing revenue streams like merchandise sales.
Player Recruitment and Development: Acquiring and developing talent is a key component of a sports team's success. Teams must decide on strategies for scouting, drafting, trading, and developing players to build a competitive roster.
Coaching and Training Staff: Decisions related to hiring and retaining coaches, trainers, and support staff are vital. The right coaching staff can make a significant difference in a team's performance.
Marketing and Branding: Building and maintaining a strong brand and marketing strategy is essential for attracting fans and sponsors. This involves decisions related to advertising, social media presence, and community engagement.
Stadium and Facility Management: Decisions about the team's home venue, practice facilities, and game-day experience are crucial. Teams may need to invest in facility upgrades or consider relocating to better meet their objectives.
Sponsorships and Partnerships: Establishing relationships with sponsors and partners can provide essential revenue streams. Decisions related to sponsorship agreements and partnerships are part of the off-field strategy.
Media and Broadcasting Rights: Negotiating broadcast contracts and digital media rights is a key financial consideration. These deals can significantly impact a team's revenue.
Fan Engagement: Engaging with fans through fan events, loyalty programs, and community involvement is vital for building a dedicated fan base.
League Rules and Regulations: Compliance with league rules and regulations, as well as understanding how to strategically navigate them, is essential. Teams must make decisions to maximize their competitive advantages within the framework of league rules.
Competitive Analysis: Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of other teams in the league is crucial. Teams often conduct competitive analysis to identify opportunities for strategic advantages.
Long-term Planning: Teams often engage in long-term planning to set a course for the future. This may involve multi-year plans for talent development, facility upgrades, and financial stability.
Reputation Management: Protecting and enhancing the team's reputation is an ongoing process. Decisions related to player conduct, community engagement, and crisis management are part of this strategy.
Risk Management: Sports teams must assess and manage various risks, including injuries to key players, changes in market conditions, and legal challenges.

These processes are interconnected, and the effectiveness of off-field strategic decisions often depends on the ability of team leadership to balance and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of professional sports. Successful teams are those that can align these processes with a clear vision and the resources to execute their strategies.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9mtd4l7jpvxb15ci', 'title': ""What processes drive a sports team's off-field strategic decisions?"", 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""A sports team's off-field strategic decisions are driven by a combination of factors, and they can vary depending on the specific sport, the team's goals, resources, and circumstances.

Brian Forlano,29-Jan,"Why do professional sports teams no longer have names like ""The Cleveland Browns""?","They do still have names like the Cleveland Browns. The Cleveland Browns are literally an NFL football team.

I'm not even sure what you mean “like the Cleveland Browns”?

I think I only partly understand what you're asking, if I had a couple more teams with similar names, I might completely understand what you're asking.

But, I'll partly answer about the Cleveland Browns team name. It's true, it's a very unique name because the Browns are names after their first head coach & co-founder Paul Brown.

The story is Paul Brown didn't want the team names after him, so there was a contest in Cleveland to name the team.

The name “Panthers” won out. The Panthers had been the name of a prior pro football team in Cleveland that had failed.

Paul Brown didn't want to be associated with something that previously failed, so he wanted to look for another name, the Browns came up again & Paul Brown didn't want to nix another team name, so Cleveland Browns it was.

Or maybe that's all bull**** & he was just a narcissist, either way, it is a very unique team name because of it being named after one man.

Brown won 4 high school National Championships at his Alma mater Massillon. He took over a team that had been 2-6–2 the year prior.

As a high-school coach, Brown would invent the playback, calling plays via hand signals into his QB during the game.

He also won 5 state championships (Ohio) & 4 Hogh School National Championships. His team wouldn't lose a game over a 35 game span & his 1940 team is still revered as one of the greatest high school teams of all-time.

They even played Kent State in a scrimmage, defeating the college team 47–0.

Next, Paul Brown would test the college game. This was a short stint but again it was at his Alma mater Ohio State.

Brown led the Buckeyes to their first college football National Championship in 1942.

Next he would co-found the Cleveland Browns & he would lead them as their head coach & they won the championship each of their first 4 seasons - but not in the NFL

The Cleveland Browns were in a league called the AAFC (All-America Football Conference) The AAFC began attracting many of college football's best players.

However, the league ceased operations after 4 seasons, the Cleveland Browns won the championship in each of these seasons (1946-49).

How good was the AAFC, it was good enough that in their first season in the NFL, the Cleveland Browns would win the NFL championship too (1950) Brown would lead his namesake to two more NFL championships in 1954 & 1955 too.

Every one of these seasons, they were led by legendary Hall-of-Fame Quarterback - Otto Graham… I've watched Graham play a couple of these NFL championship games, I still have the tape of these games.

It was very easy for me to diagnose Graham's game. First, I was floored when I watched this man…

Want to know who Otto Graham was, he was Drew Brees with a stronger arm & he was a faster, better scrambler than Brees was.

Someone very familiar with Drew Brees’ skillset might be thinking, “I don't think this guy knows what he's talking about, he doesn't really know how good Brees was”

I do, I knew how good Drew Brees was immediately after the 2001 NFL Draft, when every team passed on him once in the NFL Draft.

I said then, what a mistake many teams just made & then when San Diego never gave him a real opportunity before drafting Phillip Rivers, I said - what a mistake again.

I was telling the same people this that I had told about “mistake” after the draft. A couple of the people wanted to laugh about it & say “give it up, you're not usually wrong but you were about Brees”

I said then, you just wait - that was funny to them. Long story - short, on NFL Sundays for the next 10-15 years,

we talked about what I actually knew & what they didn't know, I still find this funny but for some reason they stopped laughing.

So, when I say Otto Graham is Drew Brees with an arm & a different level of scrambling ability, that's what I mean.

He was one of the greatest QB's to ever play pro football, Graham played pro football for 10 seasons (1946-55), all with the Cleveland Browns.

In those 10 seasons, Otto Graham was a legendary QB of the highest order, if you don't want to trust in my diagnosis…..

In 10 years, he won 7 championship rings, was named All-Pro seven times & won 3 MVP awards, the facts, they support this.

Graham retired after the 1955 NFL championship win & Jim Brown was drafted a year later by Paul Brown.

Ok, Back to the legendary coach, Brown, as happens in most instances with legendary head coaches, Paul Brown wore out his welcome by 1962. The team names after the top tier coaching legend didn't want to continue with the actual man at the helm.

In 1968, Brown co-founded another pro football franchise. Guess what State it was in? It was the Alaska Igloos 😄 😁 🤣 😂. NO, I think the Igloos are a new expansion team in the UFL?

To no one's surprise, Brown would co-found the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968, he would be head coach from 1968-to-1975 but would remain owner & tea, president until 1990.

The Bengals like the Browns prior, at their inception, they weren't an NFL expansion team. The Bengals were an AFL team.

When the Bengals joined the NFL in the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, they lost their starting QB. The backup, a player named Virgil Carter wasn't known for his arm strength

This was when Brown & his wide receivers coach began to devise a modified offense, an offense tailored to his QB's strengths - which was accuracy & his weakness was arm strength.

The name of Brown's receivers coach was Bill Walsh & the offense he created was the West Coast offense.

The Bengals would make the playoffs in their first season in the NFL. Brown wouldn't win any playoff games in his head coaching tenure in Cincinnati but he'd make the playoffs three times. (1970, 1973, 1975)

The following season, Bill Walsh would add Quarterbacks coach to his resume & Paul Brown would draft QB Ken Anderson to replace Carter, who led the NFL in passing % that season he took over - in 1970.

When you look at Paul Brown's coaching career & what he contributed to the game of football, it's evident that he was a visionary, a pioneer & a legendary head coach at all levels of competition.

He was the first coach to watch game film to scout opposition, he created the football playback, the first coach to hire a full-time staff of assistants & he was the first coach to call plays from the sideline. He helped in the creation of the West Coast offense too.

He took over a team that had been 2-6–2 the year prior.\n\nAs a high-school coach, Brown would invent the playback, calling plays via hand signals into his QB during the game.\n\nHe also won 5 state championships (Ohio) & 4 Hogh School National Championships. His team wouldn't lose a game over a 35 game span & his 1940 team is still revered as one of the greatest high school teams of all-time.\n\nThey even played Kent State in a scrimmage, defeating the college team 47–0.\n\nNext, Paul Brown would test the college game. This was a short stint but again it was at his Alma mater Ohio State.\n\nBrown led the Buckeyes to their first college football National Championship in 1942.\n\nNext he would co-found the Cleveland Browns & he would lead them as their head coach & they won the championship each of their first 4 seasons - but not in the NFL\n\nThe Cleveland Browns were in a league called the AAFC (All-America Football Conference) The AAFC began attracting many of college football's best players.\n\nHowever, the league ceased operations after 4 seasons, the Cleveland Browns won the championship in each of these seasons (1946-49).\n\nHow good was the AAFC, it was good enough that in their first season in the NFL, the Cleveland Browns would win the NFL championship too (1950) Brown would lead his namesake to two more NFL championships in 1954 & 1955 too.\n\nEvery one of these seasons, they were led by legendary Hall-of-Fame Quarterback - Otto Graham… I've watched Graham play a couple of these NFL championship games, I still have the tape of these games.\n\nIt was very easy for me to diagnose Graham's game. First, I was floored when I watched this man…\n\nWant to know who Otto Graham was, he was Drew Brees with a stronger arm & he was a faster, better scrambler than Brees was.\n\nSomeone very familiar with Drew Brees’ skillset might be thinking, “I don't think this guy knows what he's talking about, he doesn't really know how good Brees was”\n\nI do, I knew how good Drew Brees was immediately after the 2001 NFL Draft, when every team passed on him once in the NFL Draft.\n\nI said then, what a mistake many teams just made & then when San Diego never gave him a real opportunity before drafting Phillip Rivers, I said - what a mistake again.\n\nI was telling the same people this that I had told about “mistake” after the draft. A couple of the people wanted to laugh about it & say “give it up, you're not usually wrong but you were about Brees”\n\nI said then, you just wait - that was funny to them. Long story - short, on NFL Sundays for the next 10-15 years,\n\nwe talked about what I actually knew & what they didn't know, I still find this funny but for some reason they stopped laughing.\n\nSo, when I say Otto Graham is Drew Brees with an arm & a different level of scrambling ability, that's what I mean.\n\nHe was one of the greatest QB's to ever play pro football, Graham played pro football for 10 seasons (1946-55), all with the Cleveland Browns.\n\nIn those 10 seasons, Otto Graham was a legendary QB of the highest order, if you don't want to trust in my diagnosis…..\n\nIn 10 years, he won 7 championship rings, was named All-Pro seven times & won 3 MVP awards, the facts, they support this.\n\nGraham retired after the 1955 NFL championship win & Jim Brown was drafted a year later by Paul Brown.\n\nOk, Back to the legendary coach, Brown, as happens in most instances with legendary head coaches, Paul Brown wore out his welcome by 1962. The team names after the top tier coaching legend didn't want to continue with the actual man at the helm.\n\nIn 1968, Brown co-founded another pro football franchise. Guess what State it was in? It was the Alaska Igloos 😄 😁 🤣 😂. NO, I think the Igloos are a new expansion team in the UFL?\n\nTo no one's surprise, Brown would co-found the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968, he would be head coach from 1968-to-1975 but would remain owner & tea, president until 1990.\n\nThe Bengals like the Browns prior, at their inception, they weren't an NFL expansion team. The Bengals were an AFL team.\n\nWhen the Bengals joined the NFL in the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, they lost their starting QB. The backup, a player named Virgil Carter wasn't known for his arm strength\n\nThis was when Brown & his wide receivers coach began to devise a modified offense, an offense tailored to his QB's strengths - which was accuracy & his weakness was arm strength.\n\nThe name of Brown's receivers coach was Bill Walsh & the offense he created was the West Coast offense.\n\nThe Bengals would make the playoffs in their first season in the NFL. Brown wouldn't win any playoff games in his head coaching tenure in Cincinnati but he'd make the playoffs three times. (1970, 1973, 1975)\n\nThe following season, Bill Walsh would add Quarterbacks coach to his resume & Paul Brown would draft QB Ken Anderson to replace Carter, who led the NFL in passing % that season he took over - in 1970.\n\nWhen you look at Paul Brown's coaching career & what he contributed to the game of football, it's evident that he was a visionary, a pioneer & a legendary head coach at all levels of competition.\n\nHe was the first coach to watch game film to scout opposition, he created the football playback, the first coach to hire a full-time staff of assistants & he was the first coach to call plays from the sideline. He helped in the creation of the West Coast offense too.\n\nPaul Brown Coaching Accolades\n\n4x High School National Champion (1935, 36, 39, 40)\nNCAA National Champion (Ohio State) (1942)\n4x AAFC Champion (1946-49)\n3x NFL Champion (1950, 1954, 1955)\nAP NFL Coach of the Year (1970)\n3x UPI NFL Coach of the Year (1957, 1969, 1970)\n3x Sporting News Coach of the Year (1949, 1951, 1953)"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.6772

John (GrabCash.xyz),01-Oct,Why are there 82 games in an NBA regular season?,"In the NBA (National Basketball Association), the regular season typically consists of 82 games for each team. The number 82 was chosen for several reasons:

Tradition: The 82-game schedule has been in place for decades and has become a longstanding tradition in the NBA. It provides a substantial amount of basketball content for fans over the course of a season.
Balanced Competition: An 82-game season allows teams to play a relatively balanced schedule where they face each of the other teams in the league at least twice, once at home and once on the road. This balanced competition helps ensure fairness in the standings and playoff qualification.
Revenue Generation: More games mean more opportunities for revenue through ticket sales, merchandise, and television broadcasting rights. A longer season allows the NBA to generate higher revenue.
Statistical Consistency: With an 82-game season, players and teams have ample opportunities to accumulate statistics, which can be useful for evaluating player performance and team success.

It's worth noting that the NBA did shorten the regular season to 72 games for the 2020-2021 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the league has since returned to the traditional 82-game schedule for subsequent seasons. The 82-game season remains a standard in professional basketball and provides a balance between competition, revenue generation, and fan engagement.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/38gv6r4ts2cwny0k', 'title': 'Why are there 82 games in an NBA regular season?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""In the NBA (National Basketball Association), the regular season typically consists of 82 games for each team.

Michael W.,1y,"The NFL is said to be exploring expansion again, possibly bringing the league up to 40 teams. What would be the most likely and viable cities to add?","Any report that the NFL wants to expand is literally fake news and just there to generate hype and discussion.

The NFL owners are not stupid and they know that the market is presently saturated for media earnings. All the football fans who would watch football on TV, are already watching it on TV. Or the internet on a streaming service. Or their phones. The audience is only going to grow if there are new fans coming in faster than existing fans leave for other entertainment. Trust me, it happens. I can easily say that I don’t watch as much baseball or hockey as I did in the past, mostly because it’s hard to care about the results when they aren’t so meaningful, or you don’t care about the teams playing.

So the 32 teams presently share revenue from all this media exposure. They also share their gate receipts. And while on an average weekend, a million people will attend NFL games in person, that’s not the primary source of revenue.

Suppose we add 4 more teams. Will more people watch? Maybe a few. Will that be enough to increase the revenue lost to each team, when that TV deal is shared 36 ways, instead of 32? Trust me when I say that football fans in Oklahoma or Nebraska or Montana are already watching their favorite team, and not just sitting there waiting until a team appears within 3 hours of driving distance.

The NFL plays in Europe as a novelty but the logistics are tough. The league would vote down a move to have a single team in Europe. There won’t be an NFL team in Toronto because of the Bills voting against it. Mexico City isn’t an option for regular play because of the low income there. So the NFL is more about relocation than anything else.

If I would surmise, the NFL wants to move teams out of Green Bay and Buffalo and into bigger media markets, with newer and bigger facilities. The 10 biggest cities without an NFL team include 3 in Texas (including San Antonio, Austin and El Paso), 2 in California (San Jose and San Diego), and a number of scattered cities. I doubt that Columbus would get a team because of the proximity of both Cleveland and Cincinnati. The Packers used to play in Wisconsin too, and I don’t think that the market would work with a team in Oklahoma or a second team in Tennessee. And the team in Jacksonville is in trouble.

So the NFL recently saw teams move out of San Diego and Oakland, and before that, a move out of St. Louis. The NY teams share a new stadium, and things are quiet in most other places, but the NFL owners won’t share fixed revenue.

John Blick,08-Dec,When will we ever see any professional sports team be able to play a single game with out a single foul?,"When will we ever see any professional sports team be able to play a single game without a single foul?

How about less than two weeks ago?

On November 26th, the LA Raiders played the Kansas City Chiefs in the National Football League and recorded zero penalties.

SOURCE

Before that the Eagles played penalty-free on October 22nd, 2023.

For the penalty-free game before that, you have to go all the way back to….last year. The Chiefs, this time, on November 11th, 2022 against the Jags.

A team has played a full game without a penalty 23 times in the NFL since 2010.

But that’s the NFL, what about the NBA?

It turns out there has never been an NBA game without at least one foul committed by a team.

SOURCE

A foul is, of course, a different kind of penalty in basketball, and fouls are more a part of the game in basketball than penalties are in football. There are circumstances where committing a foul has strategic value in basketball. The fewest free throws attempted in any NBA game has been one, which means there has been at least one foul in every NBA game since 1953.

In the NHL there have already been eight teams that have played full games without a penalty this year, in 2023. Penality-free games in the NHL aren’t uncommon.

SOURCE

A foul means something different in baseball, of course. There doesn’t seem to be any record of zero foul balls in a game. It’s possible that there have been, and I just didn’t find it. There have been hundreds of no-hitters and a number of perfect games throughout baseball history, but I can’t find any indication that any of those pitchers were able to retire everyone without giving up even a single foul ball.

There are, however, frequently games in MLB where neither team commits a penalty. Penalties in baseball are much less a part of the game and have to be a pretty egregious infarction for the referees to call.

Not only have we already seen many professional sports teams complete an entire game without being called for a penalty, but it happens fairly regularly in the NHL and NFL. Fouls have a different meaning in the NBA and MLB, but as far as I can find there has never been a game without any fouls by either league's definition. There have been plenty of MLB games without any penalties, though.

Tony Twillie,8mo,"Are there any Major League sports teams looking for a new franchise team? If so, what are the requirements, and the costs involved, and would they care if it's incorporated, instead of a single owner?","I personally can’t see any of the major sports expanding right now. Basketball and baseball could jump to 32 teams without much issue beyond where to put new franchises. Basketball has one city in a holding pattern already, wanting to put a team back to Seattle. Las Vegas would probably make sense as the other city. MLB is moving to Las Vegas, but there isn’t much chance of a team going back to Oakland any time soon. There are prospects but there is no real talk.

And for all the hoopla, the NFL isn’t expanding anytime soon.

The big thing is while adding teams adds revenue, it also splits the revenue sharing. Any franchise would have to exhibit the ability to generate at least as much revenue as the worst teams in the league.

The going rate for an MLB team is slightly lower than the others, but your starting point would be around $2.5 billion. At the other end, the Denver Broncos were most recently purchased by the Walton-Penner families for $4.65 billion. Beyond that, the Commanders are supposedly being sold for $6 billion.

An ownership group is how most of the teams operate. You have a majority owner, with other owners involved. I don’t know exactly how incorporation works for or against you. I know that a business owning a business wouldn’t be a good business model and would likely not work. The Walton-Penner families may work as a group, but Wal-Mart likely wouldn’t be allowed to own the Broncos, like Home Depot would be allowed to own the Falcons even though the founder and owner of Home Depot is their owner.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1ml2ji3c65w9axg8', 'title': ""Are there any Major League sports teams looking for a new franchise team?

Esteban M.,16-Nov,"How do I make a national sports industry like the NBA, and what are the requirements for it?","You won't if you're vague like you're question.

No offense.

What exactly is your end game with your intentions?

Is it being a Hall-of-Fame player, a team executive, a referee?

I'm not the most successful person nor have I worked for the NBA in any way, shape, or form.

Nevertheless, I am 💯 confident that if you want to make it in any industry, you have to be very specific.

Let's use the Hall-of-Fame player route as an example:

How tall are you?

How big are you?

Know that you'll be judged by those numbers regardless of your talents first.

Second, do you want to make it the domestic route meaning like making a name for yourself via high school basketball or the amateur circuit, then playing a year/four years of college basketball for a Division 1 program/any program or the international route, which affords you the opportunity play professionally sooner at whatever age your ability consistently outshines your competition and merits you having a roster spot.

Above all else, you gotta envision yourself doing whatever it is you want to make it as.

You have to wake up with making your long-term goal your reality, which means everything you do in the short-term is geared and aligned with your long-term goal.

Before you begin, though, you gotta ask yourself if what you have ambitions of making your reality is not going to waver when obstacles or setbacks get in your way because trust me; they will pop up.

If making it to the NBA or bust is your response, it stops being a dream but rather a lifestyle.

You do research on players that you believe your style of game is similar to and dive in to learning and studying their routines and habits because that will give you a foil, someone to emulate because you're not, nor should you, use as a barometer anyone that isn't playing at the level you want to eventually be at, then some.

You want to elevate, never downgrade.

Lastly, make sure that you are having fun.

A saying that I 2nd, stand on, is…..

“If you love what you're doing, you'll never work a day in your life.”

Appreciate the journey, don't cut corners, so at the end of the day, if you come up short, you gave it your all and you didn't cheat yourself.

Don't bullshit yourself, neither.

If you suck, you suck.

If that becomes your unwanted reality, the sooner you accept your limitations, the sooner you can focus on being a team executive or a referee so your end goal of making it in the NBA in some capacity is still an option rather than a resentment.

Hope these words help.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cwfzqpd2glhaunbe', 'title': 'How do I make a national sports industry like the NBA, and what are the requirements for it?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""You won't if you're vague like you're question.\n\nNo offense.\n\nWhat exactly is your end game with your intentions?\n\nIs it being a Hall-of-Fame player, a team executive, a referee?\n\nI'm not the most successful person nor have I worked for the NBA in any way, shape, or form.\n\nNevertheless, I am 💯 confident that if you want to make it in any industry, you have to be very specific.\n\nLet's use the Hall-of-Fame player route as an example:\n\nHow tall are you?\n\nHow big are you?\n\nKnow that you'll be judged by those numbers regardless of your talents first.\n\nSecond, do you want to make it the domestic route meaning like making a name for yourself via high school basketball or the amateur circuit, then playing a year/four years of college basketball for a Division 1 program/any program or the international route, which affords you the opportunity play professionally sooner at whatever age your ability consistently outshines your competition and merits you having a roster spot.\n\nAbove all else, you gotta envision yourself doing whatever it is you want to make it as.\n\nYou have to wake up with making your long-term goal your reality, which means everything you do in the short-term is geared and aligned with your long-term goal.\n\nBefore you begin, though, you gotta ask yourself if what you have ambitions of making your reality is not going to waver when obstacles or setbacks get in your way because trust me;

Fashion Needles,06-Sep,"Why NFL playoffs format is not ""best-of-seven"" series like NBA?","The NFL playoffs format is not a ""best-of-seven"" series like the NBA (National Basketball Association) playoffs for several reasons:

Physical Demands: Football is a physically demanding sport with a higher risk of injuries compared to basketball. Playing a seven-game series in football would put an enormous strain on players' bodies and increase the likelihood of injuries, especially given the limited recovery time between games.
Game Frequency: The NFL regular season consists of 16 or 17 games (depending on the season), while the NBA regular season has significantly more games (82 in a standard season). The shorter NFL regular season makes it logistically challenging to have multiple rounds of best-of-seven series without significantly extending the season.
Historical Tradition: The NFL has a long history of single-elimination playoff games dating back to its inception. This format has become a fundamental part of the NFL's playoff tradition and is deeply ingrained in the league's culture.
Fan Excitement: The single-elimination format in the NFL playoffs adds an element of sudden death and excitement that many fans find appealing. Each playoff game carries a win-or-go-home mentality, making every play and decision crucial.
TV Scheduling: The NFL playoffs are a major television event, and the current format allows for consistent scheduling and programming that suits broadcasters and viewers. Best-of-seven series would introduce greater uncertainty into scheduling.
Historical Significance: The NFL's one-game playoff format has produced numerous iconic moments and historic games, contributing to the league's rich history and legacy.

While the NBA and NFL have different playoff formats, each format suits the nature and demands of its respective sport. The NFL's single-elimination playoff format has proven to be highly popular and successful, and it aligns with the unique characteristics of football. Ultimately, the choice of playoff format in each league is influenced by factors such as player safety, tradition, scheduling, and fan engagement.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/95zot20bidhjr8na', 'title': 'Why NFL playoffs format is not ""best-of-seven"" series like NBA?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The NFL playoffs format is not a ""best-of-seven"" series like the NBA (National Basketball Association) playoffs for several reasons:\n\nPhysical Demands: Football is a physically demanding sport with a higher risk of injuries compared to basketball.

Best-of-seven series would introduce greater uncertainty into scheduling.\nHistorical Significance: The NFL\'s one-game playoff format has produced numerous iconic moments and historic games, contributing to the league\'s rich history and legacy.\n\nWhile the NBA and NFL have different playoff formats, each format suits the nature and demands of its respective sport. The NFL\'s single-elimination playoff format has proven to be highly popular and successful, and it aligns with the unique characteristics of football. Ultimately, the choice of playoff format in each league is influenced by factors such as player safety, tradition, scheduling, and fan engagement.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0
Trowa Barton,11mo,"What is the definition of ""tanking"" in the context of professional sports? Do any NFL teams tank during their season intentionally in order to receive better draft picks or start rebuilding (like what happened with the Los Angeles Lakers)?","I don’t think NFL teams ever tank intentionally because tanking is something that NFL backseat GMs aka fans who think they can be GMs, want to do in order to get high draft picks. But the fans don’t live with the team 24/7. They turn off their TV, go back to their day job or X-Box or kids or their beer at the bar and talk about something else. It’s much more demoralizing to keep losing week in and week out when your life orbits around the team’s record.

Now is it possible? Yes. But it would have to be a Hunt for Red October situation where only a few men on the crew were actually trying to defect in the plot whereas most of the crew were clueless about it. Because the NFL players on the team aren’t going to be on board. The first thing a team does after it’s done losing is it starts rebuilding and cleaning house. Players are not going to intentionally suck to help the franchise fire them. In order to tank, the team has to naturally be terrible and that’s more difficult than you think.

To do it, they have to have the owner in on it. Because owners are not going to want the status of being the owner of a terrible football team. That’s not something that makes the women hot or gains them respect. People aren’t high on losers, especially intentional losers. Plus, if a team is losing, they’re not selling as many tickets. And other owners are going to hate them for hurting the league that way.

Next, and just as importantly, the GM has to be in on it because he’s the one who makes the final decisions when it comes to the roster. The director of player personnel would have to be in on it too. Because they’re the ones who are fired if the team sucks unintentionally and they’re in charge of the roster which is key to making the team suck enough to tank.

Also, the coach most likely has to be in on it and that’s a quandary right there. Because a losing season affects him more than anyone else. GM’s win-loss records aren’t recorded on Pro Football Reference. Owners don’t have their wins and losses counted either. It’s the Head Coach who has the record glued to his legacy. It is the Head Coach who has to bear the burden of a “losing season,” on his historical record. What self-respecting coach is going to agree to hurt his own legacy in order to tank for a player. Also, he’s not going to want to do that because he’s the guy who fans call to be fired. He’s the guy who could easily go along with a tanking then get squeezed out anyway more than the GM or personnel guy. Because there’s also the locker room. There’s a psychological factor with football teams. Even good competent coaches lose faith in the locker room after enough failure to win even if they get to the postseason. That’s what happened with Andy Reid in Philadelphia. And losing faith is very easy if you’re a coach of a team with conservatively 13 losses and liberally as many as 16 because the best team that still got the top overall pick that I can think of was a 4–12 team.

So good luck convincing the coach, who forfeits a great deal of time with his wife and children, by being in the office up to 60 or more hours a week not including game time on Sunday, to strain his eyes watching hours of film, strain his brain by analyzing that film as well as statistics, in order to formulate a game plan that’s meant to WIN the game. Not lose it. You want this guy to work that much in order to intentionally lose? That’s like asking me to intentionally walk 100 miles to an ice cream shop and not ask for a scoop of Rocky Road.

Also, I’m not sure that a team should tank because it doesn’t guarantee them the top pick. John Elway and Eli Manning both forced trades rather than go to the team that drafted them top overall. Neither of those teams tanked per say but I think if I was a QB (because you’re not gonna tank for any other position), and I saw a team intentionally lose to get me, I’m not going to be flattered. I’m going to wonder if I can survive there because the first step in a tank is bad QB play. There is no such thing as bad QB play if you don’t also have a bad offensive line. Very few QBs will be terrible if they have consistent blocking. And no new QB wants to go to a team with a bad offensive line because he will get sacked a lot! I’m not saying this is a guarantee by any means. Many QBs still go to bad organizations, but the fact that you’re tanking on purpose shouldn’t make the new QB have confidence in the front office.

Also, it’s a huge risk to tank. Trevor Laurence and Andrew Luck are the only guys who I would think to tank for and they aren’t around every year. They’re a decade apart actually.

There’s just so many reasons; some I probably have missed as to why teams do not ever tank intentionally. If a team really wants that super player, they can trade up for him if they are fortunate.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q5t98wacegps7ovl', 'title': 'What is the definition of ""tanking"" in the context of professional sports?

Here are some possible consequences and scenarios:

Impact on Other Sports Leagues:The dominance of the NFL might have put more pressure on other professional sports leagues like the NBA, MLB, NHL, and MLS to adapt and innovate to compete for viewership and revenue. This could have led to changes in their marketing strategies, rule changes, or even expansion into new markets to remain relevant.
Influence on College Football:College football's popularity could have also grown, as it often feeds talent into the NFL. An even stronger NFL could have made college football an even more significant part of the American sports landscape, with increased attention and financial investment.
Media Landscape:The media landscape might have been even more NFL-centric. Television networks and streaming platforms could have invested even more heavily in NFL broadcasting rights, potentially leading to higher subscription fees for sports fans.
Economics of Sports:The financial landscape of professional sports could have shifted further in favor of football. Player salaries in the NFL might have continued to rise, while salaries in other sports could have faced stagnation or slower growth.
Global Expansion:The NFL might have pushed for further international expansion, potentially making American football a more popular sport globally. This could have led to more international talent entering the NFL and a broader fan base outside the United States.
Impact on Society:The continued dominance of the NFL could have had social and cultural implications. Football might have remained the dominant sport in American schools and communities, with more children aspiring to be football players. The influence of football culture, from Friday Night Lights to Super Bowl parties, could have been even more pervasive.
Political and Economic Influence:The NFL's financial power and influence could have extended into politics and economics to a greater extent. The league might have played a more significant role in shaping public policy related to sports, including issues like player safety, concussions, and labor disputes.
Changes in Other Entertainment:The dominance of the NFL could have affected other forms of entertainment, as it competes for viewership. For instance, if the NFL maintained its popularity, it might have influenced the timing and scheduling of major television events, such as award shows and premieres.

It's important to note that the popularity of sports leagues can be influenced by various factors, including the performance of teams, the emergence of star athletes, social and cultural shifts, and technological advancements in media consumption. While the NFL has indeed been a dominant force in American sports, predicting the exact consequences of its continued dominance is speculative and depends on a wide range of variables and hypothetical scenarios.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/srd9w41c7nj6pixl', 'title': 'What if the NFL had continued to dominate the American sports landscape, maintaining its position as the most popular professional sports league in the country?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The NFL is the most profitable professional sports league in the United States.

Sadaf Akhtar,11mo,How did Jerry West become the NBA logo?,"Jerry West, a former NBA player, was selected as the inspiration for the NBA logo in 1969.

Hakim Ziyech,1y,How exactly does dead cap money work in the NFL and what happens to that money if they cut or trade a player?,"In the NFL, ""dead cap money"" refers to the amount of money that a team would still owe to a player even if they were to release or trade them. This money is typically spread out over multiple years and is a way for teams to spread out the financial impact of a player's contract over time.

When a team signs a player to a contract, the total value of the contract is divided into smaller amounts that are allocated to each year of the contract. These amounts are then counted against the team's salary cap, which is a set amount of money that teams are allowed to spend on player salaries each year. When a team releases or trades a player, they are still responsible for paying the remaining portion of the contract that has been allocated to future years, which is known as ""dead cap money"".

For example, if a player signs a contract with a total value of $10 million, and $5 million of that contract is allocated to the first year, and $5 million is allocated to the second year. If the team decided to release or trade the player after the first year, they would still be responsible for paying the remaining $5 million of the contract that was allocated to the second year. This $5 million would be considered ""dead cap money"" and would count against the team's salary cap for that year.

The team would still have to pay that money to the player, but it will not count as part of their active salary cap, thus limiting their ability to sign or retain other players. That money is gone from the team's salary cap and is not returned or refunded to the team.

Dead cap money is a way for teams to spread out the financial impact of a player's contract over time and is designed to give teams more flexibility when it comes to managing their salary cap. However, it's also important for teams to consider the potential impact of dead cap money when making decisions about signing or releasing players, since it can limit their financial flexibility in the future.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/04hx1ze7wk9gvm8p', 'title': 'How exactly does dead cap money work in the NFL and what happens to that money if they cut or trade a player?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In the NFL, ""dead cap money"" refers to the amount of money that a team would still owe to a player even if they were to release or trade them.

Hakim Ziyech,1y,How does signing players from another NFL team's practice squad work? Does it have to be approved by the holding franchise or are those players considered free agents?,"Signing players from another NFL team's practice squad works through a process called ""practice squad elevation.""

Practice squad players are eligible to be signed by any team's active roster, including their own team, at any point during the season. A team can sign a player from another team's practice squad to their active roster without having to go through the waiver process, but they have to keep the player on the active roster for at least three regular season games.

The holding franchise is not required to approve the signing of a practice squad player by another team, but they are allowed to elevate the player to their active roster before he can be signed by another team.

Practice squad players are considered free agents and are free to sign with any team that is interested in them. They are not bound to the team that initially signed them to the practice squad. If a player on another team's practice squad is signed to a team's active roster, that player's contract will be for the remainder of the current league year, and he will be a free agent at the end of the season.

Overall, signing players from another team's practice squad is a way for teams to add depth to their roster by bringing in players that have already been in the NFL system and have some level of experience, without having to go through the waiver process or losing another player in the process.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b1dachkq73xysu6f', 'title': ""How does signing players from another NFL team's practice squad work?

Lawrence Brooks,1y,Are people aware the NFL is recognized as an entertainment business therefore it can legally fix the outcome of its games?,"It doesn’t even have to be recognized as such. Considering things like the massive use of drugs among teams…. no one particularly cares. But you mentioned the word “fixed”. So could it be? You haven’t noticed?

It’s far worse than you can possibly imagine.

Something has been wrong for a very long time. While it is said ""a holding penalty can be called on any play"", why is it usually called at a seemingly ""generic"" time when few people will notice the impact it has on a game. While others perceive it as just a call in the middle of a game, these seemingly innocent second down calls become drive stoppers and move teams out of field goal range changing point differentials and game plans.

We see coaching maneuvers which make no sense, we see referee calls who seemingly conveniently forget the rules. We aren't just talking about newbies either, we're talking about men who have spent their entire lives around the game.

For years now. It is fixed while you’re watching it. Pay attention.

Here’s one huge example: the Feb 5, 2006 Seattle-Pittsburgh Super Bowl. This is arguably the worst officiated game of all time as it wasn't even subtle calls going the Steelers way all night long, it was every call and every chance Seattle had to gain momentum.

TWO EXAMPLES: Near the end of the first quarter Matt Hasselbeck hit Darrell Jackson in the endzone for a seemingly generic touchdown, at least as generic as Super Bowl TDs can be. Apparently this wasn't ok with the NFL as the play was flagged with an offensive pass interference call. This play was shown from no less than 15 angles and revealed not only no offensive pass interference, it wasn't even questionable as there was little to no contact on the play. Seattle ended up settling for a FG.

Early in the fourth quarter Seattle was very much in this game and was diving. Hasselbeck hit Jeremy Stevens on the Pittsburgh one-yard line to seemingly set up a Seattle scoring opportunity and a chance for the Seahawks to take the lead as the score at the time was 14-10. Upon further review, a flag was thrown on Seattle lineman Shawn Locklear for offensive holding. Seeing as Super Bowls have about 200 TV cameras these days, the play was re-shown at every possible angle, none of which showed anything resembling a hold. While they say holding can be called on any play, this wasn't one of them.

I have many more examples I can throw out here, these are just blatant. I didn't even mention the Denver-San Diego game in 2009 where I'm still not sure what happened.

I have no interest in any of these teams and there is no sour grapes angle to take in trying to dismantle anything presented here. These are just a few observations which tell me Something Is Very Wrong (and has been wrong for a looong time) with the biggest money making sports empire in the United States.

When you see a game now, you’re really watching pro wrestling on TV, but it’s on the grass.

Trust me, Arnold Rothstein would be a big NFL fan if he were alive today.

Fashion Needles,05-Sep,Why doesn't Alabama have an NFL team?,"Alabama does not have an NFL team primarily due to its proximity to other NFL franchises, as well as the state's population size and market considerations. Several factors contribute to the absence of an NFL team in Alabama:

Proximity to Existing NFL Teams: Alabama is geographically located near several NFL franchises. For example, the Atlanta Falcons are relatively close to northern Alabama, while the New Orleans Saints are not far from southern Alabama. The Tennessee Titans, based in Nashville, are also in proximity to northern parts of the state. The presence of these nearby NFL teams reduces the need for an NFL franchise within Alabama.
Market Size: While Alabama is a football-loving state with a passionate college football fan base, its population is smaller compared to major metropolitan areas where NFL teams are typically located. NFL teams rely on large markets to generate revenue from ticket sales, corporate partnerships, and media rights deals. Smaller states like Alabama may not offer the same revenue potential.
College Football Dominance: College football is immensely popular in Alabama, with the University of Alabama and Auburn University having strong football programs and dedicated fan bases. The popularity of college football often influences the sports landscape in the state and may reduce the demand for an NFL team.
Economic Considerations: The economic health and infrastructure of a region play a role in attracting or sustaining an NFL franchise. Alabama's economy and available stadium facilities may not meet the requirements for hosting an NFL team.
Franchise Ownership: The establishment or relocation of NFL franchises is often driven by ownership groups and investors. While there have been discussions and proposals for NFL teams in Alabama in the past, the right ownership group and financial support must align to make it a reality.
Travel and Logistics: The NFL considers travel and logistical factors when determining team locations. Ensuring that teams are within reasonable travel distances of each other is important for competitive balance and scheduling.

While Alabama does not have an NFL team, the state remains passionate about football and is home to many fans of NFL teams from nearby regions. College football, particularly the rivalry between the University of Alabama and Auburn University, remains a major focus of sports enthusiasm in the state. Alabama has also hosted college football bowl games and other football-related events.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/g1e7a9b5l23uzwhf', 'title': ""Why doesn't Alabama have an NFL team?"", 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Alabama does not have an NFL team primarily due to its proximity to other NFL franchises, as well as the state's population size and market considerations.

Jarrod Schalow,24-Sep,How do NFL teams make money?,"There are a wide variety of way’s an NFL team can turn a profit these day’s.

1 way is of course the ticket sales & food/merchandise sales that go on before & during the game. These day’s just about every team own’s not only the stadium they play in but also the land it sits on so with the avg attendance at an NFL game being 70,000 but not all stadiums hold that many so I’ll say an avg of 60,000 & the avg parking permit being around $55 they can make upwards of $3.3 million at each home game.

A 2nd way is with all of the advertisements u’ll see if u shell out $2000 for a family of 4 to see a game in person, & that’s in a nosebleed section mind u. The better known the company is or how big their signage is can vary in how much the team get’s paid to show it, especially if it’s blaring on the Jumbotron constantly during the game. During the offseason & even during the season at time’s they rent out their giant stadium for concerts, other sporting events & anything else that will put a dollar in their pockets.

A 3rd way that get’s each team over $370 million a season is the contract the NFL already has with the various tv networks be it the local channels, ESPN, the NFL Network & the different streaming apps. I don’t know about every other team in the league but the Raiders have small store’s in mostly malls called RAIDERS NATION where u can purchase just about everything from mugs & calendars up to jersey’s, hoodies & helmets, the great thing about those stores is that usually their online & it’s cheaper then buying it at the game.

So NEVER believe them when u hear an NFL owner say their team is broke & or losing money, an owner can always sell if a small percentage of the team & it might include the stadium or it might not… whatever works best for me majorly owner’s. The only time I’ve EVER heard of a sport’s franchise losing money is in the MLB where without a stadium selling at least 60%-70% full at all home games then after a long while it catches up to them especially if that team & stadium is in Montreal & called the Expos & it get soooo bad that the league votes to relegate to Washington & called the Nationals. If u look it up, right now the Oakland Athletics are close to being relegated to Las Vegas I believe it is, due to the fact that they can only draw around 8,000 fan’s per home game & their stadium look’s like actual gladiators fought each other & lion’s in front of the emperor, it’s the same reason the Raiders left the same building 2 years ago… the mayor & the NFL are & always will be cheap & neglect their team’s.

Because they know that another city who WILL pay for the split on a new stadium so a team with the rich history of the A’s will go there & set up shop.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.49745

Game Zone,6mo,How profitable are football clubs for the owners?,"Football, also known as soccer in some regions, is the world's most popular sport, with an estimated 3.5 billion fans globally. As the sport's popularity continues to soar, football clubs have become lucrative business ventures, attracting both passionate investors and corporate giants. The profitability of football clubs for owners is a complex and multifaceted aspect that depends on various factors, including club size, success on the field, commercial revenue streams, and financial management. In this comprehensive article, we will explore the profitability of football clubs for owners, examining the revenue sources and challenges that shape their financial success in the competitive world of football.

Part I: Revenue Streams for Football Clubs

Football clubs generate revenue from diverse sources, each playing a crucial role in determining their profitability:

1. Broadcasting Rights: The sale of broadcasting rights is a major revenue stream for football clubs. Leagues and competitions negotiate broadcasting deals, and clubs receive a share based on their market value and performance.

2. Matchday Revenue: Matchday revenue includes ticket sales, corporate hospitality, concessions, and merchandise sold during home games. Larger stadiums and successful teams attract higher matchday revenue.

3. Commercial Sponsorships: Football clubs often secure sponsorship deals with various companies, ranging from shirt sponsors to stadium naming rights. Successful clubs with global reach command premium sponsorship deals.

4. Player Transfers: Football clubs can generate substantial revenue through player transfers. Selling players at a higher value than their acquisition cost can result in significant profits.

5. Merchandising and Licensing: Sales of club-branded merchandise, including jerseys, scarves, and accessories, contribute to revenue. Licensing agreements for video games, apparel, and other products also add to income.

Part II: Challenges Affecting Profitability

While football clubs have the potential for profitability, several challenges can impact their financial success:

1. High Operating Costs: Running a professional football club is expensive, with costs for player salaries, coaching staff, travel, and facilities. High wage bills can strain a club's finances, especially if not matched by revenue.

2. Transfer Market Risks: Investing in player transfers carries risks. Clubs must balance player acquisition costs with potential returns through performance and future transfer fees.

3. Competition and Sporting Success: A club's profitability can be influenced by its sporting success. Regular participation in prestigious competitions and winning titles can attract greater revenues.

4. Fan Engagement: Fan support is vital to a club's success. Clubs need to engage fans and offer memorable matchday experiences to drive ticket sales and merchandise revenue.

5. Financial Fair Play Regulations: Governing bodies impose financial fair play regulations to ensure clubs operate within their means. Non-compliance can lead to fines and sanctions.

Part III: Case Studies of Profitable Football Clubs

Some football clubs have achieved notable profitability through strategic management and commercial success:

1. FC Barcelona: One of the wealthiest football clubs globally, FC Barcelona's success is driven by its global fan base, high-profile sponsorships, and lucrative broadcasting deals.

2. Manchester United: The club's massive global following and commercial partnerships have made it one of the most financially valuable football clubs in the world.

3. FC Bayern Munich: A dominant force in German football, Bayern Munich's consistent on-field success and robust commercial ventures have contributed to its financial strength.

Part IV: Balancing Profit and Ambition

Football club owners face a delicate balancing act between profitability and ambition. While profit maximization is essential for the club's sustainability, owners must invest in player talent, coaching, and infrastructure to remain competitive on the field. Long-term success often requires a strategic approach that balances short-term profitability with investment in the club's growth and sporting excellence.

Conclusion:

The profitability of football clubs for owners is a complex interplay of revenue sources, sporting success, commercial partnerships, and financial management. While some clubs have achieved substantial profitability through astute business practices and global appeal, others face challenges in balancing high operating costs with revenue generation. Football club owners must navigate this intricate business game, striving to achieve both financial stability and sporting ambition. As the world of football continues to evolve, club owners will need to adapt and innovate to thrive in an ever-competitive landscape where passion and profit go hand in hand.

Jonathan Kurtzman,1y,"Why was wrestling the first sport that got the ""pro wrestling"" treatment (staged matches, gimmicky fighters) instead of other sports?","I’m not sure that it was. For example, boxing matches were often staged as exhibitions, meaning no one got hurt but they put on a show. That way they could travel from place to place and make a living. You can’t go on if you’re seriously injured. Wrestlers used to do the same thing: they’d travel and put on exhibitions. Some of those would be the kind of take on local champs, and some would be pure exhibitions of wrestling skill among the troupe.

My dad was a wrestling doctor back in the mid-1950’s. It helped pay the bills. His favorite was the Terrible Turk, who was of course actually Armenian, and who had fairly significant coronary artery disease. His line, according to my dad, was ‘Doc, I’m safer out there than I am in here with you.’ He learned early that you didn’t disqualify the guys for medical reasons because they all had families to feed. They’d tell him, ‘This is what I’m good at. And it beats digging ditches.’ He liked the wrestlers. They were working stiffs and they knew it.

You can tell why wrestling took this direction if you’ve ever seen actual wrestling. There are moments of activity, but much of a match may consist of them holding on to each other on the ground with one trying to keep the other down. Wrestling as an exhibition brought them to their feet and put them in a ring so they could use the ropes as props. In actual wrestling, there’s an out-of-bounds at the edge, so many rounds consist of one guy trying to get out of bounds to force a restart.

From what I remember, ‘pro’ wrestling adopted ropes because they’d put on exhibitions with boxers. Or rather, there’d be a show with both. Along with strongman stuff, etc.

My point is that wrestling didn’t ‘get this treatment’ but rather developed organically out of the exhibitions of old. This line of development was separate from regular wrestling at a high school or college level. No one to my knowledge changed the sport to make it fit TV or the audience: it was always a separate thing.

We are very disconnected from the days when acts would travel all over. Every town worth mentioning had vaudeville theaters where the acts rotated, and these were generally connected to a booking agency to make a ‘circuit’, like the Keith or Orpheum circuits. Those conveyed the level of the acts, how classy they were (or family friendly), all the way down to burlesque. We don’t think any more about the huge number of traveling circuses. We don’t think about barnstorming baseball teams playing locals, which is how pro baseball got started in the 19thC.

When I was in junior high, so around 1970, we had a Big-Time Wrestling show at Bloomfield Hills Junior High. My mom was on the committee. You paid for the level of star you wanted. And you had to pay extra for one of the bad guys who’d ‘destroy’ your gym. As I remember, they were promoting Ernie Ladd, who had spent most of a decade in the NFL, and who was becoming a top villain in wrestling. They put on a great show. And when it’s live, you know it’s a show, but you also see how athletic it is. When you see someone like Haystacks Calhoun jump off the ropes on to a guy, even though you know the floor gives and he’s really landing on his knees and arms, not with all his weight the other guy, it’s freaking impressive to watch.

So, to summarize, my understanding is that pro-wrestling developed out of the history of traveling entertainments, mostly separate from regular wrestling. And if the issue is about it being ‘fixed’, boxing was a major sport through the 1950’s into the 1960’s, and it was well known that matches were often fixed. Boxing was so popular in the 1950’s, fights were on TV every week. And it was well known that matches were fixed, that some boxers were paid to lie down, that other fights were intentional mismatches to build up a fighter’s record so he could be put into a prize fight.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jnsvurfylew78qgx', 'title': 'Why was wrestling the first sport that got the ""pro wrestling"" treatment (staged matches, gimmicky fighters) instead of other sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.4859, 'ai': 0.5141}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I’m not sure that it was.

Trade and Transfer Disputes: When players are traded or transferred between teams, there can be disputes over whether the terms of the trade were fulfilled. This can lead to legal action if one party believes the trade was not executed as agreed.
Ownership and Franchise Disputes: Conflicts between team owners, co-owners, or stakeholders can result in legal battles over control, decision-making, revenue distribution, and other ownership-related matters.
Antitrust and Monopoly Issues: Some professional leagues have faced legal challenges related to their structure, such as allegations of operating as a monopoly or violating antitrust laws. For instance, challenges to league-wide salary caps or restrictions on player movement have been brought on antitrust grounds.
Player Discipline and Suspension: Disputes can arise when teams or players challenge league-imposed suspensions, fines, or penalties for actions such as doping, unsportsmanlike conduct, or other rule violations.
Broadcasting and Media Rights: Teams might disagree over how broadcasting revenues are distributed within a league, leading to legal battles over media contracts, streaming rights, and revenue sharing.
Relocation and Venue Disputes: When teams consider moving to a different city or building a new stadium, there can be legal challenges from local governments, fans, or other stakeholders who may oppose the move.
Intellectual Property Disputes: Teams might dispute the use of team names, logos, or trademarks by other teams, businesses, or organizations.
Labor Disputes: These can involve conflicts between players' unions, teams, and leagues over issues such as collective bargaining agreements, salary negotiations, and working conditions.
Doping and Performance-Enhancing Drugs: Legal disputes can arise from allegations of doping violations, including challenges to drug testing procedures or the validity of test results.
Contractual Obligations with Sponsors and Partners: Teams can find themselves in disputes with sponsors or partners over contractual obligations, branding rights, or the delivery of agreed-upon services.
Discrimination and Harassment Claims: In some cases, players or employees of sports teams may file legal claims against teams or leagues alleging discrimination, harassment, or other workplace issues.

These examples highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of legal disputes within professional sports leagues. The outcomes of these disputes can have far-reaching implications for the teams involved, the league as a whole, and sometimes even the broader sports industry.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/phf57382d6y04sil', 'title': 'What are some examples of legal disputes between sports teams in professional leagues?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Legal disputes between sports teams in professional leagues can arise from various issues, including contractual disagreements, rule violations, ownership disputes, and more.

Game Zone,8mo,What professional sport has the most rules?,"There are many sports that have a lot of rules, but the professional sport with the most rules is cricket. Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that originated in England in the 16th century. It is played between two teams of 11 players each, with each team taking turns batting and fielding.

Cricket has a complex set of rules that govern every aspect of the game, from the equipment used to the way runs are scored. The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which is the governing body for the sport worldwide.

Here are some of the key rules of cricket:

1. Equipment rules

Cricket has strict rules regarding the size and weight of the ball and the bat. The ball must weigh between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces and have a circumference of between 8.81 and 9 inches. The bat must not be wider than 4.25 inches and no more than 38 inches long.

2. Pitch rules

The cricket pitch is a rectangular area that is 22 yards long and 10 feet wide. The bowler must deliver the ball from one end of the pitch to the other, and the batsman must hit the ball within the boundaries of the pitch.

3. Run-scoring rules

In cricket, runs are scored by the batsman hitting the ball and running between the wickets. A run is also awarded if the ball goes over the boundary without touching the ground.

4. Wicket rules

The wicket is a set of three stumps and two bails that are placed at each end of the pitch. The bowler must try to hit the wicket with the ball to get the batsman out.

5. Fielding rules

The fielding team must have all 11 players on the field at all times. There are specific fielding positions that players must occupy, and there are rules regarding how many fielders can be positioned in certain areas of the field.

6. Umpiring rules

Cricket matches are officiated by two umpires who make decisions regarding whether the ball is in play, whether a batsman is out, and whether a run has been scored.

7. Match rules

Cricket matches can last for several days, or they can be shorter formats that last for a few hours. There are different formats of the game, including Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches.

In conclusion, cricket has the most rules of any professional sport. The laws of cricket are complex and cover every aspect of the game, from the equipment used to the way runs are scored. While it may be challenging to learn all of the rules of cricket, it is a fascinating sport with a rich history and a passionate following around the world.

Fashion Needles,06-Sep,Why do NFL teams play more games against teams in their division than in other divisions?,"NFL teams play more games against teams in their own division than in other divisions for several reasons:

Divisional Rivalries: Divisional games often carry a special significance due to long-standing rivalries between teams in the same division. These rivalries are a significant part of the NFL's history and tradition and generate heightened fan interest and passion. By playing more divisional games, the NFL can capitalize on these intense rivalries, which can lead to increased attendance, viewership, and revenue.
Geographic Proximity: Teams in the same division are typically geographically closer to each other than teams in other divisions. This geographic proximity makes it more practical and cost-effective for teams to travel to divisional opponents for games. Reduced travel time and expenses benefit both the teams and the league.
Playoff Implications: Playing more divisional games means that a team's performance within its division has a more direct impact on its playoff chances. Winning the division guarantees a playoff spot, so divisional games often carry higher stakes and influence postseason qualification.
Competitive Balance: By playing more games against divisional opponents, teams have the opportunity to compete against opponents with similar strengths and weaknesses. This helps maintain competitive balance within the division and can lead to closer and more exciting games.
Schedule Structure: The NFL schedule is structured to include a balanced mix of divisional, conference, and interconference games. Divisional games are prioritized to emphasize the importance of winning the division, followed by conference games that impact playoff seeding, and a smaller number of interconference games that allow teams to face opponents from the other conference.

While divisional games are a significant part of the NFL schedule, the league also ensures that each team plays a variety of opponents from other divisions and conferences to provide a diverse and competitive schedule. This scheduling approach helps create parity within the league and contributes to the excitement of the NFL season.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9xa6hvgwn0u54sqz', 'title': 'Why do NFL teams play more games against teams in their division than in other divisions?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""NFL teams play more games against teams in their own division than in other divisions for several reasons:\n\nDivisional Rivalries: Divisional games often carry a special significance due to long-standing rivalries between teams in the same division.

DEVENDRA PANDIYA,1y,What is the most interesting and unique use of technology in the sports industry?,"Technology has played an increasingly pivotal role in the sports industry over the past decade, modernizing the on-field experience for players, teams, and leagues. For example, advances such as Video Assistant Refereeing (VAR) technology have revolutionized how soccer games are adjudicated and played, and game footage, telematics, and heat maps have led to major advances in the field of player performance management.

However, these technology-led advances have largely been restricted to the field of play, with the sports fan experience evolving little in recent years. With technology continuing to evolve rapidly, forward-thinking sports clubs now have a unique opportunity to reach their fans more quickly and easily than ever before, expanding their global reach and appeal.

Modernizing the sports fan experience with technology

Sport is a unique industry in that it is arguably the least predictable business in the world. It is virtually impossible to predict which teams will win, players’ transient forms, and which players will be subject to a transfer or a season-ending injury.

These factors can significantly impact fan demand and appetites, meaning that many sports teams may struggle to keep pace with changing fan needs. But as technology changes, clubs can now keep an eye on new trends and make a lot of fan gear at once. This makes sure that teams can meet fan demand and take advantage of opportunities as they come up.

For instance, because of the relentless work being done by our top tech teams across the globe, Fanatics was able to service the huge spike in demand caused by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo’s 2021 transfers to Paris St Germain (PSG) and Manchester United respectively.

In just four hours following the announcement that Ronaldo would re-take his iconic number 7 shirt, sales had already surpassed the highest day of sales ever on the platform’s websites outside of the USA, with the first hour of sales alone surpassed the best-ever full day on United Direct, United’s official online store. As for Messi, branded jerseys sold quickly on PSG’s official online store, run by the digital sports platform, and demand broke single-player records at the time just thirty minutes after his signature.

Fashion Needles,05-Sep,How many carries do NFL teams usually average per game?,"Several factors can influence the number of rushing attempts in an NFL game:

Offensive Strategy: Some teams have a run-heavy offensive strategy, emphasizing the ground game and relying on a strong rushing attack. Others may have a pass-heavy approach, with fewer rushing attempts.
Game Situation: The score and game situation can impact rushing attempts. Teams that are leading in a game may run the ball more frequently to control the clock and protect their lead, while teams trailing may pass more to catch up quickly.
Opponent's Defense: The quality and strength of the opponent's defense can influence a team's game plan. If a team faces a strong run defense, they may opt to pass more.
Personnel: The skill and health of the running backs on the roster can also affect rushing attempts. Injuries or depth at the running back position can lead to adjustments in the game plan.
Coaching Philosophy: The head coach and offensive coordinator's philosophy regarding offense can significantly impact rushing attempts. Some coaches prefer a balanced approach, while others lean heavily on either the run or pass.

It's important to note that the NFL is a dynamic league, and trends in offensive strategies and game plans can change over time. The average number of rushing attempts per game can fluctuate based on evolving offensive philosophies and the skill sets of the players on a team's roster. For the most current statistics and trends, you may want to consult NFL statistical databases or resources that provide up-to-date data on team performance.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6hgrtjp8ufeb70aw', 'title': 'How many carries do NFL teams usually average per game?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Several factors can influence the number of rushing attempts in an NFL game:\n\nOffensive Strategy: Some teams have a run-heavy offensive strategy, emphasizing the ground game and relying on a strong rushing attack.

Gullywin,7mo,What is your opinion on the recent trend of professional sports teams partnering with gambling companies like Caesars Entertainment?,"Here is my opinion on the recent trend of professional sports teams partnering with gambling companies like Caesars Entertainment:

I think it is a positive trend for professional sports teams to partner with gambling companies. These partnerships can help to raise awareness of responsible gambling and can also generate revenue for the teams.

Gambling is a major part of the sports world, and it is important for teams to be involved in the conversation about responsible gambling. By partnering with gambling companies, teams can help to educate fans about the risks of gambling and can also offer resources for those who may be struggling with a gambling problem.

In addition, these partnerships can generate revenue for the teams. Gambling companies are willing to pay a lot of money to be associated with professional sports teams. This revenue can be used to improve the fan experience, such as by investing in new stadium amenities or by providing better concessions.

Of course, there are some potential risks associated with these partnerships. For example, some people may worry that these partnerships will encourage gambling among young people. However, I believe that the benefits of these partnerships outweigh the risks.

Overall, I think it is a positive trend for professional sports teams to partner with gambling companies. These partnerships can help to raise awareness of responsible gambling, generate revenue for the teams, and improve the fan experience.

Here are some additional thoughts on the matter:

It is important for teams to make sure that these partnerships are done in a responsible way. They should not promote gambling to young people or to those who may be struggling with a gambling problem.
Teams should also make sure that they are providing resources for those who may need help with responsible gambling. This could include things like hotlines, websites, or educational materials.

I believe that these partnerships can be a positive force in the sports world if they are done in a responsible way.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mkjfr5oa7wu4cn8i', 'title': 'What is your opinion on the recent trend of professional sports teams partnering with gambling companies like Caesars Entertainment?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Here is my opinion on the recent trend of professional sports teams partnering with gambling companies like Caesars Entertainment:\n\nI think it is a positive trend for professional sports teams to partner with gambling companies.

Raghavendra GM,1y,"How much of a team's total revenue goes into paying their players in the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB) or National basketball Association (NBA)?","The amount of a team's total revenue that goes into paying their players in the NFL, MLB, or NBA can vary depending on the specific team and league, as well as other factors such as collective bargaining agreements and salary cap rules. However, in general, player salaries tend to be a significant portion of a team's overall expenses.

In the NFL, the league operates under a salary cap, which is a set limit on the amount of money that teams can spend on player salaries each season. The salary cap is determined based on the league's overall revenue, with player salaries typically accounting for around 50-60% of a team's total expenses.

In the MLB, there is no salary cap, but there is a luxury tax system in place that imposes a financial penalty on teams that exceed a certain spending threshold. As a result, player salaries tend to vary widely between teams, with some spending significantly more on players than others. On average, player salaries in the MLB tend to account for around 40-50% of a team's total expenses.

In the NBA, the league also operates under a salary cap system, with player salaries typically accounting for around 50% of a team's total expenses. However, in recent years there has been some criticism of the league's salary cap system, with some arguing that it can create imbalances between teams and limit player salaries in a way that is not necessarily fair or beneficial to the players.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/30gvnjiqa7prdxke', 'title': ""How much of a team's total revenue goes into paying their players in the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB) or National basketball Association (NBA)?"", 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The amount of a team's total revenue that goes into paying their players in the NFL, MLB, or NBA can vary depending on the specific team and league, as well as other factors such as collective bargaining agreements and salary cap rules.
