Viral Suchak,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I was scrolling through my facebook feed and I saw a post by Mr.Randeep Hooda. He is a well known Bollywood actor.

Here's his facebook post:

If you are Muslim and suddenly start feeling unsafe in country where you lived for more than thousand years..

If you are Dalit and start feeling insulted on every moment of life..

If you are Hindu and suddenly start feeling that cows are being slaughtered everywhere...

If you are a Jain and suddenly start feeling that your religious piety is being compromised...

If you are punjabi and think all the youth are on drugs.

Just do one thing...

- Stay away from social media...

- Don't watch news...

- Stay away from debates on

religion...

Just look around you at your friends who belong to different castes , communities and religions...

And you will find that you are living in one of the best countries in the world!!

This is the best thing I read today…

Sai Mani Thrishool,Updated 5y,What's something you've never told anyone?,"NOTE:Please read till the end.I promise you that it is worth reading.

There is a beautiful family with two daughters and one son. Hemalatha (Hema) is the name of their first child. So after completing her 10th class, they searched for a good looking and educated person and married her to him. His name is Srinivas. They stayed in Vishakhapatnam (District in Andhra) and her father stayed in Telangana.

So,after few years Hemalatha gave birth to two children. Lets consider them as X and Y. They were happy with their family and life. She used to take her sons to her father's home. He used to play with them by taking leave from office and he loved them very much. The kids also used to be happy when they went to their grandfather's home. Hema is a very brave person with very kind heart. Life is going pretty good.

But one day, Hema is killed. Yeah,you heard it right. She was killed by her own husband for dowry.Actually Hema’s father gave him dowry. He gave almost all money.I think some money was left to be given for him as dowry, so he killed her with the help of his parents.

One day, In the night, while Hema was doing her work and playing with her children, he came home and started beating her. She started bleeding from her mouth. Her two children x and y were watching all this but unable to do anything and they were not able to understand what was happening. X is 5 years and y is 2 years. Hema called x and asked him to bring water. X brought some water and gave her. Then she drank the water and had her final words with her son. The conversation went like this.

“Study well. Take care of your brother. Your grand parents will take care of you. Don’t make them bothered because of you.”

These were her final words with her son. Then her husband came and hanged her to the ceiling fan. He wanted to make it look like suicide. Then he escaped. Then in a locked room, x and y were there with their mother who is hanged to death. They spent the entire night without food and without knowledge that their mother is dead. The next day, because of bad smell someone informed the police and finally Hema’s parents came to know about it.

After coming to know all that, all were shocked and Hema’s father was speechless. Their heart was flooded with tears. They reached to the place where all the people were gathered and found X and Y , who were lying on the road without food. Then media came and asked X regarding this. He told the entire situation that his father killed his mother. Then Hema’s father filed a case against him. Then Srinivas accepted that he killed her because of dowry. Then Hema’s father withdrew the case as Hema wouldn't like all this mess. He withdrew it as a memory of his daughter.

Then X and Y are taken by their grand father and they started taking care of them. He provided them the best education. He took them when x and y were 5 and 2 years. Now, they were 20 and 17. Now you can understand how he struggled for x and y, and provided them a better life. X got seat in a prestigious NIT . X’s grandfather provided them the best food, he always provided them what they asked. X’s grandmother, grandfather, aunty(hema’s sister), uncle(hema’s brother) provided them a beautiful life and they never made x and y think that their mother is not there.

Who was X here? Yeah,It was me. My eyes were filled with tears while I am writing the answer.

My grandfather is my father and my grandmother is my mother. They are my everything. I think if my mother was there also, she wouldn’t have provided me a better life than this. They provided me the best clothing and what not, everything they provided what I wished to have. Finally without them ,I and my brother were nothing. Being frank,if my grand pa is not there,we would have been begging on roads.

Finally

I love you so much ammamma(grandmother)
I love you so much tatayya(grandfather)
I love you so much pinni(aunty)
I love you so much mamayya(uncle)

for providing me a beautiful life.

Now a days,it’s very difficult to find grandparents like mine. If you have them, please love and take care of them. I wish,every family should have grandparents like this who are very much supporting and more than parents. I still feel guilty that I was not able to do anything while my father killed my mother infront of me.

Thank you for reading.

Ravi Mashetty,Updated 4y,What important lessons has life taught you?,"This is an incident that happened two years ago. At that time, I was studying in Vijayawada.

In Vijayawada, there is a food court which starts at 9.30pm and ends at 2.30am.

We usually go there to have dinner. One saturday, my friends and I went there at 10.00pm and the place was pretty crowded as it was a weekend. I went to one of the stalls and ordered a dosa and told the guy to put extra chutney on my plate. As I was eating, a man from behind turned and unknowingly pushed my hand. As it was a plastic plate, it slipped from my hand and fell on the person in front of me. That person was of a healthy physique, had a big moustache and an angry face looking almost like a villian in old movies.

At that point of moment I was thinking, “Abha! He is gone a slap me and kick me infront all of them.” There were many girls as well. My heartbeat started rising and I started saying ‘sorry bhai sorry bhai.’

But he just replied with a smooth voice “kya bhai you should be careful na.” By then, I went near the stall and asked them for a piece of tissue and started cleaning his shirt by saying sorry. In the meanwhile, his wife came there and said, ‘leave it child you need not do that. Sometimes it happens don't worry be careful.’ And the person took out a 50/- note ordering another dosa for me. I was surprised by his gesture and said, ‘no bhai no bhai i don't want bhai’ but he urged me to eat saying that, as you are a student and might not have money with you.

I didn't expect that kind of reaction from him

Lessons Learnt:

1. One should not form an opinion about a person’s character by their appearance.

2. Sometimes people don't do things intentionally. One should be patient and try to think over what really happened?

Thanks for reading.

Satendra Singh,Updated 5y,What interesting thing did you read today?,"When China refused to share technology with India-

Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh is dealing with severe water crisis. It receives lowest rainfall and underground water levels are at all time low with Mahoba being the most parched district. So Uttar Pradesh government decided to moisten the ground by inducing rain artificially.

But India doesn't have such technology so they contacted pioneer of this technology, their neighbour cum rival, China. According to Dharampal Singh, State irrigation minister, “China had offered to share the process with us for about Rs 10.5 crore but for reasons best known to them, they backed out in February this year. We even asked them to participate in a global tender but they didn’t.”

After China turned their back IIT Kanpur was asked to undertake the project. The process, known as cloud seeding, involves spraying a mixture in atmosphere around which water vapours condense and when these water droplets become too heavy to stay in air they fall down as rain. Development of this mixture was the most difficult part of the project but IIT Kanpur in collaboration with department of aerospace engineering, civil engineering and bio engineering developed it in just five months. In IIT Kanpur’s deputy director Manindra Agarwal’s words “The mixture is most critical part and we have perfected it. The rest of the technology is quite standard.”

Also the estimated cost of inducing artificial rain over 1000 square kilometre using the IIT Kanpur technique would come to around Rs 5 crore.

Once America and now China…never underestimate the power of Indian scientists.

It receives lowest rainfall and underground water levels are at all time low with Mahoba being the most parched district. So Uttar Pradesh government decided to moisten the ground by inducing rain artificially.\n\nBut India doesn't have such technology so they contacted pioneer of this technology, their neighbour cum rival, China. According to Dharampal Singh, State irrigation minister, “China had offered to share the process with us for about Rs 10.5 crore but for reasons best known to them, they backed out in February this year. We even asked them to participate in a global tender but they didn’t.”\n\nAfter China turned their back IIT Kanpur was asked to undertake the project. The process, known as cloud seeding, involves spraying a mixture in atmosphere around which water vapours condense and when these water droplets become too heavy to stay in air they fall down as rain.

Vignesh Atm,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I'm pretty sure most of you here know Nicki Minaj. She's an American singer/rapper.

And I'm pretty sure most of you hate her as well. She's not exactly known for all the good reasons. I used to hate her too but then she did something that just forced me to change.

I think this deserves respect. A LOT of respect.

So it all started when a fan replied to her tweet and asked if she wanted to pay his tuition fees.

And then Nicki Minaj replied. (I’m pretty sure he didn't expect it)

And then she actually did setup a contest, helping over 50 of her fans. Sure, she probably has a lot of money, but it takes some massive generosity to help her fans like this.

Here's something she posted on Instagram after:

She spent over $50,000 dollars on that day. She has actually started a student charity that's constantly helping students around the world for the past one month or so.

I'm actually astonished by how a social image can be deceptive. She's known for twerking among other things and her songs all portray her in some sort of bad light.

But to see this was truly astounding.

And today, Nicki Minaj, you've earned my respect.

Edit: Ketan Pande, down in the comments, has just informed me that Nicki Minaj has been secretly helping a Village in India! Thanks Ketan!

Rohit Kashyap,Updated 4y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"During the 1965 Indo-Pak war, Lal Bahadur Shastri went to Military Hospital in Delhi to meet injured soldiers. He met many injured soldier during his visit but at last he saw a soldier on the bed and went to meet him near his bed. The doctor told the then PM that many parts of his body got seriously injured that's why we have kept him under a net and we don’t know that he will be fine or not, chances of his survival are very thin. Shastri went closer to him and put his hand on the soldier’s head and after that tears came rolling out of the soldier’s eyes. Shastri started a conversation with him.

Shastri:- Major, You are the Major of the world famous Indian Army, the Army which is famous for its bravery and boldness. So please be strong and don’t cry. You will be fine soon.
Major:- Sir, these are not tears because of pain and injury. These tears have came because I had a dream to meet my Prime Minister once and salute him. Today I have met you but I am unable to stand and salute you.

Tears rolled out from Shastri Ji’s eyes.

The biggest lesson that life has taught me, there will be some situation where you can’t do anything and even the most powerful man is unable to do anything in that situation. So, Just live your life with dedication. We don’t know when and where it is going to end.

Namaste,

Anonymous,Updated 6y,What's something you've never told anyone?,"I am sorry for going anonymous !! But this is the only way I can write about this.

So it was 2006, my board (HS) results were out and I had scored poorly with only 81% (now I know it was pretty good). My parents were heartbroken and my dad cried for the first time seeing my marks.

How can anyone not score above 95% in board exams??? How???

My mom didnot leave any stone unturned to humiliate/scold/abuse me in every possible way. I know probably she was too disheartened and didnot intend to hurt me. But she anyway did it out of anger. She would tell me how worthless I was and etc etc. My resources were cut which included telephone,my favourite food,going out with friends,or anything a teenager would want to do at his/her age. My father being a doctor had to work out of the town so he wasnt really aware of all these and he was normal with me. I used to talk to him with shaky voice,often on the verge of crying but never really told him what I was going through.

One fine day,got an invitation from neighbour for some birthday party. My mother told me not to go and that she wanted to go alone. I was numb. Heartbroken. I probably can never even put it in words how I felt that day. I cried and cried and cried all alone in my house after she left. The only thing I could do that day to put an end to this was to die. I was suicidal. Yes I was. I tied a dupatta on the fan and tied it around my neck. It was 8pm,21st september 2006. I dont know how (I call it a miracle) my landline rang. I could have ignored but I untied the dupatta and went on to receive the call.

It was my Father on the line. He called to ask if I was ok. I was shocked as he usually doesnot call at this time. I broke into tears that night talking to him. I never told this to him or to anyone.

I still wonder what if he hadnt called that day?

I am a successful gynaecologist now. Though I cannot say this to my father about that night or may be I dont have the courage to say, I still thank him every single day for calling that night !!

EDIT1: THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT GUYS. ANSWERS TO FEW QUESTIONS HERE :

No I never believed in “percentage/marks” Not even in HS or +2 or during my MBBS or during my MS gynaecology. Marks never mattered. All we as a kid want is parental support.
I dont intend to tell anyone about it. I rather chose to work on my career and everything else with which I could show my love towards my parents, specially my dad. I know if I tell him he ll be really broken.He is an old man now. I dont want this to happen. Let it be with me. Forever.
Yes I get along with my mother though probably not like how I get along with my dad. But yes, I was never rebellious and took it as a challenge to show her or everyone who thought I was useless that I was infact a bright kid who just needed mental support.
One thing I would like to convey to everyone who read my story. Hang in there. You’re doing absolutely fine. Donot ever give up !!
Edit2 : Wow 11k upvotes !! I am flattered. Btw someone asked me how I prepared for MBBS or MD/MS. Just study. And study. Understand and study. Keep giving mock tests before your exams.Solve MCQs.Uninstall all those distractions. Study !! And if you thought it was easy. No it wasnt.

But this is the only way I can write about this.\n\nSo it was 2006, my board (HS) results were out and I had scored poorly with only 81% (now I know it was pretty good). My parents were heartbroken and my dad cried for the first time seeing my marks.\n\nHow can anyone not score above 95% in board exams??? How???\n\nMy mom didnot leave any stone unturned to humiliate/scold/abuse me in every possible way. I know probably she was too disheartened and didnot intend to hurt me. But she anyway did it out of anger. She would tell me how worthless I was and etc etc. My resources were cut which included telephone,my favourite food,going out with friends,or anything a teenager would want to do at his/her age. My father being a doctor had to work out of the town so he wasnt really aware of all these and he was normal with me. I used to talk to him with shaky voice,often on the verge of crying but never really told him what I was going through.\n\nOne fine day,got an invitation from neighbour for some birthday party. My mother told me not to go and that she wanted to go alone. I was numb. Heartbroken. I probably can never even put it in words how I felt that day. I cried and cried and cried all alone in my house after she left. The only thing I could do that day to put an end to this was to die. I was suicidal. Yes I was. I tied a dupatta on the fan and tied it around my neck. It was 8pm,21st september 2006. I dont know how (I call it a miracle) my landline rang. I could have ignored but I untied the dupatta and went on to receive the call.\n\nIt was my Father on the line. He called to ask if I was ok. I was shocked as he usually doesnot call at this time. I broke into tears that night talking to him. I never told this to him or to anyone.\n\nI still wonder what if he hadnt called that day?\n\nI am a successful gynaecologist now. Though I cannot say this to my father about that night or may be I dont have the courage to say, I still thank him every single day for calling that night !!\n\nEDIT1: THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT GUYS. ANSWERS TO FEW QUESTIONS HERE :\n\nNo I never believed in “percentage/marks” Not even in HS or +2 or during my MBBS or during my MS gynaecology. Marks never mattered. All we as a kid want is parental support.\nI dont intend to tell anyone about it. I rather chose to work on my career and everything else with which I could show my love towards my parents, specially my dad. I know if I tell him he ll be really broken.He is an old man now. I dont want this to happen. Let it be with me. Forever.\nYes I get along with my mother though probably not like how I get along with my dad. But yes, I was never rebellious and took it as a challenge to show her or everyone who thought I was useless that I was infact a bright kid who just needed mental support.\nOne thing I would like to convey to everyone who read my story. Hang in there. You’re doing absolutely fine. Donot ever give up !!\nEdit2 : Wow 11k upvotes !! I am flattered. Btw someone asked me how I prepared for MBBS or MD/MS. Just study. And study.

Kushal Tamang,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"A popular fake Quora user was exposed today.

I found this post on Reddit
 and searched her name on Quora. She was pretty popular but was fake and was finally exposed.

So, this girl called Oakley Maverick who was using fake credentials and fake profile picture was exposed and it's the best thing I’ve read today and I felt good.

Why?

Because Quora doesn't stand for this. And, I and thousands of other quorans didn't sign up here to see a fake person using fake credentials and writing about their fake experiences, sharing their “knowledge”, just for the sake of popularity.

I wonder how many people were misinformed due to her, and how many people had read her content and had believed her.

PS: I just searched her again and she has become a Quora User now.

I struggled a lot during my engineering due to language issues. My family also struggled along because of our poor finances. We were running out of money and we also had debts to pay off.

We tried to sell some of our land to change the situation but few people who came forward offered very less amount and due to other property related issues, we couldn't sell the farm.

Lavina Tandon,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I had read this on whatsapp-

A few years ago in-front of his eyes his girlfriend was brutally raped by six bastards in a running bus of Delhi.

He fought till the time he was beaten blue with an iron rod.

They broke his leg, robbed him, snatched his mobile & left him almost naked..

He fought till the time he could. Then on that chilling cold night he was thrown from the running bus along with his girl friend.

They were naked, drained, exhausted & both were bleeding for different reasons.

He tried to stop passing cars & kept on begging for a piece of shawl to wrap his naked girl friend & finally he got it after 40 minutes.

Then he took her to the hospital, admitted her, called the police,called her parents & did every possible co-operation that a true friend should do in the hour of need.

He could have fled from the bus - he did not.

He could have left her on the road - he did not.

He could have claimed fame & money ( as the father of Nirbhaya got Rs 25 lakhs from UP CM,his son got a job & many more ) - but he did not.

He could have claimed his treatment money from Govt - he did not.

He could have become the most frequently seen face in the electronic media in exchange of money - he did not.

*If this is not friendship then what is friendship??*

When the entire country roared for the girl no one thought what this boy had gone through that night.

He is not a film star or a cricketer.

He is *Awindra Pratap Pandey,* a boy from Gorakhpur in UP, the boy who loved his girl friend from the core of his heart.

When this boy is there somewhere in anonymity, why we Indians should celebrate Friendship Day on 3rd August to copy the Americans?

We should celebrate Friendship Day in India on *16th December* to salute the spirit of Awindra who proved what friendship means.

Let *16th December* be the official Friendship Day in India.

Am I talking sense??

If *yes* then please share & forward this to as many as you can…

Sarhad Choudhary,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"This one I read on WhatsApp. But strangely I found it worth sharing. It's really good. I hope we can share something that we read on WA.

A wise man asked, why do you have brakes in cars?

There were some logical replies,

To avoid accidents.
To reduce speed.
Basically, for safe driving.

That's not how the wise man perceived the importance of a brake. His answer was:

We have brakes, so that we can drive faster.

Now that was unexpected. People didn't agree at first. It didn't make much sense. But listen to the logic behind it…

If there are no brakes, any person would try to avoid accident by driving slow. Infact he won't drive at all. It's the security of working brakes that allows him to pick up speed, accelerate and reach his destination.

We can apply the same for life.

It's necessary to have a fallback option. It's necessary to have a source of mental support. Without their help, no man can rise. Who're they? Friends, family and colleagues.

They often question your actions, which may cause us to get irritated. But it's their constant nagging which involuntarily helps us stay right on track.

Without those brakes, we can skid, lose direction, and meet with an unfortunate accident.

Now I won't mind if my mom scolds me. I'll give her a kind smile and comply with whatever she asks.

Ok, no… I'll retaliate at times.

I hope we can share something that we read on WA.\n\nA wise man asked, why do you have brakes in cars?\n\nThere were some logical replies,\n\nTo avoid accidents.\nTo reduce speed.\nBasically, for safe driving.\n\nThat's not how the wise man perceived the importance of a brake. His answer was:\n\nWe have brakes, so that we can drive faster.\n\nNow that was unexpected. People didn't agree at first. It didn't make much sense. But listen to the logic behind it…\n\nIf there are no brakes, any person would try to avoid accident by driving slow. Infact he won't drive at all. It's the security of working brakes that allows him to pick up speed, accelerate and reach his destination.\n\nWe can apply the same for life.\n\nIt's necessary to have a fallback option. It's necessary to have a source of mental support. Without their help, no man can rise. Who're they? Friends, family and colleagues.\n\nThey often question your actions, which may cause us to get irritated. But it's their constant nagging which involuntarily helps us stay right on track.\n\nWithout those brakes, we can skid, lose direction, and meet with an unfortunate accident.\n\nNow I won't mind if my mom scolds me. I'll give her a kind smile and comply with whatever she asks.\n\nOk, no… I'll retaliate at times.\n\nIt's a beautiful message I found worth sharing.

Neha Batra,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Police comes to Russian guy's rescue who was seen begging near a temple.

“Atithi devo bhavah”... This is not only something we Indians take pride in saying, this is the motto we live by.

The below example truly shows this spirit.

A tourist from Russia was seen begging outside the Kumarakottam Murugan temple in Kanchipuram. People there inquired about him and informed police to look into the matter as he seemed lost. A team of police from Siva Kanchi police station arrived and found out that he was a 32 year old research student from Russia, who has simply exhausted all his money.

The guy's name was “Evangelin Burngowe”. He had arrived in India on 8th September on tourist visa.

After touring places in North India, Burngowe had reached Kancheepuram by bus from Bangalore. He exhausted all his money on mobile phone and the main problem arrived when he forgot the pin of his debit card. He said he had no other options so he decided to beg for money.

The police verified his documents and found that his documents were all valid and the story was indeed true.

Then he was given Rs. 500 and the police authorities put him on a train to Chennai. They asked him to get down at Egmore and take an autorickshaw to the Russian embassy in the City.

Given the image of police in today's scenario, this was a worth mentioning effort by them. Also salute to the local people for their spirit.

Amidst all the negative issues that media portrays, this was indeed a breath of fresh air.

Humanity is still alive.

Hail humanity.

Saurabh Suman,Updated 5y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I was going through my feed in LinkedIn and found this beautiful and heart warming poem dedicated to all the soldiers:

“We both left home at 18,

You cleared JEE, I got recommended.

You got IIT, I got NDA.

You pursued your degree, I had the toughest training.

Your day started at 7 and ended at 5, mine started at 4 till 9 and some nights also included.

You had your convocation ceremony, I had my POP (Passing Out Parade).

Best company took you and best package was awarded, I was ordered to join my Paltan with 2 stars piped on my shoulders.

You got a job,I got a way of life.

Every eve you got to see your family, I just wished I got to see my parents soon.

You celebrated festivals with lights and music, I celebrated with my comrade in bunkers.

We both married and your wife got to see you everyday, My wife just wished I was alive.

You were sent to business trips, I was sent on line of control.

We both returned, Both wives couldn't control their tears, you wiped hers but, I couldn't...

You hugged her but, I couldn't. Because I was lying in the coffin, with medals on my chest and coffin wrapped with tricolor.

My way of life ended... Your continued.

We both left home at 18.”

Salute to all the Indian soldiers!!!

Jai Hind!!!

“Dear Jack,

I hear you are a ‘Guardian of the Galaxy’ and that you’re interested in being a NASA Plantary Protection Officer. That’s great!

Our Plantary Protection Officer position is really cool and is very important work. It’s about protecting Earth from tiny microbes when we bring back samples from the Moon, asteroids and Mars. It’s also about protecting other planets and moons from our germs as we responsibly explore the Solar System.

We are always looking for bright future scientists and engineers to help us, so I hope you will study hard and do well in school. We hope to see you here at NASA one of these days!

Mohammed Rifath Sharukh, a 17 year old young scientist made the World’s Lightest and Smallest Satellite!
Pallapatti born, Karur district; Tamilnadu.
NASA organised a competition. Over 8000 students from 57 countries participated. He was the only Indian who was selected among the 80 final selections.

About his Satellite:

He named the Satellite ‘ KALAM SAT’ in memory of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul kalam.
It weighs only 64 grams.(0.1 kg and 3.8 cm in size)
“Space Kidz India” supported him.
It was a complete Indian made Satellite.
Uses:
It will be used to detect the radiation in Space, and the changes in the atmosphere.
It will stay only 240 minutes in space, then it will automatically fall in to the specified ocean. Finally, it will be taken out for research.
Launch:
On June 22nd, 2017 it will be launched through the SRK Rocket.
If they launch successfully, then it will be used for Agriculture and Weather Monitoring.
I wondered when I saw Mohammed Sharukh’s 12th Board Exam Mark Details:
In Mathematics: 92/200.
In Physics: 89/200(Practical Mark: 50)

(For the rest, he wrote only for 39 marks in theory! (Less than my marks!))

He is one of the inspirations to the Students, who scored average marks in their Board Exams.
For Parents: Marks don’t determine your Children, who they are. Every Child is born with talents.

This will be the first time Indian student’s experiment will be flown by NASA.

Mayur Tasre,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Do you know who the man is in the photo below?

By his appearance, you must be thinking that he might be a boy from lower middle class family, working in a bakery to earn money and support his family.

But no, that's not the truth.

He is Dhravya Dholakia[1], son of a billionaire Savji Dholakia.[2]

Surat diamond magnate Savji Dholakia caught the world’s attention two years ago when he rewarded 1200 employees with apartments and cars as Diwali bonus.[3]

For teaching his son how challenging life is, he decided to ask his son Dhravya Dholakia to go to an unfamiliar place and earn livelihood through odd work.

Dhravya Dholakia(21) who is studying Business management in US, came to India on summer holidays to enjoy with family.

Dhravya Dholakia accepted his father's challenge and left for Kochi with Rs 7000, a pair of clothes and nothing else.

Condition of his challenge

First Dharvya needed to find some work but wherever he joins, he should not stay there for more than a week.
He should not use his father’s identity
He should not use those Rs 7000 until an emergency.

Dhravya accepted the challenge and went to Kochi where Hindi would not help him.

Difficulties he faced

For 5 days, Dhravya did not have any proper place to stay nor did he have any job. He was rejected from 60 places, he lied that he was from a very poor family and wanted to earn money to help his family. At last he got a job in a bakery. He kept switching jobs. Do you know how much he earned? He earned Rs 4000.

Dhravya Dholakia said

I never worried about money and here I was struggling to get a one time meal worth Rs 40 and I needed another Rs 250 per day to stay in a lodge.

What do you think? Isn't that great? Isn't it a good lesson for life?

Every father (whether from rich or middle class family) should do this experiment with his son/daughter to teach them true values of life.

Thanks

I am a 31 years old girl from India.

So, the culture here in India is “the parents find a suitable match for their children and marry them”. So I always thought I am following the league, but I am still waiting for my parents to take some action.

I am from a upper middle class family and I have always been a good girl (as per Indian terms).

I completed my studies, completed my CA (Chartered accountancy), started working, started growing in my career, I have been doing good in all aspects of life..

And I have always been a good child, never had a boyfriend though I am quite good looking, always been a family person…

But my parents never thought of marrying me…I never had the courage of asking them…

But now, everyone keeps asking me why I am not married…I have no answer to this…

Arya Gupta,Updated 2y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"This is going to be my first answer…hope you guys will like it..😊

Also before anyone starts reading it..just a gentle reminder…it's going to be a very very long answer..because I always felt my life has nothing else than a complete bollywood thriller😅

Back in 2017..I was In class 10th and on one fine day..actually 6th of September…I faced severe headache after my school and coaching.. that day my father was out of town and my mother,brother and I were at home..It was around 4'o clock when I fainted and then I faced severe convulsions back to back for about 3 hours..my elder cousin who himself is a doctor..treated me with 13 injections in that short span..but yeah they failed…then I was immediately taken to the hospital from where I got my consciousness back..it was diagnosed that I was suffering from NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS (a cyst in brain)..so my father rushed back to the town and then we have consulted a neurospecialist.

After this..everything was going fine.. yet I had gained a lot of weight due to neural medicines..and in March..2018..my boards exam arrived..I was definitely not prepared for it..due to my ongoing disease.. yet I have given it and even during exams…I had faced a slight convulsion…but yeah…I survived..🙂🙂

Then came the result day..on 30th May.. 2018..results came and I just got 72%.So I was supposed to get approx 90 percent according to my family And my teachers because I was one of the most brightest student in the class.. yet I failed to fulfill their needs..and somewhere I was lost too..because I was unable to catch what was happening around me in past 6 months…but yeah…again I survived 😊

Then I took science stream in class 11th as I was quite interested in biology not because I was supposed to be a doctor…and my classes started…everything ALMOST felt fine..before June 2018 when one day…I felt an abdominal pain…but it was not just pain…it was something that again shooked me for rest of my life…it was some kind of pain…that no one had ever witnessed in my whole family till now…it was every different..I found myself hard to breathe…I was unable to eat…I was puking whole day..it completely shocked me as well as my family…and till them my family was also kinda depressed that what's happening to her…but then this kinda pain became regular in my life…I became very used to it…Then my family decided to took me to SGPGIMS.lucknow for better treatment where I was supposed to be check in paediatrics gastroenterology dept.…as I was below 18..they have called us approx 20 times in between span of Sept.2018 to May.2019 but they were unable to diagnose what exactly was happening to me…but yeah…once again I was surviving and somehow I got used to that pain..due to which I guess now even slight pain doesn't affects me at all…it increased my pain tolerance level…😁😁

I was started given heavy drugs that were sleep inducing like FORTWIN AND PHENARGAN composition but now my body doesn't even responds to heavy drugs and Constant pain with high intensity was maintained…

In May…2019…it needed hospitalisation…till now the disease was undiagnosed but yet it was given some kinda treatment so that I can survive!!! ALSO..neural problems were somewhere ignored😆

But then…finally..in September 2019..PGI docs diagnosed that it was CHRONIC PANCREATITIS affecting me..and at this point of time.. I was In class 12th..a full bubbly excited girl converted into the most depressed person ever(yet my family and friends supported me the most)and yeah…somewhere I found that oh I'm surviving with NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS AND CHRONIC PANCREATITIS TOGETHER…😅

Then…came 2020…the covid era…most memorable year of my life..actually in everyone's life..it will be memorable…but yet…I call it the unforgettable time just because this was the year in which I had to give my 12th CBSE BOARD EXAMINATION and also this was the year in which finally the proper treatment of PANCREATITIS started and it had been impossible if covid was absent.

From 24th of February to 14th of march..I have given my boards in with full excitement because yeah. I was prepared but again with each doses of high sleep inducing drug before every exam…maybe these were the things that deteriorated me inside🙃

After end of exams…we all know…well known..LOCKDOWN started and it seems that with increment in covid cases…my health was devastated too..but. yeah.. I was surviving.

Somewhere in between these times I also realised that my body has became very used to BLOOD TEST,ULTRASOUND,X-RAY,CT SCAN,MRI,MRCP,ENDOSCOPY,INJECTIONS …somewhere the fear of medical tools and devices have gone from within…and I personally found it very disturbing…🙃

April was passed with mild pain and slight symptoms but again in May.2020 when the whole country was stopped…my body again needed hospitalisation. My kidneys were devastating and my haemoglobin count went from 12 to 4–5..and my weight went from 68 kgs to 47 kgs..and most importantly for the first time I was feeling that NO..I CANT SURVIVE ANYMORE..!!

Then after 7 days of hospitalisation..my body somehow managed to recover…and in June 2020…when we had losted all the hopes from PGI..we moved to MEDANTA.HOSPITAL..lko..where I Met a doctor whom name I'm not gonna reveal but he was like an angel to me(just because he was the one who said to me that I can see a spark of living in you otherwisedue to these diseases..anyone had been dead so far)...definitely he made us realise that you people should return to SGPGI and only there this would be treated..he also mentioned some contacts due to which even with lockdown imposed and no opd running..I was consulted by one of the finest doctors…and finally after 4–5times of consultation…on 2nd July…my doctor said we would be admitting you on 6th July and start your treatment….GOSH…HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE…I just started wondering that wow after treatment..my body,mylife would again be normal..there would be no abdominal pain which I was so used to it now..also all my parents emotional and financial stresses would be gone..I was freaking happy..!!

On 6th July.. we came to SGPGIMS.LKO for admission but due to high covid cases…somehow we were managed to get admitted on 8th of July…when I got bed in ward…for the first time…I was happy…but definitely maybe god wasn't happy…so on same day..my mother tested covid positive just because she came with me to the hospital…she has taken the test and now she was positive…and that was the time when people used to ashame of being covid positive in rural area…as when people in my hometown got to know this…they made a lot of fun…also an ambulance came picked my mother and dropped her to quarantine center.She used to tell me that everyone was clicking her pictures.. as she was 1st case in district..and to the shock…my father.brother and I weren't together to support mummy in her worst times..That was the time when once again everything revolved around me…every ups and downs we faced..all the highs and lows..all the endless nights and millions of credentials my father and my mother spent just to get my good health back..

Ofcourse..I was In hospital and my father was the attendant..my mother was in quarantine center..my brother was at my nanny's place…but this time…once again we managed to survive..🙂

In between hospital sessions…on 13th of July.2020..my class 12th boards results were out and yup…I got 93.8% in PCB..CBSE BOARD. this literally became a reason of little joy in between the hard times we were facing and I was happy but not much because I found myself the reason due to which we were not united right then..!!

I was hospitalised for about 14 days in between my mother returned from quarantine center as well on 19th of July.2020…I was happy and I welcomed her on video call as I was already in hospital..😅

On 21st of July.. my first ERCP was done…in which ENPD was placed for 2 months..on a general note.ERCP is a endoscopic form of surgery or a pancreatogram that was done to dilate my pancreatic duct as well for treatment of PANCREATITIS..but after my 1st ERCP..to the shock..doctor told us that there would be about 4–5 ERCP..to normalise her body..after first ERCP…an ENPD…a drainage system was fitted from my nasal cavity to my nose via oesophagus and stomach to my pancreas so that all the collected fluid will be drained out..I was then discharged with the ENPD..on 23rd of July…I must say the joy of reaching home after 15 days and meeting my mother after she survived so much…that joy was beyond expectations..it was pure bliss🥰

Ofcourse..my ENPD survival was not much good..my birthday also fall in between and I had celebrated with a drainage system on my face onn..I would love to share the pics but that's confidential🤭

Then…again I was admitted to SGPGI..on 3rd Sept 2020..on which ENPD was removed and then after an stent was placed in my pancreatic duct..Off from then to now…4 ERCP has been done and time has almost been arrived for the 5th ERCP..as stent replacement has to been after every two months..and I have faced only some slight pain after that drainage..I feel that I well survived🙃

Also…right now..while writing this answer..I'm suffering from jaundice but I know this too will paas..!!

In the end…all I want to deliver through this longgg answer is that…if you have an urge to do something..nothing can stop you…I somewhere had a spark of living,and to fulfill my dreams,to payoff my parents what they have done to me….I genuinely want to pay back them a slight happiness in return…also most importantly I have strong faith in myself and real determination that I can and I will..😇

Also in the end..I would like to add that I have got some amazing friend circle that helped me a lot overcoming my tough times…and a highly supportive family that even supported in my lows..to my 72%..to my highs…to my 93%..🥰

So..Be determined because you never know what's your real potential is..unless you're forced to do so.and always be afraid of losing so that it becomes mandatory for you to succeed…

Right now I'm doing my graduation from Ramjas college,Delhi University and I'm a civil service aspirant and I have faith that I would be a civil officer as I need to fulfill my dreams as well as of my parents..❤❤

Ending this tragic.emotional and beautiful story of mine with a little message-Just have faith and believe in yourself.💥

Kanchan Singh,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Two Australians came to India to find a girl with a PINK bracelet.

Chris Bray and his wife Jess visited India with one very specific mission in mind- to locate a girl and her family. Smith showed Chris a photo he had taken from a train.

The photo was of a homeless family living under the bridge and included a little girl who wasn't wearing anything but a PINK bracelet.

Smith wanted to help the family to get accommodation and perhaps get the girl an education. Smith wanted Chris and Jess to go to vadodara where the photo was taken and find the family to help them out.

Chris and Jess flew to India- their adventure began in Vadodara.

With the help of the receptionist who acted as a hindi/english translator and local people they managed to find the family.

And finally the girl!

The girl's name is Divya. The family had been living under the bridge for 12 years. To Chris they seemed the perfect family: able and willing to work and not averse to help. They set up a bank account in Divya's name so that Smith could transfer money into account every month. A formal contract was linked to the account specifying what the funds could be used for: rent and education. A clause was added specifying that the fund would be stopped if Divya stopped attending school.

After their lovely goodwill adventure, Chris and Jess headed back to the airport.

Edit: Mr. Smith , full name Dick Smith is an Australian entrepreneur and aviator who is also known in Australia for taking the solo helicopter flight around the world in 1983. He is the one who spotted the girl near the railway track under the Shastri bridge. He went back to Australia and showed the picture to Jess and Chris who are travel photographers.

Here is a picture of Mr. Smith and his wife.

Hector Quintanilla,5y,What important lessons has life taught you?,"One morning, I woke up very motivated, called a friend and said “Let’s go to the park to exercise!”

“That’s great news, Hector. You know I’m there every morning, I’ll see you soon!” Peter said.

I don’t know what was going on that day, but I felt like I could have run a full marathon, so I challenged my friend.

“Hey, Pete, I feel good. I bet I can beat you running this morning.” Luckily he ignored me. I was a heavy smoker and found myself in terrible physical condition.

What was I thinking?

Somehow this sudden spark of motivation made me think that giving my 100% that morning would compensate all my bad habits in a single day.

I ran and ran… and ran until my heart rate was going through the roof.

Then… reality kicked in!

I felt lightheaded, lost my vision, and I fell to the ground. I felt like the earth was moving in circles. Pete was there trying to help me.

“Should I call an ambulance? What should I do?” He asked nervously.

What was I thinking?

It was just a spark of motivation.

The next day, I felt like a car had run over me.

I gave up.

To answer your question, what important lesson has life taught you?

I’ve learned that there are no shortcuts in life.

People who are in great physical shape deserve it. It’s not magic. They made it happen with daily decisions.
People who are successful deserve it. Success didn’t happen by luck or overnight. They made it happen with daily decisions.
People who find financial freedom deserve it. They fought for it through daily actions, many of which required hard work and daily sacrifice.

Today I frequently challenge my kids asking them to draw the path where their daily actions will take them.

More social media? Draw the path.

More exercise? Draw the path.

More reading? Draw the path.

What are you reading? Draw the path.

Who are your friends? Draw the path.

More partying? Draw the path.

You get the idea.

The bottom line is this:

It’s not rocket science. Our destiny is surprisingly related to our DAILY HABITS, not sparks of motivation.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6s4h1dup9v7awrc5', 'title': 'What important lessons has life taught you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9566, 'ai': 0.0434}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'One morning, I woke up very motivated, called a friend and said “Let’s go to the park to exercise!”\n\n“That’s great news, Hector.

Anonymous,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"“YOU’RE STILL A VIRGIN.”

( A text by a friend)

I am a girl who has been through child sexual abuse for a period of 4–5 years (aged 7–12yrs) Though it has been nearly 6 years that it has all ended, the scars of the incident still show up at times.

I shared about my past with him (on text) today.He understood the whole scenario. I nearly broke down telling this to him. Then I said “I am not a virgin”.

To this he replied-

“If you’ve not had sex by choice yet, you’re still a virgin”

Don't know why, but living in a society where virginity is one of the defining characters of a woman, I felt really good to know that such pure thoughts exist somewhere within our society.

Parul Misra,Updated 1y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"TRUST NO ONE.

People will shatter your trust at any time of life according to their convenience. My cousin and I had the best bond, we both shared everything with each other from minor to major stuff. Everyone knew that we are extremely close and we hide nothing from each other.

Recently she got married in Feb and I worked above and beyond my physical capabilities because she was very important to me and it was her biggest day. Unpaid maid to be more precise.

Everything went fine, fast forward to march her husband found her cheating through WhatsApp chats, he read all the conversations including everyone. ( My chats as well, lol. I very strongly mentioned her to stay bold and fearless after marriage and inform me if he does anything wrong, before her marriage. )

First of all, she had a relationship of 6 years and I had no idea. She lied to me all these years. She always asked for each and every update of my life and if by chance I skipped something and forgot to tell her, she used to create a huge dramatic scene.

Second thing, I was being blamed for the fact that I knew she had a relationship, I supported her and never guided her to follow the right path. The bond we had even people were not able to believe that I had no idea about it.

After her marriage, my father had a heart attack, I was sitting outside the ICU when I got this news that she was caught chatting with her boyfriend while I was still processing the previous traumatizing event, she added some more to it. After March she never called me to check on me or my dad, in fact, she never admitted I had no clue about her relationship. She was not there at the lowest time of my life but I was always there for her.

Sitting outside the hospital contemplating life.

She and her husband sorted out the stuff, She changed her no. ( her husband to be more precise ) Now, She behaves like a totally different person and I even heard through sources that she has made up a stupid story where she claims that her husband read my chats and got offended, that is why she changed her no. just because she can't tell everyone that she had an affair. I mean what should I say, people change at their own convenience and you can't do anything about it.

In life just be ready to expect the unexpected. This breaks my heart and I feel betrayed but I'm glad at least I learned this important lesson the hard way. Defended her for years, fought with everyone to protect her but eventually she made a fool out of me. I feel so stupid, when I look back now.

I believe that **if you put good into the world, good comes back to you**. If you choose to do harm, well, you can't cheat karma, folks.

P.S - Even I never tried contacting her, because I feel she is not worthy of my time and energy. I don't care and want to stay unbothered by her life. I just made peace with what has happened no clarification and no discussion is required.

Looking for a new sister lol.

Connie Ellison,2y,"Less than 2 months until Christmas, so what is the best gift you’ve ever received?","when I was a kid, about 14, I guess, we had a really hard winter: lots of school snow days, lots of boredom. I was rummaging in the attic one day when I found scraps of dresses my mom had made for me when I was younger: she made most of my clothes until I was about seven.

I brought them down, and Mama and I cut and pieced together a simple quilt top: four inch squares, from the clothing scraps. I even cut up a pair of my favorite Levis to add to the squares.

After we had sewn the squares together, it was spring and I was in softball, school stuff, and discovering that boys were actually quite interesting. I forgot all about the quilt top.

Until the Christmas of my 30th year, when mom retrieved the quilt top from the attic and had a seamstress make it into an actual quilt. Without the sappy story, let’s just say we both cried.

It’s on a quilt rack in my bedroom, and it’s Number One item to grab if the house catches fire. I can relive my earliest childhood memories just by looking at it.

Rahul R,10y,What is the most important life lesson that you have learned up to this point?,"
Most people come into your life temporarily simply to teach you something. They come and they go and they make a difference. And it’s okay that they’re not in your life anymore.

Not all relationships last, but the lessons these relationships bring to you do. If you learn to open your heart and mind, anyone, including the folks who eventually drive you crazy, can teach you something worthwhile.

Sometimes it will feel weird when you realize you spent so much time with someone you are no longer connected to, but that’s exactly how it’s supposed to be.

You are exactly where you’re supposed to be. We all are. When life takes something from us, it is only to create space for something new to enter in our life. If one looks back at all the failures, setbacks, and conflicts in life, we will see that all of it was required for us to be exactly where we are now.

Don’t let past relationships ruin your future. Don’t let someone or something that didn’t make it in your life continue to hurt you. If you do, you’re still giving a portion of your life to something that no longer exists – it’s like letting your happiness slip into a black hole. Learn the lesson, release the pain, and move on.

Scars remind us of where we have been, not where we are headed. Learn from your relationship lessons, and turn your wounds into wisdom.

Take your Life by the horns and Turn it around. Choose not to be a victim, but a WARRIOR.

Anonymous,Updated 6y,What's something you've never told anyone?,"Two things that I've never told anyone.

I am a doctor. The day I completed my course, I got a tattoo on my right thumb. Something that I see everytime I hold my pen/stethoscope. Something to remind me why I took up medicine as a career. It reminds to be grounded and to do the best I can to help people. So far it has done it’s job well

I’m a person who absolutely hated tattoos. I still do. So do my parents. They scold me till date for doing something that I hated. I haven't told them the reason behind it.

Matthew Bates,4y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"Boring is a blessing.

I live a very boring life, and, I believe as a direct result of that, I’m much happier than a lot of other people my age.

Every work day I go to work, come home, help the kids with their homework, walk the dog, make dinner, workout, walk the dog again, clean the house, spend some time with my wife, and then go to sleep. Non-work days are for grocery shopping, yard work, and hanging out with my family.

This has been my life for the last four years… since we got our dog. Before that, everything was the same except for the dog-walking part.

I’ve shopped at the same handful of places for the last decade. We rarely go to dine-in restaurants, but when we do, they’re the same handful of places we always go. I live in one of the biggest, most cosmopolitan cities in the world, with plenty to offer, and I can afford most of its offerings. Yet I don’t. Well, we rarely do anything exciting that Chicago has to offer. We did go see Hamilton three years ago. And Monster Jam two years ago. So there’s that.

The only reason I’ve stayed up past midnight in the last 15 years is because one of my children was being born, or they were awake and needed me… not for anything fun that I was doing by choice. If I’m out of my house after 10pm, it’s because I needed some medicine for a sick child and I had to go to the 24-hour pharmacy nearby.

We vacation in the same place every year: a beach near where I grew up. I have absolutely zero desire or plans to travel to another country in my lifetime. I would like to see other parts of this country, though. Maybe one day.

The single most exciting thing that has happened to me so far in 2020 is that I found a new chili verde recipe that everyone in the family enjoys. It’s rare to find something that we all enjoy. My six-year-old daughter is usually the outlier.

When I was younger, I used to worry about how boring my life was. I used to fret over the fact that I spent most weekends in my early 20s just chilling in my apartment by myself. I never went to bars, never went to clubs, never did much of anything. My idea of a good time was playing Civilization for hours on end, or taking a walk around downtown and just people-watching.

But now that I’m almost 40, I can see the different paths that all of my high school and college friends took in life. With a few exceptions, almost everyone whom I thought had a more exciting life than I had in the past is now in a position where “boring” isn’t even an option for them. They’re eager to find the same boring rut in their lives that I’ve had in mine for a long time now. Theirs are stories of struggling to find a life partner, failed marriages, failed careers, annual moves to new apartments, multiple children from multiple partners, run-ins with the law, still living paycheck-to-paycheck, lifestyle-induced health problems, etc…

And, of course, some of those with really exciting lives (read: drugs) in high school are now dead.

Being boring requires a lot of stability: mental stability, relationship stability, financial stability, career stability, etc… I am blessed to have so much stability in my life that being boring is so easy for me.

Have you ever heard the phrase, “no news is good news?” That’s how I live my life, and it’s working out very well for me.

Person I haven’t seen in a while: “What’s new, Matthew?”

Me: “Absolutely nothing, just the way I like it.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5sg34bck0ju7iyxl', 'title': 'What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?', 'score': {'original': 0.24085, 'ai': 0.75915}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Boring is a blessing.\n\nI live a very boring life, and, I believe as a direct result of that, I’m much happier than a lot of other people my age.\n\nEvery work day I go to work, come home, help the kids with their homework, walk the dog, make dinner, workout, walk the dog again, clean the house, spend some time with my wife, and then go to sleep.

Vikky Chandnani,Updated 3y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"John Abraham

He was on the Kapil Sharma show and was asked about not using a mirror.

Somehow people came to know he doesn't use a mirror, even before shots.

Here’s what he had to say:

“When you look into the mirror, you get stuck up in your self.

Imperfection is COOL

So I avoid looking into the mirror even before shots.”

Blown away by the answer.

Completely

Cant expect a more honest answer from someone who’s work involves looking good all the time.

Aviral Bhatnagar,6y,What are some crazy stories from student life at IIT?,"The one with the drunk friend and the professor

At IIT Bombay, we have a couple of watering holes right outside campus. A couple of friends and I (all lit punters) were coming back from one of these places late at night. The teetotaler I was, I was the only one in my senses, while the rest clearly were not in theirs.

The main road that runs through our large campus starts at the main gate. As we went along, couple of my friends sang loudly and we were having a good time. On the main road is also our convocation hall.

Seeing this, one of my not really “athletic” friends said “Dude, I am not high enough, I want to get higher”. We thought he meant more alcohol, but he literally meant getting higher. He started walking towards the convocation hall and as you can see in this image, there is a ramp on the left up to the red tiled triangular roof.

In this inebriated state, my friend thought that he was supremely athletic and said “I am going to scale this mountain” and started walking up the ramp. All of us started egging him on and he managed to get onto the damn roof!

Due to the tiled, triangular nature of the roof you can walk in between the grooves. My friend got in between there and started singing “Can you take me higher! Where the blind men see!” (the Creed song
)

While he was singing, a bald man was walking on the main road. Seeing him, my friend changed the lyrics and started singing “Can you take me higher! Where the bald men see!” and started laughing.

As he caught the man’s attention, he started walking towards us. Being the only who was sober, I recognized him first - it was our professor. To put it mildly, I was scared shitless (in institute parlance, “meri fat li”)

As I motioned to my friend to stop singing, he didn’t even give a damn. He continued to sing and motioned to the professor. As our professor started walking towards us, my friend grew louder, and the professor said “These aren’t the golden streets, my boy” (completing the para’s lyrics!).

I think my friend understood. I was shocked+scared+amazed because we were definitely going to get screwed, and my professor listened to Creed. My friend, realizing what we had done, started apologizing immediately to the professor, almost in tears.

He got fined, at the end, as the rules say. That was one crazy night.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zy4ag6srjqxn3t8m', 'title': 'What are some crazy stories from student life at IIT?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The one with the drunk friend and the professor\n\nAt IIT Bombay, we have a couple of watering holes right outside campus.

Eyiara Oladipo,4y,What was the funniest thing you saw/heard today?,       ,{'error': 'missing content request parameter'},
Dawn Amber,4y,What has been your worst experience in a hospital?,"I got malaria and pneumonia less than one month after arriving in Kenya.

I was in a village that was really small at the time, and I didn’t realize I was really that sick until a couple days of getting progressively worse.

My mother decided to take me to the local hospital to get treatment for, whatever I had.

That morning, I could barely walk on my own, or even look in front of me. Everything felt hazy, and my headache was pounding every time I turned. We had to take a car to the hospital, and every single bit of that car ride was utter hell.

We make it to the hospital and by now I can’t even understand half of what’s going on. It felt like zoning out for extended periods of time.

I’ve talked about the hygienic factor (or lack thereof) of this hospital before. They didn’t change gloves, or even compartments where they put used needles. My mom had to fight them just to get them to use proper hygienic techniques.

But, that’s not what I want to discuss right now.

The doctor, when I was first being admitted to the hospital, took my blood and all that. And then, he pulls out a needle.

And oh no, this isn’t any ordinary needle. It was like six freaking inches long.

And it was supposed to go in my upper arm.

I was zoning out before, but by now I’m completely awake. No way this needle is going into my arm. I’m a pretty skinny person, and unless they wanted a needle that was going all the way through my bicep, this wasn’t going to happen.

Fortunately for me, my mom adamantly refused the prospect of the needle going through and told him to get a smaller one.

However, the second wasn’t much smaller.

Now, I don’t have a phobia of needles. To me, they’re just like any other hospital thing.

But this needle hurt, so so bad. And it didn’t even feel necessary at all.

To this day, almost a year and a half after the incident, the nerves in my left upper arm are numb on the top and super painful inside if you pinch.

Ranjan,Updated 2y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"I was preparing for IIT-JEE. It was past two months when I reached class 12. My coaching institute announced that they will again do the reshuffling of batches. Without any test, on the basis of previous class test performance.

They had already shuffled the batches when we gave the final exams of Class 11. I had got the top batch, out of seven. But, due to lack of teachers, they decided to reduce the number of batches without prior information.

I was furious, because I had given only 2 test out of 3. They decided to add the number cumulatively and allot batches accordingly. I got the third batch this time out of five.

They gave us the worst teachers available. Their focus was only on the top 2 batches. Initially they taught us the basics only for JEE Mains. But later, it took an ugly turn. Their aim shifted to prepare us for boards. They combined batch 3, 4 and 5 and started teaching us for boards only.

I was a school going guy, So I didn't need board coaching. I told the administration that please allow me to upper batches, but they declined. Most of my batchmates considered that this is their fate and they gave up trying. They just went with the flow.

I didn't have enough money to join a new coaching that time and still there were 7–8 months left for the exam. I even couldn't bunk classes because they sent absent messages on parents mobile. I can't tell them why I was not attending classes, or rather I was afraid to do so.

So I started preparing it myself. Whenever I got the time, I tried to do more self study. It was too difficult because after 6 hour of schooling and 4 hour of coaching, I barely got any time left. But, I didn't quit.

In between I gave the monthly test but didn't perform well. I got so frustrated that once I tore the result sheet in front of the teacher. The whole class reaction was somewhat like this-

The teacher didn't say anything but I was literally in tears. I can see my dream getting shattered in front of myself and I can do nothing. But I didn't lose hope.

Where most of my friends had already decided where they would study when in the drop year, I continued my hard work and passion. I tried until the last moment. I gave JEE Advance with full enthusiasm.

Result: I FAILED…

Yes, despite all the hard work, I failed in my first attempt. I couldn't clear JEE.

I failed in an exam.
Not in life.
I failed in front of world.
Not myself.

A lesson I learned in life is how to deal with failure. Most people read about successful people and their inspiring journey. But, you will rarely find a book which describe how to deal with failure, despite giving your everything. Nor our elders tell us that, “It's Ok to fail sometimes. It's a way of learning.”

Failure is not the end, it can never be. But one should not make his life hell in the conquest of success, because it is not guaranteed. You can only do that much which is your potential or in your control.

That is keep trying, and never quit. Recently I read a few funny lines, but it is more inspiring than anything else-

I tried again. Took a drop and cleared JEE in second attempt. My friends who stopped trying, sadly none of them could qualify.

You will surely make mistakes if you will try. It doesn't mean you stop trying in the name of fear. Don't hesitate from trying or making mistakes. It would only make you more stronger than yesterday.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/40gn259r3jz78hox', 'title': 'What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?', 'score': {'original': 0.7745, 'ai': 0.2255}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I was preparing for IIT-JEE.

Sangeeta Goel,Updated 6y,What are some inspirational stories about teachers?,"Let me tell you a story here.

When I was in college in Bangalore, a man dressed in a suit walked in one day. It was during lunch hour and all of us presumed him to be a big guy who had come to college to seek admission for his son/ daughter.

The real surprise came in when we saw the same man walk towards our classroom the next day accompanied by the principal. We weren't sure until he was introduced to us as our teacher for the subject 'Principles of Banking'. The principal also told us that this man here was no ordinary guy - he had worked in the WTC and the Big Fives of the world. We had no clue what it meant.

So, when the guy walked in again with a big fat book in his hands the next day, he went on to be the teacher and we continued being the students - noisy and indisciplined bunch of neither teens nor adults.

This guy was patient with us, continued to teach what the books had, sticking to the course and the syllabus - at times mumbling and fumbling as he found everything in the book outdated. And the things in the books never interested the curious minds of the students in us. So we never paid attention. We made even more noise and made life hell for this guy in blazer and tie.

Hell broke lose one day. This guy lost his temper and blared, ""F*** you all. You think I come here to teach for money? FYI, the salary does not even cover my petrol cost."" We kept watching and this guy collected his stuff and walked out of the room.

With lot of guilt in us, we waited patiently the next day in our classrooms - apprehensive of what awaited next, scared of all the consequences and helpless. Our gaze was fixated at the door and we waited for the principal to barge in to bombard us and punish us severely.

But what we saw, we will remember for a lifetime! This guy came, alone. No, the Princi wasn't with him. He came bare handed. No, he did not carry the books this time.

He came with the purest smile ever seen and started to talk about banking to us. Told us about his experiences. Picked a few teams and gave us real life assignments. In few days we had written some thesis based on our research and one of the teams was presenting their papers in other colleges. He had turned us around by telling us what was there in the real world and by raising our curiosity.

Not just that - he was the most approachable guy we had around us. He invited us home, spent time with us talking about things which was not related to anything. He would offer us wine only to withdraw the offer when his wife would stare and declare that we were too young and she took the position of our mothers to deny things not good for us.

It was much later that we learnt that this guy had brain cancer and he did not expect to live for too long. When he realised this, he quit his plush job and came to India. All he wanted to do was to teach in the last few days of his life. And he selected our college and our class to teach. After one year of teaching, sir succumbed to the disease.

I feel so blessed to have him as a teacher. He, my teacher, will always live on in our memories and in our hearts.

Sir - We love you. And I dedicate this post to you. I am sure you are turning people around wherever you are.

Ravi Rasadiya,Updated 7y,Which is the best inspirational story ever?,"Yes, I am serious sir!’ she said in all excitement. She was sitting in front of the college principal on the admission day. The college was in a distant town and was far from her small village.
‘I see you are excited,’ Principal began in a calm voice. ‘But you must understand that it’s not usual here. Your academic performance is great, pick whichever stream you want, but why this one?’
‘Sir,’ she responded in her calm voice. ‘I dreamed this! I want to do this! I know I can and ever since I knew what I loved this, I wanted to live this!’
‘But you will be alone! Do not expect other girls to join you! Which girl does this course? This stream is a monopoly of boys,’
‘Tell me one thing Sir, why should I curb my dream just because I am a girl? And do I look like a normal girl to you? I know making my dream into a reality isn't that improbable. Give me a chance and I will prove my worth.’ she replied. Her voice was firm.
Principal knew that moment, that she was more than the boy-cut hair and jeans. He felt like he was being interviewed by that 18 year old petite girl. She had the will to survive and sheer determination to win. He looked deep into her eyes and they were sparkling with confidence.
He sighed.
‘So you are not accepting other choices, are you?’ he asked.
‘My fate accepts my will. Not the other way around.’ She said smiling.
Her voice echoed the hall.
‘What was your name again?’ Principal asked her while he looked into the admission form.
She knew she had convinced him. Her joy knew no bounds then. In a voice filled with enthusiasm, she replied.
‘Ms. Kalpana Chawla, sir.’

Aviral Bhatnagar,6y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"I was very complacent about most academic things when I was younger. This is partly due to the fact that I have a fairly good analytical bent of mind, and that my parents nourished it the right way with books and CDs.

Due to this, I was usually well aware of the content of most subjects even before they were taught. I seldom put effort, and I did fairly well. I felt I was really cool.

I kept at this till I was in the 11th and started preparing for the IIT JEE. There were a couple of folks I knew, who took national level competitive examinations. There was one particular friend of mine, who used to score 100 marks lesser than me in a 500 mark examination. I felt even cooler.

Till one fine day, he scored higher, and higher, and higher. I could not believe it - he ended up qualifying for a selective All India classroom program; I didn’t. My coolness evaporated and I was brought back to ground in emphatic style.

I was perplexed at the time as to how this was happening, but I knew in my mind why it was. He worked hard - I didn’t; that made all the difference. I humbly got my act together and started studying. He deservedly got a higher rank than me in the JEE, but if it was not for my realisation - I wouldn’t have even qualified.

What’s my biggest life lesson? There’s no substitute for hard work. Nothing can beat it - nothing. You may be smart, talented, blessed - if you’ve got to make it, you’ve got to put in the hours. Anyone who claims otherwise is not your well wisher.

I have a quote in my room that constantly reminds of this learning, which is now deeply ingrained in my mind:

Beatrice Weller,Updated 2y,What was the most horrible date you have ever had?,"I went on a date with a guy who invited me to a wedding reception at an upscale venue. I bought a new dress, had my hair and make-up professionally done, the whole nine yards. We had met at a bar that I’d gone to with friends after work one evening, so I’m sure I looked 9000% better when he picked me up for our date than I did when we’d first met.

When I answered the door, his jaw dropped to the floor. He stammered, “Uh…sorry…I guess I’m at the wrong house. Do you know where Belinda lives?” I laughed, thinking he was joking. Then I realized he wasn’t. “I’m Belinda,” I told him. “Come on in. I’ll grab my purse and my coat and we can go.”

After we got into the car, he kept staring at me. Then he asked, “Why don’t you make yourself look like this all the time?” He sounded almost angry. I wondered what his deal was. I mean, who wears a semi-formal designer dress and heels and has their hair and make-up done for them every day? I thought about telling him to f*ck off, but I really wanted to go to this reception. It was at a super hoity-toity place I’d heard about but had never been to. So I just shrugged and said, “I’m starving. Let’s go!”

Once we got there, he started to introduce me to the people at our table. And FORGOT MY NAME. He was like, “This is…uh…I’d like you to meet…”

“Gertrude!” I said. “Gertrude Bullschitzenheimer!”

Everyone realized this wasn’t my real name, but these people had real money, and they are of a different breed. So they politely played along: “So nice to have you here, Gertrude!” “Lovely dress, Gertrude!” And blah, blah, blah, while my date just sat there and glowered.

Later, after a few drinks, I hit it off with the couple seated next to us, who seemed to be genuinely nice people. The woman showed me some photos of her daughter, and I showed her some photos of my own daughter. My date tapped me on the shoulder and asked me to come with him for a moment.

“I’d rather you didn’t tell anyone that you have a daughter,” he said.

“Really? Why not?”

“Well…it just wouldn’t look right for me to date someone who’s already got kids,” he told me.

“I understand,” I told him. We went back to our table. I proceeded to tell everyone that I was working with my probation officer to get my other six kids back from foster care and life was turning out to be so wonderful since I’d kicked my heroin addiction.

Again, I could tell nobody believed me, but they all played along politely and acted sympathetic to my plight. I got the impression that everyone considered my date to be a real a**hole (as I now did) and that they were amused by what I was doing.

I got a ride home with one of the catering staff, who, as it turned out, was one of my co-workers who was moonlighting. I sure as sh*t wasn’t gonna ride home with the creep I’d come with.

That was probably the worst date I’ve ever had. I tried my best to make sure it was HIS worst date, as well. I’ll bet I succeeded.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mkt6gnz1hy8p9x42', 'title': 'What was the most horrible date you have ever had?', 'score': {'original': 0.61235, 'ai': 0.38765}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I went on a date with a guy who invited me to a wedding reception at an upscale venue.

James Pearson,5y,Can you describe a funny moment from boot camp?,"At Ft. Knox in 1982, we had a recruit that was just unfit for Army life.

Before chow, you had to go through the horizontal ladders before you could eat. Every time Private J. would try, he’d get about three rungs into it, fall to the ground, and walk away, holding his hands in front of him saying, “Ooowww” over and over in his whiny voice.

Everything he did was screwed up in one way or another. The final straw came when he wet the bed because he claimed that he “saw the devil sitting on the bedpost”. The Army decided they could not make a soldier out of him.

We were waiting in formation to use the payphones, a privilege that didn’t come very often, everyone was supposed to be quiet, when PVT J spoke up.

“Drill Sergeant, When am I getting my plane ticket?”

“There’s no plane ticket J”

“Am I going home by bus?”

“There’s no bus J”

“Well are they sending me back by train?”

“There ain’t no train Private”

“Well then how do I get home?” (From Kentucky to California)

The Drill SGT couldn’t resist screwing with him, “You failed Private, we’re dropping you off at the front gate, how you get home is not the Army’s problem.”

PVT J’s whiny voice was getting worse than usual, “They can’t do that Drill SGT! They have to put me back where they got me! They can’t just drop me off at the gate!”

By this time, we were all trying desperately not to laugh, the Drill SGT turned on us, telling us that we had better not laugh, but one guy, PVT K, started laughing. The SGT yelled, “Drop you!” and PVT K dropped to do push ups. Meanwhile PVT J was still whining that the Army had to put him back where they got him.

PVT K got about two push ups done and fell on his face, laughing so hard that puffs of dust were coming from the ground under his face. The rest of us were still trying not to laugh.

The SGT looked pissed, he threw his arms up and yelled at us, “FUCK IT, LAUGH!” anything resembling military discipline was gone, and we all let loose.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/z1xbf2rjvwni730k', 'title': 'Can you describe a funny moment from boot camp?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'At Ft.

Jack Brownlee,4y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"Resilience.

First grade. I was six years old then; building a house out of uncooked spaghetti noodles for a class project. Each student in the class was assigned a small box full of spaghetti, and we were given part of a school day to design a house in whatever fashion we chose.

Some students built their houses as high as they could. Others made elongated structures. Many students spent the majority of the time coloring their noodles with markers in order to make it “beautiful”. There was a common theme among most of the houses, though:

Everyone tried to design their structure to be as elegant and over-the-top as possible.

Everyone except for one boy, Liam. Liam sat quietly at his desk, breaking his noodles apart in order to build a different type of structure. It wasn’t visually appealing: short, squat, colorless, and it had uneven edges. Students from around the class looked at him, silently judging his Frankenstein-esque creation.

After all of the students were finished designing and coloring their straw houses, our teacher made an announcement to the class:

Now I’m going to put coins atop your houses to see how much weight they can support.

Most students’ houses instantly crumbled when the smallest weight was applied. Other children had forgotten to build a roof altogether. It seemed as though everyone in the class had spent so much time focusing on the colors and features of their noodle houses that even the smallest disturbance would cause them to fall apart.

Liam stepped forward with his house. Everyone who had judged his creation now stood in jealousy as his structure supported weight after weight. Although it wasn’t beautiful, it stood as strong as a rock in the middle of an midsummer ocean storm.

From Liam, I have gained the insight that beauty isn’t everything. I have learned that when we don’t establish a strong foundation for ourselves, we render ourselves unable to persevere through any times of duress.

Appearance, objects we own, money- none of it matters if we allow ourselves to crumble apart. Rather than focus on our exterior, we should try and establish a strong interior: relationships, confidence, love for ourselves, others, and the world.

Like my mother has always said:

It’s what’s on the inside that counts.

Rivansh Roy,Updated 7y,What are some short stories that change dramatically on the last line?,"It was their anniversary. Ritika was waiting for her husband Sanjay to show up.

Things had changed since their marraige, the once cute couple couldn’t-live-without-each-other had turned bitter. Fighting over every little things,both didn’t like the way things had changed.

Ritika was waiting to see if Sanjay remembered it was their anniversary!

Just as the door bell rang she ran to find her husband wet and smiling with a bunch of flowers in his hand.

The two started re-living the old days. Making up for fights, then was the plan for champagne, light, music and It was raining outside ! It was perfect.

But the moment paused when the phone in the bedroom rang. Ritika went to pick it up.

A man,” Hello ma’m. I am calling from the police station. Is this Mr. Sanjay Sharma’s number?”

“Yes. It is”

“I’m sorry ma’m. But there was an accident and a man died. We got this number from his wallet, we need you to come and identify his body.”

Ritika’s heart sank !!! She was shocked!

“But my husband is here with me?”

“Sorry ma’m. but the incident took place at 2 pm, when he was boarding the train”

Ritika was about to lose her consciousness.How could this happen? She had heard about the soul of the person coming to meet a loved one before it leaves!

She ran into the other room. He was not there. It was true ! He had left her. Oh God she would have died for another chance to mend every little fight. She started scolding herself why did not she mend up and put her heart out to Sanjay. She rolled on the floor in pain. She lost her chance. Forever.

Suddenly there was a noise from the bathroom,

“Darling . I forgot to tell you my wallet got stolen today”

A Message To Quorans- Life might not give you a second chance. So Never waste a moment when you can still make up for your Wrongs !!

Amie Dean,6y,What was the worst hour of your life?,"I’m at my best friends house. Her whole family, who I love, is there. My best friend and I are on Skype, talking to a high school friend about all the shenanigans we used to get into. I'm literally laughing so hard I have to run to the bathroom so that I don't pee myself. Still giggling, I go to check my cell phone upstairs.

13 missed calls. Texts from all of my siblings, “call Mom ASAP.” All of my siblings, except one. And in that second, I knew that my brother had died. I pick up the phone, and call Mom. “There’s been an accident… Nathan didn't make it.” “Oh.” “I love you,” says mom, as I go to hang up the phone. I vaguely register that's the first time I've ever heard her say those words. I go downstairs to my best friend, who is still laughing.

“Nathan’s dead,” I tell her.

“What?”

“Nathan is dead.”

And then it hits me. I start sobbing, just standing there in the middle of the living room, unable to move or speak. My best friend runs to get her parents, in the next room. I hear her mom say, “Please, God, tell me it wasn't Nathan.” My best friend and her mom come back into living room, and wrap their arms around me. At some point in time, the Dad, four brothers, and a sister-in-law also make their way into the room. Somebody hands me a roll of toilet paper, and apologizes for not having tissues.

I laugh a little. It's the least of my problems, and I find it to be inappropriately funny.

Next thing I know, I'm sitting on the couch. I don't remember getting there. I've been told I started to sway and almost passed out, so they guided me to the couch, but I don't remember that. They take turns sitting next to me. Saying things to comfort me, but it's like I don't have ears anymore. It's a pastor family, and I can see that the ones who aren't sitting next to me are praying. I've stopped crying, and I sit there, staring at the TV, watching a football game but not seeing it. I stand up, and I walk upstairs, and they let me go. Only my best friend follows, and I ask her for a towel so I could take a shower. I stood under the shower until hot water ran cold, and I guess they got worried, because my best friend and her mom came in to get me.

We made our way into the bedroom, and I lay down staring at the ceiling, hoping I’d die too.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/48v0jntaoq21sp7z', 'title': 'What was the worst hour of your life?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I’m at my best friends house.

Keshav Kumar,Updated 5y,What important lessons has life taught you?,"Hello friends..

Yesterday, I came out from Rohini sector-18,19 metro station, New Delhi. I saw a child on pedestrian, who was selling hot corn. He would be 9–10 years child.

I could not stop myself, went near him and asked:-

Me: Why are you selling corn till late night?

He/Deepak: Brother, my mom and dad is no more, so I earn for myself.

Me : What about your studies ? Do you go to school or not?

He : With true smile!! Yes yes! I go to government school which is very near to me.

Me : How much do you earn in a day?

He : Sometime, I earn Rs 50 or 70 per day.

Me: From where do you purchase corn?

He : There is a man who gives me corn to sell but he takes Rs 6 per corn as commission.

Me : Study hard and labour hard.

Today, he taught me the real meaning of life. A ten years old boy who labour hard but do not beg in city like New Delhi. No matter his mother and father is not alive but God is there for him. He is the one who has bright and shining future.

Lesson:- Never ever look back, leave all worst circumstances and move forward. If a child can understand, begging is not an option for living life then why can't we? Why 78 lakhs (approx) of Indians don't understand? It's time to be change.

Aetherrr,1y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"I am a Loser and a Procrastinator Who Lived in his Comfort zone. I Was Failed in My Engineering exams and in 12th Standard too. Currently I'm doing job in a Sales Company Where I've to go Everywhere in Delhi just to sell Cosmetic Products. I Became soo frustrated. sometimes When I've to Face some Rude Customer Who use Abusive language. I Ran from My Home Just to find my purpose but my Dad Caught me in Banaras. A Boy who lived in comfort zone. Now doing work in Delhi Where temperature goes to 45°C. But Why I'm Doing this??

There're Two Major Reasons :

I don't Know What My Goal is, What's my ikigai??
Just to Feed my Family.

I was very Lazy when I was 18 year old. I Always Hate our Education system. I used to read Novels just For knowledge but never touched a Book by NCERT. Never touched my Engineering Books. Now I've to suffer just to get a Good job. But I don't have any Degree. 🙂

This is My Novel Collections.

Now I've to suffer everyday just for some bucks.

I'd Suggest you, Never compromise with your career like I Did . I know that our Education system is a piece of trash But If you want a good paying job in India then Degree is Must. Reading Novels and books is a great Habit But never ignored your Studies like I Did. This is my Biggest Mistake and Life Lesson tooo.

But After Job when I reached back at home. I Was Over the Moon. I Took my Earphones & Listen to this Song Everyday.

This Song Gave me Hope that Lord Shiva Still has a Plan for me. He's with me, This suffering and pain is temporary. Have Faith on Almighty.

Janet Garlick,5y,What is your best example of revenge?,"I went on a blind date with a guy.

I met him at a local bar, and we shared some drinks and appetizers over about an hour—He was a professional- he wore a suit, because he was coming from work, and seemed respectable and respectful. He was charming, intelligent, generous and engaging- we had a lovely time.

As I prepared to excuse myself, he took my arm and drew me close to him whispering in my ear, “I’ll meet you in the bathroom in 5 minutes”…

I was stunned.

Rabiya,2y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"Nothing is accidental. Universe is too intelligent for that type of creation.

A little back story - my sister is an average student, she scores good and passes in her examination. On the other hand, I am an intelligent student (not boasting), I have scored pretty good throughout my academics.

So, my little sister spends so much time on online shopping apps. She tries to do every possible jugaad to grab that lowest price deal. She tries to find loop holes in the deal so that we get the best price.

Today I told her,

I - Tu agar itna dimaag padhne mai laga leti, toh aaj pata nai kaha se kaha hoti ?

( If you have applied your brain this much in studies, then today you would be at different place.)

She - Mai toh wahi hu jaha mujhe hona tha. Chahe mujhe 90 % aate ya 72 % aaye, mujhe toh hamesha law hee karna tha. Infact tune itna dimaag lagakar kya hee karliya, tu jaha chahti thee tu waha nai hai.

( I am already where I wanted to be. Even if I would have scored 90 %, I would have ended up in Law school only. Infact, you applied so much of your brain in studies, still you are not where you wanted to be)

Meanwhile inner me - Hogayi bezzati. (Insulted)

This conversation ended as I did not had anything to reply her.

Yes, and whatever she said was absolutely true. I mean I wanted to be a Doctor and my sister wanted to be a Lawyer. She is doing what she wanted to, but I am studying law because it was my back up plan.

Sometimes in life howsoever hard you try, you won't get things that isn't meant for you.

Always believe in the plans of universe.

You don't always need to have that steering wheel of your life.

Sometimes you have to let go off things.

Life takes who where you are supposed to be. I am really happy today about where I am.

Like I discovered it later, that I have OCD and I face struggles in my daily life due it. If I would have, by chance entered into medicine I would have risked my life as well as life of others. This very thing keeps me sane.

Allow the universe to take you where you need to be.

Just go with the flow.

Be brave to let go off somethings. Trust the process. Allow the universe to reveal it's beautiful plan to you. Have faith in your journey, even if you don't understand it. Everything is working out as it should.

Gautham Sampath,5y,What is a secret that you have?,"I don't want to go Anonymous because I am grown up to face my situations.

I always wanted to break this secret and get it off my chest.

I was 10 years old .

Next to my house, a new apartment was emerging and the construction of it was going on.

My friends and I used to play Hide and seek in that newly constructed building.

As I am 90’s kid,my childhood used to be full of fun and joy.

Everything was going well….

When the building was nearing to be finished,it was given for carpentry work .

An uncle had taken it for contract where in nearly 50 men had been working under him.

Everyday this uncle used to give me chocolates with a big smile on his face and this continued for a month.

He was very good to me and my friends.

On one evening, we were playing hide and seek in a that building and it was around 6.

As it was six ,all the workers had left.

My friend was counting No's in ground floor,I ran to the 5th floor where this contractor uncle was there.

I hid myself in one of the room telling him not to tell and suddenly this fellow had shut the door.(I was very much confused then).

I was panicking and this guy came near me and started to ask about my school.

Slowly he started to touch and I felt it was a bad touch.

I was really feeling uneasy and I started to sweat in fear.(I was about to shout and was confused to know what was happening around me)

He then continously talking ,moved his hand near my balls..

A sudden voice,

.

.

.

.

‘I found you' my friend shouted by seeing me through the window. (Thank god he didn't close the windows and the carpentery work was not finished).

My friend found out me ….

I breathed in .

Without even turning back I opened the door and ran.

On the night of this incident ,I thought of that ugly incident lastly and forgot it forever.

That was the last day I played Hide and seek and never entered that Apartment.

I never gave a smile nor took his chocolate again.

Whenever he called me from top,I just ignored him.

I just acted as if I don't know him and thought him as a stranger.

After that in one month, the carpentry work got over and that guy left.

I didnt say this to anyone and it's been 12 years and I am 22 now.

After reading an similar incident in Quora, I remembered this incident.

Thus I have shared my dark secret of life.

This secret was itching me and as a spiritual person ,I couldn't hide this more and thus I have shared my secret.

All is well now!

Note:-Not only girls but even males are subjected to mollesting and abuse.

Stay safe!

I need every parents to teach the difference between good touch and bad touch to their kids.

That day God had really saved me :)

Jarred Dunn,Updated 4y,Do you know any weird historical facts?,"The middle initial of President Ulysses S. Grant was a bureaucratic error that taunted him his entire life. The poor man’s multiple names were a constant source of amusement and derision.

The Civil War general and later US President was born Hiram Ulysses Grant (neighborhood children mocked him over his H.U.G. initials). The boy preferred “Ulysses,” though the local kids still creatively called him “Useless Grant.”

How did he end up with a phantom ‘S’ as his middle initial? It began with his local congressman Thomas Hamer.

Hamer had agreed to nominate Grant for entry into the United States Military Academy at West Point, at the request of Grant’s father.

In 1838, Hamer, in his hastily written nomination letter, incorrectly listed the applicant as “Ulysses S. Grant.”

Two explanations are offered for this mistake. Hamer could have confused Grant with his younger brother Simpson. Or the congressman thought that Ulysses used his mother’s maiden name “Simpson” as his middle name.

Grant did not know about this until he arrived at the academy. From Ron Chernow’s biography Grant (page 20):

Upon arrival at West Point, Grant registered under the name U.H. Grant, inscribing his name as Ulysses Hiram Grant in the adjutant’s office. He then discovered, despite his unavailing protests, that he had been nominated for West Point under “Ulysses S. Grant” and perhaps began to suspect that fate had pasted this label permanently onto him.

As soon as fellow cadets spotted the name “U.S. Grant” on the bulletin board, they made great sport of it and promptly branded the newcomer Uncle Sam Grant, or “Sam” Grant for short. Henceforth, he would be known as Sam Grant among the cadets.

By the end of the four years at West Point, he had capitulated to the tyranny of the clerical error and adopted Ulysses S. Grant as his new moniker for life.

There was no fighting the immovable bureaucracy. Grant simply gave up. The middle initial of ‘S’ would be permanently etched in history.

As Chernow states in his biography (page 18):

The mistaken name, which persisted at West Point and beyond, was the bane of the young man’s life…

As Grant later confessed to his wife in frank exasperation, “You know, I have an ‘S’ in my name and don’t know what it stands for.”

Abhigyan Biswas,5y,What's something you've never told anyone?,"I scored 335 in BITSAT 2017.

Since I have already completed my 1st year, I thought it is alright to reveal the secret.

During my 11th and 12th, my father had spent a lot of money on my education but never told me. He also had various loans in his name which had to be paid.

He wanted me to join a good institution. In my hands I had NITs, BITS Pilani, VIT, and Manipal University Karnataka.

As I was getting NITs and BITS, VIT and Manipal were already striked out.

I knew BITS would be my father's 1st preference of getting me enrolled. I also knew fees of BITS were quite high. And for that my father would have to take another loan. And moreover I wouldn't get any kind of scholarship from govt. (Assam govt. doesn't consider BITS as a IIT or NIT level institution).

I knew I was getting good NITs (except the top 3, Allahabad, Rourkela and Jaipur so I decided to join them).

After the exam I said my father that I got 261 in BITSAT, he said okay you tried well.

I then got admitted in NIT Surat. In special round, I got admitted in NIT Jaipur in Chemical Engineering.

Till now I have not regretted my decision. Moreover I saved my father's money and I got a scholarship from the state govt. too.

Amit Kumar,Updated 2y,What was your NEET preparation story?,"It's going to be very very long answer, with lots of grammatical mistakes,Kindly ignore or correct me so that i can improve myself.

It hurts a lot, when in neet 2020 i got nothing after scoring 591 and i decided to drop a year and give my best in 2021.

I thought it will be easy for me, as i only have to practice more and more questions.

But neet is not the only exam i have to give in 2021,

god have other plans too.

Before starting to answer this, i need to give you all a little bit background which is necessary to answer this question in my case.

So i belong to a joint family, where everyone live happily,

My grand father left us 28 years ago, I don't even exist that time and my grandmother left us 12 years ago.

My bade papa(father's elder brother) is no less than a father to me, he has done everything a guardian of a family does.

My elder brothers are god to me, i don't know any other person like my brother he is my ideal and i want to be like him.

He is a good son, a good brother, a good husband and a human who can do anything, sacrifice everything for his family for us.

we 4 brothers are inseperable. Let me introduce them.

Oldest of my brother is pavan

Then jitendra(jitu),

And then i got the opportunity to see this world,

Then my younger brother shankar.

Now the story begins,

An inseparable family is going to witness horrible things in coming days.

something bad happened and a family which is united for 30+ years break apart. I don't know the reasons yet.

I come to know little bit about the situation of my family on 22nd December 2020 and denied everything that my ear listen, then i called my father and he explained a bit to me, I can't resist my tears after finding it to be true I can't concentrate on my studies and after 15 days i have to attend neet 2020 counselling in patna, so i visited my home too,

and there everyone pretending everything to be normal which is obviously not, they are pretending everything normal just because i have to give neet 2021.

A lot of feeling running in my vein, it's unimaginable for me and for my younger brother.

i talked to everyone, each and everyone told me there is nothing to worry, nothing has happened just a big family is burden for all so we mutually decided this.

I agree with everyone and somehow manage to make myself comfortable with it,

My elder brothers console me and make me very comfortable with everything and after listening everyone, i console myself and after attending counselling, i returned to the place where i isolated myself for preparation of neet 2021, since i missed the MBBS seat by 12 marks in neet 2020.

I started preparing for my neet 2021, the only thing which bother me that i am unable to take proper sleep due to over thinking about the situations.

I have hardly come out of the incident and a new horrible thing happened for all of us.

my elder brother jitu got infected with corona and is very serious, he is in sasural that time,

His oxygen saturation level is falling down.

Pavan bhaiya arranged an oxygen cylinder and travelled 100 km in 1 hr 15 min.

Meanwhile,

My bhabi's(sister in law) father is able to arrange an oxygen cylinder which is half filled.

One of my bua's son, let's call him GOD doing pg in surgery in delhi,

When he know the situation he arrived darbhanga(a district of bihar) in 3 hours.

The saturation level fall down to 26 when jitu bhaiya taken to hospital, pavan bhaiya arrived and luckily god too arrived and took the situation in his own hand.

When i come to know about bhaiya, i feel so helpless, the fear and pain of loosing someone whom you love a lot is unbearable,

Again my studies are on hold,

my younger brother already join pavan bhaiya there, but no one allowed me to come since i haven't taken the vaccine at that time,

We all are praying god in there own way, and after 4 days of sleepless nights, jitu bhaiya opend his eyes, but he is still not out of danger,

He remain on ventilation for almost 20 days.

When he shifted to the general ward after 20 days, jitu bhaiya staying on normal oxygen.

And after almost 45 days GOD decided to discharge him,he came home and when i saw him on video call, tears automatically roll down my eyes, he was nothing but skeleton.

But the good thing is he is slowly started taking food and recovering well.

Now, it's july, GOD have to go, he is doing pg in delhi. so he left considering situation is imporving day by day, it seems everything going to be fine now,

But one day he feel difficulty in breathing oxygen intake level is increasing gradually,

pavan bhaiya talked to GOD he suggested ultrasound of chest and catch his flight in an hour.

Meanwhile here bhaiya take jitu bhaiya for chest ultrasound but here everyone denied chest ultrasound as they never perform it.

finally GOD, advised to do a x-ray at least as he suspect pneumothorax.

As he said this is a serious condition and the conditions of hospital there is so pathetic that, GOD decided to operate at home.

Bhaiya arranged everything for the surgery and finally he operated on jitu bhaiya at home, and within a minute he feel relaxed.

Now everyone is waiting for the third day after surgery, the day when pipe should be removed,

but bubbles are still coming,

Now, GOD have strong feeling that jitu bhaiya has Bronchopleural fistula, and he decided to shift him to delhi.

The process of shifting him through train ambulance is started,

meanwhile GOD called me and suddenly told me to come to delhi as soon as possible, i got nervous listening this, then he describe the situation,

I have to go to delhi in case they need people to arrange Oxygen and stuffs,

I immediately take the train and reached delhi, and waiting for them, since train take almost 22 hr.

My younger brother and my bhabi also reached delhi through flight, since only three people are allowed in that train ambulance.

This is the first time i am going to face jitu bhaiya,

i am waiting for them at station, and they finally arrived and i saw jitu bhaiya.

i tried to talk to him, but if i said a word, I can't resist myself from crying so i decided not to talk. I don't want to cry infront of him.

Pavan bhaiya hugged me and said everything will be fine soon.

We took him to the hospital,

And GOD'S doubt comes true he has bp fistula,

My both elder brother is in a lot of pain, one having covid complications and other has sleepless nights.

I stayed there for a week, then pavan bhaiya console me and told me to go and study and make sure to crack the neet this time,

He promised me that I'll not let anything bad happen to our brother,

we have already seen a worst situation of jitu, now i am not here to loose him.

I met jitu bhaiya he wish me all the best and as he said this i got tears in my eyes.

I said what i feel, and how badly i need him, make him positive and left with heavy heart, and tears in my eyes.

Now i have 54 days left for my neet but i am unable to concentrate on anything, but i have to crack neet 2021 anyhow.

I started giving test, started revising all the subjects, and rectifiy the mistakes

And talk to pavan bhaiya daily to ask about the situation,

Somehow i manage to study but when i have to sleep then my real test begins my mind started screaming, got a lot of bad thaughts about the situation of my house, situation of my brothers and that means a sleepless night.

The same routine going on for 54 days, i am counting days just to be with my brother.

Finally i gave neet 2021 with lots of expectations.

And now i am with my brother, taking care of him,

pipe is still there, it may take a week more.

Edit :— tube is removed on 5th October, now he is recovering well 😊

Meanwhile, pavan bhaiya checked my paper,

first physics he calculated 139-144.

Then chemistry i scored 162-166 and

Then bio as he finished bio he hugged me as i scored 360/360 and we cried for almost 20 minutes.

somehow i managed to Score 650+ marks according to allen answer key.

So, this is not only my neet journey, i with my whole family giving god's test,

We don't know whether we passed the test or we have to give more tests.

I hope things will back to normal in coming days, and we again able to live happily.

Sorry again for my grammatical mistakes.

And thanks for reading a long answer like this.

Sudha,1y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"Take care of your health early.
Keep your loved ones near you and draw a boundary with people who just love you at your highest.
Good things don’t come easy.
Be flexible with your goals.
Walk your own path, and don't be the one who constantly judges other people if they don't walk the same path as yours.
Know that Newton’s third law is valid everywhere in life; every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
Don’t bottle up the emotions.
Things can change in just a day.
Time heals everything, believe me, every single thing.
And last, cherish your friendships.

Our manager wasn’t wanting to handle it so our co worker did the next best thing. She had put her two weeks in and already had a solid job offer so she didn’t care. FYI she’s doing great at her new job, we all have a laugh about this now. But back to the story. She comes up to these customers who have basically called this poor girl every name in the book and we all were starting to get tired of this table. Even the gentleman next to these fuck sacks was like “she’s just trying to do her job as best she can, relax lady”. The final straw was when this lady says to Kelsi (our server who’s about to lose it on this woman) “how incompetent are you? you suck as a server, i’m not paying for this food.” Dead ass, kelsi looks at this woman for 5 fuckin seconds with the best shit eating grin everrrr! She looks at me, (i was just a dishwasher, but my other co worker Genesis told me what was about to happen and I had to witness it) winks and then proceeds to FLIP THEIR WHOLE TABLE OVER! Kelsi smiles at the woman and goes “oops”. This woman didn’t know how to respond she’s red in the face and what made it better is that the guy next to this table goes “you had it comin, ya cunt”. I couldn’t hold in my laughter, me and Genesis were practically dying in the kitchen. Kelsi gets the guy a free beer, takes off her apron, hugged us all goodbye and left 2 seconds before our manager could fire her. We talked about it for DAYSSSS!!!

Deni Porter,3y,What is the strangest experience you have ever had while waiting in traffic?,"When I was a teenager, I was living with an aunt and uncle, near Orlando, Florida. It’s dusk, on a busy Friday evening. I’m driving, my aunt is in the passenger seat. We are sitting in traffic, at a big intersection, 2 lanes, divided by a grassy median between east and west bound traffic, strip malls to the side of traffic. (Windows rolled up)

I hear a loud voice. “YOU have a tail light out!” I glance at my aunt, she looks back at me.

Again, louder, “DID YOU HEAR ME? You have a tail light out?”

The voice seems to be projected from a megaphone/loud speaker. I look in the rear view mirror. I look in my side mirrors. My aunt looks back, out the rear window. ALL I see is cars, sitting in traffic. NO cars are moving. Zip/Nada. Only people’s heads are moving! I jokingly say, “Maybe it’s an alien, calling from space!”

Light turns green, I follow traffic. I have just cleared the intersection when, a police car appears behind me, lights flashing. I find the nearest driveway, turn into a strip mall parking lot. Officer pulls in behind me. I’m actually laughing. My aunt is laughing.
Officer walks up to my window, I have my license and registration ready for him.
He says…………………”Young lady, did you hear me back there? I called out to you twice!
Me, thinking fast. “Yes sir, I heard you. However I could NOT see you. From inside my car I also can’t see my tail lights. I DID look around me. I saw every driver around me, looking ………………..looking for a voice from above?”

He stares at me. ( I was trying real hard not to laugh)…………………and then he chuckles.
“OK, you got me there. I suppose, I’ll just tell you again, from beside you, this time, you have a tail light out.

Asim Qureshi,4y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"I was profoundly impacted by the experience I had with one of my friends. Growing up as a teenager he was the golden boy - all the adults loved him. Great at everything he did, yet so humble, so respectful, so kind.

I had spent hours and hours with him, over years, and knew his reputation was absolutely deserved. We were great friends.

But then he did a series of things over several months that showed the monster he was - and it became very apparent he was arrogant, selfish, had used and abused several people, and was just an overall slimeball.

What I learned is that how you are perceived to be and how you actually are are two very different things.

And so I don't care what people think of me. So what if you think I’m wonderful? Or terrible? It doesn’t make me either.

Himanshu Sharma,5y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"11: 00 am - Second innings of breakfast

We a group of three friends who always sat in the last bench and had delicious food from lunch boxes offered by our kind-hearted class girls.

One day, I was seated in between and as usual we ate in no time. When I tried closing the lid of the empty steel lunch box, it slipped from my hands and fell down.

All my classmates turned towards us . I got a feeling as though we disturbed their research work which was critical to rescue the world.

All 57 classmates and lecturer were glaring at us.Now comes the worst part. My two friends who sat beside me also turned towards me.

I bent my head and got to know my Raahu kaal(bad time) had arrived.

The lecturer instructed all three of us to meet him after class. I was happy. Very happy as even my friends were called .

Staff room

We were told to share our father’s number. We pleaded for mercy but he was determined to talk to our father. We tried to be as smart as possible to dodge but he knew what material we were made of. First friend gave and he left to class. Next was my turn.I wrote and left to canteen to have tea.

Now, when my third friend goes to write his father's number, He gets shocked because the number which I wrote was his number.

He wrote my number. In the evening, over the call, he becomes my father and I became his father and we solved the problem.

I was too innocent and good to give away my parents number everytime. This time I was saved.

George Paolini,4y,What is the most unbelievably clever thing you have ever witnessed an animal do?,"Many years ago I was at the Tucson zoo. I was at the chimpanzee cage where a chimp was standing looking at the humans.

A woman with a stroller came up. Naturally, all the adults moved aside to let the mother and her infant child get close to the glass.

The woman picked her child up, and holding the child facing toward the cage, bent down to get at eye level with the chimp.

“Look honey,” said the mother. “See the monkey?”

The chimpanzee seemed to get very agitated at seeing the toddler. Then the chimp scurried away.

The humans all stood there, puzzled. But then the chimp came back, holding HER infant. She held it up to the glass in the same manner as the human mother.

Vijay Odedra,5y,What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?,"I saw Tom Cruise and I desired to be famous.

I saw Bill Gates and I desired to be rich.

I saw Barack Obama and I desired to be powerful.

I saw them and wanted to be like them. I thought this is the way to become happy in life. I thought ‘more is better’.

Then, I came back to my village.

I saw villagers happy though they were not famous, rich and powerful.

I saw them satisfied and content with whatever they had.

That's when I realised that I was chasing what was unnecessary.

What is the biggest lesson life has taught you?

“More is not always better.”

‘More money doesn't guarantee happiness.’

‘More fame doesn't guarantee happiness.’

‘More power doesn't guarantee happiness.’

Ashish Biyani,Updated 7mo,What is your worst experience in life?,"I thought to write this Anonymously for some reason but then I let my heart speak!

It still gives me goosebumps. It still reminds me that life is not the way how I am living. It was the worst experience I had and could have been worse for anyone else!

Background

My wife and I got married in 2013. It was an arranged marriage but love is all that we knew (read know). After a couple of years (and visiting 7 countries and many honeymoons) we decided to plan for a baby.

Fortunately, in two months, I got the good news! We were expecting!

I was more than happy. I am a family man and what else I would have asked from life at that stage?

But it seems God planned something else! We miscarried that child and lost it soon. Yes, it was the worst. We hear such news about our friends, cousins etc but when it happens it feels the worst.

We didn’t have the courage to plan again but Yes, time heals everything. Last year, we got ready and again We were expecting! Every single night, every single test and doctor visit was so stressful. All I wanted was to remain normal.

Early reports were good and then that night came!

8th November 2016 -My life’s longest night!

It was the same night when demonetization was announced. We were at the hospital for some checkups and injections and I was getting calls about all this news from friends and family members. During the day, there were some routine blood tests done too.

I came back home and was talking to my friend about Demonetization and how it will affect us, our country etc etc. And, then I found this unread Email on my laptop (it was sent to my wife’s Email which was auto-forwarded to my Email ID)

I was expecting this report. It is so normal and convenient to get reports via Email. I kept talking to my friend while browsing the report. Everything looked normal until I saw this:

Now, normally, if there is any problem with the report, they make it Bold. I checked this and didn’t find anything problematic. But I was expecting Negative instead of Reactive. I was still on call!

I started searching on the Internet. I had no idea what is Reactive, Non-reactive, or what kind of test it is. It says HIV 1 + 2 ANTIBODY so I had no clue if this was good.

So, the initial searches I found said Reactive means Positive. Later, I found that it is not good to have this as Reactive. And, then I got this WhatsApp from my wife who was sitting in another room, asking me to come as she wants to discuss the report.

By the time I sensed something, I disconnected the call and I rushed to the room where she was sitting. She was looking a bit tense as she has already done the research.

Without asking her anything,

I said “Yes, I have read the report. Not sure what it means. I am still searching on the Internet”

She said, “It looks like I am HIV Positive”

It was already 10.30 PM

I kept searching the Internet and read every possible information I could have gathered. There was lots of information on this. It all pointed out that Reactive means she is HIV Positive. I read the consequences, treatment and everything. I started trembling. I didn't know how this was possible. This could not be happening to me! not to us!

She was pregnant and I read about that situation as well. The last time when we miscarried, we didn’t go through these tests so I had no clue and no answer for Why? and How? and What Next?

I stopped searching as there was nothing left. I was so restless, nervous and that feeling I can’t describe it in words.

My wife was calm.

I asked her to call the doctor and discuss the same. It was 11.00 PM then and that was not a very good time to call the 74-year-old doctor when we recently met her and were not that much friendly with her.

She did. The doctor asked for the details and her voice was clearly hinting that it was something serious.

Still, she said, “Don’t worry, come tomorrow early morning. I will check everything and will suggest what to do next. And don’t worry, let's meet tomorrow.”

My wife said, “Doctor, we read on the Internet and we are really very tense. Is everything fine?”

Doctor Said “I need to check but no need to worry. We will see what it is. Let’s meet tomorrow at 10 AM - first appointment”

However she was trying to give the best of her advice about not thinking about anything else, and it didn’t work. With her tone and stress on “don’t worry”, we were sure that there were reasons to worry.

We had 11 hours to pass. Longest 11 hours. And then there was a thought that it is not just 11 hours.. maybe.. lots of bad thoughts started pouring into my mind.

What will I do without her?
How can this happen to me?
Will I lose her?
How much time she has?
My baby?
Was it me who got her infected??

I immediately asked her if she had any blood transfusion or had any injection where the needle wasn’t changed. She wasn’t able to remember anything.

She was, still, just calm. We both were trying to act normal referring doctor’s statement that she will talk and take care of it. Though, inside, we both were restless.

We were holding each other’s hands and were trying to talk about something else. But in my mind, again:

It has to be me! But I never did anything which can have such consequences. I have been so good in life. Then why?
What will happen If I lose her?
Who will die first?
My insurance will cover this, right?
I have a family who needs support.
What will happen to them?

And it was all random and most negative thoughts kept coming to my mind. I didn’t check my pulse but I am sure it must be 125+.

I can’t live without her!
Why there is no treatment?
How about that treatment which says one can live longer by changing lifestyle?
But just why?

The thoughts moved in another direction and I started analyzing how I lived my life. What did I actually achieve? Did I live a life worth anything? All of a sudden, I started assuming that not only she but I was also infected.

And, then I thought of people who have gone through this. Those people who are still fighting with it. They are fighting with a smile and not like what I was then.

But then I thought “I am not like them. I am so weak. I am actually.”

For hours, my wife and I didn’t directly talk about this. We tried to calm each other. I am proud of her that she reacted so calmly to this situation.

It was already 4 AM.

I was feeling so much pressure on my heart. For the first time in my life, I wanted to share all the negative things which I was feeling. I opened up. We had this emotional conversation. I told I am afraid that it might have reached you from me and I could be infected as well. I told her how afraid I was.

I told her all those things which I always would sugar-coat. But this time, it was all different. My tone was different.

We didn’t sleep the whole night.

We reached the hospital on time. Because it was the first morning of demonetization, it was total chaos. People wanted to spend money on hospitals as there was confusion that hospitals will accept old notes. There were big lines. People were shouting, and arguing and everybody was after old notes.

This is how we live! We are after those things which make no sense when the time comes. This is how I have lived!

People were making jokes about the situation and I had to fake a smile. I was still restless. After a few long minutes, I was able to make the payments and get the receipt.

I rushed to the doctor’s cabin. She wasn’t there. We sat on the chair and waited for her. I saw a known family and had to greet them, talk to them though I was in no mood for doing anything. There was another doctor, whom I knew, who passed in front of me but I tried to ignore him.

And then the Doctor came.

We went inside. And she said,“Are kya ho gaya beta. Aise kyon dull dull ho rakhe ho. Lao report dikhao” (What happened daughter? Why are you guys so dull. Show me reports. )

She said, “How did you get this report?”

I said, “We got these tests done at XYZ lab (one of the best in town) and they sent it via email last night.”

She said, “What? You got this report via Email. The procedure says, if the person is HIV Positive, they have to re-run the test and they can’t hand this report to anyone, not even to the patient. They have to inform the doctor (her) and a counsellor who has the right to share this news with the Patient by meeting in person and discussing various options. And they just Emailed you like this. How irresponsible. ”

She continued, “I want to test it again. Please give your sample in this hospital.”

I asked, “Will they give the report today itself as we are so stressed and we won’t be able to wait for 1 day.”

She said, “Ok, I will see if that can be done now.” She instructed her assistant to do the needful.

I asked, “But doctor, how is it possible? She has never donated any blood or there is no reason she should have this.”

She said “This is not something which happened recently. Maybe during childhood, she got infected.”

I too read somewhere that the symptoms start showing after 5–15 years. I asked her if I need to be tested too which she agreed and wrote about my tests in a prescription.

We came out of her cabin.

Her assistant gave me some forms (pink-coloured I think, I am a bit colour-blind so can’t remember) and asked us to fill them out. A lot of people were looking as I was filling the form for me and on my wife’s behalf which says “HIV Test” in H1 heading.

She asked to take these forms and deposit money for tests and come back with receipts.

Again same line and this time everybody was trying to read why I am carrying this pink form. Few raised eyebrows. All of a sudden I realized that if people are so reactive to reading just form, how they would react to a real HIV patient?

I folded it.

My turn came and I gave folded forms of me and my wife to the receptionist along with the prescription. She checked them, looked at me with a straight face and gave me the receipt.

We took the receipts and went to the assistant who asked us to wait to give our blood sample in some other lab. After a few minutes, we both gave our blood sample and we were told to wait for at least 3–4 hours.

I was not in the mood to go anywhere, so we decided to wait there. Meanwhile, lots of queries came to our mind as we forgot to ask the doctor about the baby so we visited her again. She said, “Let the report come first”

We had another query but then she got busy. We were restless now. We waited for a few minutes inside the hospital, then outside. Again, inside the car. And, then again decided to go into the hospital. We saw the doctor leaving then. She said, “I am going home. Collect the reports and give me a call. And, don’t worry, be strong.”

We decided to leave the hospital and just spend time together while driving as we used to do. For the next 2 hours, we just kept going here and there. I even joined a big line for fuel as people were getting their cars’ tanks full due to demonetization where pumps were accepting old notes. Remember those big lines and pumps were having no fuel!

Two hours passed, and I thought of dropping the idea of fuel and getting back to the Hospital.

We reached the hospital and inquired if they have our reports. They said that they don’t have it yet and it will take more time if the results are positive. We were scared to death, again.

Meanwhile, my parents kept calling for which I said that we are busy in the hospital and assured them everything is fine. We didn’t tell this to anyone.

We were hungry. I do not remember if we had dinner last night but I know we didn’t have anything since morning. My wife asked to have something at the hospital’s cafe. I agreed. We ordered something and sat at a table which was a bit isolated from the crowd.

She said “If there is anything which should not have happened, then don’t worry. Just take it easy. And if there is any chance, let’s save baby first.”

Now I was trying to hold myself since night but looking at her eyes while holding her hands, and when I listened to this, I broke down. I am an emotional guy and there was no way I could have controlled it.

I cried. We cried.

A few minutes passed. It was some 3.15 PM

I went again to check if the report had come even though I knew he had told me that I will receive a text first but I wasn’t able to stop myself.

He checked and the reports were there. He asked for our IDs and asked us to sign a form which said: “If our reports are positive, we will go to a counsellor or something like that.” Honestly, I didn’t care to read that. He handed two different envelopes which had no names.

Do you know what is nervousness?

Checking your CAT Result? AIEEE Result? America Visa Status? Interview Result? Funding Email? No. What, then?

It is while checking your 2nd HIV test when you were positive the first time.

I opened the first envelope. Without checking the name, I just tried to check Reactive or Non-Reactive.

It was NON REACTIVE. I checked the name, it was mine.

I immediately opened another report, which was of my wife now.

And you know what? It was NON REACTIVE too.

We hugged each other! I don’t remember if we laughed, cried or what. But, the next moment, we were out of the hospital.

The last 15 Hours were the worst. I learnt a lot. My opinion about life changed. Everything is changed now. Maybe I am more sorted now.

It seems like nothing happened, or I overreacted to a situation which wasn’t there but guys, just trust me, this is what I went through.

This was my worst experience.

PS: Later we called the doctor from outside the hospital who was so relieved hearing that. Though she told that she consulted with other senior doctors and already inquired about the treatment, and what to do with the baby. She was a real friend and not less than God to us. Lots of respect for her.

Doctor and we all were so angry at the MD who signed this report and didn’t even care to follow the procedure and re-test the same. She just signed it.

I went to that lab and told the scenario. I said I should have abused you, thrown chairs, broken all the furniture on your face but I won’t. I needed an explanation.

I was calm, then. Very calm.

The branch head assured me to check everything and asked me to sit and appreciate that I am not losing my calm in a situation where one should. He told me it never happened in his career of 16 years. They have many branches but he never heard of such a case.

I left and after a few hours, I got a call from this Doctor (MD) who signed this test. The lady called herself as the branch head asked her to deal with me, directly. She said she was sorry a million times. She knew the blunder she had done. I told her the complete story and asked her what I should do now. She said, “Please let me know if anything I can do for you. It was a machine which gave wrong figures and without checking I signed it; It is totally my fault; etc”. Indirectly she offered me money and wanted to settle anyhow.

I could have sued her, got her license cancelled or even asked for a few lakh Rupees for this mental harassment as there were other cases I read where a victim was paid heavily for giving the wrong HIV report as damages.

All I said “Learn from this and make sure because of your insincerity, no one else suffers like this ”

After all, everybody deserves a second chance! I got mine!

PS 2: They re-tested the sample and sent the NON Reactive report again by Email. *Ufff*

PS 3: Sorry for making it too long. Please ignore if there are any typos, spelling mistakes or grammar issues.

PS 4: If you are moved by this answer and need to read something light, you can read this Ashish Biyani's answer to What made you happy today? :)

Update 1 (27–08–2017, 3:45 AM)

Thanks, friends for your love and blessings. I am really overwhelmed and can’t thank you enough for the way you understood and felt our painful experience. Thanks a lot!

I don’t know if this is usual but we all have a great connection with each other. I am amazed that the emotional values we have are exactly the same. I received over 300 comments, and I will try to reply to every single person. Your words mean a lot to me.

Yes! We became parents of the cutest daughter on 24th June 2017 and named her Sinaya (Siya). We always wanted a girl and she is the answer to our prayers. She is healthy and I am fortunate that she looks like me, not so calm :) Though she shares a common blood group with her mother :) Perfect mix :)

Update 2 (06–10–2019, 04.30 PM)

Siya is already 2+ and a big-time chatterbox (Credit definitely goes to me). She has all the stories in the world which she can tell you. And yes, she throws everything. Everything means everything. :)

Update 3 (03 July 2023)

Siya is 6 now! She is a big girl! She enjoys her studies, poems, math, and almost everything in her school :)

She has more than 30 friends! She loves her teachers and she misses her school when it’s off.

She dances so well, and recently she started hula hooping!

She loves that and I doubt if there is another kid in our city or maybe anywhere else who enjoys hula hooping as much as she does.

Whenever I feel low in my life, I read this answer and it reminds me what worst actually means!

Thanks for all these views, comments and upvotes! 🙏🙏🙏

Regards

Ashish

This is how I have lived!\n\nPeople were making jokes about the situation and I had to fake a smile. I was still restless. After a few long minutes, I was able to make the payments and get the receipt.\n\nI rushed to the doctor’s cabin. She wasn’t there. We sat on the chair and waited for her. I saw a known family and had to greet them, talk to them though I was in no mood for doing anything. There was another doctor, whom I knew, who passed in front of me but I tried to ignore him.\n\nAnd then the Doctor came.\n\nWe went inside. And she said,“Are kya ho gaya beta. Aise kyon dull dull ho rakhe ho. Lao report dikhao” (What happened daughter? Why are you guys so dull. Show me reports. )\n\nShe said, “How did you get this report?”\n\nI said, “We got these tests done at XYZ lab (one of the best in town) and they sent it via email last night.”\n\nShe said, “What? You got this report via Email. The procedure says, if the person is HIV Positive, they have to re-run the test and they can’t hand this report to anyone, not even to the patient. They have to inform the doctor (her) and a counsellor who has the right to share this news with the Patient by meeting in person and discussing various options. And they just Emailed you like this. How irresponsible. ”\n\nShe continued, “I want to', 'result': {'fake': 0.3377, 'real': 0.6623}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'test it again. Please give your sample in this hospital.”\n\nI asked, “Will they give the report today itself as we are so stressed and we won’t be able to wait for 1 day.”\n\nShe said, “Ok, I will see if that can be done now.” She instructed her assistant to do the needful.\n\nI asked, “But doctor, how is it possible? She has never donated any blood or there is no reason she should have this.”\n\nShe said “This is not something which happened recently. Maybe during childhood, she got infected.”\n\nI too read somewhere that the symptoms start showing after 5–15 years. I asked her if I need to be tested too which she agreed and wrote about my tests in a prescription.\n\nWe came out of her cabin.\n\nHer assistant gave me some forms (pink-coloured I think, I am a bit colour-blind so can’t remember) and asked us to fill them out. A lot of people were looking as I was filling the form for me and on my wife’s behalf which says “HIV Test” in H1 heading.\n\nShe asked to take these forms and deposit money for tests and come back with receipts.\n\nAgain same line and this time everybody was trying to read why I am carrying this pink form. Few raised eyebrows. All of a sudden I realized that if people are so reactive to reading just form, how they would react to a real HIV patient?\n\nI folded it.\n\nMy turn came and I gave folded forms of me and my wife to the receptionist along with the prescription. She checked them, looked at me with a straight face and gave me the receipt.\n\nWe took the receipts and went to the assistant who asked us to wait to give our blood sample in some other lab. After a few minutes, we both gave our blood sample and we were told to wait for at least 3–4 hours.\n\nI was not in the mood to go anywhere, so we decided to wait there. Meanwhile, lots of queries came to our mind as we forgot to ask the doctor about the baby so we visited her again. She said, “Let the report come first”\n\nWe had another query but then she got busy. We were restless now. We waited for a few minutes inside the hospital, then outside. Again, inside the car. And, then again decided to go into the hospital. We saw the doctor leaving then. She said, “I am going home. Collect the reports and give me a call. And, don’t worry, be strong.”\n\nWe decided to leave the hospital and just spend time together while driving as we used to do. For the next 2 hours, we just kept going here and there. I even joined a big line for fuel as people were getting their cars’ tanks full due to demonetization where pumps were accepting old notes. Remember those big lines and pumps were having no fuel!\n\nTwo hours passed, and I thought of dropping the idea of fuel and getting back to the Hospital.\n\nWe reached the hospital and inquired if they have our reports. They said that', 'result': {'fake': 0.9809, 'real': 0.0191}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'they don’t have it yet and it will take more time if the results are positive. We were scared to death, again.\n\nMeanwhile, my parents kept calling for which I said that we are busy in the hospital and assured them everything is fine. We didn’t tell this to anyone.\n\nWe were hungry. I do not remember if we had dinner last night but I know we didn’t have anything since morning. My wife asked to have something at the hospital’s cafe. I agreed. We ordered something and sat at a table which was a bit isolated from the crowd.\n\nShe said “If there is anything which should not have happened, then don’t worry. Just take it easy. And if there is any chance, let’s save baby first.”\n\nNow I was trying to hold myself since night but looking at her eyes while holding her hands, and when I listened to this, I broke down. I am an emotional guy and there was no way I could have controlled it.\n\nI cried. We cried.\n\nA few minutes passed. It was some 3.15 PM\n\nI went again to check if the report had come even though I knew he had told me that I will receive a text first but I wasn’t able to stop myself.\n\nHe checked and the reports were there. He asked for our IDs and asked us to sign a form which said: “If our reports are positive, we will go to a counsellor or something like that.” Honestly, I didn’t care to read that. He handed two different envelopes which had no names.\n\nDo you know what is nervousness?\n\nChecking your CAT Result? AIEEE Result? America Visa Status? Interview Result? Funding Email? No. What, then?\n\nIt is while checking your 2nd HIV test when you were positive the first time.\n\nI opened the first envelope. Without checking the name, I just tried to check Reactive or Non-Reactive.\n\nIt was NON REACTIVE. I checked the name, it was mine.\n\nI immediately opened another report, which was of my wife now.\n\nAnd you know what? It was NON REACTIVE too.\n\nWe hugged each other! I don’t remember if we laughed, cried or what. But, the next moment, we were out of the hospital.\n\nThe last 15 Hours were the worst. I learnt a lot. My opinion about life changed. Everything is changed now. Maybe I am more sorted now.\n\nIt seems like nothing happened, or I overreacted to a situation which wasn’t there but guys, just trust me, this is what I went through.\n\nThis was my worst experience.\n\nPS: Later we called the doctor from outside the hospital who was so relieved hearing that. Though she told that she consulted with other senior doctors and already inquired about the treatment, and what to do with the baby. She was a real friend and not less than God to us. Lots of respect for her.\n\nDoctor and we all were so angry at the MD who signed this report and didn’t even care to follow the procedure and re-test the same. She just signed it.\n\nI went to that lab and told the scenario. I said I should have abused you, thrown', 'result': {'fake': 0.0573, 'real': 0.9427}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""chairs, broken all the furniture on your face but I won’t. I needed an explanation.\n\nI was calm, then. Very calm.\n\nThe branch head assured me to check everything and asked me to sit and appreciate that I am not losing my calm in a situation where one should. He told me it never happened in his career of 16 years. They have many branches but he never heard of such a case.\n\nI left and after a few hours, I got a call from this Doctor (MD) who signed this test. The lady called herself as the branch head asked her to deal with me, directly. She said she was sorry a million times. She knew the blunder she had done. I told her the complete story and asked her what I should do now. She said, “Please let me know if anything I can do for you. It was a machine which gave wrong figures and without checking I signed it; It is totally my fault; etc”. Indirectly she offered me money and wanted to settle anyhow.\n\nI could have sued her, got her license cancelled or even asked for a few lakh Rupees for this mental harassment as there were other cases I read where a victim was paid heavily for giving the wrong HIV report as damages.\n\nAll I said “Learn from this and make sure because of your insincerity, no one else suffers like this ”\n\nAfter all, everybody deserves a second chance! I got mine!\n\nPS 2: They re-tested the sample and sent the NON Reactive report again by Email. *Ufff*\n\nPS 3: Sorry for making it too long. Please ignore if there are any typos, spelling mistakes or grammar issues.\n\nPS 4: If you are moved by this answer and need to read something light, you can read this Ashish Biyani's answer to What made you happy today? :)\n\nUpdate 1 (27–08–2017, 3:45 AM)\n\nThanks, friends for your love and blessings.

It still reminds me that life is not the way how I am living. It was the worst experience I had and could have been worse for anyone else!\n\nBackground\n\nMy wife and I got married in 2013. It was an arranged marriage but love is all that we knew (read know). After a couple of years (and visiting 7 countries and many honeymoons) we decided to plan for a baby.\n\nFortunately, in two months, I got the good news! We were expecting!\n\nI was more than happy. I am a family man and what else I would have asked from life at that stage?\n\nBut it seems God planned something else! We miscarried that child and lost it soon. Yes, it was the worst. We hear such news about our friends, cousins etc but when it happens it feels the worst.\n\nWe didn’t have the courage to plan again but Yes, time heals everything. Last year, we got ready and again We were expecting! Every single night, every single test and doctor visit was so stressful. All I wanted was to remain normal.\n\nEarly reports were good and then that night came!\n\n8th November 2016 -My life’s longest night!\n\nIt was the same night when demonetization was announced. We were at the hospital for some checkups and injections and I was getting calls about all this news from friends and family members. During the day, there were some routine blood tests done too.\n\nI came back home and was talking to my friend about Demonetization and how it will affect us, our country etc etc. And, then I found this unread Email on my laptop (it was sent to my wife’s Email which was auto-forwarded to my Email ID)\n\nI was expecting this report. It is so normal and convenient to get reports via Email. I kept talking to my friend while browsing the report. Everything looked normal until I saw this:\n\nNow, normally, if there is any problem with the report, they make it Bold. I checked this and didn’t find anything problematic. But I was expecting Negative instead of Reactive. I was still on call!\n\nI started searching on the Internet. I had no idea what is Reactive, Non-reactive, or what kind of test it is. It says HIV 1 + 2 ANTIBODY so I had no clue if this was good.\n\nSo, the initial searches I found said Reactive means Positive. Later, I found that it is not good to have this as Reactive. And, then I got this WhatsApp from my wife who was sitting in another room, asking me to come as she wants to discuss the report.\n\nBy the time I sensed something, I disconnected the call and I rushed to the room where she was sitting. She was looking a bit tense as she has already done the research.\n\nWithout asking her anything,\n\nI said “Yes, I have read the report. Not sure what it means. I am still searching on the Internet”\n\nShe said, “It looks like I am HIV Positive”\n\nIt was already 10.30 PM\n\nI kept searching the Internet and read every possible information I could have gathered. There was lots of information on this. It all pointed out that Reactive means she is HIV Positive. I read the consequences, treatment and everything. I started trembling. I didn't know how this was possible. This could not be happening to me! not to us!\n\nShe was pregnant and I read about that situation as well. The last time when we miscarried, we didn’t go through these tests so I had no clue and no answer for Why? and How? and What Next?\n\nI stopped searching as there was nothing left. I was so restless, nervous and that feeling I can’t describe it in words.\n\nMy wife was calm.\n\nI asked her to call the doctor and discuss the same. It was 11.00 PM then and that was not a very good time to call the 74-year-old doctor when we recently met her and were not that much friendly with her.\n\nShe did. The doctor asked for the details and her voice was clearly hinting that it was something serious.\n\nStill, she said, “Don’t worry, come tomorrow early morning. I will check everything and will suggest what to do next. And don’t worry, let's meet tomorrow.”\n\nMy wife said, “Doctor, we read on the Internet and we are really very tense. Is everything fine?”\n\nDoctor Said “I need to check but no need to worry. We will see what it is. Let’s meet tomorrow at 10 AM - first appointment”\n\nHowever she was trying to give the best of her advice about not thinking about anything else, and it didn’t work. With her tone and stress on “don’t worry”, we were sure that there were reasons to worry.\n\nWe had 11 hours to pass. Longest 11 hours. And then there was a thought that it is not just 11 hours.. maybe.. lots of bad thoughts started pouring into my mind.\n\nWhat will I do without her?\nHow can this happen to me?\nWill I lose her?\nHow much time she has?\nMy baby?\nWas it me who got her infected??\n\nI immediately asked her if she had any blood transfusion or had any injection where the needle wasn’t changed. She wasn’t able to remember anything.\n\nShe was, still, just calm. We both were trying to act normal referring doctor’s statement that she will talk and take care of it. Though, inside, we both were restless.\n\nWe were holding each other’s hands and were trying to talk about something else. But in my mind, again:\n\nIt has to be me! But I never did anything which can have such consequences. I have been so good in life. Then why?\nWhat will happen If I lose her?\nWho will die first?\nMy insurance will cover this, right?\nI have a family who needs support.\nWhat will happen to them?\n\nAnd it was all random and most negative thoughts kept coming to my mind. I didn’t check my pulse but I am sure it must be 125+.\n\nI can’t live without her!\nWhy there is no treatment?\nHow about that treatment which says one can live longer by changing lifestyle?\nBut just why?\n\nThe thoughts moved in another direction and I started analyzing how I lived my life. What did I actually achieve? Did I live a life worth anything? All of a sudden, I started assuming that not only she but I was also infected.\n\nAnd, then I thought of people who have gone through this. Those people who are still fighting with it. They are fighting with a smile and not like what I was then.\n\nBut then I thought “I am not like them. I am so weak. I am actually.”\n\nFor hours, my wife and I didn’t directly talk about this. We tried to calm each other. I am proud of her that she reacted so calmly to this situation.\n\nIt was already 4 AM.\n\nI was feeling so much pressure on my heart. For the first time in my life, I wanted to share all the negative things which I was feeling. I opened up. We had this emotional conversation. I told I am afraid that it might have reached you from me and I could be infected as well. I told her how afraid I was.\n\nI told her all those things which I always would sugar-coat. But this time, it was all different. My tone was different.\n\nWe didn’t sleep the whole night.\n\nWe reached the hospital on time. Because it was the first morning of demonetization, it was total chaos. People wanted to spend money on hospitals as there was confusion that hospitals will accept old notes. There were big lines. People were shouting, and arguing and everybody was after old notes.\n\nThis is how we live! We are after those things which make no sense when the time comes. This is how I have lived!\n\nPeople were making jokes about the situation and I had to fake a smile. I was still restless.

Priya Jha,Updated 2y,What was your NEET preparation story?,"So after a lot of procrastination, I finally decided to answer this question.

Neet 2021 was my third attempt.I have joined aakash foundation course in class 11 &12 but I was not prepared for neet 2019 as I have not worked hard but yes I was ready to give my 100% in my next attempt. So I joined aakash dropper batch and everything was going well until this pandemic arrived and lockdown happened and I lost the way. I only studied 2 to 3 hrs a day and when I give mock test I didn't used to study that whole day .

But when neet was postponed from july 26 to September 13,I again started my preparation with full energy but my bad luck this time I fell ill and literally I can't even stand on my own . whenever I started my study , I had headache due to my poor health.☹️I visited many doctors even got admitted but nothing worked.Then finally gave neet 2020 and ended up getting 600 which could not fetch me govt college as I am from Delhi .

So I again started my preparation but this time I have to join online coaching but sadly I was late to join physics wallah yakeen batch launched on 1 October so I joined Neet udaan kite batch started in mid November.Everything was going well till January came and again I fell ill but this time my mom took me to Rml hospital which was 2 hrs from my home and after 3/4 visits I became fine.I still remember my turn used to come after waiting for 4/5 hours☹️. But it's fine qki m thik hogyi 😊.

Then my preparation went quite well and I used to score around 630/650 in March.But still I was looking for some good question practice then umeed batch of Physicswallah is launched which give a boost to my preparation.

Then again lockdown happened so this time I suggested my parents to go to our village in Madhubani,Bihar as I feel suffocated inside one room. I used to go to library. I can't study at home because I got easily distracted at home specially because of my 11 years old younger brother who disturbed me a lot and also fight with him everyday.

This was the place I love most❤️where I spend two months of my preparation in my village.

Then we came back to delhi .I used to score 650 to 670 in my mock test(695 was highest) .This was the first time that I didn't celebrated my birthday (11 sept) that is the day before my neet as I have to slept earlier.And finally I scored 667 marks that I deserved not less not more .I know that this time rank inflation is very much higher but still I am too happy 😊 that I will get my dream college with 1812 rank(VMMC and safdurjung hospital).I am very excited to start a new journey.I daily pray to god that please counseling start ho jaye jldi ab raha nhi jata .☺️

Dennis Manning,Updated 4y,What is your best example of revenge?,"A supervisor spot had opened up on the night shift, and I was a shoo-in for the job. But a co-worker who had been sleeping with the boss got the nod, even though she’d only been at the plant months while I had years.

Still, I sucked it up and did my job. Half the time I had to instruct her in hers.

Any idea or suggestion of improvement she gave to upper management was a stolen idea. She was trying to seal her space in management heaven.

I found a way to streamline the process that increased output and cut down on overtime without sacrificing quality. Once again, she claimed the idea was her own.

She was showing the big dogs the process, when one of the managers asked a question about how we got around a glitch in the machine’s capabilities. She had no idea, so she said, “I’ll let Dennis explain it. He can explain it better than I can.”

I was nearby setting the machine up and overheard. So I said, “Sorry, guys. I’m on a timeline. This truck goes out in half an hour. I’m sure her explanation will be fine,” and I left to get my job done.

I watched from afar as she struggled to come up with an explanation. It became abundantly clear she had no idea what she was talking about, and that someone else HAD to have come up with the idea.

A couple of managers came up to me later and asked if I knew how to get around the glitch, which I explained in great detail. They nodded, looked at each other, and left.

Fast forward a week. Night shift needed a new supervisor again, as the one who had just got the job got demoted, got angry, and quit. And for some strange reason, I got an office and a raise in pay.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dkecp9a5t4fuznsw', 'title': 'What is your best example of revenge?', 'score': {'original': 0.9982, 'ai': 0.0018}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'A supervisor spot had opened up on the night shift, and I was a shoo-in for the job.

Vijaya Lakshmi,5y,What is the most innocent thing you've seen?,"Warm mid day . . . I was deleting multiple copies of photos from my phone memory card.

I felt guilty. “Ok. Come after two three days I will give you a copy.”

So she came today. I handed over the photo to her.

The expression on her face was priceless.

She was still waiting at the door. I went inside and gave her some money.

She was hesitating to ask some thing.

“Do you want a saree?” I asked.

“No I want one more photo. That day I was not properly dressed.”

Swapnil Kabra,Updated 7y,What's the nicest thing you've ever done that backfired?,"HELPED A GIRL FALLING OFF THE ESCALATOR AND SCREWED MYSELF:

I was in Delhi when this happened. This was just after the 'NIRBHAYA' case. (2012 Delhi gang rape
). The capital was shivering after the incident and women were scared to the core.

I was in the mall and I saw a girl wearing high heeled stilettos and an extremely small black dress. Her legs were visible and she was the center of attraction in the mall. She was carrying two shopping bags too heavy for her to carry alone, yet she somehow managed to carry them.

She stepped the escalator and unfortunately to her surprise she could not manage to keep her feet right. She lost her balance. I was there standing right behind her. I saw that she had lost her balance and now she would hurt herself badly as she was wearing high heeled stilettos.

I realized the gravity of the situation and gave her the much needed support and balance. If it was not for my super fast reflexes and the presence of mind, she would have hurt badly.

I thought she would thank me for the help. 'How dare you touch me without my permission!' was all she uttered. Her face completely red in anger and the mall was silent after the whole scene.

I was embarrassed.....embarrassed to the core. I was boiling. Somewhere from inside me a small voice said, ' Dude, let her be. Not only she but whole Delhi is scared by the 'Nirbahaya' incident. You would have reacted the same if you were a girl.'

'I am really sorry, all I wanted to do was help you from falling and getting hurt', was all I said. I left the mall.

Anubhav Jain,5y,What are the top 5 things you learned from your life till today?,"I never trust future. Expectations and assumptions are bound to fail, do your karma and move on.
Money is everything until you start losing other “unimportant” appearing things like family, love and health.

True love never fades away, it matures with every passing second.

Jodie-Beth Galos,Updated Jan 21,"When you were very young, Did you ever get lost?","In the early 1980s, a baby named Jody was lost/abducted in the New York City area. All the newspapers breathlessly carried the nail-biting story.

I had just started working downtown in the World Trade Center. One day, during lunch, I ran an errand, taking me into a part of downtown I’d never been in before. I became lost; it was really disconcerting.

For those of you wondering why I didn’t just look up and search for the WTC, I did. But the old streets are so narrow, when you look up, it’s as though the buildings converge. You’re lucky to see a patch of sky.

After 15 minutes of walking in circles, I spotted a landmark I recognized and found my way back to the WTC.

When I entered the lobby, the afternoon papers were on the newsstands. The headlines joyously proclaimed: BABY JODY FOUND!

There were two Jodie/ys that day who were relieved to return safely to their friends and family.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vcm5hbglr8an1tu3', 'title': 'When you were very young, Did you ever get lost?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In the early 1980s, a baby named Jody was lost/abducted in the New York City area.

Tiny Nair,6y,What is the most heart-touching poem that you have ever read?,"The most Heart-touching poem I ever wrote

Pain of silence

She remembered the exact time and date

The first time he kicked her in the stomach, straight

Startled she was, but never complained

She endured it all, without disdain

More violent kicks, and finally the pain

The physical trauma, the emotional drain.

Then came the pinch, hair-pull and unprovoked bite

Cursing loudly when she was out of sight

Years passed by, as he grew up

From school to college, career jump

Maze of the corporate ladder and snakes,

Life’s rat race with important stakes.

Fast-forward, time has flown,

On the cold wheel-chair she sits alone

Waiting for her phone to ring

‘Hi Mom, how are you’ is all that she is waiting

‘No time to call, my son must be busy’

The silence pains her; those tiny kicks were so easy.

Edit- since so many people seems to have liked the poem this link revelas it

Shivam Runthala,Updated 5y,What was the funniest thing you saw/heard today?,"Today I forgot to take my data cable to college. I usually connect my phone to laptop with data cable.

This is what happened then.

Me: Dude, I need an Android data cable.

She: Okay. I don't have one but my roommate does.

Me: I will come within 15 minutes.

She: Is there virus in your laptop?

Me: Yeah

She: Then my roommate won't give it to you.

Me: Why? Data cable will also get virus.?

She: I don't know my roommate is saying.

She asked me If my laptop has virus.

I was like no man, this girl can't be that dumb.

Just to pull her leg and know what exactly is she thinking I replied with yes. She told me then her roommate won't give it to me.
