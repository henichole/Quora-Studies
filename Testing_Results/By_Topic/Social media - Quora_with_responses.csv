Meghana,Updated 3y,What disgusts you?,"Yesterday I was watching a video on You tube about how to make fixative spray at home, when I came across another video from the same channel …

Here, you can see that he wants to delete his channel. Do you know why?

Because of these kind of comments …

Why do people do these kind of comments?

He said that he is from Bengali family and they never use any abusive words. And here some people are abusing his mother, sister and all…

And some other person is abusing him saying that he can't make someone's sketch , because he's using the sketch pen of ₹15 … Seriously?‽! I don't understand what's their problem with the cost …

See, we never know how that person is feeling, what they are going through in their life, it's not easy making the videos and uploading them on YouTube …

There that guy is doing hard work and uploading good drawing videos. I am not only saying about him, but also on other videos of many others, people are giving negative comments.

I agree everyone may not like the video, but who gave you the right to abuse them???

No, please don't do that with anyone.

Your one negative comment can make them feel depressed. If you don't like any video, then leave it or dislike it or else comment and tell the reason why didn't you like the video - so that they will try to improve the next time.

What disgusts me?

People discouraging others, making negative comments, abusing others …

Thank you for reading!

Rana Ashish,Updated 5y,What disgusts you?,"Few days ago, one teenager pinged me on Quora and appreciated my writing. I thanked her, later she said that she wants to convey something.

And then she proposed to me. I tried to make her understand that, it wasn’t love just an infatuation. But she was adamant and the conversation (summarizing couple of days of chat) went this way:

Me: You are just 18, I can’t be in a relationship with you. I am 30 and I will be married within a year.

She: My love is pure, can’t you wait for me? I will wait for you.

Me: No, I can’t wait for you. This is not love.

She: Okay, I have no problem with your wedding. You can do one thing, after 10 years you can leave your wife and marry me. (Well, I can’t expect maturity from her).

Me: Hmm, that’s a great idea. But we can do one more thing.

She: What? (She thought, I was agreeing to her terms).

Me: Why should we wait for 10 years? Let’s marry now and after 10 years, I will leave you for a better younger girl. What do you say?

She realized what I wanted to convey and our conversation was over.

If someone has feelings for me, that is not the disgusting part. But this is the worst:

When you think only your feelings matter a lot in the world and you don’t hesitate to ruin others’ lives for your selfishness.

This is the most common reason for a breakup, when people develop feelings for third person while they are in a relationship. The third person is aware of their relationship, but they push. They push hard where they break, which results into cheating, breakup, or even worse.

I understand that you have feelings that are true for someone, but at the same time you should also respect that they are in a relationship. Their feelings for each other are important too.

What if it happens with you too in future?

Think.

A relationship is only made for two,

But some people don’t know how to count.

This disgusts me a lot.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/76ikf2smh4repdyc', 'title': 'What disgusts you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Few days ago, one teenager pinged me on Quora and appreciated my writing.

Shivam Gupta,5y,What disgusts you?,"There was a guy in my college who used to engross himself in studies all the time. He was a gentle and well-mannered boy. Even after his sincere efforts, he got backlogs and low marks.

He used to get panic attacks during exam times. His stress used to be clearly visible on his face. We were from different departments but in final year I got a room near to him.

Some of his colleagues used to bully and humiliate him in mess, ground, library. They rumoured that before any exam, he used to go to his classmates’ room and wish all the best by shaking hand, whomsoever he wished they would get a backlog in that exam.

Some of his colleagues used to hurl abuses on him saying because of him, he got the backlog. During exam times other students didn’t allow him in their rooms.

It was 7th semester exam time. Paper was at 9.00 AM, I was reading my notes quickly as only one hour was left, suddenly I heard a knock on my door.

He: Mai thoda der ke liye tere sath padhu? (May I study with you for some time).

Me: Ha yar baith na ( Why not, sit).

He: Dekh mere dhadkan kitni tej chal rahi hai. (See, my heart beat is so fast). He put my hand on his chest.

Me: Dar kyu raha hai? (Why are you afraid).

He: Mai exam time me bhut ghabra jata hu. Isliye apne dosto ke room me jata hu. Taki dar kam ho. Aaj koi door nahi khol raha. ( I get panicked in exams so I go to a friend’s room, but today nobody is opening the door).

Me: Acha chal sath me padhte hai. ( Let’s study together).

I asked some question from his notes. He explained them excellently. After half an hour, We came out and I started closing my door. He shook my hand and told All the best. The other guys were present in the wing and they saw it. They were laughing sarcastically.

The paper was one of the toughest. Everyone did pathetic so did I. They mocked saying they don’t know about others but I will get a backlog for sure.

Results came and I got second highest marks in that paper. He came to my room and wished as he also did well in his paper.

Bullying gentle and soft boys in college by rowdies disgusts me to the core. They suffer in silence. What they need is little support and affection.

Sean Kernan,5y,What is the biggest difference between the 1990s and today?,"Someone that I know well lost a family member in last week’s Pittsburgh shooting.

For the uninformed, a man entered into a synagogue, shouted antisemitic remarks, and began firing on a crowd of people during the naming ceremony for a baby.

He killed 11 people in total, ranging from age 59 to 97.

Essentially, he opened fire and targeted a bunch of old people.

I have an elderly grandfather so it hits home a bit.

I can’t even fathom having his last moments be like the last moments for those people. After living such a long, fruitful life, to have it all end like that.

Unfortunately, I actually didn’t hear about the shooting until a couple days after the fact.

I’ve more or less resigned myself to not watch U.S. news because of how much of an abomination journalism has become.

I turned on the TV. I leave it on. I flip between the news stations.

Nothing.

There were plenty of articles online, but TV? Nada. And then a brief mention of it at one point. And back to Trump 24–7.

Back in the 1990s, we had the first major school shooting: Columbine.

Two students shot up their high school, killing 13 people before turning the guns on themselves.

This dominated the news cycle for months. It was a huge deal. And rightly so. The public was shocked and horrified by what had happened.

Today?

A mass shooting will be the key headline for 2–3 days max (if even a single day).

At some point between the 1990s and today, mass shootings became normal and the news decided to only cover presidents and politics.

Anwesha Barua (অন্বেষা বড়ুয়া),Updated 3y,What is your biggest regret in life?,"This is a photo of my father.

He died on the 4th of February 2020 due to a massive heart attack.

I last spoke to my dad some 3–5 days before his death. The conversation was mostly about me shouting at my father and disagreeing with what he said to me. So basically the conversation did not end on a happier note. After that, I never bothered to ask my mother to give the phone to him or say “Baba, I am sorry, I shouted at you that day.”

Never bothered.

Only if I had known this would happen.

What will be my biggest regret? The sheer fact that I won’t be able to tell that “I am sorry I shouted at you and I should talk to you often”.
I was not attached to my dad but since he went, there is a sense of emptiness, a vacant feeling of uncertainty. I know this feeling will reside for a while but I cannot come up to the terms that he is no more.

I won’t be able to call him ‘Baba’ anymore. In fact, I don’t have anyone to call Baba.

His birthday falls on 16th February and I was supposed to come home at that time. He told me “You’re coming before my birthday so we all celebrate it”. I even planned it out but they say things don’t go as plan.

What will be my biggest regret? That I won’t be able to celebrate his birthday anymore, can’t call him up and wish “Happy Birthday Baba”.
Right now I feel a deluge of emotions that are making me quizzical about what should I actually feel - should I be happy or sad or neutral or what?

I miss him

What will be my biggest regret? That my dad won’t be a part of anything in my life, neither for the minute ones or the grand ones. He will never see me excel in life or reprimand him or not even see me get married.

What will be my biggest regret? I will never get to click any photo with him (the sad part is I have few photos with him and I will cherish them forever.), I won’t be able to ask how is he doing or call him to let him know that ‘I love you baba’. He won’t be able to touch me, hug me, make me laugh, or tell “First class” to everything I say. I know a lot of people have lost someone dear to them but the thing is I am someone who voluntarily distanced myself from my dad and this behavior of mine is haunting me, is questioning why I behaved like this in the first place? I am hating the fact that you will remain as a reflection of memories, perceived only through old photos and recollection of your thoughts and all.

Baba, I am sorry, I never understood you and never made an effort to fathom what you believed. I never asked how you’re feeling or how are you doing? I will never get to hear you say “I am the best dad you will ever get”. Baba wherever you are, guide me, look after me and just see that everything will be fine. I love you baba forever and ever.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rkc1wj9ieub0835h', 'title': 'What is your biggest regret in life?', 'score': {'original': 0.82265, 'ai': 0.17735}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This is a photo of my father.\n\nHe died on the 4th of February 2020 due to a massive heart attack.\n\nI last spoke to my dad some 3–5 days before his death.

The conversation was mostly about me shouting at my father and disagreeing with what he said to me. So basically the conversation did not end on a happier note. After that, I never bothered to ask my mother to give the phone to him or say “Baba, I am sorry, I shouted at you that day.”\n\nNever bothered.\n\nOnly if I had known this would happen.\n\nWhat will be my biggest regret? The sheer fact that I won’t be able to tell that “I am sorry I shouted at you and I should talk to you often”.\nI was not attached to my dad but since he went, there is a sense of emptiness, a vacant feeling of uncertainty. I know this feeling will reside for a while but I cannot come up to the terms that he is no more.\n\nI won’t be able to call him ‘Baba’ anymore. In fact, I don’t have anyone to call Baba.\n\nHis birthday falls on 16th February and I was supposed to come home at that time. He told me “You’re coming before my birthday so we all celebrate it”. I even planned it out but they say things don’t go as plan.\n\nWhat will be my biggest regret? That I won’t be able to celebrate his birthday anymore, can’t call him up and wish “Happy Birthday Baba”.\nRight now I feel a deluge of emotions that are making me quizzical about what should I actually feel - should I be happy or sad or neutral or what?\n\nI miss him\n\nWhat will be my biggest regret? That my dad won’t be a part of anything in my life, neither for the minute ones or the grand ones. He will never see me excel in life or reprimand him or not even see me get married.\n\nWhat will be my biggest regret? I will never get to click any photo with him (the sad part is I have few photos with him and I will cherish them forever.), I won’t be able to ask how is he doing or call him to let him know that ‘I love you baba’. He won’t be able to touch me, hug me, make me laugh, or tell “First class” to everything I say. I know a lot of people have lost someone dear to them but the thing is I am someone who voluntarily distanced myself from my dad and this behavior of mine is haunting me, is questioning why I behaved like this in the first place? I am hating the fact that you will remain as a reflection of memories, perceived only through old photos and recollection of your thoughts and all.\n\nBaba, I am sorry, I never understood you and never made an effort to fathom what you believed. I never asked how you’re feeling or how are you doing? I will never get to hear you say “I am the best dad you will ever get”.

Akanksha Kiran,Updated 3y,What disgusts you?,"One of my friend, Amit(name changed) was travelling by cab which was shared by 2 old men, seemingly in their 50s.

The thing to be worried was the fact that he was sharing the cab with 2 drunkards, who occupied the backseat and he was peacefully listening to music by plugging on his headphone on the front seat.

Things were normal until a girl arrived.

It seemed this lady in her 20s has booked the cab too.

That's where the problem began. Being a girl she was hesitating to adjust beside those drunkards and my friend totally understood her situation.

He planned to offer the front seat to the girl and adjust himself with the drunkards.

He was just on the verge of getting up and opening the door when this girl arrived and with rage and anger, bashed Amit by screaming at the peak of her voice-"" Dikhta nhi h mai ekk ladki hu, chup chap se utho or backseat pr jakr baitho""( can't you see I'm a girl, get up and give me the front seat).

No kidding, those were her exact words.

It was a sure thing that my friend attracted a good amount of gaze from the local public and could hear whizzes of the crowd raising voice on his morality and upbringing for being rude towards a girl.

He immediately got up and sat at the back seat.

What disgusts me?

People like her!

.

.

We should understand that the other person is neither obligated to help us and nor is getting paid for it. He's just being kind to us out of his own will, so can't we just be a little cordial while asking for help?

P.S- For the people saying he shouldn't have gotten up from his seat, I just want to clarify that he's my childhood friend and I know him inside out. His priority that time was her safety and messing with her was pointless.

James Dacey,6y,How can I become socially confident?,"Two words - stop caring.

I’m a very confident guy. Like, I’m the type of person, who could go on stage, at the Grammy Awards, and sing in front of millions of people, and not feel any nerves.

You know why? I basically don’t care if I fail, or succeed. And I don’t care whether people like me, or hate me, either.

I see life as being very short. I know I only have a small amount of time, on planet earth, and I know that ultimately, failing at something, or not being liked by someone, is pretty irrelevant.

All that matters is that I live life, how I want to live it, to the max. And that’s what I do.

The reason you’re not confident, is you care too much. You think social situations matter a lot, when they really don’t. You think people’s opinions matter a lot, when they don’t.

The only way you get confident, is by understand none of it actually matters that much. And the world isn’t going to end, just because you make a mistake, or make a fool of yourself.

In fact, you’ll find that other people, frankly, don’t care what you’re doing, or what mistakes you’re making.

And the world isn’t going to end, just because you make a mistake, or make a fool of yourself.\n\nIn fact, you’ll find that other people, frankly, don’t care what you’re doing, or what mistakes you’re making.

Shanks Wang,Updated 6y,What disgusts you?,"A few months ago, I was taking care of patient “Johnny”.

Johnny was an elderly man who had his stay in hospital extended due to multiple poorly controlled comorbidities. For privacy’s sake, I won’t go into detail about his medical conditions.

For one whole month, I was part of Johnny’s medical treatment team, and the main junior doctor taking care of him.

Every morning, I visited his bed, engaged in some small talk with him, auscultated his chest and lungs and palpated his abdomen and ankles.

Every week, I updated his family, i.e his son and daughter, on the progress of his condition via phone calls.

Due to the complexity of his condition, his family agreed to have him on partial code (i.e not for CPR/Intubation/ICU). While his condition had stabilised, I warned them that any further infections or cardiac event will likely cost his life.

Despite all this, the son and daughter did not visit Johnny once, not even once, in those 30 days. Over the phone, they would always have a convenient excuse ready. Business trips, commitments, you name it.

One morning, when I visited Johnny for his usual checkup, I observed that he was drowsier than usual. A vital sign perimeters check revealed a significantly reduced oxygen saturation. The medical team was immediately informed as I took and sent off bloods and ordered a chest x-ray. Investigations indicated a new-onset hospital-acquired Pneumonia, likely due to his age and compromised immunity.

As was discussed with him and his family, at this stage, it’s better to allow a natural death instead of prolonging his suffering by sending him to ICU and putting tubes down his throat.

His son and daughter were promptly informed and voila! Within an hour, somehow both of them were able to ditch their “commitments” and arrive at bedside. By then, the patient was already unresponsive and on morphine.

The son had tears in his eyes while the daughter was bawling uncontrollably. Johnny could no longer recognise them, nor respond to them in any way. He had spent his last 30 days without a single family member beside him.

That very evening, Johnny passed away.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/thenbi4vd2s7qw3j', 'title': 'What disgusts you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'A few months ago, I was taking care of patient “Johnny”.\n\nJohnny was an elderly man who had his stay in hospital extended due to multiple poorly controlled comorbidities.

Teshani Nanayakkara,Updated 2y,What disgusts you?,"This is the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev.

Earlier this year, Aliyev delivered an impassioned speech to the UN regarding the genocide of 600+ Azerbaijanis, which he claims were committed by Armenia during the 1992 conflict.

Also in attendance were Aliyev’s wife, Mehriban and daughter, Leyla.

For the first two or so minutes, 33-year-old Leyla listened attentively to her father’s speech.

It seems her attention span can’t exceed 3 minutes because by that time, Leyla has her phone out.

Maybe she’s proud of a father, so she’s taking pictures to mark the occasion?

Nope.

She turns her phone around and we see that she’s taking SELFIES!!!

Suhani,1y,What disgusts you?,"Recently me and my friend ordered pizza on zomato because we were really hungry.

There was this restaurant called Hotel Samrat which had some offer of 50% off going on. We looked for pizza and ordered one chicken pizza and one paneer pizza because the price was good.(First mistake we did was paying beforehand.)

Then we started eagerly waiting for our order. Just then we received a call from the restaurant and the person on the order side said:

He- Paneer nahi h to paneer pizza nahi hopaega veg hojaega.

(Paneer is not available so we can't make paneer pizza but veg pizza is available)

Me-But bhaiya paneer pizza ka price to jyada hai veg wale se to kya aap paise wapas krenge?

(But price of paneer pizza is more than the veg one. So what about the money?)

He- Aap zomato walo ko Complain karke refund lelena.

(You can put a complain on the zomato app and take refund)

We thought, he himself is telling to put complain about his restraunt then its fine if we are getting our remaining money back.

Me-Han thik hai ek veg krdo.

(OK then replace it with a veg pizza)

After 15 to 20 minutes we got the call from our delivery boy and went downstairs to receive it. Usually when you order a pizza, you expect a large rectangular box right? When we opened the gate we were shocked to see a small thaila( pouch) in the hands of the delivery boy.

We blankly looked at each others faces then after seeing our expressions the delivery boy said

He- Aapko ratings Dekhlena chahiye tha madam. Jab mai order receive krne gaya to mereko v dekh k accha ni lga. Ye koi restaurant nahi hai ek aadmi hai, Jo 7 8 fake Id bana rakha hai zomato pe aur orders leke chote chote dukano se kharid k dedeta hai. Agli baar order krne se pehle reviews dekh lijiyega.

(You should have seen the ratings mam. When I reached there to collect the order I too felt disgusted after I saw the package. This is not a restaurant, just a person who has 7 - 8 fake Ids in zomato.. He just takes orders then purchase it from the roadside shops and sends it)

We felt numb. The hunger, the scam, the delivery boy's explanation, every thing just mixed up. We took the parcel as we had already paid for it :|

We opened the package and this is what we got:

Two God knows which world's “Pizzas”. Fitting in one palm. Worth 218 rupees🙂.

We immediately complained in the app and told them about the fake I'd and that they should ban them but as pathetic as the zomato customer service is , they connected me to an executive who literally was taking hours to reply.

He wanted to settle me down with a coupon code which wasn't even half the price we paid. I was like, you can't be serious!

We even tried calling the restaurant again but guess what he had blocked my number and was not picking up anyone's call. What an ahole!

I wonder how many people he has scammed till now and earning profits so easily and nobody does nothing even if they know about it because its almost 2 weeks since this incident but Boom! That fake I'd still is there, untouched, and scamming people! And zomato does nothing.

So yes this disgusts me.

Cuttackia people never fail to disgust me by the way🙂.

Sandhya Bharti,Updated 3y,What disgusts you?,"There were only six others on the bus, including the driver. One of the men, identified as minor, had called for passengers telling them that the bus was going towards their destination.

We are all aware of the 2012 Delhi gang rape case in Munirka, South Delhi. 23 old Nirbhaya was beaten, gang-raped and tortured in a private bus.

They boarded the bus at Munirka. Her friend became suspicious when the bus deviated from its normal route and its doors were shut. When he objected, the group of six men already on board, including the driver, taunted the couple, asking what they were doing alone at such a late hour.

During the argument, a scuffle ensued between her friend and the group of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked unconscious with an iron rod. The men then dragged Nirbhaya to the rear of the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. A medical report later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration.

That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.

According to police reports Nirbhaya attempted to fight off her assailants, biting three of the attackers and leaving bite marks on the accused men.

After the beatings and rape ended, the attackers threw both victims from the moving bus. One of the perpetrators later cleaned the vehicle to remove evidence.

After Nirbhaya’s death protests were staged in entire country. Nation was burning with anger. It was something never occured in history. Even the rapists were not ashamed of themselves.

Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh Singh were sentenced to death by a trial court in 2013.

Do you recognize this woman?

She is wife of one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case ‘Akshay Thakur’. I just watched a video. I am very sympathic towards her but the way she is abusing in front of court is inhuman. She is crying for a husband who didn’t deserve to be a human. She has a child who is not in the age to understand what’s happening around him. She is asking for justice.

Isn’t justice served for Nirbhaya?

Her husband did wrong to her not the court. What kind of justice is she talking about?

Here goes Pawan Gupta’s sister. She was protesting on the road saying who will marry her if her brother is hanged. We say changes made at home.

Is this the way we’ll make a change?

They were murderer and rapists not freedom fighters. They don’t deserve any life petition or protest in favour. These people are cancer to the society. A woman was raped brutally. They are also women who are not willing to understand her pain.

How am i supposed to call them a human?

Edit 1: This is for them who are very sorry for her and telling that she's illiterate.

This is the same woman who applied for divorce because she didn't want to be a widow. It's been 7 years. She didn't do anything over these years and why all of a sudden she is worshipping her husband?

I never talked about literacy. I mentioned humanity only.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cknpgois1m2l6bq0', 'title': 'What disgusts you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9382, 'ai': 0.0618}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'There were only six others on the bus, including the driver.

Mohit,2y,What is your biggest regret in life?,"I left for Hyderabad on 25–12–21. I was excited to attend classes in offline mode. Two days before leaving Dehradun, I paid visit to my maternal grandmother.

She asked me to stay for lunch, eat and then go. She kept on insisting but I told her I would surely visit her again before I go. As and how Indian tradition follows, she held Rs 500 in my hand and I left. I did not had a right feeling. My gut told me to stay.

She wept as I was departing. I gave her hug and comforted her by telling I would once again visit her. I was selfish as I was more excited to pack my bags and go. I wanted to stay as well yet I went. She wept as I passed by. I felt bad.

I could not visit her again! I left for Hyderabad on 26th of December, 2021.

On 3rd January, she passed away. I was taken aback. My world shook up. And I felt guilty.

I could not even spare half hour more for her.

She was a pure soul, a person with high dignity, love and selflessness. One who could sacrifice her entire life for people she loved. She was my ‘Nani’. And she was my world. As I write this while holding tears in my heart and eyes, I wish to tell the world that I was raised by my maternal grandmother.

I hope wherever she is, she is in peace. May her soul rest in peace. She is forever alive in my heart. I love you Nani.

Shubham KP,7mo,Are you on Instagram?,"What for?

For reels? For zooming the cleavage? For watching girls twerk? For seeing someone fake their lifestyle as it sounds cool?

Nope.

I've deleted my Instagram around two years back and I never looked back. But, sometimes, I get pinged by someone on Quora and just to check whether they are genuine or not, I check their Instagram profile.

I have a fake Instagram handle with two unknown followers, zero following, and zero posts.

I open it once in several months. I don't remember when was the last time I opened it. And there's no way you can discover me there.

I'm a ghost on Instagram.

Not using Instagram doesn't make you cool. But I never really liked it. Instagram doesn't add any value to my life.

Someday I might write there if there's a need. But I'll not be there, you know, just to post my pictures.

I'm happily posting pictures on Quora as a memory. I write long answers and attach a photo of myself, in the end, and that suffices.

People might have a problem with that. But since I don't use Instagram, I take it as a sweet excuse.

We all are gifted,

Divya Raikwar,2y,What disgusts you?,"A friend of mine asked me for this book 8 months ago for some reference purpose in her board exams, also she promised to return it soon. I didn’t usually give my books to anyone .

The reason is that i really keep my books away from using pen or markers and even highlighters as well.

After few months she retured my book..in this condition….

Some pages were missing ….

Sanyukta,2y,What's the creepiest social media trend currently?,"TW

“Repost this if you’re against rape.”

“This was Cara she slit her wrists to die. Put it on your story or you’re an animal.”

“Share this or a child dies in Africa because of you.”

We’ve all seen a surge in these posts of late on social media. The number of times I see this is mildly infuriating and borderline creepy.

Anything that is a ‘repost if’ or ‘like if’ is something I immediate scroll past or ignore.

And why not?

Don’t use a tragedy or problem to get some likes or shares.

It doesn't do anything to fix a problem, does it make you feel morally superior or good?

Ask us to like and/or share something if it’s important and is actually gonna make a difference and if you mean it.

Take it from a long-term victim of CSA. Doing this is the exact opposite of being supportive.

It leaves a bad taste in my mouth and makes me feel disgusted.

To me, they are essentially just shamelessly asking for reposts.

Kinda hate this trend so much, can we just scroll past?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/k4qhlea2z183s0jg', 'title': ""What's the creepiest social media trend currently?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""TW\n\n“Repost this if you’re against rape.”\n\n“This was Cara she slit her wrists to die.

Matthew Bates,6y,How do you grab a reader's attention?,"Easy.

Single word sentences.

Followed by short sentences.

Then you can move in to longer, flowing sentences that contain the “meat” of what you want to tell your readers. This method works well for me. I guess that, by the time they’ve made it to the fourth paragraph (which doesn’t take long, because the first three paragraphs are short), people figure they’ve made it this far, they might as well finish it.

And just like that, you’ve gotten their attention.

The worst thing to do is to hit them from the beginning with a huge paragraph. People are lazy. You can count on that. If the first thing they encounter seems like work, they won’t do it.

But look at my first “paragraph”. You can’t look at it and NOT read it.

PshhMizu,1y,"My 15-year-old daughter got a B in class today. I took away her phone, laptop, TV, bedroom door, bed, pillows, and blankets away for 2 weeks. Should I have done more?","You better just be a troll. If you're not, I hope that girl gets the hell out of that house as soon as possible.

That is abuse. ABUSE. A B in school is good. It's not this perfect A that you're apparently demanding your child to get. News flash. People aren't perfect. People make mistakes. Be proud of her instead of being an absolute monster.

Do you want her to develop mental health issues like depression and anxiety? Are you actively trying to get your child to hate you? Cause that's a one way trip down a road you do not want to go down.

I was mentally and emotionally abused by my father my entire childhood, and the trauma still lives with me today. I am unable to get a job because of how severe it was. I am unable to talk to grown men. I am unable to order my own food at a restaurant. I am unable to ask for help in a store. I am unable to FUNCTION. I only graduated high school because I was supported by my mom. If I wasn't, I would be a drop out. I graduated January of this year. 2022. 2 years after when I was originally supposed to graduate. Why? Because I was abused. Because I was starved by my father. Because I was locked in my room until I got everything perfect on my homework sheets. All because I didn't do good in school, and obey his every command. I was an undiagnosed autistic child going through absolute hell. Alongside autism, I now have severe depression, trauma induced social anxiety, and general anxiety because of my experience.

Waji ul Hassan,Sat,What made you stop using Reddit and switch to another site?,"The Allure of Alternatives: Exploring Why Users Abandon Reddit for Other Platforms

Introduction: Navigating the Ever-Evolving Social Media Landscape

In today's fast-paced digital age, social media platforms serve as the virtual town squares where individuals converge to share ideas, connect with like-minded individuals, and engage in vibrant discussions. Among the myriad of platforms vying for users' attention, Reddit has long held a prominent place, renowned for its diverse communities and robust user-generated content. However, as the digital landscape continues to evolve, an increasing number of users are finding themselves drawn to alternative platforms. In this article, we delve into the factors driving users to abandon Reddit in favor of other sites.

The Rise of Reddit: A Brief Overview

Since its inception in 2005, Reddit has grown from a niche discussion forum to one of the largest social media platforms in the world. With millions of active users and thousands of communities covering virtually every topic imaginable, Reddit has carved out a unique niche in the digital ecosystem. Its voting-based system and emphasis on anonymity have fostered an environment where users feel empowered to express themselves freely and engage in open dialogue.

Exploring the Exodus: Reasons for Leaving Reddit

1. Erosion of Community Culture: Some users lament the gradual shift away from Reddit's original ethos of community-driven content and discourse. As the platform has grown in size and popularity, many feel that the sense of intimacy and camaraderie that once defined Reddit has been diluted or lost altogether.

2. Moderation and Censorship Concerns: Criticisms regarding Reddit's moderation policies and approach to content moderation have prompted some users to seek alternative platforms where they feel their voices are not stifled or censored.

3. Privacy and Data Security: With growing concerns over online privacy and data security, some users are turning to platforms that offer greater assurances in these areas. While Reddit has taken steps to enhance user privacy, concerns persist regarding data breaches and third-party access to user data.

4. User Experience and Interface Design: Despite Reddit's wealth of content, some users find its interface to be outdated and clunky, especially when compared to sleeker, more user-friendly alternatives.

Embracing Alternatives: The Appeal of Other Platforms

1. Voat: Dubbed the ""Reddit alternative for those who hate Reddit,"" Voat offers a similar user experience while touting a commitment to free speech and minimal moderation. Its decentralized structure and emphasis on user autonomy have attracted users disillusioned with Reddit's approach to content moderation.

2. Snapzu: With its visually appealing interface and curated content model, Snapzu offers a more curated and organized browsing experience compared to Reddit's sprawling communities. Its focus on quality over quantity has resonated with users seeking a more refined social media experience.

3. Hubski: Positioned as a platform for ""thoughtful discussion and insightful content,"" Hubski emphasizes meaningful interactions and diverse perspectives. Its smaller, tight-knit community fosters deeper connections and more nuanced conversations than what is often found on larger platforms like Reddit.

Conclusion: Navigating the Social Media Landscape

In conclusion, the decision to abandon Reddit in favor of alternative platforms is driven by a multitude of factors, ranging from concerns over community culture and moderation to preferences for user experience and interface design. While Reddit remains a dominant force in the social media landscape, the rise of alternative platforms underscores the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of online communities. As users continue to seek out platforms that align with their values and preferences, the social media landscape will undoubtedly continue to shift and evolve in response.

It’s in the category of someone in your house reading your postcards simply because they can.

Social media exists for social purposes, at best. A case could be made that a therapist fooling around with a client’s social media accounts is flirting with a potentially harmful multiple relationship.

Having said that, I’ve had clients show me passages from Facebook and other platforms, and that’s fine if they want to do it. It can be useful. No problem.

Jagoda Dabrowska,2y,What disgusts you?,"This phrase “what were you wearing?”

Whenever someone (usually a woman) is raped or sexually abused. The first thing people ask is “what were you wearing”.

As if it actually matters, because society thinks that women wear clothes for men, that we dress up for men. We don’t. If a girl gets raped and is wearing something considered promiscuous, that doesn’t mean she’s asking for it. She’s not dressing for your pervy self.

It’s the first thing I was asked when I was raped, both times.

I’ll show you what I was wearing.

The first time:

Ooo, because 5 year olds dress up for men. I was clearly asking for it wearing this.

The second time, it was in 2020. I was wearing something slightly revealing but again. I wasn’t asking for it. I wasn’t dressing for men. I was dressing for myself.

The clothes I was wearing have nothing to do with why I was raped. I was 17 years old.

^photo of me. Taken on the day I was raped for the second time.

That question disgusts me, because it’s saying every rape victim is to blame and that their trauma is justifiable just because of a piece of cloth.

If a girl is wearing something that you think is “slutty”. Then learn to control yourself. It’s not hard.

This could be your daughter, your mother, sister, niece.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/syt2uefp1vbj3nc8', 'title': 'What disgusts you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This phrase “what were you wearing?”\n\nWhenever someone (usually a woman) is raped or sexually abused.

Rabiya,Updated 3y,What disgusts you?,"My dad believes in charity. He makes sure that once in a week, he distributes food to poor and needy. Last week he was out of the town for work, so he called and told me to distribute the food among poor people in the nearby vicinity. I agreed.

So next day, I went to a restaurant and ordered 50 parcels of the food. After the food was ready, I went to nearby slum, where many poor people used to live. More than half of the food packets were distributed there.

Then, I moved forward and saw a lady who was sitting a bit far on a footpath. I took my vehicle there, and gave her a packet of the food. That lady suddenly started crying. I consoled her and gave her water. She was sobbing in pain. I asked her what happened?

Lady- Beta, meri bhi tere jaisi beti hai, hum dono idhar hee rehte the aur idhar hee sote the

(I also have a daughter like you, we both used to live here and sleep here)

I - Accha aunty aap ro kyu rahe ho, aap aise hee bol dete mai aapko aur ek khaane ka packet de deti hu.

(Okay aunty, you don't need to cry, take this one more packet of food for your daughter)

Lady- Arre, nai beta. Mai khaana nai maang rahi hu.

(No, I am not asking for food)

I - Toh phir aunty kya hua aapko? Aap itna kyu ro rahe ho?

(So, what happened to you aunty, why are you crying so much)

Lady - Mai aur meri beti 8 din pehle yahi par soye the. Raat ko achanak ek gaadi par 2 log aaye aur meri beti ko uthaakar le gaye. Mai kuch karu usse pehle woh log meri beti ko lekar chale gaye.

( I and my daughter were sleeping here 8 days before. Suddenly, in the middle of night , 2 guyz came and took my daughter away. I couldn't do anything.)

After listening to this I was completely blank. I didn't know what to tell her. I could only see that lady crying infront me. I was helpless.

I- Aunty, aap ne kch kiya nai kya? Police mai complaint kee aapne?

(Aunty, have you reported this at police station)

Lady - Arre beta, police hamari kaha sunti hai. Mai gayi thee police station, maine bola unko. Mere pass meri beti ka photo bhi nai hai. Unhone bola ke photo ke bina hum kaise dhunde tumhari beti ko.

( I went to the police station, but they don't listen to poor people like us. I don't have a photograph of my daughter and they told it's not possible to find your daughter without her photograph.)

I - Aunty aap tension mat lo, aapki beti mil jayegi.

(Aunty don't be tensed,your daughter will come back)

After listening to that lady, I was awestruck. And yes I gave her my number and asked her to call me if she needs anything.

No, I am not here to blame police or administration of justice. What makes me sad is that how some humans have become so heartless. What makes them to do such acts, what compels them to commit such things ?

Todd Allen,4y,What do you think about the Louisiana police officer now being fired for his Facebook post about AOC?,"So, let’s be clear on what exactly was said. Not hard to find.[1]

He said she “needs a round, and not the kind she used to serve”. That’s not hard to interpret. He was advocating the murder of a public official.

Now, he has the right to say that, so long as he’s not directly threatening to do it himself. But that means he will not be arrested or prosecuted for saying it. It doesn’t mean he can’t be fired for saying it. If I walk into work and call my boss a fucking moron, I won’t be arrested or prosecuted for that, but I damn sure can get fired for it, and the First Amendment will not keep that from happening.

How many times have cops complained about people who advocated the murder of cops (who are, incidentally, also public officials)? Would he be happy about it if another cop were saying he ought to be shot?

If you’re going to say things like that in public, well, there might be a reaction to it. You won’t get arrested, but that doesn’t mean there will be no consequences whatsoever. In this case, he embarrassed his employer by saying something like that, and got fired for it.

Think before you post.

Digital B,19h,Can you list the different ranks on Reddit?,"Navigating the Reddit Ranks: From Karma to Karma Chameleons

Ah, Reddit! The land of endless rabbit holes, hilarious memes, and passionate debates. But beyond the memes lies a complex system of ranks and karma. Let's demystify them, fellow digital enthusiast!

1. Karma: The lifeblood of Reddit, karma reflects your contributions to the community. Each upvote adds karma, while downvotes subtract it. Higher karma unlocks access to certain subreddits and increases your overall influence.

Examples:

Comment karma: Earned through upvoted comments.
Post karma: Earned through upvoted posts.
Link karma: Earned through upvoted links you share.

2. Awards: Reddit awards are virtual tokens gifted by users to appreciate exceptional content. Awards range from the free ""Helpful"" to the prestigious Platinum, each carrying different karma bonuses.

3. User Flairs: Subreddits often assign custom flairs to users based on their karma or contributions. These flairs can range from simple badges to humorous titles, reflecting your standing within the community.

4. Moderators: The guardians of each subreddit, moderators enforce the rules, remove spam, and curate content. They wield immense power, shaping the subreddit's direction.

5. Subreddit Ranks: Some subreddits have their own internal ranking systems. For example, r/AskReddit uses ""Top Contributor"" and ""Karma Whore"" flairs to acknowledge prolific commenters.

Vinay Chandekar,Sun,How can users on Reddit know if something has been reported or flagged?,"On Reddit, there isn't a direct way for users to know if a specific post or comment has been reported or flagged. Reddit keeps the reporting process anonymous to encourage users to report content without fear of retaliation. When a user reports a post or comment, it goes through the platform's moderation system for review.

If a post or comment violates Reddit's community guidelines or rules, the moderators may take appropriate action, such as removing the content or issuing warnings to the user who posted it. The original reporter usually remains anonymous in this process.

However, Reddit provides some general indicators that a post or comment may have been reported or flagged:

Comment Scores:If a comment receives a high number of downvotes, it might indicate that users in the community find the content objectionable. However, downvotes alone don't necessarily mean the content has been reported.
Post Removal:If a post is removed by moderators, it could be due to a report or a violation of community guidelines. The removal may be accompanied by a message from the moderators explaining the reason.
Flair or Tags:Some subreddits use flairs or tags to indicate the status of a post. For example, a post might be tagged as ""Reported"" or ""Under Review"" to inform users about its status.

It's important to note that the absence of these indicators doesn't necessarily mean a post or comment hasn't been reported. Moderators and administrators handle reported content privately to ensure the integrity of the reporting system.

If you are a moderator of a subreddit, you can check the mod queue to see reported items and take appropriate action.

Eisenhauer Kelly,Nov 28,My Instagram account is disabled and I didn't do anything wrong. What can I do? And what caused this mistake?,"It depends on they reasons they gave you but HEY! there’s still hope,

Many individuals tend to make a common mistake when they face a ban on Instagram, they tend to overreact” Hey c’mon don’t stress.

They often make the situation worse by sending multiple messages to Instagram or using random email addresses to contact them.

However, this approach can only trigger Instagram's algorithm to detect suspicious activity and mistake it Spam actions.

It's important to remember that Instagram's community is managed by algorithms and analytics, not real humans. Therefore, decisions are made automatically based on User actions

TRY THIS INSTEAD,

If your account was removed due to a simple issue like a poor internet connection or changing IP address, you can try resolving it by sending a message to Instagram's support team at support@instagram.com. They may be able to assist you but it’s not always guaranteed.
: PHP, rust++ and meta experts
Another option is to consult with an attorney, depending on your state and the applicable laws. You can file a complaint for business negligence, and you can find local attorneys through their websites.

I’ll put the links in the comment below because of Quora’s policies,

It's worth noting that this approach may take time and does not guarantee a definite outcome.

I also gathered some info on some topics related to contacting Instagram.

How do I contact Instagram through Facebook or Instant Messenger?
How do you contact Instagram for recovering my account?

Ayush Kumar,Mon,How can one effectively promote posts on Reddit?,"Promoting posts on Reddit effectively requires a blend of strategy, authenticity, and community engagement. Here's how you can do it:

1. Find the Right Subreddit: Think of subreddits as different neighborhoods within the vast Reddit community. Look for ones that match your post's topic and where your target audience hangs out.

2. Create Compelling Content: Just like in real life, first impressions matter on Reddit. Craft posts that are informative, entertaining, or thought-provoking. Visual content like images or videos tends to catch eyes, but well-written text posts can also make a splash.

3. Play by the Rules: Each subreddit has its own set of rules, like house rules in a game. Take the time to read and understand them to avoid getting your post removed or facing backlash from the community.

4. Get in the Mix: Reddit isn't just about shouting into the void – it's about joining conversations. Be an active member of the subreddit by commenting on others' posts, sharing insights, and showing genuine interest in the community.

5. Timing Matters: Timing can make or break a post. Try to post when the subreddit is most active to maximize visibility. Experiment with different times to see what works best for your audience.

6. Craft Catchy Titles: Think of your post title as the headline of a newspaper – it needs to grab attention. Be descriptive, intriguing, and avoid being overly promotional.

7. Consider Paid Options: If you're looking to give your post an extra boost, Reddit offers advertising options. While they require a budget, they can help target specific audiences and increase visibility.

8. Keep an Eye on Analytics: Reddit provides tools to track the performance of your posts. Pay attention to metrics like upvotes, comments, and shares to gauge engagement and adjust your strategy accordingly.

9. Stay Genuine: Authenticity is key on Reddit. Avoid coming across as too salesy or spammy – instead, focus on providing value to the community and building genuine connections.

By following these tips and actively participating in the Reddit community, you can effectively promote your posts and make a positive impact on the platform.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ihpz1vtlw8gm342n', 'title': 'How can one effectively promote posts on Reddit?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Promoting posts on Reddit effectively requires a blend of strategy, authenticity, and community engagement.

Play by the Rules: Each subreddit has its own set of rules, like house rules in a game. Take the time to read and understand them to avoid getting your post removed or facing backlash from the community.\n\n4. Get in the Mix: Reddit isn't just about shouting into the void – it's about joining conversations. Be an active member of the subreddit by commenting on others' posts, sharing insights, and showing genuine interest in the community.\n\n5. Timing Matters: Timing can make or break a post. Try to post when the subreddit is most active to maximize visibility. Experiment with different times to see what works best for your audience.\n\n6. Craft Catchy Titles: Think of your post title as the headline of a newspaper – it needs to grab attention. Be descriptive, intriguing, and avoid being overly promotional.\n\n7. Consider Paid Options: If you're looking to give your post an extra boost, Reddit offers advertising options. While they require a budget, they can help target specific audiences and increase visibility.\n\n8. Keep an Eye on Analytics: Reddit provides tools to track the performance of your posts. Pay attention to metrics like upvotes, comments, and shares to gauge engagement and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n9. Stay Genuine: Authenticity is key on Reddit. Avoid coming across as too salesy or spammy – instead, focus on providing value to the community and building genuine connections.\n\nBy following these tips and actively participating in the Reddit community, you can effectively promote your posts and make a positive impact on the platform."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Zola Curimao,Dec 25,Instagram said they disabled my account for violating their terms on usage. How long will my account stay disabled for?,"No one knows my friend, if your wait time is longer than 2 hours, it should be something to worry about.

Instagram support center doesn’t give two fukks about your account like that, you must have to go through some level of effort to get it back. Most times people who spend their entire time waiting never get a respond at all.

It’s rational I believe, and only the strong people win actually, as a matter of fact over waiting can hurt your case only rather than helping it. No bother, it takes just a single trigger for the push command the AI takes-away your account

This year I was removed twice and this was unlawful and not ethical. But who’s to blame for not having it sort? Me!

let’s forget about the help articles the are no better than flaws of art sitting still and hoping to waste you more time on their own projects. However Instagram’s algorithm doesn’t see it this way as it only increases their sales and revenue because you commit more time by adding numbers to there flowcharts.

Doing the brains” researched a lot of articles online and found the best explanation to my own problems, “theory solved”.

I felt honored! and feel the need to now have control on my finger tips, without spanning across multiple web articles trying to look geek!

Across all the problems using expertise advice was my permanent mark and solution

people who know better than I do can mitigate their problem properly

Let’s take an example “the successful businesses”.

do you think that they waste time looking around articles?

Let’s put the fact straight, they are monumentally successfully because they stick to getting their goals ahead and understand the cost of doing business.

So save this for later you might need it in one of your books,

You might want to read this article: My Instagram got Deactivated for No Reasons (Here's How I Recovered It Back

Lastly I’ll put out,

The common problems that violates the rules of Instagram:

Multiple account creation
Sending spam messages
Sending buses and pornographic images
Impersonation
Posing as threat/ political violence

To mention but a few…

Justin Vargas,Oct 3,How do I verify Instagram if it won't send me code?,"If you're experiencing difficulties receiving the verification code from Instagram, rest assured that you're not alone. Many individuals face the same issue. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the problem:

1. Check your email's ""Spam"" or ""Junk"" folder: Sometimes, the confirmation emails end up in these folders. Make sure to check them within your email account.

2. Verify your phone number and email address: Double-check that you've entered the correct phone number and email address associated with your Instagram account.

3. Wait for a few minutes: Occasionally, network problems can cause delays in receiving the verification code. Give it a little time and then try again.

4. Resend the verification code: Return to the Instagram app and select the option to resend the verification code.

5. Review blocking rules: Ensure that your email settings or phone carrier aren't blocking texts from Instagram.

6. Restart your device: Sometimes, a quick restart of your mobile device can resolve minor issues.

7. Try an alternative verification method: If possible, attempt to receive the code through both your email address and phone number.

8. Contact Instagram support: If none of the above steps work, you can reach out to Instagram's customer service for further assistance.

Devorah Ek,Dec 24,Is Instagram's contact email: support@Instagram.com?,"Yes this is the official support email of Instagram, although it no longer receives complaints and forwards complaints to the support articles,

It’s a matter of time that meta falls flat on their chin

Even when I tried to reach them about a business ads account they wouldn’t respond me. I eventually found out it’s long been stopped and only not just their live chat stopped working, but they don’t have the capacity to handle issues because of the lack of staffs.

Best case scenario for me I had an expert do it for me rather than support from traditional method,

If you focus more on the live chat side of things you might not get your issue resolved I can attest to that.

Meta is slowing down their support usage and just last month over 100k complaints were dismissed,

Is that a good thing for consumer confidence? the answer is no’

Support systems like Flickr and Twitter are doing great in this area,

I can consciously say that it’s not a good thing as a business to put your eggs in one basket.

The likelihood of speaking to a live chat representative is very low and people prefer using non traditional methods at this point.

Eileen M. Gormley,Sun,How can you be sure the man is real and not a scammer? He is not found on any other social media sites or dating sites.,"Okay, it’s common sense time.

Is he local to you? If he claims to be living on a different continent, he’s a scammer. Because you should not have “popped up when he was searching for an old friend” if he wasn’t looking for someone where you live.

If he is local, ask him things like which is his favourite pub or cafe? Locals know the good ones, scammers have to take a blind stab at google. Ask about where he went to school and college. Look for mutual friends.

And if he is local, arrange to meet him. Pick a venue like Starbucks or McDonalds, somewhere you can have a coffee and chat without any commitment or personal information. You’ll know pretty quickly if he’s why he says.

I actually have a lot of fun with the scammers. They tell me they were looking for “Mary Smith of 1 Main Street, Dublin” and I tell them I know her, she’s my next door neighbour.

Md. Hasan Miqah,Feb 16,What makes people consider Reddit as the best website?,"Reddit is not a website on Fiverr.🎍 Reddit is a separate platform entirely, known for its vast array of communities (subreddits) where users can discuss various topics, share content, ask questions, and engage with others. Fiverr, on the other hand, is a freelancing platform where users can buy and sell services, such as graphic design, writing, programming, and more.

It's possible that you may have come across Fiverr gigs offering services related to Reddit, such as promoting content, managing Reddit accounts, or providing advice on Reddit marketing strategies. In such cases, people may consider these gigs valuable because they can help businesses or individuals leverage the Reddit platform effectively for marketing, promotion, or community engagement purposes.

However, it's important to note that opinions about the quality and effectiveness of services offered on Fiverr can vary widely depending on individual experiences and preferences. While some people may find certain Reddit-related services on Fiverr to be helpful, others may have different opinions or experiences. As with any service on Fiverr, it's essential to thoroughly research and vet sellers before making a purchase to ensure they meet your specific needs and expectations.

Harder Eric,Nov 27,Are those companies that restore your disabled Instagram account any good?,"Based on my own experiences,

I've encountered some trustworthy organizations after being scammed multiple times.

Just like any other business, there are dishonest scams out there preying on people who desperately need genuine help.

I made the mistake of not researching the entities I dealt with in the past due to my own naivety, and I learned the hard way.

But it's all part of life's lessons.

These fraudulent organizations would often demand payments ahead without doing anything.

In contrast, reputable companies have transparent processes and won't charge you upfront for bogus fees. Although they may allow you to make a deposit, such as using USDT.

To identify unreliable organizations, watch out for signs like using mediums such as Gmail instead of having a proper website and lacking proven track records.

To assess credibility, it's important to diligently search for what other users are saying about them.

Check for user reviews on blogs and see if they have social media accounts on platforms like YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook.

Recovering an account is indeed possible and I am a living proof. anyone claiming otherwise lack software knowledge or expertise.

Thanks to the implementation of projects like Rust and other open-source initiatives,

Shirley John,Dec 13,"When my account gets disabled on Instagram, how long will it be disabled or will I have to do an appeal for it?","Consider giving this a try instead:

Take a moment to review both your email and the website for troubleshooting insights or information regarding the disabling of your account.

Here are some key points I've gathered:

Question: Why has my account been disabled even though I haven't violated any rules?

This typically revolves around reported activities or posts on Instagram's platform linked to your account. You can appeal two types of content decisions on the oversight board: those related to your content or those concerning the content of others that you reported.

How to appeal Instagram's content decision to the oversight board:

If Instagram deems an activity or post as unethical or against their rules based on a previous report, they may decide to disable your account. To appeal, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your profile by tapping your profile picture in the bottom right.

2. Tap on the top right, then select Settings and Privacy.

3. Under More info and support, tap Help.

4. Go to Support Requests and then Violations.

5. Open the decision update you received.

6. At the bottom, tap More Options.

7. Tap Request Review and then Close.

You can monitor the status of your review request by checking Account Status or viewing the violation in your Support Inbox.

Sonia Qasim,Feb 15,How do I find all of my photos if my Facebook account is banned?,"Unfortunately, recovering all your photos after a Facebook ban can be difficult or impossible depending on the situation:

If your account is temporarily disabled: You might be able to regain access and download your photos through Facebook's data download tool.
If your account is permanently banned: Facebook typically retains limited data for banned accounts, and photo recovery is unlikely.

Here are your options:

Appeal the ban: If you believe the ban is incorrect, try appealing through Facebook's system. If successful, you'll regain access to your photos.
Check other platforms: Did you share photos on other platforms like Instagram or Google Photos? These might have copies.
Contact friends and family: Ask friends and family who you shared photos with if they have copies they can share.

Remember: Respecting Facebook's terms of service is crucial. Trying to bypass the ban through unauthorized methods can be risky and against their policies.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bn60umekv1x95jtl', 'title': 'How do I find all of my photos if my Facebook account is banned?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Unfortunately, recovering all your photos after a Facebook ban can be difficult or impossible depending on the situation:\n\nIf your account is temporarily disabled: You might be able to regain access and download your photos through Facebook's data download tool.\nIf your account is permanently banned: Facebook typically retains limited data for banned accounts, and photo recovery is unlikely.\n\nHere are your options:\n\nAppeal the ban: If you believe the ban is incorrect, try appealing through Facebook's system.

Sonia Qasim,Sun,How does Reddit determine which users are shadowbanned and what can be done to address it?,"Reddit hasn't officially acknowledged shadowbanning as a practice, so the exact criteria remain unclear. However, based on community observations and user experiences, here's what we know:

Possible Triggers for Shadowbanning:

Repeated rule violations: Violating subreddit or Reddit-wide rules frequently could trigger a shadowban.
Abusive behavior: Harassment, spam, or other forms of disruptive behavior might lead to shadowbanning.
Suspicious activity: Automated bots, vote manipulation, or other suspicious activity could flag your account.
Subreddit moderation: Individual subreddit moderators might implement shadowbans within their communities.

Addressing Shadowbanning:

Unfortunately, due to its unofficial nature, addressing a shadowban directly can be challenging. However, here are some options:

Confirm the Shadowban: Use tools like r/ShadowBan or third-party websites to check if you're shadowbanned.
Identify the Source: Consider if the shadowban might be from a specific subreddit or Reddit itself.
Respect Rules & Guidelines: Review Reddit's and relevant subreddit's rules to ensure you're compliant.
Appeal to Moderators: If your shadowban seems unfair, try politely contacting the subreddit moderators and explaining your situation.
Wait it Out: Shadowbans may be temporary, so waiting and continuing responsible behavior might resolve the issue.

Key Points:

Shadowbanning remains a disputed topic on Reddit, with no official confirmation or clear guidelines.
Identifying the exact cause of a shadowban can be difficult.
Focus on understanding and respecting community rules to minimize the risk of facing any restrictions.
If you believe your shadowban is unfair, attempt respectful communication with moderators or consider waiting it out.

Remember, shadowbanning is often implemented to address problematic behavior. Reflect on your online conduct and strive for positive interactions within the platform.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6qzk8fs9xhlogapd', 'title': 'How does Reddit determine which users are shadowbanned and what can be done to address it?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Reddit hasn't officially acknowledged shadowbanning as a practice, so the exact criteria remain unclear.

Sonia Qasim,Sun,How can you determine who has shadowbanned you on Reddit?,"Unfortunately, there's no foolproof way to determine who specifically shadowbanned you on Reddit as the platform itself doesn't disclose this information. However, several methods can help you confirm if you're shadowbanned and provide some clues about the possible source:

Confirming Shadowban:

r/ShadowBan: Visit https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/
 and create a new post. A bot will analyze your account and tell you if you're shadowbanned and list your recent posts/comments (with visibility status).
Third-party tools: Websites like Reddit Shadowban Tester
 offer similar checks, though their accuracy may vary.
Engagement: If your posts and comments receive no upvotes, downvotes, or replies despite regular activity, it's a strong indicator of a shadowban.

Identifying Potential Sources:

Subreddit moderators: If your shadowban seems limited to a specific subreddit, the moderators might be responsible. Check subreddit rules for potential violations or contact them directly (but avoid accusing them).
Reddit admins: In rare cases, Reddit admins might directly shadowban for severe rule violations. This often comes with a notification, though, so you'd likely be aware.

Remember:

Shadowbanning isn't officially acknowledged by Reddit, so these methods offer educated guesses rather than definitive answers.
Focus on understanding what might have triggered the shadowban and avoid accusatory approaches.
If you believe the shadowban is unfair, consider appealing to the subreddit moderators or Reddit admins (through the official channels).

It's important to note that simply being downvoted or having posts removed due to rule violations doesn't necessarily mean you're shadowbanned. Shadowbans are a specific measure that hides your content from public view, so use the methods above to confirm and proceed cautiously when seeking potential sources.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/giarx1n4wc9vzkby', 'title': 'How can you determine who has shadowbanned you on Reddit?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Unfortunately, there's no foolproof way to determine who specifically shadowbanned you on Reddit as the platform itself doesn't disclose this information.

Rohit Singh Jadhav,17m,What don't some people like about Reddit?,"While Reddit has a large and dedicated user base, there are some aspects of the platform that some people may not like:

1. **Complexity and Learning Curve**: Reddit can be overwhelming for newcomers due to its complex interface and unique culture. Understanding how subreddits, upvotes, downvotes, and karma work may take time, and some users may find it difficult to navigate the platform effectively.

2. **Anonymity and Trolls**: The anonymity afforded by Reddit can sometimes lead to negative behavior, such as trolling, harassment, or hate speech. Some users may encounter hostile or offensive comments, particularly in larger and more contentious subreddits.

3. **Echo Chambers and Polarization**: Like other social media platforms, Reddit can sometimes foster echo chambers where users are exposed only to opinions and viewpoints that align with their own. This can lead to polarization and reinforce biases, making it challenging to engage in constructive dialogue with those who hold different perspectives.

4. **Moderation and Censorship Concerns**: Reddit's system of community moderation, while generally effective, can sometimes be inconsistent or controversial. Users may feel that certain subreddits are unfairly moderated or that their content is subject to censorship or removal without clear justification.

5. **Privacy and Data Security**: As with any online platform, there are concerns about privacy and data security on Reddit. While Reddit takes measures to protect user data, some users may be uncomfortable with the amount of personal information shared on the platform or the potential for data breaches or leaks.

6. **Time Sink and Addiction**: Reddit's endless stream of content and communities can be addictive, leading some users to spend excessive amounts of time browsing the site. This can detract from productivity and real-life relationships if not managed responsibly.

7. **Commercialization and Ads**: Some users may dislike the increasing presence of advertisements and sponsored content on Reddit. While ads help support the platform financially, they can be intrusive and disrupt the user experience for some.

Some users may encounter hostile or offensive comments, particularly in larger and more contentious subreddits.\n\n3. **Echo Chambers and Polarization**: Like other social media platforms, Reddit can sometimes foster echo chambers where users are exposed only to opinions and viewpoints that align with their own. This can lead to polarization and reinforce biases, making it challenging to engage in constructive dialogue with those who hold different perspectives.\n\n4. **Moderation and Censorship Concerns**: Reddit's system of community moderation, while generally effective, can sometimes be inconsistent or controversial. Users may feel that certain subreddits are unfairly moderated or that their content is subject to censorship or removal without clear justification.\n\n5. **Privacy and Data Security**: As with any online platform, there are concerns about privacy and data security on Reddit. While Reddit takes measures to protect user data, some users may be uncomfortable with the amount of personal information shared on the platform or the potential for data breaches or leaks.\n\n6. **Time Sink and Addiction**: Reddit's endless stream of content and communities can be addictive, leading some users to spend excessive amounts of time browsing the site. This can detract from productivity and real-life relationships if not managed responsibly.\n\n7. **Commercialization and Ads**: Some users may dislike the increasing presence of advertisements and sponsored content on Reddit. While ads help support the platform financially, they can be intrusive and disrupt the user experience for some.\n\nOverall, while Reddit offers a wealth of content and community interaction, it also has its drawbacks and challenges that some users may find off-putting or concerning."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
