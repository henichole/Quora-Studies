Navin Kumar,5y,Why should we read books?,"Let me keep it simple.

Have you read Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill?

Pages: 176

Wordcount: 89,175

An average person with a reading speed of 250 WPM can finish reading this book in 6 hours.

But it took 20 years for the author to research and to finish the book.

I think you can understand now. You can almost gain the knowledge and experiences of a person who made researches for 20 years in just 6 hours.

Whenever you read a good book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light.

Franklin Veaux,1y,"How did you like Fahrenheit 451? I just read it and I was extremely disappointed. To me, it felt like an attempt at similar things as other Dystopian novels, but in a more poorly executed fashion. It was like a bad movie adaptation of itself.","Fahrenheit 451 has the same problem Neuromancer has: modern readers can never get the full impact, because both these books created what went on to be cliches.

Yes, today Fahrenheit 451 feels generic and formulaic…

…because it invented that formula.

Like Neuromancer, it effectively created the elements that would later become tropes in the genre. It feels generic and cliched because a lot of fiction that came after copied it (sometimes worse), not because it copied other fiction. Yes, it looks derivative to modern eyes, because so much fiction derives from it.

Franklin Veaux,5y,How do hackers know when they have been caught (I'm writing a scene for a novel)?,"Usually, they know when the FBI shows up at their door.

I’m serious. It’s not like Hollywood movies or badly-written TV shows when a red “warning!” alert appears on the screen with a countdown timer, and the hacker says “Oh no!

Usually, they’re caught weeks, months, or years after the hack, when forensic IT specialists for the FBI or some other law enforcement agency do a post-mortem on the attack, carefully and painstakingly reading hundreds (or thousands) of pages of log files, comparing the attack to other attacks, decompiling attack code, and doing a thousand other tedious things that all take time.

Vans Grimiere,Updated 5y,"Is it possible for an entire book to be written so that at the very last phrase, the meaning of the rest of the novel changes entirely?","Would you mind if it did by the “last chapter” rather than the “last sentence”? Here it is:

“Si” by Bob Ong

It’s published last 2014. A short read with only 185 pages and large font size. Sadly, this book is only available in our language (Filipino). (There's no official nor fan translation available anywhere, my bros and sis). What made this book interesting is that the story is in reverse order.

The book starts with chapter “72” and ends with chapter “0”. Each chapter tells the most significant event in EVERY YEAR of the MC’s life, from when he’s 72 years old up to when he’s still inside his mom’s womb (0 yrs old). And you’re supposed to read it that way.

[Spoiler-Alert]
So what’s special about the ending?

The book is all about a man’s life. I mean, everything. It is a story about love, family, friendship, life during WW 2 and every other things that everyone may have once or wished to experience. The story developed with a magical feels to it because of the reverse order that would make you feel nostalgic in every chapter.

It’s as if you’re looking through the eyes of an old man recalling his past before he leaves this world peacefully.

But once you reach chapter “0” where he’s still not born, you’ll realize how wrong you were. Here’s an excerpt from that chapter:

“Ngunit tulad ng dati ay binulungan ako ni Ina. At sa dulo ng bawat luha ay muling nakiusap na patawarin ko siya. Nagsumamo ako. Sa huling pagkakataon . At ipinagmakaawa ang karapatan ng aking buhay”

Translation: “But just like before, my Mom whispered to me. And in every drop of tears, she’d ask me to forgive her. I plead. For the last time. I begged for my right to live.”

And the last few sentences of the book described how he slowly lost his senses. From how it’s getting quieter, how it’s getting colder, how it’s getting darker.

It squeezed my heart to pulp as it only implies that: He was aborted.

The book was NEVER about how a man struggled and lived his life BUT about a life that someone would have had if he was given the chance to live.

It also made me facepalm ‘cause I never saw that coming despite all the clues like:

Snow. Philippines is a tropical country meaning there’s no snow here. The snowflakes on the book cover and the scenes were there’s snow symbolizes imagination in our context.

The Title. Which is “Si”. Si is a Filipino article (like a, an, the) that ALWAYS comes before a name. (Ex. Si Vans, Si Elon) So why only “Si ____”? Because the MC never had a name. Why no name? Because it was our parents who give us a name when we are born. He never had a name because he was never born.

MC’s name was never mentioned. Because he didn’t have one. Also, lack of name symbolizes his lack of identity or place in the real world.

The Overview. It’s comprised of a dialogue that goes like…

MC: “When will I meet you?”

Victoria (love interest): “Once you’re born”

-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

We all knew how annoying was the trope “It never happened” but this book’s message saved it from that.

It’s true that our life depends on the choices we’ll make. That our destiny is in our own hands. But none of that would have mattered if our parents never let us live in the first place.

The story developed with a magical feels to it because of the reverse order that would make you feel nostalgic in every chapter.\n\nIt’s as if you’re looking through the eyes of an old man recalling his past before he leaves this world peacefully.\n\nBut once you reach chapter “0” where he’s still not born, you’ll realize how wrong you were. Here’s an excerpt from that chapter:\n\n“Ngunit tulad ng dati ay binulungan ako ni Ina. At sa dulo ng bawat luha ay muling nakiusap na patawarin ko siya. Nagsumamo ako. Sa huling pagkakataon . At ipinagmakaawa ang karapatan ng aking buhay”\n\nTranslation: “But just like before, my Mom whispered to me. And in every drop of tears, she’d ask me to forgive her. I plead. For the last time. I begged for my right to live.”\n\nAnd the last few sentences of the book described how he slowly lost his senses. From how it’s getting quieter, how it’s getting colder, how it’s getting darker.\n\nIt squeezed my heart to pulp as it only implies that: He was aborted.\n\nThe book was NEVER about how a man struggled and lived his life BUT about a life that someone would have had if he was given the chance to live.\n\nIt also made me facepalm ‘cause I never saw that coming despite all the clues like:\n\nSnow. Philippines is a tropical country meaning there’s no snow here. The snowflakes on the book cover and the scenes were there’s snow symbolizes imagination in our context.\n\nThe Title. Which is “Si”. Si is a Filipino article (like a, an, the) that ALWAYS comes before a name. (Ex. Si Vans, Si Elon) So why only “Si ____”? Because the MC never had a name. Why no name? Because it was our parents who give us a name when we are born. He never had a name because he was never born.\n\nMC’s name was never mentioned. Because he didn’t have one. Also, lack of name symbolizes his lack of identity or place in the real world.\n\nThe Overview. It’s comprised of a dialogue that goes like…\n\nMC: “When will I meet you?”\n\nVictoria (love interest): “Once you’re born”\n\n-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nWe all knew how annoying was the trope “It never happened” but this book’s message saved it from that.\n\nIt’s true that our life depends on the choices we’ll make. That our destiny is in our own hands. But none of that would have mattered if our parents never let us live in the first place.\n\nPS: This is my first post in Quora. I hope I made sense…\n\nPPS: I am a very timid person and this surge of upvotes and comments made me shake invariably in my insides**"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.93955
Shubham KP,1y,What book are you reading now?,"My sister was struggling to get a job.

According to me, every girl should be independent. Every girl needs to earn their own money.

Girls don’t need to bear any domestic abuse just because she’s not earning. Girls should have a job so that they don’t become a burden to anyone at any point in life.

I told my father, strictly, that didi is not getting married unless she gets a job. Thankfully, this year she cleared a government exam and now she’s a Rural Agriculture Extention Officer. This is just the beginning for her, I hope, and she gets more in her life.

At that time, I came across a beautiful strong woman from Quora. I messaged her, personally, and thanked her as she was brave enough to share her story to motivate others.

I kept pushing my sister because of her. I wanted her to become as strong as that Quoran.

The moment didi’s results were out, I was so thankful to that Quoran...

Franklin Veaux,7y,Should I write a novel based on elves if I haven't read Tolkien?,"Should I write a novel based on elves if I haven't read Tolkien?

Oh my God yes. In fact, please do.

I’m serious. I would strongly encourage people who haven’t read Tolkien to write novels based on elves.

Don’t misunderstand me, Tolkien is brilliant. The Silmarillion is one of my favorite books.

But the problem is, he’s a bit too brilliant. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have cast a very long shadow over the landscape of fantasy, and as a result, it’s almost impossible for novels about elves not to feel derivative. Tolkien defined elves and orcs and wizards for at least two generations of readers, and writers. Maybe more.

I would love to see novels that revisit these ideas and characters that aren’t derivative of Tolkien’s work. So, please do. I for one will read it!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/d0yabt5lwpvm486c', 'title': ""Should I write a novel based on elves if I haven't read Tolkien?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9881, 'ai': 0.0119}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Should I write a novel based on elves if I haven't read Tolkien?\n\nOh my God yes.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,4y,What is the most life changing book you've ever read?,"I don’t write in “self improvement” topic, but there is a first for everything. Two of my favorite books that I read together are: “How to get whatever you want” and “Think and Grow Rich”. I read these as a 17 year old and they were phenomenal. I tried to apply a lot of it during that time and had quite a bit of fortune implementing them. How to Get Whatever You Want
 and Think and Grow Rich
.

The key concepts like “just show up” and “just ask” —are so simple and yet so powerful.

I will give you examples of how I used it.

I was in my second year of college when we had the annual programming contest to select the top team to go to the prestigious ACM ICPC. I was preparing for the contest since the time I joined college. I led a team that was short of 1 person [he had to leave another contest in the last minute] and we tied up for the top slot. The other team were one year senior to us and the college gave them the slot to go to the Asia regionals in IIT Kanpur. I didn’t like the idea of seniority just used to break the tie.

I would have given up if not for that crazy book above. I just explored for sometime the other alternatives in the days before social media and found an Asia regionals happened in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I just found out the organiser’s number and called him out of the blue [when it cost over $1/min for the international call from a public booth and I had very little money]. I convinced him to take our team from India. I went through all the rules and he could not find any hole in my argument. He was more amused by the strange request from a teenager from abroad and okayed my proposal.

And then came the task of convincing my teammates that Bangladesh was a safe country to go to. We had a trip of our lifetimes taking a 3.5 day travel one way from the southern part of India to Bangladesh over 2 trains and a bus. It was an amazing experience interacting with everyone there and although we could not make it to the world finals we got home with a honorable mention for being in the top 10%. I should have tried the following 2 years too, but somehow never participated [and of course I regret that now for not showing up].

From sitting in a small town in the middle of nowhere in a day without all the information revolution to getting there was a big win for me.

Two months later I did an even crazier thing. I was in New Delhi attending a college competition. I got a strange idea to walk up to the Rashtrapati Bhavan [President’s palace] to get a meeting with the President of the largest democracy. In an another time I would not have done that, but I was crazy in the power of asking. It could not harm, right?

I just showed up and asked. The secretary thought it was funny that a teenager was walking up to get an appointment with the President of India. She still passed up my request to President’s PA. A day later my relative got the call that the President wanted to talk to me. He was genuinely curious about a teenager who came all the way from the southern part of India and had gumption to write to him.

That led to the greatest day in my life: Why is Abdul Kalam widely loved and respected by everyone? — where I got a 40 minute one-on-one with the President and got another such meeting just 6 months later.

A year later I was applying for grad school. I got an admission, but without a scholarship. I called up a professor and explained the situation. He not only gave the scholarship that enabled me to go to gradschool, but someone who is still in touch with me after so many year.

I applied the same principles to a lot of smaller successes too — from getting airline seats upgraded to getting into contests. Once I was in Linuxcon where there was a Linux quiz & raffle. I answered the quiz and they asked us to come for a raffle in the afternoon. I usually don’t go for this and thought there will be a big crowd. When I showed up there was just 1 other guy and I had a 50% chance of winning. And winning I did of a good laptop that I immediately sold on eBay. All I had to do was just show up. Another time I saw a startup competition going on. I was in for an another event and asked if I could pitch. The qualifiers were already over a long time ago, but they still let me pitch in the finals. I strangely won the pitch prize for someone who knew about the contest only 30 min before.

After I graduated from college, I failed to use many of the principles as I grew to think that “self improvement” stuff is just icky. That means that I also went back to my old ways of being too shy to ask for stuff and thus went on a period of plateau with no major success in life. Now putting those principles back to motion. If you aim for the right thing, be reasonable, persistent and show up everytime you could very likely get that thing.

We often think of success as a cut throat race where you race against thousands. Often what I found was success was a race where only a handful even show up — others are either lazy, unaware or too shy to even ask to get in. Winning often happen in contests that most don’t even know exists.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/540zlpfkeai9j6hq', 'title': ""What is the most life changing book you've ever read?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9011, 'ai': 0.0989}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I don’t write in “self improvement” topic, but there is a first for everything.

Chris O'Leary,3y,What is the last book you tried to read that was so bad you just could not finish it?,"That would be “Inferno” by Dan Brown.

Like most people, I got turned on to Dan Brown because of The DaVinci Code and followed back around to read Angels and Demons. When it came out, I read the Lost Symbol too.

I enjoyed the first two as good light reading. The third just started stretching the premise of a hero symbologist a little too far for my taste, but it wasn’t so bad that I didn’t finish it.

When Inferno came out, I bought it, hoping it would get back to the quality of at least Angels and Demons.

As the premise started to unfold, I tried to keep with it, but, my brow a bit furrowed, I turned my head to Dr. Scott, my wife, and asked for clarification…

“Isn’t Plague Bacterial” Can’t it be cured with antibiotics?”

“Of course,” she replied.

I tossed the book aside and never picked it up again.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fxr6h2agenlktjm9', 'title': 'What is the last book you tried to read that was so bad you just could not finish it?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'That would be “Inferno” by Dan Brown.\n\nLike most people, I got turned on to Dan Brown because of The DaVinci Code and followed back around to read Angels and Demons.

Franklin Veaux,Sat,"In my novel, should I use “dinner” or “supper” to refer to the third meal?","Dinner and supper don’t mean the same thing.

Which one you use should depend on where your novel is set. As a general guide:

“Dinner” means the largest meal of the day. In some parts of the US, that’s the midday meal, particularly in the rural Midwest. When I lived in a farm in Nebraska, we had breakfast, dinner, and supper. The “main” meal was dinner; supper was a lighter meal.

On the coasts, and in every large town or city I’ve lived in, it’s breakfast, lunch, dinner. The midday meal, lunch, is typically smaller than the evening meal, dinner.

So if your novel is set in New York City? Breakfast, lunch, dinner. If your novel is set in Venango, Nebraska? Breakfast, dinner, supper.

Murphy Barrett,4y,In my new science fiction novel I'm debating whether the bridge of a military spaceship should have carpet or not. Is there any good reason for the ship to use carpet over hard flooring or vice versa?,"What sort of culture does your military have?

Firstly, there’s no technical reason why a starship can’t have carpeting. If you can build a starship, you can carpet it.

So what sort of look and feel do you want your ship to have?

or

For reference, this is a real warship bridge.

HMAS Brisbane

Today, carpet is a serious fire-hazard, which is why you don’t find it on warships. But this is science fiction. Your culture has developed fire-resistant carpeting. And it’s not even made of asbestos! Yay!

Carpeting is comfortable, and dampens sounds. It may make your warship more pleasant to live on, if crew aren’t constantly subjected to the bang clang of people tromping across the steel decks constantly.

However, carpeting is also a bit of a pain to clean, even sci-fi super-carpet. It’s just not going to be as easy to clean as bare steel. Plus carpeting is mass. Mass requires reaction mass to move it around. How much money is your Navy willing to spend to haul carpeting into a warzone?

So what might the implications of carpet or not be?

Crew comfort is important enough to be worth the expense. We can expect to find quite a few other crew-comfort concessions aboard.
Your Navy and the culture it comes from are wealthy enough to afford installing and hauling carpet around.
Your vessel may be a customs cutter, planetary patrol boat, or other rear-echelon vessel not intended to serve in the wall of battle.
True or not, your navymen may be perceived as being soft and weak by others, as they strut across their carpeted warships sipping lattes and sleeping on featherbeds. Of course, it also means they’re comfortable, well rested, and sharp should they meet battle. Subversion of expectations is fun.
Whatever area is carpeted is not expected to be often doused with mess such as hydraulic fluid or blood. Or, if you do find carpet in engineering spaces, well…your naval architects may not be very good.
Your navy believes it will never need magnetic boots inside the ship.

If the question is simply crew comfort while standing, there are other options, such as foam floor pads. They’re more industrial in appearance, being often used in garages, shops, or other working spaces but providing the same comfort and sound dampening as carpet.

Just ask yourself, what does carpet do for you, and what do you want to convey about your navy and its philosophy on warship construction.

Arundhati Bose,5y,Why do people hate “Twilight” so much?,"We have Bella, a 17 year old girl.

And then there's Edward who is 117 years old, has a deep desire to suck blood out of her and breaks into her house in the middle of the night to watch her sleep.

And they fall in love which is supposed to be fine. Why?

Because he looks good.

The worst part of this series isn't that Bella has zero self esteem. It is the fact that the books glorify it.

Huge rants about feminism but when it comes down to influencing young females, let's just show how being submissive and easily manipulated gets you “love”, shall we?

Then our lovely protagonist decides to marry Edward and also willingly has his half vampire kid because all of that is obviously not inappropriate.

Don't even give me the “age is just a number” crap, okay? Had Edward been looking like the picture below, our docile, little Bella would be first one to scream beyond her wits.

Then enters Jacob, the werewolf who falls in love with Bella.

Just to check the saturation point of the readers' brains, Jacob finds his soulmate later on. Guess who it is?

*Drumrolls*

It is Bella and Edward's baby daughter!

Eli Grant,5y,"How did you like Fahrenheit 451? I just read it and I was extremely disappointed. To me, it felt like an attempt at similar things as other Dystopian novels, but in a more poorly executed fashion. It was like a bad movie adaptation of itself.","Its the Star Trek effect!

You know those really standard sci fi plots that you see in absolutely everything? The one where they find a paralell universe where all the heroes are evil? The one where the alien has some weird mating ritual that makes them violently crazy? The one where time dilation or alien technology lets a character live a whole life and then return to when they left before the end of the episode?

Any sci fi plot you can imagine, a third of the time Star Trek did it first. The other two thirds of the time it was Doctor Who or Asimov.

As a result, rewatching old star trek or doctor who episodes tends to involve a lot of rolling your eyes at plots youve seen done to death, deconstructed and reinvented a thousand times, because every show that followed tried to do the same thing.

Basically, when a piece of media becomes big and influential enough, the ideas which were revolutionary when it was written become tropes of the genre. As a result, future readers may find it cliched or overdone, even though it invented those tropes. At a certain point, those tropes become SO old and overdone that theyre only referenced as jokes or as the set up to an obvious surprise twist.

Farenheit 451 is one of the original modern dystopian novels. Bradbury was a pioneer of that genre. So concepts he invented are now the standard upon which other dystopias are built. And since it was written in the 50’s, the genre has had a lot of time to evolve those concepts, leaving to old versions behind.

Basically, the book seems like a parody of itself because it’s playing straight all the genre tropes youre used to seeing treated as a joke or as the standard.

Daniel Kaplan,Updated 2y,"What did American writer and satirist Dorothy Parker mean when she wrote about Atlas Shrugged that, ""This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.""?","I’ve read Atlas Shrugged multiple times. In addition, I’ve read the following:

The Fountainhead
Anthem
We the Living
Capitalism: The Uknown Ideal
The Virtue of Selfishness
Night of January 16th

Yes, I’ve even read her play. I’ve read her books of essays. I wouldn’t say I’m an “expert” on Ayn Rand, but I would say that I’m as close as you’re likely to find.

Ayn Rand was a bitter person. She offers us the most cynical version of humanity. In fact, she offers us a fantasy in human perversion in most of her books.

Every one of her books appears to be the same thing. Some guy (it’s pretty much always a guy) has some fancy talent. He is incapable of really exploiting that talent because of other people who are pulling him down like a rabid pack of petty Lilliputians. So… he fights and wins because he’s awesome. Now we know that people like him are better than all of us.

Here’s the problem: the world isn’t like that.

Everything around you? WE built it. I’m a teacher. I didn’t build the road outside, but I might have taught the guy who did build it. Maybe I taught him how to read or fill out a job application.

Ayn Rand’s fantasy of a world completely in thrall to a Prometheus, John Galt, or Howard Roark is a world in which I don’t want to live. I’m smart. I’m capable. I’m not perfect. I’ve got news for you, Cupcake: NEITHER ARE YOU. Rand’s fantasy world doesn’t have any room in it for people who aren’t perfect. You’re either perfect (angularly good looking with the skills of a god… except tact and diplomacy) or you’re a slave to those people.

Objectivism doesn’t work in the real, imperfect world. We all popped into this world imperfect. John Galt didn’t crawl out of his mother’s womb perfectly formed, knowing everything. He got a free public education or had his parents provide it to him.

We should all try to hold ourselves to the objectivist ideal. We should strive not to be a burden to others. We should all carry our weight… and then some. We should also recognize that not everyone else out there can.

Had Dorothy Parker claimed this, she would have been right (the quote is, as is often the case, misattributed
). Atlas Shrugged is pornography for the arch-conservative.

One of the commenters under this answer asked this:

You read multiple books by an author you hate and expect anybody to think you’re telling the truth?

I don’t really care if you believe me. I read these books (and play) when I was in high school and college. Remember when you were on a long car trip, on a bus, or on a train and didn’t have a phone, tablet, or laptop to dissociate yourself from your plight? I do.

At the time, I didn’t have enough life experience to question what she’d claimed. Then you read other things and talk to other people and have other experiences. And grow up.

Also, I cannot help but wonder… if you don’t read things by people you “hate” (I don’t hate Ayn Rand, but I do pity her), how do you know how you feel about them?

he remembers finding his sister’s panties with blood on them, seeing that she didn’t have a penis, and assuming that her penis was cut off as a punishment, so that’s why there was blood in her panties.

I don't know how many times I've read this novel. It was introduced to me by a girl. We’ll probably never talk to each other, again, yet I'm so grateful to her.

This novel is not for everyone.

I still remember when I first finished it— I thought someone has slumped me into a big, dark void. I couldn't get out of it for days. Everything around me felt so colourless. And I no longer believed in human relationships.

For me, nothing comes close to this novel. It's the greatest melancholy. A craft that can never be repeated.

I've slept with this novel for numerous nights. I kept it beside my cushion. And I moved my fingers on it, gingerly, to admire the magical flow of the words inside.

She knew that my memories of her would fade. Which is precisely why she begged me never to forget her, to remember that she existed.

The thought fills me with almost unbearable sorrow. Because Naoko never loved me.

Niks González,Updated 3y,What is the most horrible children's book ever written?,"I was in a children's camp four years ago. My fellow volunteers and I were teaching the children to read and encouraging them to write their own short stories. Someone donated a book My Beautiful Mommy it was written by a plastic surgeon, Dr. Michael Salzhauer and was published in 2008.

The book tells the story of a little girl whose mother gets a tummy tuck, breast implants and nose job and comes complete with cartoon-style illustrations. There's nothing wrong with plastic surgery, but in a children’s book? That’s inappropriate.

I couldn't imagine if my future six-year-old daughter says to me, “Mum, I’ve read a book about her mum getting plastic surgery. You should get a tummy tuck and breast implants too because your breasts are saggy.”

Me: “You don't think mum’s beautiful?”

My daughter: “You’ll be more beautiful when you have plastic surgery. Dad will love you more.”

Me: “Yes, mum’s breasts are saggy so I could provide you milk when you were a baby.” I would cry.

""That’s sweet of you to say, my love, but Mommy is also having her tummy made smaller. You see, as I got older, my body stretched and I couldn't fit into my clothes any more. Dr. Michael is going to help fix that and make me feel better.""

When it comes to her nose job, the mother warns her daughter that she will look different when the bandages come off.

The mother responds: ""Not just different, my dear - prettier!""

The book implies one thing: The person is not happy with her body. By making plastic surgery sound like a perfectly natural and fascinating process, it warps a child's view of their own body.

Loki Odinsson,4y,What is the most cliché way to start a novel?,"My alarm went off and I groaned, rolling over to switch it off. My life was so ordinary. I was so plain. Choking back sobs, I sorted through my various piles of Gucci clothes until I found something appropriate for school. But — horror of all horrors! — the only one that didn’t have the label still attached was a tight, leather miniskirt! I gasped in horror, tears filling my eyes at my predicament. I couldn’t wear clothes that still had labels attached! I was going to have to wear the miniskirt. My first day at school was going to be awful.

“Jessabelle Angelica Goldeneyes Westwood, come downstairs at once!” my mother screeched. Once more, I struggled to stop myself from crying. My mother was so abusive! Whimpering, I checked my reflection in my floor-length mirror. Waist-length ebony hair tumbled down my shoulders in raven locks, and amethyst orbs glinted back at me through a film of tears. I shrugged on a too-tight blouse that showed off my DD cups and stared pitifully back at myself. I’m so plain! I thought sadly, applying only a hint of eyeliner to my sparkling, purple eyes and a dab of lipgloss to my full, pouting lips. Of course I didn’t put too much make-up on. Only fake sluts use concealer.

Sashaying downstairs, I picked up my Gucci handbag and waved goodbye to my abusive mother. She wasn’t really my mother, of course. I was an orphan.

But as I strutted into school, my three-inch heel caught on the curb and I slipped! I screamed shrilly — but I never hit the ground. Two strong arms enveloped my tiny waist and caught me just before I face-planted. They were warm and muscular. The top button of my blouse popped off, giving my rescuer a good look at my perfect breasts.

“You… you saved me!” I gasped, rolling over in my rescuer’s arms to face him. He was incredibly handsome! His skin was tanned and honey-smooth, and when he moved me in his arms his muscles bulged so much his shirtsleeves ripped. His dark hair swept across his face in an artistic swoop. My heart sank. Someone this perfect could never fall for someone ugly like me!

And then I felt something stirring deep within me. Something that felt almost like… a bond.

“I did save you,” my mysterious rescuer whispered huskily, tawny eyes roving up and down my curvaceous figure. “Jessabelle, you have woken something inside me. I can sense you within me. I can feel… you are my mate.”

Alex Cooper,Updated 2y,What is the most cliché way to start a novel?,"I’ve scrolled through about 10 answers and half of them begin exactly the same way, so either the alarm clock is the most cliché way to start a novel, or it’s the cliché idea of a cliché that most people have.

I can’t remember reading a novel that started that way recently, but let’s be honest, I’m not the demographic.

How about the cliché fantasy novel?

Gunther is a young farmboy growing up in a vaguely-described feudal society. His parents are honest, salt-of-the-earth types, but Gunther wants more from life.

He’s only left the hamlet of Shitbottom three times. His days are spent working and staring wistfully out into the distance, imagining the glitz and glamour of Thisismorelikeitville, where King Thrumplesack holds court and the buildings are made out of brick instead of faeces.

Today is different, though, because it’s the yearly warthog festival. Shitbottom is briefly transformed into a thriving metropolis as villagers from the local region descend on the muddy fields to compare warthogs and gather around campfires telling stories.

These stories are what captivate our young farmhand. He loves tales of warriors, of wizards, and the fiery flatulence of the legendary farting dragon.

Gunther’s ears prick up whenever he hears this story. He, too, produces fire from his rear end. Two years ago, the season’s crops were ruined after he’d overindulged in vindaloos from the local curry house, or perhaps a more period-appropriate dish that I can’t be bothered to think of.

He’d managed to make excuses that time, but he couldn’t afford another slip-up.

Gunther has never told anyone his secret, because he doesn’t believe he’s special. He’s just a useless farmboy in buttfuck nowheresville. And sometimes (well, most of the time) the whole “farting out fire” thing feels more like a curse than a blessing.

Little does he know, everything is about to change.

The warthog festival has brought a new face to the hamlet that Gunther doesn’t recognise. Piercing blue eyes poking out from beneath a hooded cloak are all he sees, but he feels…uneasy. Those eyes seem to follow him as the outsider sits at a table, drinking his mead.

As the farting dragon story is told, Gunther feels the stranger’s eyes boring into him.

Does he know about my incendiary anus?

Alright, that’s enough of that. As you can probably tell, it turns out Gunther is half human, half fart dragon. The stranger, Bob, teaches him how to harness his arsenal of arse attacks, and overthrow the corrupt King Thrumplesack. Maybe Bob is his real father and the fart dragon in disguise; maybe Bob tragically dies fending off rabid warthogs on the journey to find the fart dragon. I haven’t decided yet.

Fun for all the family. 5 stars.

Edit — Shameless plug incoming. One book that doesn’t start with a cliché is my latest offering, The Mating Game. Depending on what you consider the start of the book, it’s a talking gorilla writing the foreword, or a sexist lion’s dating profile.

His parents are honest, salt-of-the-earth types, but Gunther wants more from life.\n\nHe’s only left the hamlet of Shitbottom three times. His days are spent working and staring wistfully out into the distance, imagining the glitz and glamour of Thisismorelikeitville, where King Thrumplesack holds court and the buildings are made out of brick instead of faeces.\n\nToday is different, though, because it’s the yearly warthog festival. Shitbottom is briefly transformed into a thriving metropolis as villagers from the local region descend on the muddy fields to compare warthogs and gather around campfires telling stories.\n\nThese stories are what captivate our young farmhand. He loves tales of warriors, of wizards, and the fiery flatulence of the legendary farting dragon.\n\nGunther’s ears prick up whenever he hears this story. He, too, produces fire from his rear end. Two years ago, the season’s crops were ruined after he’d overindulged in vindaloos from the local curry house, or perhaps a more period-appropriate dish that I can’t be bothered to think of.\n\nHe’d managed to make excuses that time, but he couldn’t afford another slip-up.\n\nGunther has never told anyone his secret, because he doesn’t believe he’s special. He’s just a useless farmboy in buttfuck nowheresville. And sometimes (well, most of the time) the whole “farting out fire” thing feels more like a curse than a blessing.\n\nLittle does he know, everything is about to change.\n\nThe warthog festival has brought a new face to the hamlet that Gunther doesn’t recognise. Piercing blue eyes poking out from beneath a hooded cloak are all he sees, but he feels…uneasy. Those eyes seem to follow him as the outsider sits at a table, drinking his mead.\n\nAs the farting dragon story is told, Gunther feels the stranger’s eyes boring into him.\n\nDoes he know about my incendiary anus?\n\nAlright, that’s enough of that.

Feifei Wang,3y,"Why weren't women, besides aunts, allowed to read in ""The Handmaid's Tale""?","It is interesting, that aunts are allowed to read and write, and yet other women, including the commander’s wives, are not.

Reading is access to knowledge, while writing is self-expression. And they are considered a tool of control. You only get to access that tool if you’re part of the ruling class. In this sense, reading and writing are not that different from firearms.

Since the commander’s wives are denied access to power and self-expression, they aren’t considered part of the ruling class, despite their seemingly prestigious position.

And when Serena Joy made a symbolic gesture, hoping to gain access to that tool, she was swiftly punished.

Aunts are allowed to read and write, the same reason guards and soldiers are allowed to have guns. They’re considered part of mechanism of control, while commander’s wives are considered (more privileged) subjects of control.

I think that’s what makes Handmade’s Tale truly unique in its commentary on power and systemic oppression.

When depicting an oppressive regime in media, may it be books or TV shows, or movies, the media often focus on “the face” of the oppressive regime. Even in masterpieces like 1984, there is an individual villain person, O’Brien, we can focus our hatred and fear.

But Handmaid’s Tale (TV show), painted a grim picture that features an everpresent, overwhelming, and utterly inhumane system that oppresses everyone.

Spoilers of Season 3

For example, in season 3, June was assigned to Commander Lawrence. Depite being a founding member of Gilead, Lawrance was disillusioned about the regime, and often helps the handmaids and Marthas when he’s able.

He did not require handmaids assigned to his home to perform the “sex ritual”, partly because the fragile mentality of his wife Eleanor couldn’t take something like that. It’s obvious that he loved his wife deeply and did not want to put her through more trauma.

Of course, such silent rebellions could not be tolerated, so one time, Aunts and Eyes came to Lawrence’s home, and demand that he perform the ritual. And he did the deed, while his wife hid behind the curtain crying.

It was a heartbreaking scene, because all three of them, the commander, commander’s wife, and handmaid, are victims. The commander and handmaid are raped by the system, while the wife is forced to watch and do nothing.

Spoilers of Season 3 - End

The show did a really good job presenting what systemic oppression looks like, by depicting rebellions in every social class and how such individuals are punished not by other individuals, but by the system:

The eyes are forced to betray the people they often come to like (or love), any suspicion of disloyalty will be punished.
The guards are executed simply for loving the wrong person.
The commanders are forced to perform sexual acts and when they show a tiny bit of humanity to their charges, they get their hands chopped off.
The Wives can be punished, have their fingers cut off, for simply asking to read and write.
Not to mention more oppressed classes like Marthas and Handmaids.

I once wrote an answer on why it is bad to live in a society like Gilead, even if you’re a commander. See: Feifei Wang's answer to Why is it so bad to want a society like the ones in The Handmaid's Tale or The Stepford Wives?

The fact is, an oppressive theocracy like Gilead oppresses EVERYONE, even its most privileged numbers.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1ed8bmgax5su6fyp', 'title': 'Why weren\'t women, besides aunts, allowed to read in ""The Handmaid\'s Tale""?', 'score': {'original': 0.51885, 'ai': 0.48115}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It is interesting, that aunts are allowed to read and write, and yet other women, including the commander’s wives, are not.\n\nReading is access to knowledge, while writing is self-expression.

Alex Johnston,Feb 10,"There are pages worth of words in the dictionary that most people have either never heard of, or don’t understand, “sangfroid”, for example. Would you be less likely to read a novel that used some of these words?","This is an interesting question, but from my own perspective I think it’s a slightly odd one.

For one thing, I know what ‘sangfroid’ means, and I can’t remember a time when I didn’t. (It’s French, literally means ‘cold blood’, and is used to mean a certain coolness in the face of adversity.)

Now, I’m not bragging. I know what this word means not because I’m smarter than other people. I know what it means because I was lucky enough to grow up in a house full of books. I had a lot of cultural capital.

One of the books in the house I grew up in was James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake, a book which is infamously composed in a punning language that Joyce devised to represent the ways our minds work when we’re dreaming.

Random page:

I was trying to read this when I was 10 years old. I did end up reading the whole thing, in my late teens.

I still think that the Wake is an amazing, unforgettable, monstrous book.

But one of the effects of reading the whole thing has been that it’s permanently cured me of being impressed or entertained by writers who use ten-dollar words to make their prose seem more… I dunno. Posh. Or clever. Because Joyce went as far in that direction as it is possible to go, by essentially inventing his own language.

So, when lesser writers use words like ‘acerbic’ when they could have used ‘sour’, or ‘plethora’ when they mean ‘lots’, they do nothing for me. I would rather read something that either is genuinely baroque all the way down, like Robert Burton or Thomas Browne, or for that matter James Joyce (or Borges in Fictions), or else who uses the simplest and most concrete language to tell a good story, like John Berger in his magnificent Into their Labours trilogy, a masterpiece which I must reread and write about some time.

There are a few exceptions. I give Thomas Pynchon a free pass, because the guy can do pretty much anything with the English language that he wants to do, Mason & Dixon being my favourite example. And Henry James could make English sit up and play nice, when he was really trying. And poetry is a whole separate matter.

But either I want my fiction to be on that level of verbal genius, or else I want it to be restrained in its use of out-of-the-way words, especially if the story isn’t much to write home about, as is the case with most literary fiction.

Sprinkling otherwise unremarkable prose with pretentious verbal trinkets don’t impress me none.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/y2udv7btocl5szr6', 'title': 'There are pages worth of words in the dictionary that most people have either never heard of, or don’t understand, “sangfroid”, for example.

Chris O'Leary,2y,How good are Tom Clancy's novels?,"eh…

I say this as a guy who read all of Clancy’s books and enjoyed them quite a bit when I was young, (especially when I was a Marine, Clancy always treated the military very well in his books) but now I find them difficult to read.

Clancy had a few gifts and a few faults as a writer.

As far as gifts go, he was a terrific researcher, knew his stuff about military hardware, had a good feel for the way intelligence-gathering operations actually worked, so there was always a feel for realism in what was happening as it related to the capabilities of the ships, weapons, planes or technology he was weaving into his stories.

When he was writing about things, or how things were done, it was always interesting, because he worked hard at understanding those things and weaving the real-world capability or techniques into the flow of the novel.

What makes Clancy hard to read is two-fold

He had a terrible feel for dialogue. The characters in his books all sound the same (Likely very much like Clancy himself) they all use the same verbal pause “Ok?” CONSTANTLY, and you just cant come away from the conversations in the story without feeling like they are what someone who is a very poor conversationalist thinks good conversation sounds like.
Clancy isn’t alone in this, or even the worst Author out there, (I’m looking at you, Thomas Harris and Dan Brown) but he fell too much in love with his characters, and as a result, they became more and more unrealistic (President Jack Ryan, anyone?)

If you stick to Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games, Cardinal of the Kremlin, and MAYBE Clear and Present Danger, the #2 part doesn’t get so bad. (Although Clear and Present Danger is where you start to character plots get a little silly.) But the dialog is kind of hard to take even in Hunt for Red October when I try to read it now.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qkws12blhxu9yi7p', 'title': ""How good are Tom Clancy's novels?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'eh…\n\nI say this as a guy who read all of Clancy’s books and enjoyed them quite a bit when I was young, (especially when I was a Marine, Clancy always treated the military very well in his books) but now I find them difficult to read.\n\nClancy had a few gifts and a few faults as a writer.\n\nAs far as gifts go, he was a terrific researcher, knew his stuff about military hardware, had a good feel for the way intelligence-gathering operations actually worked, so there was always a feel for realism in what was happening as it related to the capabilities of the ships, weapons, planes or technology he was weaving into his stories.\n\nWhen he was writing about things, or how things were done, it was always interesting, because he worked hard at understanding those things and weaving the real-world capability or techniques into the flow of the novel.\n\nWhat makes Clancy hard to read is two-fold\n\nHe had a terrible feel for dialogue.

Ruth Bygrave,3y,"As a British person, would you be offended if an American author wrote a historical fiction novel set in Great Britain? The protagonist is also English.","There is one thing that really, really offends me.

American historical romance writers who set them in Britain and don't have them checked.

Ignorance itself is forgivable in the sense of not knowing before you look something up or ask someone. Plenty of British writers would be happy to answer a few questions online. Americans who watch British media and get an idea of how we talk and think can often do well.

Alex Johnston,2y,What is the most dangerous book in the world?,"This:

This is an image of one of Marie Curie’s lab notebooks.

Marie Curie in 1920.

Marie Curie and her husband Pierre discovered polonium and radium, and she is generally credited with being one of the most important pioneers in the study of radioactivity.

Radioactivity was so poorly understood that she and Pierre kept samples of these substances in their pockets and handled them freely. They wore standard lab clothing.

She died of aplastic anaemia, which was a consequence of her being exposed to so much radiation, but not before she won two Nobel Prizes, in both physics and chemistry.

After she died, the Curie’s house kept on being used by the Institute of Nuclear Physics, before being abandoned in 1978.

But her notebooks were transferred to the Bibliotheque Nationale, where they still are.

The reason why her notebooks are the most dangerous book(s) in the world, is not so much because of the knowledge contained in them.

It’s because they’re still radioactive.

They are stored in a lead-lined box. If you want to consult them, you have to sign a waiver. You can only inspect them in a special reading room away from the other reading rooms, you have to wear protective clothing, and you have to use contamination monitoring during and after handling.

In fact, it’s not like they’re deadly: according to one researcher, even if you consulted them regularly over the course of one year, you would only get a whole-body dose of about 10µSv, which is about as much as you get on a return flight from the UK to Spain.

Nevertheless, I offer Marie Curie’s radioactive notebooks as the most dangerous books in the world.

Books aren’t dangerous for what’s written in them.

Books don’t kill people.

People do, using books as the excuse.

Thanks for reading.

Rivkah Chava HaFrei,4y,What is the most horrible children's book ever written?,"I can’t find it anywhere, so thank goodness; maybe this one isn’t around anymore, but when I was a preschooler, so 1970–72 or thereabouts, someone gave me the most nightmare-inducing book imaginable. It was called, IIRC, Keep Your Mouth Closed, Dear, and was about an anthropomorphic crocodilian (I can’t remember whether it was about an alligator or a crocodile). Anyway, he keeps accidentally swallowing non-food items, beginning with his mother’s hairbrush, and going on to things like cooking implements, and small appliances. For some reason they do not pass through him, but remain in his gullet until he can barely move around anymore.

His mother just tells him to keep his mouth closed. She does not take him to a doctor, or even give him a dose of Ex-Lax. She does try TYING HIS MOUTH SHUT, though.

Then one day, he accidentally swallows the end of the vacuum cleaner hose, and it sucks all the foreign objects out of him (which it magically has the power to do, without harming him). The illustration accompanying this looks pretty much like someone having small appliances and various household implements being pulled one after another up his throat, and just how much that would hurt.

His mother decides to celebrate his “cure” by baking a cake, which for a moment it looks like he will swallow whole— but miraculously, he doesn’t. So it seems that the experience with the vacuum cleaner really did cure him.

If it’s not a nightmare, then someone got some some really bad acid, and an old Smith-Corona. It did come out around 1970.

I was so frightened of this book, I would hide it. I tried to hide it really well, hoping I’d forget where it was, but that didn’t work, so then I threw it up on a top shelf where I couldn’t reach it.

The illustration accompanying this looks pretty much like someone having small appliances and various household implements being pulled one after another up his throat, and just how much that would hurt.\n\nHis mother decides to celebrate his “cure” by baking a cake, which for a moment it looks like he will swallow whole— but miraculously, he doesn’t. So it seems that the experience with the vacuum cleaner really did cure him.\n\nIf it’s not a nightmare, then someone got some some really bad acid, and an old Smith-Corona. It did come out around 1970.\n\nI was so frightened of this book, I would hide it. I tried to hide it really well, hoping I’d forget where it was, but that didn’t work, so then I threw it up on a top shelf where I couldn’t reach it. At some point, one of my parents found it, though, and put it back on my shelf. So I buried it in the park. Far as I know, it’s still there.\n\nETA: OMG! I found a site for it! Here’s the cover!

Shiva Trilogy and Ramchandra Series by Amish have a special place in my heart, especially Sita, because I liked it very much.

Dan Brown is equally favourite. The Deception Point by him is my favourite. I have read 4 books by him. Although the plot of all his books are roughly the same.

Paulo Coelho is again a good one and The Alchemist by him is my favourite.

And Robin Sharma and Khaled Hossaini is one of my favourite authors.

Other famous books like The Autobiography of Yogi, The legend of Lakshmi Prasad, And then there were none, The Secret, and many others.

Jennifer Quail,5y,"How do I make my fantasy novel less clunky? There's so much world-building and it's all necessary to understand the context of the world, but it just feels like it's way too much.","The number one thing that makes me put a fantasy novel back on the bookstore shelf or skim right by it on Amazon is when the description is an endless stream of names of places and people being flung at me, generally of dubious spelling and pronunciation, and a blurb that’s trying desperately to convince me how enormous and epic the whole thing is.

Chances are, readers DON’T need to understand the context. We don’t need to know all the complex details of the world your characters live in. We can, however, learn what we need to know through the action of the story. But to do that, we have to care first about the characters and their problems and how they’re going to solve them. You as the author may need to think big and know how the entire world works, but we as the reader aren’t buying a fantasy travelogue or epic history of the world.

I’m actually going to say not to look at Tolkien. Even if you want to write epic fantasy, not only is his work over half a century old, he was a brilliant academic and linguist. He got away with a lot. The Hobbit is a good example of a book aimed at younger readers, and it’s retroactively popular with adults after Tolkien reverse-engineered it to fit with his other works. Lord of the Rings was a hard enough sell when it was written (Tolkien’s publishers had to put their collective foot down and refuse to publish it all as one volume.) Tolkien got away with a long, meandering, diversion-filled epic mostly because no one had ever done it before and again, he was very, very good at what he did—which was not writing fiction but studying languages and mythology. He was not writing fiction as much as he was writing a mythology for England specifically and the modern world. That it took off was more a weird coincidence and good timing.

The chances are you are not writing the next Lord of the Rings. You’re also almost certainly not writing the next A Song of Ice and Fire. (Tolkien was creating myths, Martin is writing the Wars of the Roses with dragons.) And even if you are, you’ll notice that the traits we associate with it (dozens of POVs, lots of violence and abrupt deaths, Byzantine politics) build up. The first book is relatively, even deceptively, straightforward, right up until the wham moment at the end. This not only is a way of easing readers into the story he wants to tell (strip the magic and weird weather and it’s Phillipa Gregory doing the Tudors), it gives us a chance to get to know characters, not just setting. I don’t care about the grand politics of Westeros as I’m reading the first book, I’m starting to like or at least feel for various characters, dislike and distrust others, get some sense of what the stakes are, and start to formulate sympathies and predictions. Even though a LOT of that is challenged or turned on its head later, I still have characters as anchors.

Think like that, but think smaller than rewriting a complex chapter of world history in a fantasy setting. Think about why we’re actually interested in and reading about your characters. Not the world or the setting. What is it about these characters that make us want to care? And don’t think huge. If we look at Martin again, we don’t respond to Daenerys because she’s the daughter of so-and-so and she’s royalty and her ancestors blah blah blah. We care because we meet her as a young teenage girl who’s pretty much alone in a harsh world and who’s about to be sold into marriage by her only family to a barbarian leader. Looking at Jon, we may not all grasp being a bastard child raised with his [putative] father’s family, but we all understand being the odd man out, and having strained or cold family relationships and people we feel dislike us unfairly. Likewise we don’t need to be literally a dwarf whose mother died giving birth to him to feel like we’re treated badly for things we can’t help about ourselves. We learn characters, then we learn about the world they occupy through them.

Andrew T. Post,1y,What are some famous movies based on novels that had a different ending than the novels they were based on?,"Jurassic Park.

(Massive spoilers ahead. Ye be warned.)

In Michael Crichton’s original 1990 novel, the ending went something like this:

Doctor Henry Wu died—he got his intestines ripped out by velociraptors.
John Hammond died—he got jumped by a pack of Procompsognathus after breaking his ankle. More disturbing yet, it’s his grandkids who technically kill him. Tim and Lex are fiddling around with the visitor center PA system, and find out that they can broadcast recordings of various dinosaur vocalizations. They send out a terrifyingly realistic juvenile T. Rex roar that panics Hammond and sends him rolling down a hill.
Donald Gennaro actually survives—rather than die an embarrassing death like he did in the film, he’s actually given some character development. He realizes the error of his ways, aids Muldoon in suppressing the dinosaur outbreak, and winds up escaping the island with the rest of the survivors.
Muldoon—the gamekeeper—doesn’t die either, despite numerous close encounters with both the T. Rex and the raptors.
The survivors—Grant, Sattler, Malcolm, Harding (Jurassic Park’s veterinarian, who has a much larger role in the novel than he does in the film), and the kids—don’t just run off to an InGen helicopter and escape in it. They’re actually saved by the Costa Rican air force, which airlifts them out and then blasts the whole of Isla Nublar with napalm, presumably killing every living thing on it. Grant and the other survivors are detained in a mainland hotel by the Costa Rican authorities. After a few weeks, an American doctor visits Grant and tells him that an unknown pack of large animals has been migrating through the Costa Rican jungle, chowing down on lysine-rich foods (chickens and soybeans and stuff like that), which leaves the audience with a tantalizing hint that some of the dinosaurs may have escaped from Isla Nublar and made it to the mainland.

Orson Scott Card,5y,How do I go about writing a novel that is not a cliché? Is there certain things to avoid doing when writing a first novel?,"One thing to avoid is obsessing over what's been written before. No story is completely original, and if by chance you come up with something another writer thought of and used, it will be quite different in your story.

However, much depends on just how famous the other writer's story is. If you have a starship captain or ferry boat pilot obsessing over the giant creature that cost him a limb, tread carefully: Moby-Dick is looking over your shoulder. If you have a lost alien who befriends a suburban family as he's trying to contact the ship that left him behind, please DON’T have them call him E.T.

And no kid going off to Wizard School unless you make it radically different from Hogwarts.

Unless you put it in space, called it Battle School, and published it more than a decade before any of the Harry Potter books.

My point is, there's nothing wholly new. But you also have to be aware of other writers’ work if only to avoid being too similar to a work that a large portion of your potential audience is bound to know. If you want magical living swords, please don't call them shardblades. If you want talking sailing ships, please don't have them built from the semi-petrified mummies of pupating dragons.

And for heaven’s sake, don't have the climax of your novel be identical to the scene in Ordinary People where the therapist says to the guilt-ridden young man, “It's not your fault!” unless you name it Good Will Hunting and you're a pair of hot young actors — then you'll share an Oscar for it.

I once wrote a story, “Unaccompanied Sonata,” that “just came to me.” No one else realized it, but after it came in second for a Hugo, it dawned on me that I had unconsciously imitated the storyline of a powerful tale I had read in the Santa Clara Public Library when I was eight years old. It took years of asking book dealers at conventions but I finally found out that the story in question was “Tunesmith” by Lloyd Biggle, Jr. I was able to include it in a TOR double with my novella Eye for Eye so that others could be reminded of the story that had moved me so deeply.

But we all have deep stories lurking in our unconscious minds, and they WILL take hold of us and surface in our fiction without our realizing it. And that's fine, because while they hibernated in the deep caverns of our minds, they changed and became our own.

Just don't put a Warp Drive in your starship or have your magic system be called The Force, and you'll probably be just fine. Even if your story “reminds” somebody of some other story, so what?

I remember sitting in a hotel room at a convention, reading to a group of fans the opening chapters of the not-yet-published novel version of Ender's Game, when one of the listeners said, “This sounds just like a novella by Barry Longyear.” At that time I was reading and reviewing ALL the short fiction in the sci-fi genre, so I knew Barry Longyear had never written anything similar to Ender's Game. But the guy insisted, and then proceeded to prove it by retelling a pretty detailed version of the magazine version of Ender's Game.

Everyone in the room tried to convince him that he had read MY story and mixed up the author names. But he was adamant that I had completely plagiarized a story by Barry Longyear, and he walked out of my reading in disgust.

Memory plays tricks on us, writers and readers alike. No matter what you write, someone will “recognize” it — even if you never heard of or read that supposed original. I still haven't read Starship Troopers, because so many people have been certain I was influenced by it. But I had read Forever War by Joe Haldeman, which I think he said was written as a kind of anti-Starship Troopers, so maybe there was second-hand influence. But I don't much care. All wars in space against aliens will be compared to all other wars in space, and it doesn't make any such story redundant or “derivative,” except to the extent that all art is derived from the expectations of our shared culture.

I once had a novel under contract, about a clan of Homo erectus that was discovered to be surviving in the high deep valleys of upper Pakistan. Then Michael Bishop, a writer I much admired, published Ancient of Days, and as I read it I realized that while our plots were radically different, he had dealt so well with the issues and questions that I cared about that I no longer had the heart to write my version. So I replaced that contract with another book, and will probably never write my version.

And how lucky was that! Because that was more than 20 years ago, and now we know SO much more than we did then about the other species of genus Homo that my book would now be a scientific embarrassment. Thanks for saving me, Michael Bishop!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qfc45ulbi2r1hkdz', 'title': 'How do I go about writing a novel that is not a cliché?

Jordan Zhouyi,Tue,What is the unfunniest comedic novel you have ever read?,"“My Point…And I do Have One” by Ellen DeGeneres.

Why did I read it? I suppose didn't have better things to do.

This was in 2013, I believe - long before the news about her being a royal asshole came out.

It was wholly unfunny. Being a comedian is truly a talent; some people have it, some don't. Ellen has negative comedic talent.

The book was mostly Ellen recalling random events that happened in her past.

Most of these events were clearly fabricated, which I had little problem with. It doesn't have to be an autobiography.

There was one story about how she used non-sledding dogs and a cat in a sledding competition.

I don't know if she used a ghostwriter or not, but there's something about expressing yourself in writing that speaking and mannerisms don't quite capture.

Her voice felt…nonexistent…like she was acting, putting on a show in written words. Funny just for the sake of being funny. Funny...but in mechanical kind of way. Disgenuine. Try hard.

There may have been a few parts of the book that were mildly enjoyable, but the rest was just filler mush. It was overwhelmingly boring.

I feel that way about the book then and I did even more after the news of her being a giant jerk came out.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/31uwtlj5gseamyhn', 'title': 'What is the unfunniest comedic novel you have ever read?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""“My Point…And I do Have One” by Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nWhy did I read it?

Eric Andersson,5y,What are some examples of authors who turn novels out in quantity rather than quality?,"James Patterson.

James Patterson has a huge bibliography. He’s written or co-written well over a hundred books, and is the number-one best-selling novelist in the world. If you’re a bookworm at all, you should know his name.

I have mixed feelings on the man, though.

First of all, I just don’t generally enjoy his writing that much. His books just aren’t my cup of tea. I liked the Maximum Ride books when I was younger, but going back and re-reading them when I was slightly older revealed a host of plot holes, character inconsistencies and just plain stupid twists and turns that took me right out of them.

I’ve tried to read a couple of his other books since then, but have never managed to get through them. It doesn’t help that he mostly writes crime dramas and spy thrillers, both genres that sell really well but neither ones I typically enjoy reading.

And then there’s the other thing about him. The thing I like even less.

Take a look at the covers of a few of his books.

Notice it yet? Here’s a few more:

You notice how, on the covers of all these books, there’s another person’s name on there? Usually down below Patterson’s name, in smaller, less prominent letters?

Yeah, that’s because James Patterson doesn’t actually write a large chunk of the books with his name on them. He basically sends another writer a plot outline, lets that other author write the book for him, and then uses his name to sell the book.

Now, there’s nothing wrong with collaboration, and this formula has obviously been successful for Patterson. It’s just…something deep inside me recoils at the way he creates these books. It’s far less an individual artist coming up with a vision and then bringing that vision to life and far closer to two people using a brand name to sell a highly sterile, prepackaged product.

That just feels wrong to me.

And that’s why, when I saw this question, James Patterson was the first person to pop into my head. He produces a crap-ton of books, but a lot of them are forgettable. If I had to guess, I’d say Patterson’s work will be largely forgotten 50–100 years after his death.

But, hey, that’s just my opinion.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ci2eyoqu1fpkm5zl', 'title': 'What are some examples of authors who turn novels out in quantity rather than quality?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'James Patterson.\n\nJames Patterson has a huge bibliography.

This and all my best stuff arrives there daily.]

Winston Smith hated everything about the socialist party of England, Ingsoc, but still worked for them changing newspapers to fit the propaganda of the day. “Freedom is the ability to say 2+2 =4” he wrote in the diary he knew could get him killed. The truth, not as you see it or they want it to be seen, but the way it is.

Eventually arrested and dragged to a room where his mind was broken, they attached a feeder cage of hungry rats, like a mask, to his face, and in his panic he betrayed everything he loved, his cause, the truth about Big Brother. He was truly undone.

When he sat in the pub afterwards, paying attention to the propaganda on the telescreen and becoming genuinely upset over it—something he never did before, because he, you know, helped invent it. His eyes floated to a poster of the semi-mythical, ever-watching leader of Ingsoc, and there, in the pub, George Orwell split my heart in half when he penned the last line of this prophetic masterpiece—after all that torment, Orwell wrote

Feifei Wang,2y,Who are the most depressing characters in The Handmaid's Tale?,"Every character in the Handmaid’s Tale is depressing, even the commanders. And they’re all depressing for different reasons. I like Handmaid’s Tale because it demonstrated how systemic oppression works in a society. A lot of people, when thinking of Gilead’s system, fantasizing themselves being in the position of the Commanders. And the show had shown, again and again, everyone in that society is oppressed by the system, from the Commanders to Eyes, to Marthas, to Aunts, to Wives, and of course, to Handmaids.

Of course, some of them defend the system, enforce the system, and perpetuate the system, but they are at the same time being oppressed by the system they themselves created and maintained.

This answer contains heavy spoilers of all seasons of the show.

I don’t want to go into the more obvious choices, like the protagonist June, Nick the bodyguard turned commander, Serena Joy, or Emily…

There’s this one minor character, Eden, Nick’s assigned wife.

Eden was raised in a religious family (as all families are religious families). She grew up believing she will be a dutiful wife to her husband and a loving mother for her children (if she’s lucky). When she was assigned to Nick, she’s full of hope, ready to start a new family.

And she was 15.

You can see from this image when she stood right next to Serena Joy and Rita. She looks tiny, barely a girl.

She did everything she’s taught to do. She’s ready to give Nick all her love and care that’s required for her. She tried to be nice to Nick, she tried to be a good wife for him, as the good book told her to.

But of course, we all know Nick was in love with June. And he couldn’t stand Eden, basically the exact opposite of June, and represent everything Nick hated. He wasn’t abusive to her, but he was cold, distant, unkind, and basically ignored her.

I can relate to Nick. He hated the Gilead system and the whole religious BS, and every day he went home, there’s this ignorant stupid girl, remind him about just how miserable his life actually was.

But I relate to Eden more. She was brainwashed into thinking this is the best life ever, without knowing there are other possibilities. She perpetuates the system, sure, but she’s also a victim.

Eden eventually started a secret relationship with a guard. Once their relationship was discovered, they had to flee. Eden went back to her parents’ home for help. And her parents turned her in.

She refused to denounce her relationship with the Guard. Both of them were executed by drowning.

Here’s a girl who set up to follow the social rules, however inhumane and draconian, to be a good wife and good mother. And the moment she showed a shred of free will and compassion, she was swiftly executed.

And what’s depressing is that audiences probably didn’t care about her until the end. She’s a nuisance for Nick. Her kindness was annoying, her timidness was seen as being complicit in an oppressing system. We as audiences don’t even see her as a person, just another interchangeable face of the system.

The depressing part is when she finally “become” a person with her own thoughts and have some agency, the system she loved so much turned around and crushed her.

Other depressing characters are Commander Lawrance and his wife Eleanor.

I think Lawrance’s experience really drives it home that being a commander sucks if you have some humanity and empathy left.

Lawrance was a founding member of the Gilead leadership who primarily worked in economics. Both he and his wife were implied to be academics. And the two obviously loved each other deeply. The cruelty of Gilead destroyed Eleanor’s spirit. She got through each day between moments of clarity and drug-induced stupor.

Lawrance became disillusioned with Gilead and become an on-again-off-again supporter for the underground Martha network. He did not perform the rape ritual with handmaids assigned to him.

However, his quiet rebellion raised the suspicion of the Gilead leadership. Eventually, an aunt and an eye were sent to his home to make sure he performed the ritual, as in the aunt and the eye was waiting outside his bedroom on the day of the ritual, and the aunt will check handmaids for ejaculation afterward.

It is perhaps one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the show. Lawrance obviously didn’t want to do it, Eleanor was in distress, knowing what’s coming, and June, the rape victim becomes their rock, getting Lawrance through the ordeal because if Lawrance didn’t do it, for real, all three of them will face dire consequences.

While Lawrance ended doing it, he’s also a victim. He’s forced to perform a sex act he does not want to do. And unlike handmaids, who can passively suffer through it, he had to get an erection to do it. Can you imagine the horror and humiliation? He’s raped by the system while the woman he loves was forced to watch.

In this scene, all three of them, the commander, the wife, and the handmaid, were rape victims.

Still think being a commander is fucking awesome?

I’ve said this in my other answers about Handmaid’s Tale that an oppressive system oppresses EVERYONE in it, from its most prestigious members down to the lowest pariah. Just because you get to oppress other people, doesn’t mean you have the freedom to live your life as you wanted.

Equality benefits everyone.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ibtj7secon9r865w', 'title': ""Who are the most depressing characters in The Handmaid's Tale?"", 'score': {'original': 0.94535, 'ai': 0.05465}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Every character in the Handmaid’s Tale is depressing, even the commanders.

Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,3y,Is it right to choose writing as a career? I'm a 17-year-old NEET aspirant. I write poems. I'm also writing a novel.,"I advise you to keep writing as a hobby for the present.

You will enjoy it better when your livelihood does not depend on it.

Find another profession which you like or a line of business in which you have good aptitude and which can guarantee you at least a living wage.

Dr Jo,7mo,"What are some novels that you personally believe (as a teacher, librarian, or parent) should not be taught or read in modern classrooms anymore?","“They've a temper, some of them—particularly verbs”

Hi, Hanna

Humpty Dumpty’s remark may not seem immediately relevant. But it underlines the simple observation that your question contains three verbs: ‘believe’, ‘taught’ and ‘read’.

This is important.

Like many who have already answered your question with “None”, as a parent I believe that there’s a huge down-side to restricting access to books. And it’s not just this …

Oh no. There are more subtle aspects to censorship. In fact, by its nature, most censorship goes unnoticed.

Ask the average Russian what he feels about Vladimir Putin, and he’ll likely shrug (Who wants to get into trouble by talking to a stranger and potentially compromising yourself by revealing your thoughts?) or be complimentary—because he/she has swallowed what the Russian media carefully put out. This despite Putin’s recent face-slapping by his own mercenaries. Here’s a frame from yesterday’s video clip where Putin is mobbed by ‘hundreds’ of screaming, excited citizens, happy to see their leader… and queueing for selfies.[1]

Yeah right. Let’s just sidestep. Ignore the uncomfortable or inconvenient.

Perhaps we might try something closer to home? I’ll bet you were engrossed in the recent Titan sub disaster—where 5 people died. Did you even notice the several hundred people who drowned[2] in the Mediterranean when a fishing boat went down about the same time?

Uhh…

“But that’s not censorship!”

Any suppression of information is censorship. But far more effective than removing information is simply supplying irrelevancies. Dazzle people with stunts or sideshows. Ply people with nouns and adjectives, and ignore the verbs. The killing happens around the back.

If you were not taught these unpleasant truths, well then, I’d suggest that your teachers weren’t really doing their job. Perhaps you’ve rehabilitated yourself; if you have, it’s likely because you’ve read a bit for yourself.

A few verbs, then

We tend to believe what we see—but in the context of what we’ve read, and what we’ve been taught.

As I see it, facts are a dime a dozen. Nouns are commonplace. Content is two-a-penny. Shove in a few more adjectives. In contrast, good teachers provide context. They join up facts, and explain them, and put them in context. And this inevitably leads us to question, and even act differently.

When a difficult question comes up—perhaps in a difficult book?—then a good teacher will use this to teach.

I’d suggest that when we see people still supporting Putin (or, say, the orange sexual predator) they are simply demonstrating that their education was inadequate. Do you remember the work of Blakemore & Cooper[3] in the 1970s?

They took kittens and raised them in environments filled with either vertical or horizontal stripes. After this, the kittens had difficulty even seeing stripes with an unfamiliar orientation.

Perhaps there is someone out there who believes we should shield our children from terrible things.

Tamara Vardo,Updated 3y,"Why is Horace Walpole's opening line, ""It was a dark and stormy night"" so often cited as a bad line to start a novel? It sets the tone, is informative, and is appropriately gloomy. So why is this line so beleaguered?","Because “It was a dark and stormy night” is not the full line.

Here’s the full line from Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s novel Paul Clifford:

It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents - except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of lamps that struggled against the darkness.

Do you see more clearly now what’s wrong with the full line?

I can do no better than to quote the writer Kit Whitfield’s discussion of this line Kit Whitfield's Blog: Opening Line:
 (she had a series on her blog First sentence posts!
 about analyzing the first lines of famous novels)

On the one hand, it's lavishly over-written. Before we've had time to catch our breath Bulwer-Lytton is pounding us with storms, rain, torrents, violent gusts of wind, rattling rooftops and struggling flames: water, wind and fire swirl all over the place, sweeping us into the novel in no doubt that things are going to be dramatic. The 'pathetic fallacy' is a common device in literature and describes the attribution of human emotions to the landscape, usually to express or accentuate a character's emotional state. This isn't quite a pathetic fallacy - 'violent' and 'fiercely' are just on the naturalistic side of the line - but it is, you might say, a stylistic pathetic fallacy. By beginning with such a ferocious setting, Bulwer-Lytton is telling us in no uncertain terms - and no succinct ones either - that this is going to be a story of extreme events and larger-than-life characters. (The story concerns a romantic highwayman, a subject that should surprise no one after such an opening.) This is one of the main reasons why 'It was a dark and stormy night' has become such a catchphrase: it's unquestionably purple prose.

And she follows it with

The fall probably has a lot to do with the fact that it's not the only aside. Our cynicism has been primed by a much clumsier one early on: 'the rain fell in torrents - except at occasional intervals...' While the description of those intervals that follows is pacy and vivid enough to distract us if we allow it to - this is prose written to be gulped, not sipped - that really is a bit of a clanger. When a writer throws everything into describing one kind of drama, storms and torrents in full flow, then checks that flow with an 'except' - and 'except at occasional intervals', which has a dry and pedantic ring that doesn't at all suit the tone - it sounds unfortunately as if he'd lost his focus. Loss of focus never looks good, but when it happens between one kind of extreme and another, with a qualification in the middle that smacks more of the inkstain and pince-nez than the swash and buckle, the effect is unavoidably bathetic.

I strongly recommend you read the whole thing, as Whitfield goes deeply into both what this line does well and what it does poorly. Her Opening Lines posts really were great; it’s a shame that, due to life circumstances I do not know, she has stopped writing or updating her blog.

So the reason that “It was a dark and stormy night” became such a cliche is not the “it was a dark and stormy night”, but the gushing torrent of purple prose that follows, except at occasional intervals, when it is checked by a parenthetical (for it is in 19th-century melodrama that our scene lies).

When Madeleine L’Engle begins A Wrinkle In Time with “It was a dark and stormy night” and stops there, doing a paragraph break and spending the next paragraph introducing her protagonist Meg Murry, it actually works quite well. “An inexperienced writer is usually well advised not to start with a description of the weather or the landscape: it can be done, and sometimes it can be done beautifully, but it runs the risk of beginning with a sentence in which nobody's there and nothing happens,” says Kit Whitfield. L’Engle, a more skilled writer, gives us the “dark and stormy night” setting the tone and being informative, and then immediately gives us the somebody there, Meg, and details about what she is doing and implications of how she is feeling.

IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT.

In her attic bedroom Margaret Murry, wrapped in an old patchwork quilt, sat on the foot of her bed and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind. Behind the trees clouds scudded frantically across the sky. Every few moments the moon ripped through them, creating wraithlike shadows that raced along the ground.

The house shook.

Wrapped in her quilt, Meg shook.

That novel is a classic, and a classic for a reason.

But Bulwer-Lytton, bless his heart, didn’t know to leave well enough alone.

Michael R. Bernstein,7y,What is the most horrible children's book ever written?,"Ok, I can't really compete with the genuinely horrible examples in the other answers, so I will share a children's book that is meant to be horrible.

I give you Uncle Shelby's ABZ Book:

The contents are ostensibly intended for children, with the not-particularly-hidden goal of tormenting them and their parents in various ways as a result of side effects and consequences that are obvious to an adult reader but that, supposedly, wouldn't be to a child. Some examples:

You get the drift.

The first time I read this book I got a stitch in my side from laughing so hard. It's been my experience that kids (particularly ones with younger siblings, of course) find it just as funny, but I wouldn't recommend handing this book to anyone younger than 10 or so (or leaving it where they could find it), as they just might take something like the following seriously:

Remember folks, leave satire to the professionals, and don't try this at home.

Amy Smith,Updated 3y,What is the most cliché way to start a novel?,"~ Chapter 1 ~

“Come on, you have to go now, Eliza May Jenison!” my horrible mother calls.

I throw on my black leather jacket and take one more quick look at myself in my bathroom mirror before I leave. I brush my lush red curls out of my face revealing my fair, lightly freckled skin. I begin applying a little more mascara to my perfectly curled eyelashes. I check my outfit, a short blouse and some ripped skinny jeans shaping my curvy figure. I have to at least try to hide my incredible ugliness, it's my first day at a new school, after all.

I suddenly think of my old school. All of my nice teachers, all of my old friends. I fight the urge to cry. This new school isn't going to be anywhere near as good as my old school. I hate my mother so much for forcing me to leave. It's so unfair, my family has to be the worst out there. Except for my dad, he died in a car accident when I was just 4. He wouldn't have let us move.

“Eliza!” my mother yells out again. I groan, lifting up my heavy backpack and walking downstairs. I quickly run towards the front door, where my mom is waiting. Suddenly, my big sister runs around the corner and crashes into me.

“Watch where you are going, whore” she snaps at me.

I roll my eyes and walk out the door. My mother reaches to give me a hug, but I pull away. “Good luck” my mum says. She's so horrible to me. She just doesn't understand.

“You're gonna need it, loser” my sister says. She's such a bitch, isn't she? My whole family is so terrible.

I walk down the street, lugging my backpack along. I feel like I've been walking for at least 5 minutes now, but still no bus stop. I'm walking the wrong way, I realise. What a great start to my day. My life is basically ruined now.

I look at my watch and realise I'm already running late. I turn around and start running.

I get to the bus stop just as the bus is leaving. Shit, I can't miss this bus. I start to run again, attempting to hail down the bus. After a few meters, it finally slows down and the doors open for me. I quickly get in, sweating and panting, only to be met with the stares of approximately 30 other school kids. A group of girls at the back of the bus quietly giggle. I feel my cheeks burning with redness, my heart beating fast. They have already seen my ugliness and clumsiness.

After about 30 minutes, the bus arrives outside of a school surrounded by tall metal gates.

I walk into the school, to be met with a long corridor. There's kids flowing in from all directions. I struggle to even move as several kids shove past me.

I look at my watch again, and see I'm already behind on schedule for my first class. I try to run towards my class, but crash headfirst into someone else who was running through the hall. I am sent flying backwards, and hear a loud thud as my books and I hit the floor.

I slowly open my eyes, to be met with another set of deep, sea blue orbs that make me melt inside.

This boy offers me his hand, and I grab onto it, instantly feeling safe and calm. He lifts me up from the floor with his strong and muscular arms.

After I am steadily standing up, he collects my books off the ground for me and hands them to me when I find myself gazing into his beautiful blue eyes for a moment, still clutching his arm tightly, never wanting to let go. He gently asks me if I am okay, his words sounding deep and melodic. I nod shyly. I can barely breathe. I feel a spark inside of me, it's something I've never felt before.

“I'm sorry, I have to go to class now. See you around” he says as he starts running off in another direction.

I am left standing there alone, overwhelmed by a feeling… a feeling of, love?

I finally find my class, but I can't concentrate the whole time. I can't stop thinking about him.

Wait, what am I thinking? I have no chance with someone as angelic as him. He wouldn't even be able to look at me without puking, I'm so disgustingly ugly. He probably already has 20 girls crushing on him.

My thoughts are disrupted by the school bell, signalling our freedom from the classroom.

I join the other kids walking down the hall again. Then suddenly, I see him. Except this time, he's not alone.

He's right in the middle of passionately kissing another girl… one of the girls that laughed at me on the bus.

My heart sinks.

Oliver Mai,6y,"Is it possible for an entire book to be written so that at the very last phrase, the meaning of the rest of the novel changes entirely?","Although I have never read the book the movie, certainly The Secret Life of Walter Mitty seems to epitomizes this theme.

!!Spoiler Alert!!

The movie is about a man, Walter Mitty, who lives a boring life, works a boring job (from our perspective), with an asshole boss, and who really hasn’t done anything his entire life. The only thing he is good at is his job, in which he develops pictures from negatives, which he seems to be extremely passionate about even though it is seemingly derided upon by his colleagues. Essentially we are introduced to a man who is a nobody; he could disappear off the face of the Earth and nobody outside his immediate family (which consists of his unmarried sister and widowed mother) would notice.

This is in stark contrast to the company he works for, Life magazine, whose motto is “To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the meaning of life.” This motto is not so subtly repeated over and over again throughout the movie.

In the story, Life is downsizing and will publish its last paper issue. Walter is responsible for developing the negative for the front cover for the final magazine, the negative which has been sent to him by an elusive photographer Sean O’Connell. The negative is supposed to be the greatest picture Sean O’Connell has ever taken, the “quintessence of life”—except Walter cannot find it.

Against everything we know and would expect from Walter so far, Walter decides to find Sean O’Connell. Walter goes to Iceland, jumps out of helicopters, experiences firsthand a volcano eruption at eyjafjallajökull, etc. Essentially Walter is finally embracing the Life motto and experiencing the quintessence of life!

When Walter finally finds Sean, he finds out that he had the picture the entire time! He returns to Life magazine triumphant, and a changed man. For most people this is where the story essentially ends: Walter’s journey has made him the quintessence of life.

However, we learn that the picture that Sean takes is that of Walter before Walter ventures out on his massive quest. That means that Walter was the quintessence of life even before his journey. The moral of the story, then, is that the quintessence of life does not necessarily mean the experiencing of crazy experiences, the quintessence of life can be as simple as passion for one’s work, no matter how silly it may seem to others.

If that’s not changing the meaning of the story entirely, I don’t know what is.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pjh89yadm37gkt0e', 'title': 'Is it possible for an entire book to be written so that at the very last phrase, the meaning of the rest of the novel changes entirely?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Although I have never read the book the movie, certainly The Secret Life of Walter Mitty seems to epitomizes this theme.\n\n!!Spoiler Alert!!\n\nThe movie is about a man, Walter Mitty, who lives a boring life, works a boring job (from our perspective), with an asshole boss, and who really hasn’t done anything his entire life.

Mercedes R. Lackey,5y,"Is it better to get all of your ideas out and write a novel quickly, or to spend years in the process of curating the story and its elements?","Here’s how you can do both.

You write the synopsis, all of the ideas for the story, very quickly. About 10 pages worth.

Then you expand that; say forty to a hundred pages. Write very lean. Not a lot of description, not a lot of dialogue, unless a really choice bit occurs to you, mostly action.

Now sit down, take a long, deep breath, and start expanding on that. Now you put in all your description, your character insights, your dialogue. Slowly, take your time. You’ve roughed out a human-shaped blob of clay, now it’s time to refine it into a statue.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/en7sy9j15difvuzw', 'title': 'Is it better to get all of your ideas out and write a novel quickly, or to spend years in the process of curating the story and its elements?', 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Here’s how you can do both.\n\nYou write the synopsis, all of the ideas for the story, very quickly.

Graham Troy,Updated 6y,Which is the most underrated house in Westeros?,"The Starks. Not in honor, but rather in power. They spent large amounts of money, but never get in debt to anyone. They have stormed the capital as much as every other house combined. In the Dance of the Dragons, the heir for the blacks personally went up to Winterfell, before promising a member of the royal family, just to get their swords. And they are such capable rulers that Eddard Stark commands more respect in the North than Tywin Lannister does in the Westerlands.
Remember, as soon as Tywin kicks the bucket no one is really loyal to his children.
