Harshal Deokar,Updated 5y,What are some of the new innovative startups in India?,"Rivigo.

I came across this start-up when I was reading a column in Times of India.

Rivigo is really a unique start-up,their business model,the area they work in is quite unique.

They want to revolutionize trucking and logistics in India. Logistics have become paramount part of supply chain management with rise of eCommerce and other industries.The common problem is that everyone wants faster delivery of goods. Rivigo is trying to solve this problem by their unique solution.

Mostly delivery of cargo in any industry across country is done through trucking. And trucking in India is in tumultuous shape,they face acute shortage of drivers and there are many other problems ,Truck drivers face very harsh lifestyles as they have to drive through all over India.

Many long-distance trucks have two drivers, taking turns to sleep. Other trucks have only one driver, fighting sleep (often with drugs). Rivigo has replaced this with a relay system. Each driver drives 4.5 hours to a company pit stop, and hands over to another driver who again drives 4.5 hours to the next pit stop. The relay continues till destination. This cuts delivery time for Delhi-Chennai from 96 hours to 48, and for Bengaluru-Kolkata from 110 hours to 44. This is twice the speed of some courier companies, and maximizes truck utilization.

From a pit stop, each driver catches a truck in the return direction to get home by night. The driver suddenly becomes a normal worker with a full family and community life. He gets a cellphone and good wages by village standards. His truck is air-conditioned, improving comfort and social status.

One of their product is “Full truck load” as mentioned on their website, which promises delivery Anywhere to anywhere in India in just 3 days,against the industry average of 7-8 day.

This looks like future of trucking/logistics,this can replace today’s unorganized,inefficient trucking and logistics sector in India,Which can deliver goods on time to warehouses reducing costs.May be in future this company can become Maersk of India.

I think this is very innovative start-up and based on quite unique Idea.

Edit 1 : Just woke up to 7K upvotes and an upvote from Balaji Vishwanathan sir. Thanks for the response people, Some people asked whether this is a promotion or an advertisement , So it’s not a promotion nor an advertisement, I really found this Startup innovative, thus I have written an answer regarding this.

‘Drive in India’ can generate more jobs than ‘Make in India’

Rohit Nagdewani,Updated 4y,What's your startup and how's it doing?,"Short Answer: FarmingV2; It is doing great!
Long Answer:

What is your startup -
We, at FarmingV2, grow plants without the use of soil and sunlight in a controlled environment using hydroponics as the core technology! We grow in a high density, vertical setup by enabling a lot of technologies.

We grow multiple varieties of Lettuce, Basil, Mint, Swiss Chard and some other herbs in the middle of New Delhi!
Our produce uses 80% less water than traditional soil farming and 90% less space. We grow year round since we are not dependent on weather or soil.

We accumulate data and growing patterns by monitoring multiple variables and then create a “digital recipe” which future proofs our crops thereby leading to ZERO crop failure.

We use a nutrient rich water and provide it to plants using long channels. We mimic the sunlight by using specific wavelengths and feeding it to the plants using LEDs.

How are we doing -
Great! We are completely sold out from our Delhi farm and are beginning operations in our Mumbai farm. We plan to soon expand to various Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities via organised retail.

Thank you!!

Edit (23/10/2019) - Our Mumbai farm is all set and ready for operations. 7 levels of growing. Over 4500 plants in less than 600sqft.

Rushikesh Kirtikar,1y,Why do so many startups fail?,"Back in 2012, I was participating in a competition of young startups and entrepreneurs who were presenting their ideas before a panel. There was this very enthusiastic and smart guy amongst us who seemed very excited and confident about his product. He had made a shoe which could charge your mobile battery. It produced electricity using the pressure created below your feet while walking. A mobile battery could be fitted near the foot sole which then you can later put in your phone.

Image only for reference.

It was truly a remarkable product for that time especially for people like travellers, trekkers, salesman, etc. who wouldn't find a power source often and needed to charge their phones. He had all the estimates ready of how much market it would capture and how many people it would impact. Most importantly he claimed that there is no competition for his product as it is the only of its kind in the market. He was truly impressive in his presentation and undoubtedly won the competition and a lot of praise from the judges. It was clear that the guy had put a lot of hard work on his product.

Today it is 2022 and it wouldn't take us much thought to realise why the product is useless. Most people use smartphones today which do not have replaceable batteries. That was not the case so much in 2012. Secondly, power banks have now captured the market which addresses the problem with charging phones having limited power sources. Plus the battery capacity has also been increasing.

So where did the guy fail?

In Entrepreneurship, it is generally said that one should not fall in love with the solution. But rather with the problem. Or else you would be overwhelmed by your solution and miss out other ways of looking at the problem.

So when the above guy believed that there was no competition for his product, he believed that his solution is the only solution available. He could not imagine that the problem can be solved in other ways or his solution will become redundant due to external factors. So technically a power bank manufacturer, or any mobile battery manufacturers attempting to increase its power capacity, were his potential competitors even when the products were different.

So while it is good to love your idea and your solution, a startup might fail if the ‘problem’ is not the first love. A love for the solution might close your mind, but loving the problem might just open it up.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fc2jnvasw1y4mbdr', 'title': 'Why do so many startups fail?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Back in 2012, I was participating in a competition of young startups and entrepreneurs who were presenting their ideas before a panel.

Jennifer Maiko Bradshaw,Updated 6y,What is the most catastrophic mistake made by an intern at a company?,"Not precisely an intern, but I was a flight attendant on her very first flight.

There’s one critical thing flight attendants must do on each flight, and it’s not coffee runs. Flight attendants must arm the plane doors before takeoff and disarm them before opening.

What does arming doors do, you ask?

Arming doors prepares the doors for emergencies. Disarming the doors disables the emergency functions.

I got to see firsthand what happens if you don’t disarm before opening.

We had landed. The pilot had requested the FAs to prepare the plane for disembarking.

I was looking at this:

And for a brief second, my mind went blank. My months of feverish training felt years ago. I looked at the big door handle, and the bright red arrow and OPEN sign.

I reached for the handle…

And stopped, horrified at what I almost did. I quickly switched the lever that disarmed the door, double checked, and turned to my counterpart at the opposite door, to double check that she had done the same.

She was midway through lifting the door handle. I had no time to stop her. The door opened, and with a big BANG!

The inflatable slide-raft burst out, the whole plane rocked a little, and the new FA, one of the many women who had taken training with me, stood there immobile.

The passengers were watching, concerned, so I reassured them, told them not to come near, and gently guided the FA away from the door - we were so high from the ground! - and made her sit. Silent tears rolled down her prettily made-up face.

This slide-raft is not designed with reuse in mind. It can’t just be deflated and rolled back into the plane - it’s meant to be used only in dire circumstances. The plane had to be fitted with a new raft before it could fly again - taking it out of the sky for weeks, causing a big ripple effect.

The crew was stranded in Los Angeles and a new plane had to be brought in from Vancouver. This caused big delays, fines from various airports, overtime for crew, and followup investigation.

I heard various estimates for the cost of the fallout, some up to $10 million.

The FA was let go - ostensibly not because of her mistake, but because afterward, she froze and didn’t help with damage control or ensuring safety.

Edit: Thank-you everyone for reading!
As a funny aside… I had yet another minor crisis in my very first month of FAing. A heavily substance-abused man in one of the carts for unloading bags crashed into another plane I was FAing in. It broke the air seal on the cargo hold door, necessitating repairs. This was again, at LAX, leading me to conclude that the airport was cursed. The man in question threw his badge at his superior and quit rather than undergo a drug test.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h7byejgv6ntfi5sl', 'title': 'What is the most catastrophic mistake made by an intern at a company?', 'score': {'original': 0.9974, 'ai': 0.0026}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Not precisely an intern, but I was a flight attendant on her very first flight.\n\nThere’s one critical thing flight attendants must do on each flight, and it’s not coffee runs.

Alisha Talks,Updated 3y,Which businesses took an unexpected hit because of covid-19?,"My father's business has taken a turn for the worst. Up to 70% of regular customers have vanished in the last week, and our profit has plummeted by a large margin.

I know many takeaways and restaurants are facing the same problem too. Some have already gone bust…

Yesterday evening I patiently waited for orders to come through. On a typical Sunday, we would rake up to 40 orders. This Sunday we barely reached 10.

Watching my dad on the verge of tears and frustration was difficult. It was the first Sunday in years where I simply sat for an hour, praying that the phone would ring or the chimes placed above the door would make a ting noise.

It's understandable — people are afraid of the unknown. We've become cautious and super vigilant about germs and contamination. Customers do not know the health of the person handling the dishes, so cooking at home appears to be a safer option.

I know it's only going to get worse as the weeks go by, but we are struggling and I'm stressed. My father and I are the only earners in a seven person household.

Tough and terrifying is what it's been and I know you're afraid, but please, if you can help your small, local businesses, you'd be helping us live.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 5y,Is it a good idea to start a startup straight out of college?,"Do you know what this is?

It’s called a PAYCHECK…

Do you know what happens when you bite it?

You get trapped and reeled in!

Do you know where most of your entrepreneurial dreams will end?

They will die!

It’s a slow painful death… like a fish out of water!

You will be decorated and covered with yummy “spices” and eaten!

To answer your question:

If you didn't understand my analogy here the cold hard truth…

You are a college student!
Like most students you know how to live with scarcity!
Like most students you know how to invest long sleepless nights solving projects!
Like most students, if something goes wrong you won’t end up homeless.
Like most students today you don’t have much responsibilities — it’s just you!

What happens when you get a job?

You will feel “relaxed!”
You will feel “safe!”
You will feel “successful.”
You will have your most basic needs “met.”
You will now “deserve” to buy gadgets.
You will now “deserve” to go traveling.
You will now “deserve” to go party and dine out with friends.
You will buy a car.
You will get stuck with consumer debt.
You will find time for love.
You will get married.
You will start a family.
You are officially now in the “rat race!”

Do you really think you can get out of it?

If you can — great!
PLEASE know that most people can’t!

Get started today! The sooner the better!

Hector Quintanilla,4y,What is the reality of startup life?,"“Who wants to go to Disney World?” I asked my kids.

Immediately they reacted shouting, “Me! Me! Me!”

I turned to my wife and whispered in her ear, “Project sold. We have our ‘startup team’ onboard!”

“Okay, okay! Calm down, kids. Don’t get too excited yet,” I said in a loud voice, “This will be a long trip. Florida is very far away. It will take two days to get there.”

“Only two days? Ohh, come on, dad, that’s nothing! We can take it.”

“Kids, I’m telling you this won't be easy. I can assure you this will challenge every one of us,” I said.

“No worries, Dad. We can take it. We’re ready!” my girl said confidently.

So we started planning our trip.

We did some research, paperwork, and finally packed our luggage to make this ‘project’ a reality. The motivation and excitement were enough to lift every one of us into taking care of all the details.

The day finally came. No more planning. It was time to take action! “Hop into the car,” I said, “And don’t forget your luggage!”

That day we woke up at 5:00 AM. Everyone energetically jumped out of their beds. The goal was clear: Get to Disney World! Our plan was to drive to New Orleans, sleep there and continue to Orlando the following day.

Easy, right? That’s what we thought …

As soon as we took action, reality kicked in.

“Dad, I need a restroom!”

We stopped.

Then we hit the U.S. border with two long hours of car line.

We stopped.

“Mom, I’m hungry!”

We stopped.

“Dad, are we there yet?”

“No, we still have several hours ahead of us,” I answered patiently.

Then, internal problems began to emerge, “Keep your hands to yourself!” one said.

“I didn't do anything!” the other said.

“Yes, you did!”

We stopped for a break before the conflict escalated.

Then, our resources started to become scarce. We needed gasoline but found no gas stations nearby. Patience. Uncertainty. More patience. Nerves. Uncertainty.

It took time, but we finally found one.

We stopped.

Then we bumped into an accident in the middle of the highway blocking the road. We had to use a different road to avoid all the traffic.

It took us much, much longer than expected to get to our first destination, but, finally, hotel and dinner for everyone!

Tough day, full of unexpected issues, but we successfully solved one at a time. Day one … OVER.

Early the next day, I woke up to motivate the team. “Who wants to go to Disney World?”

“Me! Me! Me!” They shouted jumping out of their beds.

“Quickly,” I said. “We have another long day ahead of us,” I told my ‘partners.’

Everyone was excited. Off we went …

A couple of hours later, problems started to happen again, “Mom?”

“Yes?” my wife asked.

“I’m dizzy!” one of our children said, followed by a long pause.

“Mom? I want to …” my kid said with his eyes popping out while holding his mouth tightly.

“HECTOR,” my wife shouted, “PUT DOWN THE WINDOW AND STOP THE CAR!”

We stopped.

Then a restroom.

We stopped.

Then gasoline.

We stopped.

A few hours later, “Dad, I’m hungry!”

We stopped.

“Mom, are we there yet?”

“Not yet, we still have a few hours ahead of us,” my wife patiently said.

Then a yellow warning light appeared on my dashboard. “CHECK ENGINE.”

I found the nearest Honda dealer. We deviated from our route, again. A few hours later, success. Issue solved. We continued.

Then emotions started to overtake us.

“Dad, I want to get out. I don’t feel like going to Orlando anymore,” my girl said impatiently.

“We’re almost there,” I said.

Emotions turned into desperation …

“DAD, ARE WE THERE YET? WILL WE EVER GET THERE?”

“Yes, we’re just a few minutes away.”

Minutes felt like hours, until FINALLY … we got there.

This is an exemplification of “the startup life.”

Expect a journey full of emotions. You will experience good days and bad days. You will work hard with little-to-no progress and multiple unexpected roadblocks along the way.

That’s okay. That’s the road everyone goes through on their way to “Disney World.”

We all start with a dream. We plan. That’s easy!

The real adventure starts the moment we get moving, and like on any road trip, your PATIENCE will be tested.

But, hey! Cheer up! Remember that “Disney World” awaits you at your destination!

My advice: Control your attitude!

Remember that the “adventure” that leads to your destination is also part of your overall “Disney Trip” experience!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/advx26kh3scityl9', 'title': 'What is the reality of startup life?', 'score': {'original': 0.9336, 'ai': 0.0664}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""“Who wants to go to Disney World?” I asked my kids.\n\nImmediately they reacted shouting, “Me!

We had to use a different road to avoid all the traffic.\n\nIt took us much, much longer than expected to get to our first destination, but, finally, hotel and dinner for everyone!\n\nTough day, full of unexpected issues, but we successfully solved one at a time. Day one … OVER.\n\nEarly the next day, I woke up to motivate the team. “Who wants to go to Disney World?”\n\n“Me! Me! Me!” They shouted jumping out of their beds.\n\n“Quickly,” I said. “We have another long day ahead of us,” I told my ‘partners.’\n\nEveryone was excited. Off we went …\n\nA couple of hours later, problems started to happen again, “Mom?”\n\n“Yes?” my wife asked.\n\n“I’m dizzy!” one of our children said, followed by a long pause.\n\n“Mom? I want to …” my kid said with his eyes popping out while holding his mouth tightly.\n\n“HECTOR,” my wife shouted, “PUT DOWN THE WINDOW AND STOP THE CAR!”\n\nWe stopped.\n\nThen a restroom.\n\nWe stopped.\n\nThen gasoline.\n\nWe stopped.\n\nA few hours later, “Dad, I’m hungry!”\n\nWe stopped.\n\n“Mom, are we there yet?”\n\n“Not yet, we still have a few hours ahead of us,” my wife patiently said.\n\nThen a yellow warning light appeared on my dashboard. “CHECK ENGINE.”\n\nI found the nearest Honda dealer. We deviated from our route, again. A few hours later, success. Issue solved. We continued.\n\nThen emotions started to overtake us.\n\n“Dad, I want to get out. I don’t feel like going to Orlando anymore,” my girl said impatiently.\n\n“We’re almost there,” I said.\n\nEmotions turned into desperation …\n\n“DAD, ARE WE THERE YET? WILL WE EVER GET THERE?”\n\n“Yes, we’re just a few minutes away.”\n\nMinutes felt like hours, until FINALLY … we got there.\n\nThis is an exemplification of “the startup life.”\n\nExpect a journey full of emotions. You will experience good days and bad days. You will work hard with little-to-no progress and multiple unexpected roadblocks along the way.\n\nThat’s okay. That’s the road everyone goes through on their way to “Disney World.”\n\nWe all start with a dream. We plan. That’s easy!\n\nThe real adventure starts the moment we get moving, and like on any road trip, your PATIENCE will be tested.\n\nBut, hey! Cheer up! Remember that “Disney World” awaits you at your destination!\n\nMy advice: Control your attitude!\n\nRemember that the “adventure” that leads to your destination is also part of your overall “Disney Trip” experience!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9336
Guy D. McCardle,2y,How did Sara Blakely become a billionaire?,"How Sara Blakely Turned $5,000 into $1 Billion

** Every time I see a photo of Sara Blakely, she has a huge smile on her face. I’d probably walk around with a big grin, too, if I had a billion dollars.

After two attempts of taking the LSAT (Law School Admission Test) and scoring miserably, Blakely moved from Clearwater, Florida to Orlando to work at Disney World. It turns out she was two inches too short to fill out the Goofy costume, so she spent all day making sure patrons were securely buckled into a ride at Epcot.

Three months of that was quite enough for anyone, so she took another job. Selling fax machines door to door for a company called Danka.

Wearing any business attire in Florida is simply miserable, and Blakely said she simply could not stand the way she felt when she was wearing pantyhose.

To make a long story short, she cut the feet out of her pantyhose and figured she might be onto something. She spent evenings researching hosiery in a college library and eventually developed a foundation undergarment for women. To save $3,000 in legal fees, she wrote her own patent from a Barnes & Noble textbook.

She called her new product “Spanx” because she thought it sounded funny and memorable and also because she heard that products that ended in the letter “X” tended to sell well.

She found an old textile mill in North Carolina to make her first batch of product and gave them all of her $5000 live savings to do it. She took the finished goods and managed to sell them to Nieman Marcus.

Spanx now has factories in 15 countries. It sells ridiculously well.

In 2012, at the age of 41, Sara Blakely became the world's youngest female self-made billionaire.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/iqy4zklurxwoedf0', 'title': 'How did Sara Blakely become a billionaire?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""How Sara Blakely Turned $5,000 into $1 Billion\n\n** Every time I see a photo of Sara Blakely, she has a huge smile on her face.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,"If a startup has a great product, then why don't people buy it still?","Startup mistake:

“I have a great product. Come and buy it!”

“I have the best business idea. You should invest in it!”

“My product is the best in the market. I deserve your money!”

—

I’ve made this mistake so many times, it’s painful!

It’s probably one of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs make when starting their business.

The challenge is to make decisions RATIONALLY, not emotionally.

Entrepreneurship is complex because we act on our emotions, but we should make all decisions with data. Without the proper guidance and discipline, it's very easy to make mistakes.

Now, there’s no negative judgment of failures, just lessons and growth. You'd be surprised, though, how history repeats itself over and over again down through the ages. The most successful companies and entrepreneurs have learned this the hard way.

Examples:

1957 — Ford Edsel

Ford invested $400 million into the car, but Americans wanted smaller, more economic vehicles. FAILED.

1975 — Sony Betamax

Sony kept Betamax proprietary, meaning that the market for VHS products quickly outpaced Betamax. FAILED.

1985 — New Coke

The ""Pepsi Challenge"" ads were responsible for Coca-Cola trying to create a product that would taste more like Pepsi. FAILED.

1993 — Apple Newton

Apple's great idea was ahead of its time. The technology wasn't there yet. FAILED.

Source: Wikimedia

2006 — Microsoft Zune

The Zune was targeted to take over Apple’s iPod. It didn't. FAILED.

2006 — HD-DVD

HD-DVD was the hi-def replacement to DVD, but Sony led with Blu-ray built into their Playstation console. FAILED.

2009 — The Nook

Amazon's Kindle is cheaper and syncs up easily with Amazon’s account. FAILED.

2014 — Amazon's Fire Phone

Amazon's Fire Phone released in 2014 looked competitive. Amazon discontinued the phone 13 months after its launch. FAILED.

2019 — Google+

“Google+ was one of the most ambitious bets in the company’s history,” Eric Schmidt wrote in his book, How Google Works. It was believed that it would be a Facebook killer. FAILED.

To answer your question, if a startup has a great product, why aren't people still buying it?

People don't buy products or services — they buy results, benefits and solutions.

PUSHING your products and services to the consumer is a recipe for failure.

Startups commonly fail because they waste their most scarce resource (cash) on advertising and promotions. The ‘in’ reality is that marketing goes in one ear and right out the other.

Solution?

Figure out your niche in the market; DON’T try to sell to everyone.
Understand their hurts and their frustrations. Why is it that they will buy your product? Example: people don’t buy eyeglasses, they buy vision, the benefit!
Learn to feel like them to a point to deeply understand them.
Communicate their problem in their language. Listen to them, don't guess what they want — talk to them. What you think they need is very commonly not what they want.
Test your market BEFORE scaling.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sufk24m0bdwx1og3', 'title': ""If a startup has a great product, then why don't people buy it still?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Startup mistake:\n\n“I have a great product.

Udit Prasad,Updated 6y,What are some of the new innovative startups in India?,"Graviky Labs

It is one of the few carbon capturing startups in the world and only such startup in India.

It is taking stock of the growing pollution situation in the country by creating paint and ink from pollution itself.

The startup has built a contraption (Kaalink) that gets connected to the exhaust on the tail pipe of a vehicle, and once it is done collecting the raw carbon, the soot, it take it through a purification process which successfully converts that air pollution into printing ink.

A Kaalink won't stop carbon dioxide gas from going into the air and exacerbating climate change, but it does target carbon soot that contributes to dangerous form of pollution called PM 2.5.

According to the team, it takes just 45 minutes worth of vehicle emissions to produce enough ink for one pen.

The company has said that they have cleaned 1.6 trillion litres of air so far.

“Pollution is nothing but the resources we are not harvesting. We allow them to disperse because we’ve been ignorant of their value.”

Kush Agarwal,Updated 6y,What went wrong at Snapdeal?,"What went wrong at Snapdeal?

Analysts have their own views, VCs have their views, customers say service was bad and offers went away, Snapdeal says competition killed them.

Here’s a sellers point of view.

SELLERS RUN ECOMMERCE MARKETPLACE. NO SELLERS = NO SALES

Kill sellers, kill marketplace.

Happy sellers - profitable marketplace.

A short video clip for you to see. This is the last time Mr. Ratan Tata publicly associated with Snapdeal or Kunal Bahl.

Start at 40 Minute.

It was January 2016, I stood up nervously in front of Mr. Tata and 1000s of people and asked Kunal Bahl whether his company would survive without the loyalty of sellers.

1 Year after that, his company is going out of his hands.

Here is the actual account of what happened wrong at Snapdeal from an insider view with proper timeline.

I am a manufacturer and exporter. I wanted to bring export quality goods in India and the best option which worked out for us in a profitable way was by becoming a seller on Snapdeal.

We became a seller on Snapdeal in 2013 and for 2 years we have minted money.

Everyday there were more than 1000 B2C orders which we had never anticipated, the managers at Snapdeal were very warm in their approach, I was giving the best prices to them which even they could not find anywhere.

As Snapdeal was filling my capacity, I never even looked at any other marketplace.

Every 15 days I used to be in Snapdeal office to know what to plan for future.

Meanwhile I started selling on Flipkart in 2014 end and other marketplaces as we had increased our production capacity.

Hell broke loose in November 2014 when Snapdeal blocked my account!

Reason - You dispatched “wrong product” to the customer.

On analysing data, I found that out of 20,000 orders in a month, 17 orders had such a problem out of which only 10 were genuine and balance were customers claims. Dispatch process is a manual process and every process has a margin for error.

Nevertheless, we tried to explain the same to Snapdeal along with an improvement plan but they still kept us blocked for a month.

The managers whom I used to interact on a daily basis gave up their efforts as they could not find the policy maker who framed such a useless policy.

In a single day, 10 of these managers resigned from Snapdeal. (These managers still work with me in whichever organisation they have gone).

Scary? It gets scarier.

I soon got in touch with many sellers across the country and found out they were also having similar experiences, and there was no access to the top management.

At this point of time we were not facing any problem of payments from Snapdeal.

Then this happened.

To attract sellers, Snapdeal to open fulfilment centres in 15 more cities

A welcome move, with a foolish implementation.

We sellers already had big enough warehouses to cater to the orders which Snapdeal was giving us. And the stock in our warehouse could be sold on Flipkart and other sales avenues also. (Amazon was very limited at that time).

Snapdeal’s logic to open their warehouses was to ensure on time and correct dispatch and fast delivery. And also to rake more funding against these warehouses from investors.

So where is the Problem?

Unlike Flipkart and Amazon today, Snapdeal rolled out this service for free to sellers.

But sellers were not keen to send stock over there due to various operational issues and were happy dispatching from their own warehouses. (Dropshipping)

This is where Snapdeal started having its downfall.

They made the first of the numerous changes in their system.

Snapdeal put a cap on the daily orders that a seller could dropship, in my case it was 5 orders per day. Reason? So that sellers would be forced to use warehouses.

Effect, the warehouses of one region were not big enough to accommodate all sellers. This led to products being shown as out of stock on Snapdeal.

Second change, now a new change was made, the Central team in Delhi would create an ASR (Advance Stock Receipt) of the goods that you could send to the warehouse, this would take upto 7 days to get generated. (In Amazon you yourself generate ASR). At the same time, goods were not showing in stock on Snapdeal.

This used to be a big problem during peak season, and this would lead to stock being stranded at sellers warehouse, or stocks being inwarded post the season, which would lead to clogging of Snapdeal’s warehouse.

Third Change, as sellers has no option, they would have to send all goods to the warehouses, so even slow moving and newly introduced products were sent to the warehouses, this would clog the warehouses. So they started a new policy, only high moving products will be allowed in priority to the warehouse. Who decides high moving? Some “Algorithm”.

Here I will give you an example, suppose the Algorithm was introduced in May, at that time, Ice Creams were high moving, and Sweaters were slow moving.

So Algorithm likes ice cream, hates sweaters.

So in Diwali, it wants ice cream in warehouse, and no sweater.

Result, in demand goods were not available on Snapdeal, out of demand goods were jamming their warehouses.

Consequently, the in demand goods were available to sell and buy on Flipkart and Amazon.

By now Snapdeal had lost the plot and sellers were recalling inventory from warehouses so that they could be sold on other channels.

Fourth change, they refused the sellers to call back inventory from warehouses.

Now, as there were no sales, sellers stopped sending inventory to Snapdeal warehouses and stopped concentrating at Snapdeal.

I will give my example : I deal in trousers, Size 28 and 40 were available for sale as they were in Snapdeal warehouse, but balance sizes were not available as I did not want to send goods to their warehouse and Snapdeal did not want me to dropship. As a result, if Snapdeal would advertise my product, a customer would like the image and go in to order it, but could not find the size that would fit him. So customer would search same product on Flipkart and buy from me over there.

I win, customer wins, Snapdeal loses.

Now again a change around November 2015. Snapdeal said now they will charge warehousing fees from sellers. And those sellers who did not want to pay could take their goods back.

What do sellers do? Ask for goods back.

It took Snapdeal 2 months to remove those goods and send to the sellers.

Now its the fun part, as the sellers have now got all their goods back, they reconcile their inventory.

Sent Goods - Sold Goods + Customer Return - Goods recalled from warehouse = 0.

But 0 never happened.

Inventories worth crores was lost at their warehouses. Snapdeal gave claims to lot of sellers and is still giving claims to sellers.

The managers at the warehouses were caught stealing goods.

Due to all this, the Cost of Selling on Snapdeal was increasing day by day. Many more foolish policies were introduced by some unknown MBA clowns who did not know sh*t about ecommerce selling. As a result, sellers had increased their prices on Snapdeal compared to the prices prevailing on other cheaper selling options.

Meanwhile, groups of sellers and I were trying to get the solution implemented at Snapdeal. But there was no deciding authority who could solve these things. The decisive authority was packed in some room, inaccessible to all the sellers and executives.

So we tried to reach out to the CEO Kunal Bahl. Hundreds of sellers tried to get in touch with him at different times, he never responded or felt like solving problems of any sellers.

Such companies always go down.

From January 2015 to December 2016, Snapdeal was a failing company which was running only a gimmick. Talks of being profitable, IPO etc were just to grab cheap publicity

Does that mean that Snapdeal is bad?

No.

The mistakes which Snapdeal made in 2015, Flipkart made in 2016 and Amazon is making in 2017.

Lot of people ask me which is the best marketplace for sellers.

I have only 1 standard reply, Today it is Amazon, last year it was Flipkart, Before that Snapdeal, next year who knows.

Some people will say Flipkart is going strong, they acquired Myntra, Jabong etc they are doing huge profit etc. But this I will answer the day when I find the same question on Quora regarding Flipkart.

UPDATE 1

Never knew i would get 6k upvotes for this.

Somehow Snapdeal has not contacted me regarding this yet.

Today there was an update that Flipkart offered Snapdeal 800 million for buy out which Snapdeal rejected.

Words of caution for Flipkart - there are unrecorded liabilities to sellers and service providers which you have not taken up in your due diligence. These can be part of future litigations where you might be ordered to pay up crores. I know you do not have any intention of paying those liabilities as such liabilities exist in Flipkart also, but why take a chance?

Word of caution for Snapdeal - sell now. You have no asset, no value. Your brand value is 0, your value addition is 0. One of your JV with Den TV was sold for 10 crores. Seems you want to sell Snapdeal at a similiar rate.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,"If most startups fail, why risk starting one?","Tell me something…

Do you trust strangers?
Isn't it risky to trust strangers?

Well, hold that answer for 5 seconds …

Now let me take you to a job fair:

I’m going to throw you into this room full of strangers so you can find a job and “feel” safe …

Isn't this what a “safe job” is? Entrusting your career, your future, your life, your talent, your full potential, your passion, your dreams, your freedom, your family’s financial security to the hands of a stranger?

What if these “strangers” are not making the right decisions?
What if these “strangers” can’t afford you anymore?
What if these “strangers” don't need you anymore?
What if these “strangers” can simply replace you with a robot or AI?

As our world evolves into the new economy — it is predicted that automation will take over millions of “safe industrial-age jobs.”

During bad economic times, it's the employees who lose their job, not the business owners.
As you get older, fatigue will remind you what risk looks like.
As technology advances, if you don't stay relevant, you are at a bigger risk of being disrupted.
I teach on my website, “Ignorance will be the #1 reason for poverty in the decades ahead.” — Being under-educated in the Digital Age is risky.
The source of wealth in the Digital Age is information and knowledge.[1]
Following the old “Industrial Age” mindset is risky.
Believing that a college degree will guarantee you financial freedom is risky.

I could go on and on, but here’s the bottom line…

Why risk starting your business?

To take control of YOUR life!

Be 100% accountable for YOUR destiny. Sadly, we live in a very selfish world, nobody cares about you or me. NOT your government leaders, your teachers, your social security workers, your boss… nobody!

Please remember this:

Waking up every morning in this changing world is risky!

The rules of the Industrial Age don't work anymore! What worked for our parents won’t work for us anymore! A job is not safe anymore!

Anonymous,Updated 10y,"What is your favorite ""going the extra mile"" customer services story?","I was travelling by Singapore Airlines some time in the 80's from Mumbai to Singapore at a time where air travel was a big thing in India. Being a strict vegetarian (don't eat any meat or even eggs) I had requested accordingly to the airline and received confirmation to that an Asian vegetarian meal would be arranged for me.

However the airline forgot to carry the meal for me and when they realized that the air hostess was very apologetic about it. She then went and informed the captain who also came out and offered his apologies. After that the air hostess cooked up some rice and cut up some fruits that she was carrying for herself and offered them to me.

Once I arrived at the airport the duty manager was waiting for me at the airport and offered his apologies and personally ensured that I was given the best treatment that they could offer from porters to carry the luggage and a limo drop to my hotel.

On my return flight was upgraded to first class and the cabin crew was informed what had happened and they took special care of me.

Once I reached my office in Bombay Singapore airlines sent me a huge box of chocolates and the country head came to my office to apologize personally.

Gayle Laakmann McDowell,6y,What's the worst experience you've had in your work field?,"Six weeks into my Microsoft internship, I sat down for my checkpoint review discussion with my “mentor” and my “manager.” This was probably only my second time meeting with my “manager”, since my mentor was really acting as my manager (this was typical for Microsoft internships).

Checkpoint Review

My mentor began reading the evaluation, and all seemed great. All positive stuff. Yay!

Then my manager takes over for the final parts, where he explains that he’s given me a no hire recommendation—on the sole grounds that I don’t check in my code often enough. I explained that I hadn’t finished the feature yet; should I really be checking in something that’s incomplete? (Apparently, yes.)

This seemed like a ridiculous reason for a no-hire. Why hadn’t they just told me earlier? It wasn’t like I was refusing to check in my code. I just didn’t realize I should be.

I went back to my office and checked in my code immediately.

HR Meeting

Follow-up meeting with HR: I explain that I’m alarmed that my mentor/manager would no-hire me for this, rather than just telling me to correct the issue in the beginning.

Don’t worry about it, they say. Fix the issue, and proactively solicit feedback from your mentor, just in case there’s anything else lurking.

Final Review

I’ve been really stressed since my checkpoint review. I’ve worked extra hard and I have been regularly asking my mentor feedback (and of course checking in my code frequently). All is looking good. But, after my last review, I just don’t know what will happen.

My mentor starts off reading it the evaluation. He’s liked my code, progress, etc. All good stuff.

Again, my manager takes over for the final recommendation. Again, no hire. Again, I’m totally caught off guard.

He has three reasons stated:

I don’t self-advocate enough (basically, I’m not boastful enough of my own accomplishments).
Some major bugs in my code.
I’ve “missed several key deadlines that has resulted in the team having to pick up the slack.”

#1 seems like a weird reason for a no-hire, but it’s too subjective to argue with. I have no idea what he’s talking about with #2 or #3. What major bugs? And deadlines? I never saw any deadlines. All I know was my summer goals had only one feature listed, and I was onto the second or third now. Was I behind some schedule I never saw?

He explains that he would be fine with me working elsewhere at Microsoft, just not his team (which, fyi, is kind of messed up). No hire.

After the Meeting

My mentor stops by my office and tells me that, for what it’s worth, he did not agree with the conclusion of that meeting or the negative feedback given. All that negative stuff, the no-hire—this all came from my manager, but he (my mentor) is powerless to overrule the manager (who is his manager as well).

Now, I realize the weird disconnect in my checkpoint review. The positive stuff all came from my mentor. The negative feedback and no-hires came from my manager, who had essentially zero involvement with me.

What the…

Another developer (who I’d worked with very closely) overhears the conversation, and asks me what’s going on. I show her the evaluation. She’s very confused as well. She can’t think of what these “major bugs” are. And the deadlines? I was ahead of schedule and work had been transferred from her plate to mine.

So, yeah. My manager, who had essentially no interaction with me, was lying on my review to prevent me from being hired—and overruling people who actually worked with me.

I appealed the decision to my manager’s manager, who changed it to a “hire.” I really, really didn’t want to go back to that team, but a “no hire” would pose an issue with future Microsoft interviews.

A few years later, I bumped into some people on my old team. Apparently this manager had a string of issues with female developers—unfairly disparaging their work, taking credit for things they’ve done, and so on.

I can’t say for sure why he was so against me (I have my obvious guesses), but whatever it was, it was enough to make him lie.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/68b1jnsopx79qehf', 'title': ""What's the worst experience you've had in your work field?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9305, 'ai': 0.0695}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Six weeks into my Microsoft internship, I sat down for my checkpoint review discussion with my “mentor” and my “manager.” This was probably only my second time meeting with my “manager”, since my mentor was really acting as my manager (this was typical for Microsoft internships).\n\nCheckpoint Review\n\nMy mentor began reading the evaluation, and all seemed great.

Asim Qureshi,6y,What is the all-time greatest failed Internet startup?,"The most hilarious one is definitely Karhoo.

Founded in early 2015, by the end of the year Karhoo had raised a reported US$250m, and expected to launch its app 3 months later in London, New York and Singapore after apparently securing a network of 200,000 taxis and minicabs.

It planned to raise US$1bn in mid 2017.

The CEO and founder, Daniel Ishag, planned to take on Uber and “…level the playing field.”

A year after the reported US$250m raise and six months after the app launch, it shut down its service, with all the money blown, and with more than 100 staff out-of-pocket - ok, that’s the not so funny bit.

It later emerged that Karhoo had actually raised closer to US$30m, and the US$250m was just bullshit.

The incredible lack of financial controls were highlighted by Daniel’s own spending on the company’s credit cards - first class flights, designer shoes, £5,000 on vet bills for his pet dog!

The dog must have been wondering what the heck was going on. And now he’s back to his dog’s life, he’s probably still trying to figure out what the heck happened.

The odd thing is that it’s this type of bullshit and hype that sometimes gets entrepreneurs very very far.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 3y,What happens to the founders after big tech acquisitions?,"WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum — both former employees of Yahoo!

In September 2007, they took about a year off for traveling around South America. After buying an iPhone, they saw opportunity in the growing App Store.

In February 2009, they incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California.

After many bugs and failures, the app suddenly started to gain momentum. With growth, however, the costs quickly started to add up, so they occasionally switched the app from ""free"" to $0.99 so they wouldn't grow too fast.

A few years later, in February 2013, WhatsApp’s user base had grown to about 200 million active users and 50 employees. Sequoia would invest $50 million, valuing WhatsApp at $1.5 billion.

In February 2014, just a few months after Sequoia’s round, Facebook, Inc. announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion — its largest acquisition to date.

What happened to the founders after WhatsApp’s acquisition?

Both founders were hired by Mark Zuckerberg to continue growing the platform.

Four years later, they decided to leave Facebook with polarized opinions on how to monetize the app. “At the end of the day, I sold my company,” Acton told Forbes. “I sold my users’ privacy to a larger benefit. I made a choice and a compromise. I live with that every day.”

Michael W.,1y,Why did RadioShack go bankrupt?,"Radio Shack was the place to go for hobbyists - they sold electronic parts of all kinds, and not just for the hobbyist who was soldering things together. If you needed a COAX extension cable for your TV, that was just about the only place to go.

That “only place to go” gave the stores - the parent company - an overinflated sense of self. They sold “Realistic” brand stereo equipment at prices that were comparable to the name brands of the day. People tended to only buy it when it was on sale, or when taking advantage of the store’s layaway or payment plan options.

But I will never forget walking into Radio Shack here in Canada in 1990, and asking for a box of 3.5″ HD 1.44MB floppy disks. At the time, they were running anywhere between $35 and $45 for a box of 10, with SONY branded disks being the most expensive, but having an over-the-counter warranty for exchange on any defective floppy.

Radio Shack wanted $100 for a box of 10 “Tandy” brand 3.5″ HD disks. More than double the best name brand out there. The clerk at the counter made it sound like they were jumping off the shelves. So much so that they didn’t even stock any other brands.

But dealing with Radio Shack became difficult. They wanted your name and address on any purchase including small cash purchases, and they peddled an extended warranty on everything, including individually packaged batteries. Imagine being offered a warranty on a $3 watch battery - one that is identical to every other battery. How do you expect to get a refund or replacement on a battery, that is expected to wear out, when it’s not uniquely identifiable?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/i987pzeya3jsc1br', 'title': 'Why did RadioShack go bankrupt?', 'score': {'original': 0.9983, 'ai': 0.0017}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Radio Shack was the place to go for hobbyists - they sold electronic parts of all kinds, and not just for the hobbyist who was soldering things together.

How can the net worth of any app-based services like Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, Uber, or Byju's be assessed fairly and realistically on a sound economic basis?
Its Simple How much is the Technology Worth? How Legal and Easy is it to recreate the same App? Thats it. More than Enough Lets take Zomato What is their Technology? An App which uses GPS (Generic) to connect food delivery boys with their customers after the customers place orders with various restaurants Is it Unique? No. You have more than 1500 Apps worldwide doing the absolute same thing and in many cases far better and more interactive than Zomato Are there any Assets? No. Literally Zilch. Generic GPS, Generic Licensed Encryption, Generic Programming , Even the Scooters and Uniforms are not their own What is their Worth? Ans - Rs. 1 LAKH CRORE What should be their worth based on any Conventional Model? Ans - Rs. 139 Crore at the Most How much is it bloated by? Ans - 700 Times Lets take Byjus What is their Technology? Generic Tablets and Apps with access to Coaching and Training Materials for Education Purposes Is it Unique? No! You have 50 such Apps in India itself and over 10,000 such Apps worldwide Are there any Assets? Zilch. None. Again No Technology. Just some Tablets, Uniforms. Offices are Rented. Is the Course Content Unique? No. Standard Course Content. Of course the Teaching Materials are Custom Made Valuation? Ans - Rs. 1, 27,500 Crore !!!!! One Point Two Seven Five TRILLION!!!! What should be their worth based on Conventional Model? Ans - Rs. 640 Crore at the MOST HOw much is it Bloated by? Ans - 200 Times at the very least even BEFORE IPO Have you heard of Mass Hypnosis? Magicians like David Copperfield etc perform magic tricks like making the Statue of Liberty disappear or PC Sorkar making a Train disappear That is exactly what is happening with these Indian Apps. A Bunch of Educated yet utterly naive gentlemen are convinced using Technical Terms that our Old Conventional Method of Valuation is ancient and worthless and some modern methods of valuation exist wherein any junk can be valued in lakhs of crores using a combo of the words “Interactive” + “Customer Base” + “Platform” + “Expansion” etc. These Halfwits convince more Quarter wits until finally - you have a Mass Hysteria of Speculation which will lead to a bubble - 1000 times worse than Evergrande. Not one of these Apps has got - (a) Unique Business Model (b) First Global Advantage (c) Unique Certified Technology (d) Global Customer Base There is no difference between Bunty Taxi wallah and Ola There is no difference between Gupta Aunty Tiffin Service and Zomato Just Businesses which are on a much Larger Scale.

This is my response to Kanthaswamy’s answer on Zomato and BYJUS valuation being flawed.

Here’s what I think:

I agree with you on the fact that there are thousands of companies that are doing the same thing as BYJUS or Zomato. But how are they performing so much better than others? It’s because they have mastered their product better than anyone else.

I feel Mr. Kanthswamy’s take on issues is negative and he tries to find fault with everything using some stats he found somewhere on the internet. I read publications such as Forbes, Time of India, The New York Times, The Economist, etc and I’d rather believe in the facts presented by reputable new agencies over a Quora influencer.

One does not have to come up with a groundbreaking, first-of-its-kind idea in order to have a big valuation. While the idea acts as a crux, how its implemented plays a crucial role in success. BYJUS or Zomato might not have the factors outlined by Mr. Kanthaswamy i.e., Unique Business Model, First Global Advantage, Unique Certified Technology or Global Customer Base but they offer the best product among its competitors and therefore, they have a higher growth potential. While Zomato is purely domestic at the moment, I think BYJUS does have a global customer base, considering all the new acquisitions and recent company developments.

The biggest advantage they have is, Zomato and BYJUS started the company at the right time, when the market was largely untapped. That’s why, they are way ahead of other brands which are mimicking their products.

Honestly, I don’t think the valuation of both companies is “bloated”. Just because someone cannot see the future potential does not mean the company is faking it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zvko974lpgnr26d3', 'title': ""How can the net worth of any app-based services like Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, Uber, or Byju's be assessed fairly and realistically on a sound economic basis?"", 'score': {'original': 0.82765, 'ai': 0.17235}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam\n · 2y\nHow can the net worth of any app-based services like Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, Uber, or Byju's be assessed fairly and realistically on a sound economic basis?\nIts Simple How much is the Technology Worth?

Randall Reade,Updated 5y,"While listening to a start up pitch, did you ever hear something that made you say, “you can’t be serious…”?","Oh yes. Many times. One was a guy who came up with the bright idea of competing with Airbnb. He had no money, no product, no management team, just an idea. And the idea was that Airbnb is a mediocre experience for users, and so he was going to do the same thing but provide a “five star” experience. The website would be better, the hosts would be better prepared, and that was about it. He wanted money to build this out, but had no clue how he was going to get customers or compete against Airbnb.

Another guy had a coding team that had worked for two years and blew through $200K of his own money to develop a software program that would take a picture of you and then you could try on glasses, jewelry and other things and see how they would look on you from a variety of angles. I didn’t have the heart to tell him his technology is already out there, and so he wasted all his time and money.

Another guy had a small box that you wear around your neck, almost like jewelry. This device was a medical device, though, that could tell you instantly your heart rate, temperature and other things. I asked him about competition, and he said there was no competition — nothing else like it on the market. So I took out my phone and did a search on Amazon, and found a dozen devices just like his for sale already. I showed him them and said, “you mean these things are different from yours?” He got rather angry, turned away and walked away from me.

Another guy wanted $300M to build an office building with tv studios so he could launch a tv network that would compete against Fox. He was sure it would be a huge success despite having zero experience in the tv industry.

My associate met someone at a pitch competition who just needed about $80K to finish his app. He asked him how long has he been developing this app, and he said five years. Then he asked him how much money has he spent so far, and he said $500K. But if he just had another $80K, he could finish the app within a few months, it’s just that his family won’t give him any more money.

I just had a company tell me that they have a valuation of $233 million, despite being pre-revenue. I was shocked, and I asked what that was based on. They had paid a big consulting firm and they based it on the fact that some company that had a product similar to theirs, but not as many features, recently sold for close to $200M, but since they “plan” to include many more features, it would surely be worth much more. I pretty much laughed in his face and warned him to never, ever tell anyone this or they will be laughed off the stage.

This name came into my mind after reading the question.

Dubin launched a bootstrapped beta site in 2011, which he ran from his apartment.

He spent $4500 and produced a video by starring himself, the video begins with him asking:

Are our blades any good?
No. Our blades are f***ing great!

The video was launched on March 6, 2012 (coincidentally, the same day Dubin and business partner Levine closed a $1 million funding round with various seed investors in California).

It immediately went viral, and the startup received more than 12,000 orders in the first two days.

Dollar Shave Club delivers razors and other personal grooming products to customers by mail. It delivers razor blades on a monthly basis and offers additional grooming products for home delivery.

The company successfully eliminate barriers to subscription trials with the business’ low-cost model and anytime cancellation policy with no additional charges and built a business with a more efficient supply chain not beholden to traditional retailers.

Dollar Shave Club’s supply model is also highly cost-effective. The company sources its blades and other men’s grooming products from China and South Korea and manages inventory from a single distribution centre.

By 2015, Dollar Shave Club was the number-one online razor company with a 52.4% share of the market, compared with Gillette’s 21.2%.

Consumer goods company Unilever saw the writing on the wall, and in July 2016 purchased Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion.

Anonymous,6y,What went wrong at Snapdeal?,"I had worked very closely with Snapdeal and still work with them. I have known most of their senior management team personally and that’s the reason for going anonymous.

Kunal Bahl was considered as one of the smartest startup CEOs when the whole ecommerce startups industry was booming. He was smart enough to raise funds in billions and flip the business models on such a large scale. Snapdeal turned to ecommerce portal overnight from deal website and then to marketplace. It was all happening very fast and it went on very smoothly but still snapdeal failed.

Soon it became the market leaders in Electronics & FMCG categories but things went downhill the moment it reached the peak. Success is not when you reach the top spot but you maintain your success. Many things contributed to Snapdeal’s failure and being very close partner of Snapdeal and do understand the downfall from 6 Billion to less than billion.

Neck-less Hiring - It was not just hiring but was mass hiring and just not mass hiring, it was random mass hiring. Most of the hiring was done via references, no selection processes. Deserving people stayed outside, non deserving were inside. I remember meeting Business leaders of Snapdeal with almost zero to no knowledge of business. Most of the times, post meetings the words were “how the hell did he got hired”. Huge amount of early joining Bonuses were distributed like cakes. In early days, SNapdeal bosted of women-men ration of 2:1 and guess what Snapdeal’s office looked more of Fashion event than an ecommerce company. (trust me, it was an visual treat to visit snapdeal office, those of you who have visited their Okhla office will agree) - Not sure what all these woman were doing. Paychecks were offered double to triple of what the candidates deserved. (Guy earning 50k in previous job were offered 2 lac for the same job and this was not 1/100 case but in majority). No KRA’s, no job responsibilities, no targets set the entire team loose. Come to office, play games, go for breaks, head for company sponsored parties in evening and go home.

Corruption: Was surprised to know that even the senior management was involved in the corruption. You are lesser known brand and if were ready to offer 1% of sales to the team, boom your products were everywhere. People made tons of money in this whole corruption. Cash was delivered to Manager’s home in lacs (seen 25lac being delivered at one of the manager’s place. His dad received the money and this was just for a month). Possibly the first flag I got that this is not going to take long for snapdeal to disappear from the market. Managers opening asking and accepting bribes. I remember bringing this in notice to the Senior VP and he immediately bounced back with completely senseless arguments. He was not even ready to accept the fact when 6 out of 10 people in the meeting said the same thing. I know many senior people from snapdeal who are now jobless just because everyone in the industry know their corruption history.

Failed Strategy - When snapdeal switched to the market place, they failed to sanitize the product categories. Fake products, illegal product listings, poor customer services, delayed deliveries, no exclusive launches, no big brand tie-ups. They have to close down the FMCG categories for same reasons.

Missing Seller Arm - They missed the seller arm alike WSR is to flipkart and Cloutail is to amazon. This was much needed thing for snapdeal to stay in the market. WSR and Cloudtail played very important role in building up the customer trusts. Most of the top sellers moved to AMazon/Flipkart because of better working and better opportunities. Top sellers din’t felt valued enough in Snapdeal and were desperately looking for opportunities outside snapdeal which was offered by amazon/flipkart

Failed Shopping - Snapdeal acquired 12 companies in their 6 years tenure and failed to leverage any of the opportunities. This was like a brainless shopping spree by soon to be wedded bride who shopped for pointless things which she was never going to use post wedding. Funfact: the wedding never happened. One of the worst investments of snapdeal was joint venture with DEN and Freecharge. They failed to ripe the benefits of both.

By Oct 2016, snapdeal was a sinking ship with over 6k people on board, it needed more money to feed those 6k people, it needed more money to fund those big paychecks, money was needed for those after office parties and nobody knew how to make money.

Abhishek Gupta,Updated 3y,"What, according to you, is WhiteHat Jr?","WhiteHat Jr. is the startup that gained a lot of popularity after the New Education Policy.

But is it really beneficial? I don’t think so.

A day before yesterday, I came to know about WhiteHat Jr through an advertisement, then I started searching for what it actually is. So, what WhiteHat Jr. does is, it just teaches students how to build an App/Website, which many people will think that it is really beneficial to start coding at this age and I saw a video on YouTube/LinkedIn where a 7-year-old kid was building an app while learning from WHJ.

Then how come is it not beneficial? Let’s find out.

What coding really is? Is it just building an App/Website? NO

Anyone can build an App if you provide all the code needed for it just like what WHJ does, what matters is the thinking process, how does your mind process a question/task given to you which WHJ doesn’t provide. And for these things, one needs to do Real-World things so that the Brain doesn’t get used to typing some pre-given Codes and not thinking of anything. A child learning from WHJ might build a good app, but he would never know how to convert Decimal to Binary.

So why is WHJ so popular?

It has a good marketing strategy for those parents who are not into IT Field or don't know about it, by telling if their child will start building apps, he/she will earn 10 Crores a year and also might become the next Elon Musk.

Anonymous,10y,What is the most catastrophic mistake made by an intern at a company?,"Not a tech company, but about 18 years ago as a student, I was doing research at London's Heathrow Airport, working in a room just below the control tower.

We were listening to the control tower instructions and timing how long the pilots took to respond.

My colleague left for lunch one day having turned his radio onto 'broadcast' by accident. As radio is one way, it meant that no one was able to send or receive messages on the frequency that was being used to give take off permission.

I returned back to my desk and started to eat my lunch to discover that all departures from the airport had been brought to a standstill by someone who sounded like they were eating their lunch.

The realisation that it was the sound of MY lunch being eaten hit me about 10 minutes later.. I rushed over and flicked the switch to off, and one of the busiest international airports in the world started to work again.

We got away with it though.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/suln3pf4rzvejd7k', 'title': 'What is the most catastrophic mistake made by an intern at a company?', 'score': {'original': 0.9857, 'ai': 0.0143}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Not a tech company, but about 18 years ago as a student, I was doing research at London's Heathrow Airport, working in a room just below the control tower.\n\nWe were listening to the control tower instructions and timing how long the pilots took to respond.\n\nMy colleague left for lunch one day having turned his radio onto 'broadcast' by accident.

Adam D'Angelo,13y,Does Adam D'Angelo feel comfortable with the transition from an engineer to a management position?,"I don't actually have as much professional individual engineering experience as people think. I studied CS in college and programmed a lot when I was younger, but I was only an engineer at Facebook for 6 months before going into management for about two years. At Quora I acted as an engineer (in addition to tons of other founder/management stuff) for a little under a year before I stopped writing significant amounts of code.

Since this is my second time going through the transition and we have good people to take over engineering, it's been pretty smooth. There are still some parts of the Quora codebase that I know best but they're rapidly disappearing.

Even though I don't write much code anymore, I'm still in touch with the codebase and plan on staying like that for a while. I don't really feel like I've strayed from my roots - building and running a product development organization requires a mix of engineering skill and management skill and isn't too different from developing a product alone.

People tend to exaggerate the differences between management and engineering but in reality, there's a ton of overlap. I'm still concerned with tradeoffs about simplicity vs functionality, long-term development speed vs short term development progress, code quality and efficiency, etc. They just happen at a higher level. For example, instead of thinking about the quality of the code I'm writing, I pay attention to how good the engineers we interview are, make sure new employees are getting the right amount of guidance from more experienced engineers, and monitor how well our code review process is working by asking people.

Also, while this role is different in a lot of ways, in terms of # of people, Quora is currently a much smaller organization than what I was managing at Facebook, which makes the people management part of the role a lot easier than it would be if I didn't have much experience.

Is it as gratifying as writing code? There are pluses and minuses:


Things move a lot faster because there are now 10 people doing engineering.
I get to see and experience a wider variety of challenges, rather than just those that come up in the amount of code that I'm able to write.
Building a team is pretty fun; programming is pretty fun too.
The biggest minus I can think of is that focusing on one thing for a week or more can be relaxing and enjoyable. As an engineer you can do that but as a manager the most you can hope for is a few hours at a time.


Overall I'd say this isn't more or less gratifying than being an engineer. I wrote code for the first year of Quora because it was the best thing I could do for the company - we needed to build the product, it gave us a solid foundation that I understand, it created a good model for how products are developed here, and it was feasible for us to get the product out with just the four of us writing code.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 3y,What makes an entrepreneur's mindset quite different from the rest?,"This happened yesterday:

“Dad, please take me to the shopping mall. I need to buy a couple of gifts,” my daughter said.

“No,” I immediately answered.

“Please, Dad! I really need to buy these Christmas gifts today.”

She has that magical smile that I can’t resist and gets me every time. “Okay, do it quickly,” I relented.

We got to the store. While my daughter searched for gifts, my mind was working. I do this instinctively. I remember how I was carefully watching her reaction to each item she showed some interest in.

“Look, Dad. My friend would love this,” she said showing me some items.

I observed and asked questions.

“What are you doing, Dad?” my daughter asked while I was taking pictures of this product.

“I’m studying,” I said.

“Oh, come on, Dad. Seriously, why are you taking pictures?”

“I’m learning,” I said.

“What are you learning?”

“I’m curiously trying to understand why women buy this for $29 dollars,”

I couldn’t believe the price of this “pillow spray.”

What makes an entrepreneur's mindset quite different from the rest?

My wife says I’m always documenting everything and loves to make fun of me. She just doesn’t understand me.

Wherever I go, I instinctively observe everything. That’s the way I learn and identify opportunities.

I'm always analyzing businesses around me. I like to understand how things work. It's a subconscious action. It happens naturally.
Very commonly, when I walk into a restaurant or business, I will observe and analyze how many employees work there, and what are the roles of each employee. I try to estimate the potential sales of the business to measure their success.
Sometimes I pose questions to the employees so I can make my assessment. I do this just to feed my brain. (I know … It's crazy)
I will analyze how things could be done better, identify efficiencies, and their biggest problems.
I ask myself, “What can I sell them?”
Franchise expos are like brain candy for me because I can analyze their business models and understand how they do business.
I’ll try to see ahead and predict results.

All this happens without effort and in a matter of minutes — even while I’m doing something else.

I guess this is a similar experience of a chef walking into a supermarket; all their instincts immediately turn on and start creating their next culinary experience.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ch1z4258mbng3ksx', 'title': ""What makes an entrepreneur's mindset quite different from the rest?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This happened yesterday:\n\n“Dad, please take me to the shopping mall.

Andrew Forrest,3y,Is Elon Musk's Starlink idea original? Why didn't other companies do the same earlier?,"Is Elon Musk's Starlink idea original? Why didn't other companies do the same earlier?

The idea of a constellation of satellites is not new by any means, think of previous examples like the Iridium network, or the most ubiquitous example, the worldwide navigation system GPS. There are a few big differences between these examples and the Starlink network however.

Firstly, the orbital altitude of the satellites. GPS uses high altitude MEO satellites at a height of 20,180 km, although Iridium satellites are LEO.

Secondly there is the number of units in the constellation, Iridium has 82 and GPS uses 24.

Starlink in comparison already has 895 units in operation right now, and is aiming for a first stage constellation of 12,000 units!

(Bear in mind this is just the initial phase of 1,600 for the first stage of 12,000)

This brings us to the third difference and real clincher, the cost of launching the satellites. Every other player has to pay exorbitant fees for a launch provider to send their precious payloads into orbit, which tends to put a practical limit on the number that is economically feasible. Not only does SpaceX fabricate their own satellites for the cost of a suburban house, but they also happen to have their own launch vehicles that can launch 60 units at a time for a fraction of the cost of their competitors.

When you make the most of these huge advantages that SpaceX has over the competition, you have a system that can offer huge data handling capacity that no one else can get remotely close to.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5xmi2e97yupofcvb', 'title': ""Is Elon Musk's Starlink idea original?

Jeff Mwangi,Updated 6y,What is the most catastrophic mistake made by an intern at a company?,"I was an aeronautics tech and we had just received new interns fresh from college as part of their course work. They were in their second or third week.

We had just finished doing a maintenance check on a Boeing 737 that was supposed to fly a UN delegation to a neighboring country in the region for a peace mission or something. My colleagues and I signed off, headed to lunch and left the clean up to the interns.

One of them, cocky little SOB I might add, was cleaning out the main cabin area. He had one job. One Job. And then he had the bright idea to do this:

This is an evacuation slide and it deploys when the main cabin doors are opened in the armed position. The 737 had a stand alone fail safe voice alarm that notified anyone trying to arm it in case it was unintentional. If it fails to deploy or is not armed, there is a manual lever or in our case, a red nylon handle tucked in the side of the door written in giant white letters, “PULL”. So that’s exactly what the intern did. The door was not armed, matter of fact it was not even closed, but he went ahead to, of all things, pull the goddamn handle.

We were all out of our work overalls getting ready for lunch when we heard the terrifying and familiar “pppppssssshhhhhhffffffffff”. We all knew it, someone had f@&ked up.

Well, some of you might think, ‘hey what’s the big deal, just get the slide back into the plane, you still got time.” Once an evacuation slide is deployed, it has to be taken down from the plane, transported to a certified shop, which was not on-site by the way, where it is re-inflated again to check for defects, deflated, professionally packed, and its air canister re-pressurized. Then it has to come back to the hangar, get it lifted and fixed into the aircraft again.

Needless to say, the intern cost the company about $18,000, delay expenses for the UN flight, peace for the country they were headed to, and our lunch.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qk2dfvo6r0ym8j9w', 'title': 'What is the most catastrophic mistake made by an intern at a company?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I was an aeronautics tech and we had just received new interns fresh from college as part of their course work.

Varun Anand,Updated 7y,Does Zomato blackmail restaurant owners? I’ve seen incidents where restaurant owners said zomato asked for 20K to improve their ratings. Most of their top reviewers are paid employees. Search their reviewer names on Facebook and you will get it all.,"Hey, I am a restaurant owner myself. I listed myself on Zomato, my average ratings were 4.5 from over 60 reviews. All genuine customers, OK around 6 were my close friends who helped me out by reviewing for me the very first week(though they had my food and even clicked pictures).

Zomato one day decided to show my average reviews as 3.2. I see in their terms that 'the review system is based on Zomato policy of spam'.

Funny thing is, even if they marked all the reviews as spam and decided to take my lowest score of 3.5 stars, even then the average doesn't come down to 3.2.

I emailed Zomato, got a call and guess what, they wanted me to sponsor and pay in officials ways for their useless services, and they would make sure my reviewing average would get satisfactory.

There is a reason all big names in businesses have started to delist themselves from zomato, also Food Panda and Zomato gave losses in hundreds of crores last quarter, with food Panda announcing closure by the end of the year to Zomato leading to closure or bankruptcy.

Obviously I didn't pay, I am still listed, but now it's a waste as I contacted lots of popular reviewers, they took food at huge discounts, or even free, gave genuine reviews, but Zomato didn't even trust their popular reviewers.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/x917c6sume2iwpg5', 'title': 'Does Zomato blackmail restaurant owners?

Yishan Wong,14y,Why was YouTube successful?,"YouTube was successful for two big reasons: 1) It made a previously difficult thing much, much easier by bringing together recent technological advances.  Before YouTube, the method of sharing video on the web was basically ""Hey, check out this video!.... buffering....buffering...."" and very painful.  The process of making and uploading video was also very difficult - few places hosted large video files (and storage was more expensive back then), so if you made videos, you basically had to host them yourself, and videos were typically played using Windows Media or RealPlayer, both of which were substandard solutions in terms of usability.  Furthermore, if your video became popular (""went viral""), the bandwidth cost of serving up the video would bankrupt you. YouTube combined two major technological advances into an easy-to-use product: the first was the declining cost of storage, which they used to provide centralized hosting and delivery with a web product that offered easy uploads.  The second was the advent of video on Flash, which enabled fast-start streaming video delivery using a plug-in with existing high user penetration (>80% at the time).  This cut the wait time for watching a video down to a few seconds and was a quantum leap over other video delivery solutions like Windows and Real. 2) The company understood the importance of actively working on driving user adoption.  This is something that a lot of startups don't understand: a superior product is not enough, you need to put in active effort in driving user adoption, both via marketing (via viral or traditional channels) and key product features.  The team tried over and over for months, working on multiple ways to get things to take off until they finally stumbled on embeddable videos on MySpace profiles.  The insight here isn't necessarily that ""riding on the back of a big player like MySpace"" was key, but rather that reaching a point of sustained viral user adoption was an operational priority. --- Jawed Karim has a really good video where he explains all of this in entertaining detail:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nssfmTo7SZg&NR=1","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/y3vdeo47jbiksm90', 'title': 'Why was YouTube successful?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'YouTube was successful for two big reasons: 1) It made a previously difficult thing much, much easier by bringing together recent technological advances.

Tom Storey,Updated 4y,What is the shrewdest pivot in business history?,"I’ve written about this before on the Q and it never gets old.

In 1938 Chester Carlson, a patent attorney and inventor, developed a process that would change the world. Trouble was the world didn’t want it.

The product would not make it to market until 1959.

In the late 1940’s, A man Named Joseph Wilson, the founder of Haloid Corporation, took a risk and invested in development of Mr. Carlson’s new device.

Almost a decade of struggle and a factory was financed for the production of the above. Wilson headed the executive team. Top finance people from New York and elsewhere committed millions to the project. The Business press, however, said “it would never succeed in the market.”

The factory started to churn out these machines. The market included every government and private institution in the world. In today’s dollars? It was a trillion dollar market.

Top sales management and field reps had been brought in, organized and sent out to get orders. An institution would use a group of twenty staff to produce this commodity product. It would take these employees up to an hour to produce what Mr. Carlson’s device could do in less than a minute.

The campaign commenced. Reps fanned out and called on the US government, General Motors, Bell Labs, Ford, IBM, Texaco, Harvard, Yale … everyone.

Nothing happened.

The machine was not selling. There were tens of millions and a decade of work into this innovation and sales were 20% of schedule.

Machines were piling up in the warehouse and the all too famous “meeting” was called. Anyone in start-ups knows what this meeting is.

It is labeled the “what the hell are we gonna do now?” meeting. Wilson, Carlson, heads of sales, finance, engineering and an addition. This man was an outsider brought in for his perspective on the pending catastrophe.

A $25,000 machine was a “capex” item. It had to be budgeted on a 12 month cycle. General Motors would need hundreds of the machines and that would be an enormous budget item to push through. The sales staff was despondent.

The meeting adjourned and the outsider said he’d get back the following week.

The original model was to produce the device and sell it directly to the users.

The outsider called and a meeting was held.

Engineering was instructed to attach a “counter” to each machine. Finance was instructed to redesign the revenue model to a “fee per unit used” of 3 cents. Sales was instructed to call on clients and ask where the device could be located, plug it in and inform the client the machine was free of charge - they would only be billed monthly for the numbers of copies used.

The client now had two choices to get a 15 page document duplicated. Bring it to the typing pool where typists would type an original with carbon paper between sheets for additional copies or walk over to the Xerox 914 copier and get a spotless copy in a couple of minutes which the company would pay for, no budget meeting, no requisition…no problem.

Xerox became the fastest growing technology company in history.

Original model $25,000 capital purchase.

Pivot

Successful model 3 cents a page…(service)

“The machine nobody knew they needed until they had one”

EDITS: Thanks for comments/responses. I’m not a Xerox/Haloid archivist, just a business person who, through study of Mr. Carlson, was always fascinated by the story. The almost two decade struggle to get the technology packaged and onto the market was quite simply, epic. Every top tech firm shot him down. Just about everyone everywhere, besides Haloid and the Batelle Memorial Institute, just wrote him off as an idiot.

The stats on the pivot to “service” from “equipment sale” have been requested and the issue is there were “stages.” The paper I read 20 years ago stated the machine would be placed in the customer’s office and the only charge was three cents a copy. Perhaps this was an early rendition. As the deal eventually became identical to the structure IBM used for their computers. The lease was $95/month and the first 2000 copies were free. After the free 2000? It became 5 cents a copy.

Ready for the Inflation adjustment? $250,000 per machine in today’s dollars.

Their proposal related to current method which, for the majority of customers, was a “secretarial pool.” My Mom was the head of administration for the department of investigation of the United States Army Air Corps Intelligence in 1944. Their department had to manage tens of thousands of background checks with mechanical typewriters and carbon paper. They needed four or five copies of everything. She laughs out loud when telling about pushing paper through a government agency. They had fifty women just in their section in Manhattan typing all day long. God bless’em!

With that picture in mind, what the copying machine’s proposal was about is about the same as “horses to cars”. The profundity of this new automation?

This $250,000 machine would replace 50 employees and do a much, much better job in less time.

Xerox simply didn’t know how large the market was for this machine. They assumed the lifetime market was in the 100,000 unit range…as above they were really expensive. That is an estimated $2.5B (today’s dollars) market for the device. Not too shabby.

Once they got it rolling? Xerox could not make them fast enough, their inability to assess the breadth of the market is shown here…They sold the “estimated 100,000 machine product lifetime” in six months! Now there’s a back log for ya.

The New York Times business editor attended the roll out for the machine and panned it. People simply didn’t understand that it was going to change the world.

Listen, you think the tech companies of today generated some wealth?

Xerox stock split 138 times.

Chester Carlson was worth $1.8B in today’s dollars.

Xerox developed the PC, the interface and the rest so that Jobs and Gates could claim they stole it from each other….when they just stole it from Xerox.

One of the first units is in the Smithsonian next to the light bulb and the cotton gin.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0bnpju5dqaz3ri8g', 'title': 'What is the shrewdest pivot in business history?', 'score': {'original': 0.6612, 'ai': 0.3388}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I’ve written about this before on the Q and it never gets old.\n\nIn 1938 Chester Carlson, a patent attorney and inventor, developed a process that would change the world.

Stan Hanks,2y,Why is Reddit still relying on venture capital?,"Have a look at Jason M. Lemkin's answer to Why is Reddit still relying on venture capital? and let’s talk a bit about what’s under that.

Investors in any company are looking for a way not just to get their money back but to make really big returns on the money that they invested. The longer their investment “cooks”, the more that they need to get back in order to make it worth the risk.

Reddit has been around for a long time - 15 years. That’s… approximately forever in VC terms. Their Series A1 was in 2013, after the great reversion in limited partner hold time terms, and here 8 years later, those guys are dying - they wanted to have cashed out a couple years ago. So it’s time.

The question is… how. And how to make that at as big as possible a valuation.

Enter the art of the “mezzanine finance round”.

Back in the day, a mezzanine round did two things - first, it was a market signal, to set the floor value for an IPO; in this case, given that they raised $250M at a $6B valuation… you can expect that an IPO done reasonably rapidly, the next year, would be at a serious premium to that pricing. Second, it’s a way for the lead investment banks to bring in customers from their private bank business so that they can “get into the company” directly before the IPO. A lot of time when you see a venture capital group that you’ve never seen before showing up in a late-stage deal, that’s actually a syndicate of high net worth individuals and family office customers of the major investment banks jockeying for just such opportunity. Sure, can use some pull to buy at the open of the IPO… but if you play your cards right, you can be last money in before the IPO, at a steep, steep discount to the open.

So when you see a raise in a late stage company that doesn’t make sense? That’s likely what it is. You sometimes see that in early stage companies that are being prepped for acquisition - I saw a lot of those when I was working in PE..

There’s a decent chance that some variation on this is what’s going on with Reddit.

On the other hand… these guys are still spending money ahead of revenue. My guess is that they really needed the cash, for at least another year maybe two. Why? Well, while Reddit Is on Pace to More Than Double Its Ad Revenues By 2021
 that’s still not a lot of money. Currently they’re running about $100M-$150M in ad revenue. And I’m guessing that their infra and staff costs are over $220M a year.

Second, they’re swamped. Growth takes people to make it happen and based on this raise, Reddit to double employees after raising $250 million
. That’s like 700 people. If those are engineer-class people… that’s taking on an additional $250M per year in burn all by itself. Less, of course, if they’re tech support or marketing or business development, but the floor is probably $150M. Which is a pile of cash. That, oh hey! this just happens to pay for…

Lastly, while Reddit has been growing… and it says Reddit plots a path to $1B in ad sales, but first it needs to convince brands
 - the hard part is that last bit of “convincing brands”. There are a whole ton of ads focused on geeky techy stuff, but can you pull over toilet paper? kid’s shoes? dog food??

Remains to be seen. And while they’re figuring that out, it’s an expensive platform to run and they’ve hired even more people…

So the raise makes sense, from a couple of directions.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/as2e6xturbhvyp4d', 'title': 'Why is Reddit still relying on venture capital?', 'score': {'original': 0.8255, 'ai': 0.1745}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Have a look at Jason M.

Yishan Wong,Updated 4y,What does it feel like to be an employee of a company that goes public?,"It's extremely distracting.

Following the decision to formally file your S-1 (roughly, your intention to IPO), your company enters a quiet period. During this period, the press becomes intensely interested in your company and there is a lot of external speculation about how your company is doing. Some of it will be negative and/or inaccurate. The problem is, because the company is in its quiet period, no one in the company can say anything to the press, so inaccurate stories will largely go unanswered. This might be okay to the executives, who have a firm grasp of the true fundamentals of the company, but it can be extremely distressing to rank-and-file employees to hear negative news stories about the company that don't get refuted.

Next come the lawsuits. Once a company files to go public, this signals to the world that it is a profitable business with healthy revenues (usually; if not, the S-1 contains exactly what the cash flow of the business looks like). This means that all manner of frivolous lawsuits will come out of the woodwork (e.g. patent trolls). The business press also eats this up, and tends to spin these stories out of proportion, lending unnecessary credence to the claims made by the litigants and subsequently casting doubt on the viability of the company that is filing. Again, the company is not able to respond publicly to these reports and if you're an employee who doesn't know that this is business as usual - most healthy public companies typically have at least half a dozen lawsuits pending against them at any one time - it can be intimidating to see the company you've worked for so long and love suddenly be the target of a bunch of bizarre legal claims whose merits are opaque to you. The executives usually have a better idea of what's going on, but they have to be very careful about what they can say (where the public can hear) and also to employees, because often when a lawsuit is pending the lawyers advise the principals to say as little as possible so all you typically get is ""we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.""

The filing of the S-1 also signals to investment banks and wealth managers that a new group of people is about to become very wealthy, so they will dig up lists of employees (or even wardial their way through the company's phone number range) offering financial management services. This gets annoying real fast.

On the day of the IPO, everyone at the company is basically drunk (either for real or metaphorically). There is no work getting done that day, as employees are basically just watching the stock price and shouting out new highs as it makes its first-day pop.

On the day of PayPal's IPO, I think I was literally the only employee who didn't care and was kind of annoyed about all the noise going on that was preventing me from doing work. I was a young engineer and didn't quite understand why I should be so excited (I had been there only a few months, and my primary impression of Valley IPOs was that they were just part and parcel of the dot-com bust - I hadn't hit my first-year cliff yet, so I had no immediate expectation of financial gain). There is a picture somewhere of a bunch of us cheering except that I am just looking off distractedly at my Snapple drink. I distinctly remember wondering how I could extract myself from that crowd and get back to my cube so that I could code.

In the next couple weeks, very little work gets done. People are obsessively looking at the stock price and calculating their net worth. Everyone is still in the lock-up period so no one can sell, so there is a bit of suspense about how high the stock will stay until the lock-up expires. Some people will already begin to buy things like expensive cars (they can e.g. put a collar on their holdings if company trading rules don't forbid buying derivatives).

New rules get put into place regarding who can see financial or user data (for a consumer internet company), or basically any other internal metrics that would materially affect that stock price. People who have to be able to see them as part of their jobs get put onto a list that severely restricts the timing during which they can trade in the company's stock - these ""blackout"" periods are typically in the weeks around when the company reports its quarterly earnings.

Once the lock-up period ends (90 or 180 days, usually), employees can sell their shares and many people do so, at least some portion. This is usually when people start showing up with fancy cars, etc.

After that, things start going back to normal, except for two big things:

1) The company now has to focus on quarterly earnings reports and SOX compliance. This is inevitable, no matter how much you declare beforehand that you won't be affected by quarterly earnings pressures. There is a new, and very distinct pressure near the end of the quarter to do things you didn't have to do before because it might make the difference between beating, making, or missing your expected numbers. SOX compliance places new restrictions on what employees can do - for engineers, it often involves restrictions on how well they can debug problems in production - and this generally makes ""getting things done"" harder in ways that aren't very meaningful.

2) The new employees you hire are distinctly less motivated and bought in to the company compared to the pre-IPO people - it's just a job to them. Per Jamie Zawinski's old adage (see http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html) of the difference between ""people who want to go to work for a company to make it successful"" and ""people who want to work for a successful company,"" most of your new employees (i.e. co-workers) now distinctly fall into the second category.

Some people will already begin to buy things like expensive cars (they can e.g. put a collar on their holdings if company trading rules don\'t forbid buying derivatives).\n\nNew rules get put into place regarding who can see financial or user data (for a consumer internet company), or basically any other internal metrics that would materially affect that stock price. People who have to be able to see them as part of their jobs get put onto a list that severely restricts the timing during which they can trade in the company\'s stock - these ""blackout"" periods are typically in the weeks around when the company reports its quarterly earnings.\n\nOnce the lock-up period ends (90 or 180 days, usually), employees can sell their shares and many people do so, at least some portion. This is usually when people start showing up with fancy cars, etc.\n\nAfter that, things start going back to normal, except for two big things:\n\n1) The company now has to focus on quarterly earnings reports and SOX compliance. This is inevitable, no matter how much you declare beforehand that you won\'t be affected by quarterly earnings pressures. There is a new, and very distinct pressure near the end of the quarter to do things you didn\'t have to do before because it might make the difference between beating, making, or missing your expected numbers. SOX compliance places new restrictions on what employees can do - for engineers, it often involves restrictions on how well they can debug problems in production - and this generally makes ""getting things done"" harder in ways that aren\'t very meaningful.\n\n2) The new employees you hire are distinctly less motivated and bought in to the company compared to the pre-IPO people - it\'s just a job to them. Per Jamie Zawinski\'s old adage (see http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html) of the difference between ""people who want to go to work for a company to make it successful"" and ""people who want to work for a successful company,"" most of your new employees (i.e. co-workers) now distinctly fall into the second category.\n\n----\n\nEdited to add the picture (thanks Moses Namkung):', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.77975

Kurt Guntheroth,Updated 4y,How would the first day at a startup be like for a software engineer?,"Yes, this stuff really happened on my first day…

You come to the office at 9 AM. Fortunately, there’s one guy who likes to come in “early”, and he meets you in the hall around 9:20 and lets you in. Of course, he doesn’t know what to do with you so you just sit in a chair.

Around 10:30 the owner comes in, fresh from some meeting with VCs. He looks at you with no recognition at all on his face. He says, “Can I help…Oh, you’re the new hire, right?”

The owner and another guy rummage around until they can put together a computer for you to use. There isn’t really a desk for you, so you perch on the end of the desk of another dev.

By lunchtime there are half a dozen guys (yeah, guys: no women) in the space. There isn’t much talking, except you trying to introduce yourself.

You download your development environment, figure out the git repository, and fetch the software. It takes a couple of hours of tinkering before it will compile. It’s pretty lonely and frustrating because the rest of the team is ignoring you, and they have headphones on so it’s hard to ask for help. You have to get into their visual field and wave or something.

It’s 5 PM but the team is still hard at it, the air in the shared space smelling just a bit like the locker room after a big game. You didn’t plan to stay late, but you figure you better to make a good impression. No one has asked you to fill out a W4, or said anything about health care, or when payday is. You know your wife is going to ask you about that, so you try to talk to the founder, but he’s been on the phone for an hour now and still going. You’re looking at the code, but you don’t understand any of it because someone really loves template metaprogramming and oh jesus is the code strange. It looks like it does a shitload of work just to start up, for no particular effect. You wonder if you’re reading it wrong.

Around 7 PM you notice that a couple of the team are playing a shooter on their PCs. Earphones come off and conversation starts up. You don’t know enough about them to join in really. Finally someone else packs up their backpack, puts on their bike shoes, and stompfs out the door klickity-clack. You decide to go too. God what a day, you think.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,How did you start your first business?,"Twenty-six years ago, I was in college studying Civil Engineering.

I felt as if in a prison. I was a terrible student.

I was all set to be a construction superintendent — with hopes that in the future, I would take over the family business.

Huge mistake!

I was receiving a position in a business that I had NO interest in.

It was expected for me to become a construction engineer. I was expected to do it. I was expected to love it… No questions asked!

Imagine a pre-arranged marriage… a nightmare!

Image

My father was never rude or imposed anything; he didn’t even expect me to like the construction business — but somehow, it was “expected” that I should become the next “builder” in the family.

Maybe a cultural thing…

To answer your question:

My motivation to start my business was FREEDOM!

I was choking! Every cell in my body wanted freedom.

I was not focused in college. I hated my Civil Engineering studies. All I wanted was to own my own business.

I first started a parking lot business outside my college.

I rented a vacant piece of land located just outside the campus. I didn't need much money, just the rent for the first month. I struck a deal with the owner of the land and I convinced my dad to co-sign the lease.

My experiment lasted less than one year….

Everything went well, but when the lease was over, the land owner took over my business — he would NOT renew my lease.

First failure; lessons learned.

I was always in search of business opportunities. Day and night, all I had in mind was my goal to find a business opportunity.

I would go to the magazine shops and read business books every chance I could.

I found[1] a cheap business to get started with a loan from my parents and the best business partner I could have ever dreamed of. This was a small and simple business, but it meant everything to me!

I was still in college and got started.

This is me in 1994… a 22-year-old, promoting his business.

I honestly didn’t know what I was doing, but I was burning with passion, learning daily.

Today, almost 25 years later, this small business employs over 40 people, hands down the best team in the world. They manage 100% of the everyday, business operations.

Secret revealed:

We use three different brand names. This is a great strategy to “monopolize” the area without people noticing.

Don’t tell anyone; it works! If a customer for any reason gets mad with one location — they end up at another one of ours :)

Rui Lourenço,Updated 3y,What's the most important lesson a startup owner should learn?,"This is Harl.

It’s ok if you don't recognize him yet. You will in a moment.

Harl had some rough early years.

He lost his father at the age of 6 and was left with the responsibility of looking after his younger brother and sisters.

I’ll save you from some sad and less relevant details involving an abusive stepfather, Harl leaving his home to work on a farm, leaving school and faking his ID to join the Army.

After being honorably discharged, he got hired by the railway as a laborer. His temper cost him that job as he got himself involved in a fight with a coworker.

Fortunately, while he worked for the railway, he studied law.

Unfortunately, he ruined that career as well by getting into another fight.

Harl was forced to move back in with his mom and get a job selling life insurance. He got fired again. Insubordination.

Not much of an example, right? Bear with me.

He went on to found a ferry boat company where he had some success. Later, he tried cashing in his ferry boat business to create a lamp manufacturing business only to get outcompeted by another company.

He failed a couple more times before hitting his 40’s. At that time he began selling chicken dishes in a service station.

As his reputation as a cook spread, he eventually decided to close the service station and set up a restaurant. Harl enjoyed some measure of success there.

Then the restaurant burned down.

Still, he didn't give up and rebuilt the restaurant. Once again, it looked like he was set for success. He wasn’t.

First, a highway that was right in front of his restaurant was moved, hurting the amount of traffic near his restaurant. Then a new interstate highway was announced. It would bypass his restaurant by seven miles.

He ended up selling the restaurant at a considerable loss.

With no other source of income, he started living with a monthly social security check of $105. He was 65 years old.

He was not done, though.

He left his home and traveled to different states to try to sell a chicken recipe he had perfected over the years.

He even offered the recipe to restaurant owners for free, just asking for a small percentage on the items sold.

He heard “no” over 1000 times.

Even after all of those rejections, he didn’t give up. He believed his chicken recipe was something special.

He got rejected 1009 times before he heard his first yes. Then Kentucky Fried Chicken was born.

Coronel Harland Sanders got rich (he sold the business for 2m$ some years later).

So here’s the lesson: It takes hard work, time and luck to succeed. Don't give up.

Also, be nice. It will probably take you there sooner than it took Harl.

Sidenote: the internet is filled with controversy over the details of Coronel Sander’s life. If you find some facts are not as accurate as they could be, feel free to suggest an edit.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o7nql8xj1wguvtdk', 'title': ""What's the most important lesson a startup owner should learn?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This is Harl.\n\nIt’s ok if you don't recognize him yet.

Tim Hoffmann,Updated 5y,How are non-technical people able to found successful tech startups?,"According to Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs didn't ever code. He still founded Apple.

Today Apple is worth a trillion dollars, making incredible products and even more incredible amounts of money.

That's because founding is not about knowing everything - it's about having a vision and having a network of people who can answer all your questions. It's also about knowing what you're able to do and what you better leave to others.

Okay so before I say anything - let's define non-technical. If you don't know anything about engineering or coding, you probably don't want to start building cars by yourself. That's bonkers.

But if you're open minded, know your way around new technology - then there's opportunity everywhere. By that, I mean that you don't need to know how to code everything, but it's important to know what's possible and what's not. What's in need and what has great potential.

I can't code, but I'd be able to build a technology product. Why? Because I know the basics, so I know what I need. With these needs I can find technical co-founders and employees.

I can still maintain an important role as either taking care of operations, sales, marketing, design, etc. Just stuff that I'm a lot better at than coding.

Steve Jobs was a visionary leader and had a lot of things going for him, that let him think of great products.

Just because you're technically-minded, doesn't mean that you can invent great products. You might be able to build them, but that doesn't mean that you have the necessary vision.

Building great things is a team effort.

Scaling is a team effort.

Success is a team effort.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,What are the most common reasons that new businesses don't succeed?,"“I can’t make a profit on my shop,” said Luigi to Mario.

“What’s the problem?”

“I don’t know. I have beautiful clothing. People walk by the store every day, and a few stop by to make a purchase, but I just can’t sell enough volume.”

“What have you done?” asked Mario.

“I’m doing marketing campaigns, always offering discounts and coupons. With low prices, I do attract more customers, but with low margins, so no real profit. What do you suggest?”

“Stop selling rocks!”

“I’m not selling rocks, Mario! I’m selling quality clothes!”

“You are selling clothing like you were selling rocks. You are selling a commodity. There’s nothing remarkable about your clothing. That's why your business will fail.”

“You are being rude, Mario!”

“No, I’m just being honest! Do you want help or not?”

“Please,” said Luigi, starting to feel depressed.

“Do you know what are the most common reasons new businesses don't succeed, Luigi?”

“Because they are selling rocks, I suppose…” Luigi said doubtfully.

“Correct! Just like all other retailers in this same street, all selling clothing. The ONLY reason people want to buy from you is for a discount. You are competing by price!”

“That’s a commodity, correct?”

“To succeed in business, you need to differentiate yourself,” stated Mario.

“How? Please give me an example.”

Mario paused for a moment, thinking of a good example, and said, “What does Nike sell?”

“Sports shoes and clothing,” Luigi answered.

“No! Nike is NOT selling you a shoe or a shirt.”

“What do you mean?”

“Nike is selling you an emotion. When people buy Nike Golf clothing, they’re buying the success of Tiger Woods. Nike sells the dream of being like Tiger.”

“That’s why they pay him millions?”

“Tiger makes an estimated $30 million per year from Nike alone. Seems like a lot, but now people pay over $90 for a $5 shirt. How do you like the margins now?”

“Sounds like Nike is selling diamonds!” said Luigi, scratching his head.

“Luigi, your business is set to fail if you are selling just another product in the market.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 6y,What is the hardest thing you've gone through being an entrepreneur?,"The worst year of my life… 2008

I was developing a 72 unit condo in a vacation area
With a huge pool at the roof top
Everything was done
Building permits
Financing
Marketing
Even pre-sales
I was happy

Then… while we were at the peak of our sales season

A Category 2 Hurricane passed through the vacation area

(image[1])

Complete devastation

The area was without power for several weeks

We lost a few pre-sales

As if things couldn't get any worse
The 2008 Financial Meltdown destroyed my dream…
Took 100% of my investment money… lost everything
Took almost 3 years of my life invested into this project
Took my investors trust
Took my friends for money issues
Took my reputation
Took my pride
Took my joy

The entrepreneurial life is not easy.

But this didn't stop me.

Strangely… this is a way of life.

I can't quit… I won't quit.

Lesson?

As an entrepreneur… don't expect one problem

I should add:

Tough Finances
Family Sacrifices
Depression and getting back up
Misunderstood and called crazy
Pains of failure
Execution problems
Bad partnerships
Deceived, tricked, robbed, backstabbed
etc… etc… etc…

Recharge the Battery in Step 1 using the battery charger.

Matthew Bates,Updated 3y,What is the biggest challenge to the youth today?,"I teach kids in the 11–14-year-old range. If I had to narrow down all of the problems they face into just three main ones, they’d be:

Information overload 1.0: Most children have the internet at their fingertips at all times, and little to no supervision on it. They have immediate, unfiltered access to things that their minds aren’t ready for. It’s not “12 year old kid found his dad’s Playboy stash and took a peek when his parents weren’t home.” It’s “12 year old kid is on his phone or laptop all night, every night, alternating between watching hardcore porn videos and gory, violent videos. He struggles to stay awake during the day because of it, begins to see women as nothing more than sexual objects, and begins to glorify and fantasize about violence.”
Information overload 2.0: Kids today also have such an easy time accessing any information they need that they lose the ability… or never gain it in the first place… to do things for themselves. I know I sound like an old man, shaking his cane at today’s kids when I say this, but it’s absolutely true: every year, I teach more and more students who are so completely dependent on the internet to do their classwork that their offline skills are many grades below level. There are students who cannot do basic math or spelling without technological help, because they’ve never had to do it without that help. Just as the cure for obesity is to take in fewer calories and find reasons to move more, the cure for a lack of critical thinking skills is to get offline and challenge yourself to think on your own more often.
Hopelessness/feelings of futility/giving up before they even try things. I’d say that about 5% of my students over the years have fallen into this category. They put forth zero effort into everything they do that isn’t “fun,” because they just don’t see the point. They’ll spend hours trying to beat a single level of a video game, but won’t spend minutes on really easy classwork, while they’re in class and have nothing else to do anyway. At the same time, I have students who do their work, but are openly depressed about their personal futures, the future of the country, and the future of the planet. I think a lot of this goes back to just spending too much time online and believing all of the doom-and-gloom they read there. Every year, as part of our vocations unit, I ask the students to write about a typical day for them when they’re an adult. Nowadays, a lot of them write, non-sarcastically, things like, “I’ll still be living in my parents’ basement when I’m in my 30s because I will never be able to afford a new house,” or “I’ll spend all day at a job I hate, struggling to pay my bills,” or “I’ll never find someone to marry, because everyone cheats and I don’t want to be cheated on.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/w4osufz1cxdpha30', 'title': 'What is the biggest challenge to the youth today?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I teach kids in the 11–14-year-old range.

It’s not “12 year old kid found his dad’s Playboy stash and took a peek when his parents weren’t home.” It’s “12 year old kid is on his phone or laptop all night, every night, alternating between watching hardcore porn videos and gory, violent videos. He struggles to stay awake during the day because of it, begins to see women as nothing more than sexual objects, and begins to glorify and fantasize about violence.”\nInformation overload 2.0: Kids today also have such an easy time accessing any information they need that they lose the ability… or never gain it in the first place… to do things for themselves. I know I sound like an old man, shaking his cane at today’s kids when I say this, but it’s absolutely true: every year, I teach more and more students who are so completely dependent on the internet to do their classwork that their offline skills are many grades below level. There are students who cannot do basic math or spelling without technological help, because they’ve never had to do it without that help. Just as the cure for obesity is to take in fewer calories and find reasons to move more, the cure for a lack of critical thinking skills is to get offline and challenge yourself to think on your own more often.\nHopelessness/feelings of futility/giving up before they even try things. I’d say that about 5% of my students over the years have fallen into this category. They put forth zero effort into everything they do that isn’t “fun,” because they just don’t see the point. They’ll spend hours trying to beat a single level of a video game, but won’t spend minutes on really easy classwork, while they’re in class and have nothing else to do anyway. At the same time, I have students who do their work, but are openly depressed about their personal futures, the future of the country, and the future of the planet.

Awdhesh Singh,Updated 4y,"Why do 95% of start-ups fail, what do the 5% do right that make them successful?","Every year, around 500,000 candidates appear in Civil Services Examination for selection of IAS, IPS, IFS, IRS etc, but less than 1000 only succeed.

Every year more than 10,00,000 appear for JEE Mains aspiring to get into IITs, but only around 12,000 make it.

Every year more than 10,00,000 new books are published, but hardly around a few hundreds books become bestseller and provide royalty to author for survival.

In the same way, every year hundreds of new start-ups are born, but more than 95% fail after couple of years.

This happens simply because there is not enough of demands for companies in the world.

You can’t have hundreds of millions of companies in the world as the demand is quite limited.

Hence, only the best survive in the stiff competition in every field of life.

There is no mercy in the world of entrepreneurship.

It still follows the law of jungle where only the fittest and the best can survive.

Once the company fails, we can do the postmortem and find out the reasons for its failure.

According to some experts, top 10 causes of small business failure are:

No market need: 42 percent;
Ran out of cash: 29 percent;
Not the right team: 23 percent;
Got out-competed: 19 percent;
Pricing / Cost issues: 18 percent;
User un-friendly product: 17 percent;
Product without a business model: 17 percent;
Poor marketing: 14 percent;
Ignore customers: 14 percent; and
Product mistimed: 13 percent.[1]

However, none of the above factors can be anticipated and you can avoid them in advance.

You will know them only when you fail.

If you are successful, you need not find any explanation.

American Author Napoleon Hill. said this wisely, “Success requires no explanation; failure permits no alibis”.

Ian McAllister,10y,How can you manage people smarter than you and more knowledgeable than you?,"Don't manage, guide. IQ and experience are two attributes you want your team members to over-index on, but there are plenty of other attributes that also matter including judgment, work ethic, communication skills, and teamwork. Unlike raw IQ, these are things that can be developed in any employee. Your job is to provide individualized guidance to each of your team members in the areas where they need to develop.

Here are other some general tips for guiding strong engineers.

Guide what they build, not how they build. As a manager, your job is to make sure your engineering team is working on the most important things. Your idea of what is most important will often differ from theirs, so you need to spend some time explaining why you feel your priorities are the right ones and letting them make the case for theirs. Once you're agreed on priorities and the outcomes you need, give them latitude to decide how they achieve them.
Ask probing questions. Ask them what their design optimizes for, what their availability target is, what the latency requirements are, why they chose a particular persistence layer, why they chose the specific language. Ask them what the standard in your company is for X or Y, and why they chose to diverge from the standard. Doing so will educate you, and also give you an opportunity to spot potential inconsistencies in their design or fuzzy thinking in general.
Connect them with very senior engineers even smarter or experienced than they are, and set up a process to leverage that experience. This supports your engineers' learning and development and also ensures that their designs get an adequate architectural review if you're not equipped to do so.

Mediate arguments and (too) long-running discussions. Strong engineers have confidence in their design and coding judgment and are inclined to get into debates with other engineers about the right way to do things. This is productive, to a point, but at some point it starts becoming unproductive and can create tension. Your job as a manager is to find ways to short-circuit arguments and long-running debates, which may mean listening to diverging viewpoints and then making a decision. If you're not equipped to make the decision than find a path to do so, which might mean reviewing with a very senior engineer not on your team and letting them make the decision.
Continue to hire team members smarter than you. You may want to balance a team of mostly experienced engineers with some more junior engineers, but you always want to hire for high raw technical IQ. Hiring an engineer is a long-term decision. Don't relax your standards in order to fill an engineering role quickly.
Manage out poor performers. Strong engineers don't like to work with weak ones. If you don't manage out poor performers your team will accumulate them and your strong performers will move on to other teams or companies.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kwc7phdxsorui4qz', 'title': 'How can you manage people smarter than you and more knowledgeable than you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Don't manage, guide.

Abhishek Raj,Updated 3y,What is the worst technology fail in history?,"1.Google Glass, Google (2013-2014)

Google Glass have came too soon. It was launched in February 2013. The price was sky high, have issues around privacy, and cultural backlash, this wearable product was not able to connect.

2. Tata Nano, Tata Motors (2008)

Tata Motors launched the Nano cars with motorcyclists in mind. Tata manufactured the Nano as inexpensively as possible. The price was 100,000 rupees in 2008.

However, due to the low prices the company has to cut corners in production, as a result, there were many serious safety flaws. There were some reports that Nanos were bursting into flames after rear collisions. Tata ultimately sold fewer than 8000 Nanons in 2016–17. Due to low sales, Tata Motors announced the end of production without any direct successor. (Only one was assembled in June 2018).

3. Facebook Phone, Facebook (2013)

The Facebook Phone was surrounded by speculation from the moment the first rumors of it is surfaced. What the public got was HTC first, an android skinned device whose main feature was being geared towards the Facebook Home application. The phones exclusive carrier, AT&T, drastically slashed the price to 99 cents in a “temporary sale” that became permanent until the phone’s death.

4. Juicero, Juicero (2013)

Juicero was a California-based startup that raised $120M for its fresh-squeezed juice device. But after it was found that its $400, Wi-Fi-enabled machines were no more effective at making juice than squeezing the pre-packaged fruit with your hands, the company shut down within months of its launch.

5. Google+, Google (2011-2019)

Google+ isn’t the only social outing on this list from the search giant, but it’s probably the highest-profile disappointment. A closed launch made invites a hot commodity for about a week. Then Google discarded their restrained invitation model, throwing open the doors in an attempt to build a user base that never lived up to their expectations of creating a possible Facebook competitor. Google+ was shuttered permanently on April 2, 2019.

6. Windows Vista, Microsoft (2007)

We all have used the Windows operating system for at least one time in our life. Windows XP was quite successful and about 5 years after the launch of Windows XP, they launched Windows Vista.

After review on Vista, it was found out that this is not so user-friendly OS. Microsoft accepted its mistakes and announced to offer XP instead of vista to all the computer manufacturers. Many users downgraded their OS from Vista to XP. It hastened production on Windows 7.

7. Windows Phone, Microsoft (2010)

Microsoft made up its mind to launch Windows Phone but took a very late step in the world of smartphones. Apple Phones had already created a great impact in the smartphone world. Android phones were already in the market for 2 years. All these things created the problems for Microsoft.

The Windows Phone represented less than 1% of the total smartphone market in 2017, according to Recode — Microsoft discontinued the development of new features for the device that same year.

The former Nokia engineer said:

There are many well-known factors that caused WP’s demise, none of them alone took it down, but here are the ones that stood out most to me:

Underestimating Google: Obviously, Apple was red hot and Microsoft knew that, but Google was new to the OS business and they really weren’t taken seriously enough. Android was pretty rough then, but the real value was Google’s services; when Google cut Microsoft off of YouTube, Maps, Gmail, etc, it really made WP look cheap.
Botched Windows 8: Before Windows 8, WP had a lot of people’s curiosity. After Windows 8, people associated the two together has bad products even though the teams then were pretty independent and things done poorly on Windows 8 were not reflective of how the experience was on WP. Even with Windows 10, the stigma against “metro” never recovered.
Microsoft’s reputation: At the time it was still horrible and it meant that the young guys who grew up hating Microsoft were making the big startups for other platforms.
Loyalty: By 2014, people had themselves pretty comfortable with iOS or Android and even if WP got apps and whatever else it lacked, there just wasn’t a compelling reason to switch. Even now I sense the number swapping between iOS and Android is pretty low.

8. Apple Newton (1993–1998)

A PDA (personal digital assistant) that suffered from a poorly functioning operating system, the Apple Newton never caught on. However, the development of Apple Newton did indirectly lead to the iPad, proving that learning from failure can lead to great success.

9. BlackBerry

Before the iPhone, there was the BlackBerry — or “CrackBerry,” as the devices’ obsessed users affectionately referred to them. Blackberry phones were the first choice for many people and have features like Internet connection, email, chatting on Blackberry Messengers, and many more. Research in Motion, as BlackBerry, was then called, sold more than 50 million of the devices in 2011.

Time passed and RIM did not have any changes, it kept up with its trademark physical keyboard and did not bring a full touchscreen like the iPhone. The touchscreen had become quite popular at that time and people were very fond of it.

By 2016, BlackBerry was selling only about 4 million devices annually. Blackberry is still in this world but due to its archaic fervor, but one thing has to be accepted company’s devices paved the way for the super-powered smartphones we carry around today.

10. MySpace

Myspace was originally launched as a side project. It became the most famous social networking site before Facebook enter the world. It was officially launched in 2004 and gained 1 million users in one month only. MySpace first try to ignore Facebook but later on started copying it.

They have poorly designed their interface and faulty applications on the site. No doubt they have an amazing marketing strategy, but from the technical side, they were far behind from other platforms.

Facebook and Twitter have continuously rolled out major changes, new features, and redesigned their UI that have helped them to reshaped the social web for better, whereas MySpace remained stagnant for most of the time and never made a comeback.

11. Segway

Perhaps no gadget evokes the early turn of the century like the Segway, a personal motorized scooter that riders control by leaning in one direction or another. Designed as a revolutionary new transportation option, Segways have largely been relegated to the realm of the mall cop and tour group. But for whatever reason, technologists never tire of trying to replace the well-proven movement method of walking around — The Great Hoverboard Craze of 2015-16 can trace its origins directly to this stand-up scooter.

It was launched in February 2013. The price was sky high, have issues around privacy, and cultural backlash, this wearable product was not able to connect.\n\n2. Tata Nano, Tata Motors (2008)\n\nTata Motors launched the Nano cars with motorcyclists in mind. Tata manufactured the Nano as inexpensively as possible. The price was 100,000 rupees in 2008.\n\nHowever, due to the low prices the company has to cut corners in production, as a result, there were many serious safety flaws. There were some reports that Nanos were bursting into flames after rear collisions. Tata ultimately sold fewer than 8000 Nanons in 2016–17. Due to low sales, Tata Motors announced the end of production without any direct successor. (Only one was assembled in June 2018).\n\n3. Facebook Phone, Facebook (2013)\n\nThe Facebook Phone was surrounded by speculation from the moment the first rumors of it is surfaced. What the public got was HTC first, an android skinned device whose main feature was being geared towards the Facebook Home application. The phones exclusive carrier, AT&T, drastically slashed the price to 99 cents in a “temporary sale” that became permanent until the phone’s death.\n\n4. Juicero, Juicero (2013)\n\nJuicero was a California-based startup that raised $120M for its fresh-squeezed juice device. But after it was found that its $400, Wi-Fi-enabled machines were no more effective at making juice than squeezing the pre-packaged fruit with your hands, the company shut down within months of its launch.\n\n5. Google+, Google (2011-2019)\n\nGoogle+ isn’t the only social outing on this list from the search giant, but it’s probably the highest-profile disappointment. A closed launch made invites a hot commodity for about a week. Then Google discarded their restrained invitation model, throwing open the doors in an attempt to build a user base that never lived up to their expectations of creating a possible Facebook competitor. Google+ was shuttered permanently on April 2, 2019.\n\n6. Windows Vista, Microsoft (2007)\n\nWe all have used the Windows operating system for at least one time in our life. Windows XP was quite successful and about 5 years after the launch of Windows XP, they launched Windows Vista.\n\nAfter review on Vista, it was found out that this is not so user-friendly OS. Microsoft accepted its mistakes and announced to offer XP instead of vista to all the computer manufacturers. Many users downgraded their OS from Vista to XP. It hastened production on Windows 7.\n\n7. Windows Phone, Microsoft (2010)\n\nMicrosoft made up its mind to launch Windows Phone but took a very late step in the world of smartphones. Apple Phones had already created a great impact in the smartphone world. Android phones were already in the market for 2 years. All these things created the problems for Microsoft.\n\nThe Windows Phone represented less than 1% of the total smartphone market in 2017, according to Recode — Microsoft discontinued the development of new features for the device that same year.\n\nThe former Nokia engineer said:\n\nThere are many well-known factors that caused WP’s demise, none of them alone took it down, but here are the ones that stood out most to me:\n\nUnderestimating Google: Obviously, Apple was red hot and Microsoft knew that, but Google was new to the OS business and they really weren’t taken seriously enough. Android was pretty rough then, but the real value was Google’s services; when Google cut Microsoft off of YouTube, Maps, Gmail, etc, it really made WP look cheap.\nBotched Windows 8: Before Windows 8, WP had a lot of people’s curiosity. After Windows 8, people associated the two together has bad products even though the teams then were pretty independent and things done poorly on Windows 8 were not reflective of how the experience was on WP. Even with Windows 10, the stigma against “metro” never recovered.\nMicrosoft’s reputation: At the time it was still horrible and it meant that the young guys who grew up hating Microsoft were making the big startups for other platforms.\nLoyalty: By 2014, people had themselves pretty comfortable with iOS or Android and even if WP got apps and whatever else it lacked, there just wasn’t a compelling reason to switch. Even now I sense the number swapping between iOS and Android is pretty low.\n\n8.

Tom Nault,4y,What happens to the founders after big tech acquisitions?,"I have first hand experience with this one, having sold my company to Qualcomm in December 2007, where I was Chairman and CEO as well as majority controlling shareholder. The answer largely depends on the role you have and how they see you fit in the organization. You are treated like any other potential hire the day they take over, so you have no special standing. They acquire your company and they may offer you a role, or not. In my case, I didn’t want to move to San Diego and work for Qualcomm and they didn’t ask me to stay, so it was never a discussion.

The closing date is predefined and the money changes hands at a very specific time. There is a schedule of everyone who’s receiving a dime and at that exact minute, funds are transferred into each personal account on that minute. The documents were all signed days before.

You’ve cleared out your office by that morning, and the second the transfer happens, it’s their company, and locks, computer access, everything switches at the same minute. Typically there is an overnight gap with employees who remain with the company. In our case it closed Christmas Eve at noon.

What I remember most was all the noise as I was leaving, putting boxes in my car, then closing the car door. Silence. Complete silence. It was over. I wanted to cry.

So then what?

That’s where it gets weird. First, there was the Christmas holiday and yet there was some high anxiety coming off the transaction. The stress level is beyond explanation as you work towards a closing. The sleepless nights didn’t stop. There was no big party. Nothing.

I’d made a promise to myself years before that I’d buy an exotic if I ever had a big exit, so I did. I flew down to Lamborghini Orange County and bought a new LP640 Roadster on January 2, then drove it to Santa Barbara for a few days to see some friends, then drove it to CES in Las Vegas in light snow.

While at a gas station in route, my credit card was abruptly on hold, so I had to call in. It was my sudden change in spending that tipped them off. Yet, I wasn’t spending a lot outside the car, but my “pattern” was different. We cleared that up and I was on my way.

I got pulled over twice on the way, both times it was a mistake by the police. Once was for what they thought were expired tabs, the other for seatbelt. Apparently CA and NV plates looked similar at the time. It was a reminder I was in a new life.

The lamborghini seatbelts go from right to left versus left to right so the motorcycle cop assumed I wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. Getting pulled over was something new. There were no other extravagances outside of the car. I didn’t upgrade my hotel room.

While at CES, I met with people who were both happy about the deal and some customers who were not. I had to explain why we sold when we did. I was not in a suit and tie like other years. I was wearing business casual and the whole place felt different to me. Still, I wasn’t going to miss CES for anything. It was strange not having the usual meetings.

I left the car in California in storage and flew home to my normal life, just as before. I was living in a modest apartment and I remained for another six months before I bought a house. I wanted to spend time with my dog at the beach, so that’s what I did. That was more important to me than anything.

We did this drive down the coast and got as far as resort on HY 1, when we got snowed in, in Northern California of all things. It was a very rare freak snow storm and we couldn’t continue south. It was the opposite of what we were expecting so turned and headed back north and eventually made it home. That’s about when it really hit me that the company was sold.

The adjustment was difficult for me. I tried retirement for a few months. I hated saying it, I hated telling people I wasn’t doing anything, and lost my sense of purpose and that completely sucked. It was soon after that decided to get back to work helping other entrepreneurs and that’s where I started to rebuild my life.

It wasn’t long before I was getting calls from other entrepreneurs who wanted to know how I did it, so I began formal advising, which led to my role as President and COO at Summit, then COO at OAC after advising them, where I’m leaving my role in a few days. I love helping other entrepreneurs and I’m going to help a friend with an exit, while continuing my journey.

That’s what it was like for me, first hand.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zd9gea53t8jnrf1l', 'title': 'What happens to the founders after big tech acquisitions?', 'score': {'original': 0.4785, 'ai': 0.5215}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I have first hand experience with this one, having sold my company to Qualcomm in December 2007, where I was Chairman and CEO as well as majority controlling shareholder.

Oyo was on track to become the world’s largest hotel chain just before Covid hit: OYO could overtake Marriott as world’s largest hotel group by early 2020

Jio is the world’s largest telecom company — Reliance Jio becomes world’s largest telecom operator with 340 million subscribers
. — although you could argue about them being a startup or their close government connections. If you hold that metric, you might have to discount most Chinese startups.

GreyOrange is the most valued warehouse robotics company in the world [although technically they moved their incorporation to Singapore].

Ola, Flipkart, Paytm, Swiggy, Zoho and Freshdesk are in the world’s top 10 in their respective industries.

All this came in the past decade [for the most part]. And this was on the back of Indian software engineers and the growing Indian market.

Comparing directly with US is unfair.

US economy is nearly 8x of Indian economy in GDP.
A lot of successful US companies are cofounded by immigrants [Tesla/SpaceX by a South African, Google by a Russian, Juniper by an Indian etc]. India doesn’t have the same dynamic to attract world’s best immigrants.
The government bats for the local companies. Trump is arm-twisting Tiktok to be sold to a US company (Microsoft). Indian government is mostly a passive observer in startup world.

We can beat US in individual sectors, but beating it across the board would take a lot of effort and time. We can get there, but not immediately.

There are a lot of issues in Indian startup world — especially when it comes to understanding and valuing hardware. And there are real manufacturing hurdles and logistical nightmares. And unlike the Chinese and Americans, Indian government has not really helped Indian startups

However, Indian startups have been competing with the world despite all that. And as you can see at the top of the answer, many win the world.

This is a brilliant performance for a country that was not in the startup radar 15 years ago. 40 years ago they said we cannot do computers. 20 years ago they said we cannot build product companies. Look at how much was achieved. And someday we will build companies of the caliber of Tesla & SpaceX. Be patient ;-)

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

But I have promises to keep,

And miles to go before I sleep,

And miles to go before I sleep.

… until an accident happened. His wife Falguni Devi got injured while traversing through a rocky mountain. With the nearest hospital being 70 km away, she succumbed to the injuries and died. Sad story. But nothing new for people belonging to the labour class…

… until it wasn't. Manjhi was traumatized by this incident, but didn't want this to die away as just another incident. He decided to do something about this. He found a meaning to his loss and a purpose for his existence.

He single handedly carved a path through the rugged mountains, so that his village becomes accessible to medical care. It took 22 years for him to complete it. The path reduced the distance from 70 km to just 1 km.

He was ridiculed all along. He quotes, ""When I started hammering the hill, people called me a lunatic but that steeled my resolve."" …

… until he became The Mountain Man.

After he becomes a legend, the government then builds an official road over his path, much later after his death.

What is the relevance to this question?

Startups are like the road which Manjhi created. The founders have a personal connection to it. They see a path when nobody else saw. They see a purpose behind it.

The non-founder CEOs always tend to follow the path that is already laid. They will bring their personal connection to it. But it will always be built over the years of effort the founders had invested. Becoming a founder, requires them to risk seeing a new path, which anyone at their level wouldn't want to take.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9xc8j3z4gf1svtqi', 'title': ""Why can't CEOs like Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella start their own startup instead of working in other companies?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Do you know this guy?\n\nHe was just a simple labourer from the Indian state of Bihar like the millions of people in the subcontinent…\n\n… until an accident happened.

Hector Quintanilla,4y,Why do so many businesses fail?,"Up to 6,000 people sold apples in New York during the Great Depression.

Finding a job wasn’t easy. Businesses struggled to sell their products. The apple industry was no exception. They needed to sell their produce to people who had little to no money for food.

How could they do this?

To do so, they started promoting apple stands on the streets of New York.

These simple stands helped the apple industry move the apples that would most probably never get consumed, while it also helped men earn some money.

The program was a huge success. By selling apples instead of begging, this gave men a sense of pride, proving they were fighting for their future.

Soon, up to 6,000 people were selling apples in New York every day.

Did the 6,000 apple vendors succeed?
Why would you buy the apples?
Why would you buy from one seller instead of the other?
What makes one apple stand unique and better than the that of the competitors?
If you approached a seller and asked, “Why should I choose you over your competitor’s stand?” What would they answer? You’d be surprised how many wouldn’t be able to give you an answer!

That is why many businesses fail. They can’t answer this question!

Here’s an example that recently blew my mind:

A simple sticker with Mickey Mouse makes a remarkable difference in today's world of abundance.

Many businesses fail because they don’t have a clear differentiation that makes them stand out in the market.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/iwx3zeqtv476mdyj', 'title': 'Why do so many businesses fail?', 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Up to 6,000 people sold apples in New York during the Great Depression.\n\nFinding a job wasn’t easy.

Garry Taylor,1y,Why is it so hard to find a tech co-founder who can write all my code?,"Programmers are generally paid six-figure salaries. Are you offering that?

Assuming the answer is no, then what are you offering?

You’re offering a share in the business, a business which presumably has zero revenue, no track record, and a leadership team without any real experience.

You’re asking people to work for you for no money. It’s basically asking them to work for a lottery ticket. There is a non-zero chance of making millions, but the chances are microscopically small.

What I advise to startup founders is to find a way to pay a developer. If you can pay, even a goodwill amount of $10,000 or something, that’s enough to attract interest.

A share of your business is currently worthless, but a share of your business plus $10,000 is going to interest some people.

Yishan Wong,Updated 13y,What are some good questions to ask yourself to determine if you are ready to join a startup?,"I'm not sure if people ""become"" ready for a startup; in my experience, people are either small-company types or big-company types.  When big-company types of people join a startup, they are typically ineffective and (if installed as a manager), a major force in slowing things down.  When small-company types of people join a larger company, they tend to become annoyed and dissatisfied, often leaving quickly.  This question might be more appropriately phrased as ""what are some good questions to ask yourself to determine if you would prefer to work at a startup?"" Here are some acid test questions to help you determine conclusively (I hope) one way or another: Do you work more effectively with vague (or totally absent) instructions rather than detailed instructions?  Are you good at making plans when presented with unclear or contradictory goals?  Does executing on these plans tend to result in success despite the original goals?Do you often do more than is needed and find that your extra efforts weren't necessary to satisfy the requirements of the task?Do you need a higher salary than the one you have, or could you live comfortably with a pay cut?Are you comfortable working ""as long as necessary to get the job done"" or do you rigidly adhere to or require a 9-to-5 schedule?An explanation of why these are important: At a startup, you will not only have vague instructions, but often you won't be given any instructions unless you ask for them.  Most people at a startup (even your nominal ""boss"") are too busy doing their own jobs to tell you what to do.  To succeed, you will need to look around and figure out how to be most useful based on your own observations and vague comments from others like ""Uh, well, I think we have a problem somewhere with X.""Similar to #1, goals are very unclear - both within a startup and potentially for the startup as a whole (at least beyond ""survive and find a market for your product"").  This means that you need to be good at figuring out concrete goals when confronted only with a mess of problems and historically you should have shown a propensity for reaching a successful conclusion when acting upon these self-constructed goals.In larger companies (and as an extension of the [American] educational system), success criteria are often well-described and therefore ""capped.""  This tends to limit the achievement potential of both individuals and organizations.  In a startup, the company's survival may very well depend on achieving 5000% of your original goal (e.g. massively disrupting and dominating a market), rather than 120% of your goal (e.g. exceeding your productivity quota for the quarter).  You should have a habit of ignoring whatever was described as the ""100%"" (i.e. ""getting an A"") criteria and instead focusing on simply taking things as far as you can.You are extremely unlikely to get a pay raise when moving to a startup.  If you are already financially strained, a startup is not a way to solve this problem (i.e. don't count on a big payday or something).  This is not to say that you can't join a startup if you have kids and a mortgage; you should just not join a startup if you and your family are financially treading water.  The real solution is to manage down your expenses so that you are living below your means, which will give you the flexibility to change jobs.  If you already do this, you can easily move to a startup and be comfortable there.Working at a startup doesn't necessarily mean long hours, but it does mean that it's not the hours that count, it's the results.  If you need to work 80 hours to get something done by next week, you will need to do it because otherwise the startup might die - in a large company, this might just result in some mild consequences.  Startup life tends to go in bursts.  You should be comfortable with this.Lastly, a big misconception that I want to point out is that one of the criteria is not ""do you have an appetite for risk?""  I believe that working at a startup is more about the type of lifestyle and working environment you prefer, and not significantly more risky than working at an established company.  Job security at large companies today is nearly non-existent, and the ability to know when you're going to be out of a job or facing a decreased income stream is less at a large company (you will often only be told at the last minute) than at a startup, where you can usually see bad events coming and prepare yourself.  Startups are more likely to fail than large companies, but people who work at startups often don't have trouble finding jobs again very quickly, either in other startups or in larger companies, especially in Silicon Valley, since they are often valued for having higher initiative and broader experience.

Mehak Vohra,6y,What's the ugly side of Silicon Valley and the tech industry culture?,"Everyone is all talk.

Seriously.

I don’t think I’ve ever actually heard a founder say that they are failing.

It’s all about how many users you have.

How many views your ad got on Facebook.

I look around sometimes and I feel like Silicon Valley has lost it’s realness.

It’s no longer about trying to change the world, but about trying to be the next Mark Zuckerberg.

Everyone is putting off this front that they are successful, and it’s just simply not true.

People are more worried about how others perceive them, than actually getting shit done.

I’ve watched my friends get depressed because of the feeling of being less than.

No one realizes how fake it is out here, until you get here.

I’ve had friends say that they feel Silicon Valley is “eating them up”, and it’s true. The fakeness and money aren’t real here.

There were so many people that I looked up to because they had a good social following, only to get out here and find that they aren’t real.

Either their startup is failing or they’ve just put on a show.

The fakeness is the ugly side of Silicon Valley, and sadly I don’t see it changing anytime soon.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q8sxvrz1uk6d3cw2', 'title': ""What's the ugly side of Silicon Valley and the tech industry culture?"", 'score': {'original': 0.4187, 'ai': 0.5813}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Everyone is all talk.\n\nSeriously.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever actually heard a founder say that they are failing.\n\nIt’s all about how many users you have.\n\nHow many views your ad got on Facebook.\n\nI look around sometimes and I feel like Silicon Valley has lost it’s realness.\n\nIt’s no longer about trying to change the world, but about trying to be the next Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nEveryone is putting off this front that they are successful, and it’s just simply not true.\n\nPeople are more worried about how others perceive them, than actually getting shit done.\n\nI’ve watched my friends get depressed because of the feeling of being less than.\n\nNo one realizes how fake it is out here, until you get here.\n\nI’ve had friends say that they feel Silicon Valley is “eating them up”, and it’s true.

Shubham Mishra,Updated 4y,What's your startup and how's it doing?,"So our startup’s name is E-Vega Mobility Labs.

During the hunt of internship in reputed EV firms for the post of electrical design engineer, I found that such people are selling EV products at a very higher range so that only upper class people can dare to afford. After getting rejected from many EV companies such as Ather, Tork and Artem I thought that,

Why don’t we provide EVs at affordable rates to Indian masses mainly?

EVs which are rugged, reliable and affordable at the same time. As majority of the pollution is coming from the lower strata, urban commute is facing traffic congestion along with that. Average distance is estimated to be 8 KM for an urban commute in India. People are becoming stressed and ill due to such traffic congestion and pollutants. As our brain and nose both are a chaotic place, we are unknowingly becoming unhealthy.

With no money in hand, I applied at several incubation centres for the initial support. Our pitch went well at GUSEC, where we got selected after much explanation of vision and mission.

Starting with an Idea of “World’s most affordable electric bicycle” without much compromising the quality and user experience we started the venture. We are at a mission to be the EV solution provider for the world.

We are now incubated at GUSEC, a govt. supported incubation centre in Ahmedabad. They are supporting us at various aspects. They have provided the initial funding which obviously doesn’t include the survival allowances.

I have done my M.Tech, where I got placed in a well known solar company but vision pulls greater than gravity.

I thought that it is better to risk then regret.

So it got started from Feb 19 at a bullet speed.

E-Vega consists of two portions, E leads to electric and vega means speed in Sanskrit.

Some weird things about E-Vega team (perhaps for most of the Indian bootstrapped startups):

We never order from zomato or any food delivery chain. (most affordable living standard)
We drink less water, as it allows lesser loo breaks. (Less rests)
We don’t pay anyone, totally vision driven startup. (To make dings…)
We don’t insult any other startup. (Ethics)
We eat Parle-G often, to get the flow going. (India’s own brand ;-))
We deal with indigenous component suppliers mainly (to make the product as Indian as possible).
Indians, so are we, love chai.
We don’t have breakfasts (Paisa nahi hai ;-)).
At some point we were feeling like Rahul Gandhi, now we are moving towards to feel like PM Modi (Fake struggles to real ones).
Hungry for the food and success both.
If this ebike rolls out well, we will be like Rajnikantha of EV sector.
E-Vega’s Founder is the poorest founder among all the startup founders of GUSEC.

This is what we have done so far:

These images are of the initial prototype only.

Now lets talk about innovations. We have already filed two patents which consists of patents related to air purification on the go and another one is related to ergonomics comfort.

We are upgrading our flagship product to making it ready for the market. This is our present team, with the first treat they got at engineer’s day 15 Sept:

That’s how it will look like, (Good isn’t it?)

This is all about an INDIAN STARTUP looking forward to do something really f*cking big.

Just waiting for your blessings and support.

I am grateful to have such an amazing team and people we dealt throughout this journey which is yet to be finished.

Jim Burbridge,Updated 4y,"What is your favorite ""going the extra mile"" customer services story?","In October of 2011 my house caught fire. We were told that we had a day to get everything out we were going to keep, and that after that we would be locked from entering the premises.

Well, what the fuck do you do with that situation? It was Halloween so basically everyone in the house had gotten paid. And since our landlord had done this to us (they said “ok” to locking us out of the house we all lived in after 24 hours), we all silently agreed that we wouldn’t be paying rent for the next month. So we sprang into action, my mom had my brother in law go down to this storage place by our house and rent the biggest storage he could. My mom went down to the hardware store down the street. I called some friends — I was supposed to go hangout at a party or something for halloween and I was just letting them know I wasn’t going to be going. They all asked why, to which I said “the house caught fire last night. Sorry.” I didn’t call them to ask for help — my family is one of those “we’ll do it ourselves” sort of people so I had planned to be moving / packing shit for the next 24 hours solid. Next thing I knew every friend with a car was at my house. “What do you need us to do?” Well shit.

My mom went to buy bags that we could put loose stuff in — we obviously didn’t have time or the money to get boxes so things were just gonna get chucked into heavy duty trash bags and we would go through them as we could later on. When the guy commented on the volume of bags my mom bought she said “yeah, our house caught fire last night and we need to collect our things.” My mom is the sort of person who just passes on information — she wasn’t saying it expecting anything, she was just relaying why she needed the bags. Those bags sold for like $30 or $40 a box, I can’t remember honestly. The guy gave them to my mom for $10 each. When I ended up needing to go back later he said “are you from that family up the street with the house fire?” … Yeah? “Just take what you need. Let us know if you guys need to borrow any tools to take stuff apart.” I was stunned. Just… take them? “No it’s okay I can pay for th—” Your house burned down. I bought them for you at my incredibly discounted price since I own the store.

I go out of my way to use that Ace Hardware whenever I need anything involving hardware. That man took money out of his pocket to help us. We ended up bringing him a cake to thank him after we found a new place.

My brother in law went to the storage place and got the largest storage unit he could. He, like my mom, was making conversation as the woman was putting in the info into the computer “Our house burned down so we need a place to store the stuff while we figure out what we’re gonna do.” Lady didn’t bat an eye. There was a guy on the phone while my brother was doing that. He got off the phone after my brother-in-law had already paid.

“Sir, I’m sorry but did you just say your house burned down and that’s why you need the storage unit?” Yeah, it’s why I’m getting the storage. “Refund that man his money back. Give him the storage he asked for, but his rate for the first two months is $1, and you know what *reaches into pocket and pulls out a dollar bill* There, it’s paid. Also, give him after-hours gate access — I doubt you’ll be able to get everything out before 9, right?”

Uh.. I.. yeah. You don’t have to do that.

“No, your house burnt down. you’ve got bigger issues to worry about than a storage unit.”

We ended up having to get another storage unit, we didn’t expect the same kindness twice, my brother and I even tried to tell him it was okay, we didn’t want him to lose too much money. He insisted, even paid for the second unit himself again. Over the next couple of months we would occasionally have to miss payments as we dealt with the fall out of losing our home, and he would say “look, I put the padlocks on but I’ve instructed everyone to not let anyone open yours up just yet. Don’t worry about it guys.” We brought him a crap load of cake, lasagna, hell occasionally we would cook up an extra bit of food to bring him. He lost a lot of money for his kindness, and we appreciate it immensely.

Edit

When I wrote this answer I did not expect for it to receive the amount of votes and views that it would (this question already had quite a few answers on it when I wrote mine)

I figured I would name the places that helped my family out when we really needed it. The Ace Hardware is called “Whale Point Ace Hardware” and is on Cutting Boulevard in Richmond, CA.

The storage place is Payless Self Storage, on Richmond Parkway in Richmond CA. Without them I don’t want to imagine how much rougher the whole process would have been.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6h4wtc1spfqgxbjm', 'title': 'What is your favorite ""going the extra mile"" customer services story?', 'score': {'original': 0.9748, 'ai': 0.0252}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In October of 2011 my house caught fire.

Jim Reich,Updated 4y,What are the dark secrets of Silicon Valley startups?,"Pretty much all startups who are actually doing something difficult had a period where they were semi-faking it. This doesn’t mean they were intending to run a fake company, or that they weren’t confident the technology was going to work. It’s just a stage of development.

But that brilliant computer vision startup probably had a phase where a bunch of highly paid engineers in the back room were hand- counting the number of cars on some camera images, or the founders of that delivery robot platform were hand driving their deliveries , or someone was having to rebuild the database every night after it got corrupted, or the results of that natural language processing algorithm get fixed by hand each time, etc. Usually this phase passes.

Matthew Bates,3y,Which businesses took an unexpected hit because of covid-19?,"Teachers will still get paid during this time, because they’re salaried and have contracts. Also, many of us are working from home instead, doing e-learning with our students, so we don’t have to make up these days later on.

But many schools have third-party special teachers and therapists who will not get paid during this time. They don’t work for the schools, but for a company that sends them to the schools. They’re hourly, not salaried, and they have no contracts.

It’s the same for the overnight cleaning crews at many schools and other public places. There’s no need to clean a building overnight if it wasn’t occupied during the day.

The people who supply weekly religious consumables, like Communion wine and wafers, and even the printed flyers… no need for any of that if the church is closed to the public. The masses here in Chicago were all just livestreamed today.

Illinois just legalized sports betting on March 1. Casinos spent millions on new sports betting areas. And now… those casinos are closed for two weeks, but they were taking a dive on those sports betting venues for days before that.

The way this plays out is often STUNNING. Consider the train of thinking that goes with the StarShip and SuperHeavy:

1. The cost of flying to Mars is dominated by the number of on-orbit refueling tankers we need to launch to refuel a single StarShip.
2. So a big cost reduction would come from tanker ships with bigger payload to orbit.
3. Is there any weight reduction possible on the tankers?
4. The landing legs are heavy…we should lighten them.

Kurt Guntheroth,Updated 5y,"If you are a senior programmer, how can a new startup attract you to join?","Pay me the salary that my training and experience deserve. Senior developers have seen enough startups crash that they aren’t interested in working for peanuts. Doesn’t matter if your funding is shaky. Doesn’t matter how good you think your idea is. You need senior devs to get across the finish line. If you can’t afford to pay them, don’t start the project.
Listen to my advice. The valuable thing you get when you hire a senior developer is experience. If the senior developers say you need more tests, you need ‘em. You can’t say, “We’re a startup; we can’t afford tests.” If the senior developers say, “We need to refactor or we’ll never get the quality we need,” believe it. You can’t say, “We’ll fix it in version 2.0.” because you may never get there if you spend all your time supporting version 1.0 on the phone. You (the founder) may be the smartest guy in the room, but you need to recognize that there are other smart guys.
Don’t reject my application if I don’t immediately buy into the wonderfulness of your great idea. I’ll come to work every day and work hard and effectively to make your dream a reality. It’s up to you as founder to have dreams that are not complete fantasy. It’s up to me to write good code. Senior developers have seen enough dreams crash that they aren’t willing to work for stock. They’ve also seen founders do some MBA jiu-jitsu right before going public that leaves the developers holding a big empty bag, while the founders walk off with all the money.
Don’t make me trust you on matters of compensation. Don’t promise that you will get your senior devs stock grants, but you can’t do it until June because that’s when the board meets. Don’t promise that they can have comp-time in six months after the Big Push. Put it in writing today, or don’t say it. Remember what I said about senior developers and experience?

And see what happens when an intern of a team in the league screws up.

Rajasthan Royals’ has about 5,47,000 followers on Twitter and with it’s brilliant performance this IPL season it is gaining many more fans everyday. However, all these fans were left a little bewildered on April 28th when RR’s official account sent out 6 random tweets.

​

Well, this is what happens when interns put their phones in their pockets and forget to log out! Followers first wondered if this was some advertising strategy but later understood.

Jason M. Lemkin,4y,How did Masayoshi Son trust WeWork at its founder so quickly? He has met Adam Neumann for only 4 minutes and decided to invest $4.4 billion.,"Pattern-matching.

It what almost all investors do. At least the heads of investing firms. FBOW.

First, even if Masayoshi Son only met for Neumann for 4 minutes, the Softbank team had spent tons of time pouring over financials, doing diligence, visiting customers, etc. Tons of time. That’s what the investing team is for.

Second, the heads of most huge PE/VC firms often have to quickly assess CEO candidates proposed by their teams. The boss / the head of the firm often only meets once with a CEO before a large check goes in. Not the same as Softbank, but I intro’d 2 CEOs to a $10b+ fund who funded both companies (both winners) within weeks. Both were $60m+ checks. Not Softbank big, but big. And the head of the firm made a decision 15 minutes into meeting with each CEO. He had to. They probably do 50 of these investments per fund, and he has to meet probably 100+ CEOs as part of that. But that was after his team had done lots of work to have conviction on the investments.

So the folks at the top of PE/VC firms end up doing a lot of pattern-matching to make 15–20 minute confirmatory decisions after person-months of work their teams have already done.

And for better or worse, they pattern match. Masayoshi Son apparently was pattern-matching with Alibaba, his top investment. Everyone does it. It allows a lot of bias to creep in. And it risks not evolving with the times.

But it is hard to make a decision in 20 minutes or less if you don’t.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a9xrgc4tq3fjw086', 'title': 'How did Masayoshi Son trust WeWork at its founder so quickly?

Steve Baker,2y,"Can you explain Elon Musk's venture Neuralink, as though you had to explain it to a kindergartner?","Sure.

The people at Neuralink invented a machine that can put hundreds or perhaps thousands of TINY thin wires into someone’s head. It doesn’t hurt at all and it does it very quickly.

So far, they’ve only tried it out on animals - but they taught a monkey to play a video game just by watching the screen and thinking about it.

Perhaps, eventually, we’ll be able to do more - maybe just thinking messages to people that will just pop into their heads without them having to read it.

This shoe store launched without any shoes

Nick Swinmurn (founder of Zappos) had a big fight ahead of him. He recently went to a shopping mall and was frustrated as he couldn’t find a pair of shoes he wanted.

In 1999, Swinmurn was frustrated with the industry and decided to launch his own company called Zappos.

Swinmurn needed to raise money for Zappos, so he went to an investor meeting. Before him, stood some of the richest investors in Las Vegas and Swinmurn tried to convince them that

One day Zappos will take full advantage of the internet. Zappos will sell shoes online to ensure that everybody receives the shoes they want. Zappos will provide happiness. That is “What We Live By!”

All Swinmurn needed was a small investment of $1 million

Nobody invested

Buying shoes online!?! Nobody wants to buy shoes online. People want to go into a shop and try shoes out for themselves. This business will go nowhere.

Swinmurn walked away with nothing. He didn’t have the money, the expertise and couldn’t find the right employees. How could he make this work? It’s impossible… but Swinmurn believed everything was possible.

How could he convince investors that his business would work?

Swinmurn launched the company without any shoes. He made a deal with a shoe company that he would take a picture of the shoes in store and post them for sale on his website. Then, when customers bought the shoes, he would buy them from the store and send the shoes to the customers.

He created an illusion that the company had 100s of shoes; whilst, in reality, they had none. And…

Swinmurn was correct. The company exploded in popularity. Zappos made sale after sale, received investment after investment, and surely enough, after 6 years, they made profit after profit.

This was one of the first instances of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) which is the minimum amount of effort needed to test if a product will be successful. Zappos changed the way startups operate.

Today, Zappos is one of the most recognised online shoe stores in the U.S.

Joshua Gross,3y,Why do so many computer science graduates want to work for an existing company but not to make their own startup?,"I’ll rephrase your question:

Why do people who are most interested in computing want computing careers, rather than business (entrepreneurship) careers?

I had a business. I made a lot of money. I had the ability to grow, hire people, etc. I didn’t like running a business. That was hard. I had to do administrative things. I had to deal with money, which creeped me out. I had to fire a guy, which I definitely took harder than he did.

I went back to regular employment as soon as I could. I could noodle around with computers all day, and get paid for that. It wasn’t always fun, but it was in my area of interest. Money just magically appeared in my bank account.

Peter Baskerville,Updated 5y,What are the biggest myths about owning a business?,"As someone who has owned over 30 different businesses in speciality retail, fast food and hospitality, here are some of the biggest myths that I have discovered in relation to owning a small business, especially in the early stages:

Myth 1: That owning a business means that you can work whenever you like.

The truth is that you don’t own a business ... it owns you. If it is right for the business to serve its customers 24/7, then it is up to you as the owner/manager to staff that need, even if it means staffing it yourself - which it usually does. It’s not uncommon for people that own their own business to commit 80–100 hours a week to its survival and success.

Myth 2: That you will make a fortune when you own your own business.

Many employees look at what their boss charges their customers and thinks that they must be making a fortune. It’s only when they open their own business and see the vast number of ‘mouths that need to be fed’ (expenses) from the revenue received, that they realize that net profit margins are thin, bordering on non-existent.

Myth 3: That the feeling you enjoyed as a customer of the business will carry over to when you become the owner of the business.

The truth is that the reason you enjoyed the pleasurable feeling as a customer of a business is because the owner of that business sacrificed their happiness/wants for yours. So when you own that business, you will need to sacrifice your happiness/wants for your customer’s benefit, negating any pleasurable feelings that you once held as a customer.

Myth 4: That owning your own business means that you can be your own boss and no longer answer to one.

In some ways this is true in that as an owner of the business you no longer answer to a boss … it’s more likely that you will now answer to many bosses: customers for a start, then maybe your employees, your partners, your financiers, your suppliers, your landlords and government departments - just to mention a few of the bosses that you will need to answer to and not to forget the business’ ‘bottom line profits’.

Myth 5: That owning a business means that you can set your own salary

The truth is that the survival of the business is more important than your own wants and desires. So if the business calls for it, then you as the owner will need to sacrifice your take from the business to ensure that the business has the ability to pay its bills and grow. Your salary comes after all other business demands and it will be much less than you anticipate at this point. Your income will ultimately depended on fickle customer decisions and economic forces that are mostly beyond your control.

Myth 6: You will be able to outsource and delegate everything.

The truth is that some issues like managerial finance, pricing and recruitment can’t be outsourced if you are going to run a financially sustainable business and your profit margins will restrict you from engaging all the consultants and help that you will need. Also, many task just can’t be delegated to key staff and you will find that these tasks will fall to you to perform. Don’t be surprised if some of those tasks include cleaning the bathrooms and putting out the rubbish.

Myth 7: That the business will be financially successful from day 1.

The truth is that very few business are profitable from day 1. Most businesses take a period of time to become profitable that can stretch from 3 months to 3 years. It’s not uncommon for say a restaurant to take up to 3 years to become profitable while a take-away food bar may only take 3 months. Either-way, if a business owner does not have sufficient working capital to cover the losses incurred until the business reaches profitability, then it will fail due to liquidity problems.

I know that the above myths are valid, because I believed each one of them to my own detriment during my 25 year career in starting and managing small businesses.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ux8nwabdg69hcyvf', 'title': 'What are the biggest myths about owning a business?', 'score': {'original': 0.8335, 'ai': 0.1665}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'As someone who has owned over 30 different businesses in speciality retail, fast food and hospitality, here are some of the biggest myths that I have discovered in relation to owning a small business, especially in the early stages:\n\nMyth 1: That owning a business means that you can work whenever you like.\n\nThe truth is that you don’t own a business ... it owns you.

Either-way, if a business owner does not have sufficient working capital to cover the losses incurred until the business reaches profitability, then it will fail due to liquidity problems.\n\nI know that the above myths are valid, because I believed each one of them to my own detriment during my 25 year career in starting and managing small businesses.', 'result': {'fake': 0.4719, 'real': 0.5281}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 7, 'credits': 1988827, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'As someone who has owned over 30 different businesses in speciality retail, fast food and hospitality, here are some of the biggest myths that I have discovered in relation to owning a small business, especially in the early stages:\n\nMyth 1: That owning a business means that you can work whenever you like.\n\nThe truth is that you don’t own a business ... it owns you. If it is right for the business to serve its customers 24/7, then it is up to you as the owner/manager to staff that need, even if it means staffing it yourself - which it usually does. It’s not uncommon for people that own their own business to commit 80–100 hours a week to its survival and success.\n\nMyth 2: That you will make a fortune when you own your own business.\n\nMany employees look at what their boss charges their customers and thinks that they must be making a fortune. It’s only when they open their own business and see the vast number of ‘mouths that need to be fed’ (expenses) from the revenue received, that they realize that net profit margins are thin, bordering on non-existent.\n\nMyth 3: That the feeling you enjoyed as a customer of the business will carry over to when you become the owner of the business.\n\nThe truth is that the reason you enjoyed the pleasurable feeling as a customer of a business is because the owner of that business sacrificed their happiness/wants for yours. So when you own that business, you will need to sacrifice your happiness/wants for your customer’s benefit, negating any pleasurable feelings that you once held as a customer.\n\nMyth 4: That owning your own business means that you can be your own boss and no longer answer to one.\n\nIn some ways this is true in that as an owner of the business you no longer answer to a boss … it’s more likely that you will now answer to many bosses: customers for a start, then maybe your employees, your partners, your financiers, your suppliers, your landlords and government departments - just to mention a few of the bosses that you will need to answer to and not to forget the business’ ‘bottom line profits’.\n\nMyth 5: That owning a business means that you can set your own salary\n\nThe truth is that the survival of the business is more important than your own wants and desires. So if the business calls for it, then you as the owner will need to sacrifice your take from the business to ensure that the business has the ability to pay its bills and grow. Your salary comes after all other business demands and it will be much less than you anticipate at this point. Your income will ultimately depended on fickle customer decisions and economic forces that are mostly beyond your control.\n\nMyth 6: You will be able to outsource and delegate everything.\n\nThe truth is that some issues like managerial finance, pricing and recruitment can’t be outsourced if you are going to run a financially sustainable business and your profit margins will restrict you from engaging all the consultants and help that you will need. Also, many task just can’t be delegated to key staff and you will find that these tasks will fall to you to perform. Don’t be surprised if some of those tasks include cleaning the bathrooms and putting out the rubbish.\n\nMyth 7: That the business will be financially successful from day 1.\n\nThe truth is that very few business are profitable from day 1. Most businesses take a period of time to become profitable that can stretch from 3 months to 3 years. It’s not uncommon for say a restaurant to take up to 3 years to become profitable while a take-away food bar may only take 3 months. Either-way, if a business owner does not have sufficient working capital to cover the losses incurred until the business reaches profitability, then it will fail due to liquidity problems.\n\nI know that the above myths are valid, because I believed each one of them to my own detriment during my 25 year career in starting and managing small businesses.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.8335
Hector Quintanilla,9mo,What’s the best piece of advice for a bootstrapped startup?,"Price is NEVER the problem…

If your product doesn’t sell or struggles with tight margins, don’t blame your customers— it’s all your fault.

Tough truth.

Louis Vuitton is the perfect example.

How can LV sell their luxury handbags for thousands of dollars, while other manufacturers struggle to sell their heavily discounted bags?

So, to answer your question, what’s the best piece of advice for a bootstrapped startup?

NEVER, EVER — EVER compete by price!

The price of the product is NEVER the problem — the problem is always found on the PERCEPTION of value of the product.

Andreas Kitzing,Updated 4y,What is the worst thing you can do or say in your first meeting with a venture capital firm?,"You could intentionally show up late and wear pajamas. You think that would never happen? Well, it did, and the incident is well documented. You can probably guess from the picture - if not, you’ll find out by the end of the answer who pulled this off…

In 2004, Sequoia Capital - arguably one of the world’s most prestigious venture capital firms - invited the founder of one of the hottest startups at the time to a meeting. This founder was working on two startups at that time, one of which would eventually become a multi-billion dollar company. Anyway, the meeting was scheduled to discuss funding for the other startup.

A friend and employee of this founder was Napster’s co-founder Sean Parker. Sequoia had previously invested into Parker’s startup Plaxo, but things didn’t end well. As a result, our founder had no intention of accepting funding from Sequoia and decided to prank them. The prank had three core elements:

First, the founder intentionally showed up late for the 8 AM meeting.

Second, he was wearing pajamas (yes, seriously).

Third, he presented a PowerPoint presentation titled “The Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Not Invest”. The deck included very convincing arguments, such as:

“We have no revenue.”
“We’re only here because [name of Sequoia partner] told us to come.”
“Because Sean Parker is involved.”
“We will probably get sued by the music industry.”
“We showed up at your office late in our pajamas.”

Not surprisingly, Sequoia politely declined to make an offer. They never invested in his other, later-on super-successful startup, either. Considering that Sequoia did invest in Apple, Atari, Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, Instagram, PayPal, WhatsApp, YouTube, and many others, this is one of the few successful Silicon Valley tech companies where Sequoia wasn’t involved.

So, what’s the name of this founder?

Do you recognize him? Yes, Mark Zuckerberg played this prank on Sequoia when raising money for Wirehog (his side project when founding Facebook). Zuckerberg later told David Kirkpatrick, author of “The Facebook Effect”, that he “assumed we really offended them and now I feel really bad about that.”

Anyway, this wouldn’t be a Silicon Valley story if the VC firm wouldn’t have the last laugh. Do you remember the list of Sequoia’s investments two paragraphs above this one? Did you notice it included “WhatsApp”? In 2011, Sequoia Capital had led WhatsApp’s $8 million Series A (and in 2013, the Series B as well).

Guess who bought WhatsApp in 2014? Yeah, Facebook did, and they paid $19 billion - about $3 billion of which went directly into Sequoia’s pockets. I guess this repayment kind of let Sequoia forgive Zuckerberg for his prank 10 years earlier. :)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/42xb5063qmsrjcgn', 'title': 'What is the worst thing you can do or say in your first meeting with a venture capital firm?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'You could intentionally show up late and wear pajamas.

Ali Aydar,11y,"What was it like to work at the old Napster (particularly, during the lawsuits)?","There were three distinct phases of Napster and working there was different in each one. Phase 1 - Pre-investment from Hummer Winblad (before Q1 2000):  At this point we were a small team, made up mostly of engineers.  Our CEO was an energetic former VC named Eileen Richardson, who was primarily working on raising money.  A successful money raise was predicated on growth of the service.  At the time I joined in September 1999, there were only 40,000 registered users and only a few hundred connected simultaneously at any given time.  There were concerns about whether or not we'd be able to scale given the available technologies in 1999.  Our only focus as an engineering team during this phase was scalability of the backend systems to support potentially millions of simultaneously connected users.  This was no easy feat in 1999, but our corporate culture led us to completely exceed anybody's expectations.  We were all very young at the time and very excited about what Napster could become, so we worked our tails off and had a total blast.  And it wasn't just the engineers, it was the business side too.  I remember that our first company meeting after I joined started at 11pm and went until around 2am.  We had one room in our office with all of us youngsters, which included myself, Jordan Ritter, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Parker.  We were joined a couple months later by Jordan Mendelson.  We were there at all hours of the day and night, sometimes sleeping under our desks as we tried to keep the servers up.  To keep ourselves awake during marathon coding sessions, rap or cheesy hip-hop music would blare through Jordan Ritter's speakers.  We even had cases of Red Bull, which had only recently launched, delivered directly to our office.  It was absolutely the best time in the entire Napster experience.  Everybody was excited about the future, happy about what they were working on, and free from any corporate or legal constraints.  The intrinsic value of what were doing was so high that we would have all probably worked for free.  It's no wonder that we were able to overcome significant technical challenges to build a scalable service.  As I've grown and matured as a manager and now a CEO, I've come to understand that the right corporate culture is critical in creating an environment that incites the creativity necessary to achieve disruptive innovation.  That's what we had at this time, and it was nothing short of awesome. Phase 2 - Post Hummer Winblad investment until service shutdown (Q1 2000 to Q2 2001):  The lawsuit from the major labels was filed in December 1999.  Things really didn't change that much when the lawsuit was filed because as engineers we were still focused on scaling and as a business we were still focused on raising money.  Of course raising money was a bit more challenging with a lawsuit hanging over us, but there was still a significant amount of interest and we ultimately closed a round with Hummer Winblad.  Hummer immediately installed one of their partners, Hank Barry, as the CEO.  At that point we moved into this phase of Napster's existence.  Hank (and John Hummer, who took a board seat) was completely focused on resolving the lawsuit.  Hank brought in others to help manage the day-to-day aspects of managing the company while he worked with the labels to try to resolve the dispute.  For all of us internally, there wasn't much we could do.  Product changes were minimal to none -- purposely so as to not disrupt our legal efforts.  We were in a wait and see mode.  It was discouraging because we didn't know what was going to happen and we didn't know what to expect.  Communication to the staff about progress of negotiations was minimal, mostly because discretion was perceived to be critical.  We were continuing to grow organizationally, so it was exciting to be part of something that was getting bigger.  And the service itself was scaling like crazy.  At our peak we had over 70M registered users with 2.5M connected simultaneously at one point.  The statistic that blew me away the most was that the average registered user connected to Napster once every other day (this is of course now completely blown out of the water by Facebook, but for the year 2000 this was astounding).  However, on the whole this phase was characterized by lots of ups and down.  We didn't know what was going on with the lawsuit and there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty.  The uncertainty led to total product stagnation, which for engineering and product management was very frustrating.  At the same time, we were growing like gangbusters, so it was exciting.  Then we got the court order to shutdown followed by a stay of the order two days later.  It was like going from total devastation to absolute jubilation.  The emotional roller coaster was draining.  Then during the stay we got the $60M investment from Bertelsmann, which at the time was the owner of one of the record labels suing us, so we really thought this whole thing was really going to work.  But ultimately the court ruled that we needed to shutdown.  I've later been told by multiple people that I had the dubious honor of shutting down all the server processes, though to be totally honest I have zero recollection of doing so.  Repressed memories I guess. Phase 3 - The Bertelsmann Era (Q2 2001 to Q3 2002):  After the Bertelsmann investment, Hank began looking for his replacement.  Ultimately, Bertelsmann installed one of their own executives, Konrad Hilbers, as the CEO.  This was the worst time at Napster, but it wasn't Konrad's fault.  The truth is that Napster was over, but nobody was willing to admit it.  It was like trying to get an old horse with tired legs to jump over a fence.  And one of the legs was broken.  And the fence was 1,000 feet high.  It wasn't going to happen.  Napster as we knew it was dead.  The strategy was to try to build a legal Napster, something that works a lot like Spotify does today.  But the labels just weren't going to license a company named ""Napster"" in 2002 with subscription licenses.  That didn't stop Konrad and Bertelsmann from trying.  In this era the company was really split in two: the engineering and product side vs. the business side.  The business side was telling the other side ""just build the service and don't worry about the licenses, we'll get them, trust us.""  The engineering and product side was saying, ""Yeah, we'll build it, don't worry.  But this sucks.  This isn't really Napster.""  And we built it.  I led the development of many of the systems that we built for the ""legitimate Napster.""  And they were all ultimately ready to ship.  But there weren't many on the engineering side that thought this would work as a product.  The world was used to the original Napster and we felt like they would hate this product.  It was an absolutely dreadful time trying to build a product that you didn't believe in, 180 degrees away from what the first phase of Napster was like.  There was also mistrust between the two sides of the company.  There was always skepticism from the business side about our ability to build the service, while there was similar skepticism from the engineering side about whether or not we would procure licenses.  Ultimately we didn't get the licenses.  But it really wasn't anybody's fault -- the industry just wasn't ready for it.  This was a dark time.  The lesson for me here was that when your instincts tell you that it's over, you're probably right, so just call it like it is and move on.  Doing so would have saved a whole lot of time, heartache, and money.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1isoamb8j9znlv25', 'title': 'What was it like to work at the old Napster (particularly, during the lawsuits)?', 'score': {'original': 0.4898, 'ai': 0.5102}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""There were three distinct phases of Napster and working there was different in each one.

And it wasn\'t just the engineers, it was the business side too.  I remember that our first company meeting after I joined started at 11pm and went until around 2am.  We had one room in our office with all of us youngsters, which included myself, Jordan Ritter, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Parker.  We were joined a couple months later by Jordan Mendelson.  We were there at all hours of the day and night, sometimes sleeping under our desks as we tried to keep the servers up.  To keep ourselves awake during marathon coding sessions, rap or cheesy hip-hop music would blare through Jordan Ritter\'s speakers.  We even had cases of Red Bull, which had only recently launched, delivered directly to our office.  It was absolutely the best time in the entire Napster experience.  Everybody was excited about the future, happy about what they were working on, and free from any corporate or legal constraints.  The intrinsic value of what were doing was so high that we would have all probably worked for free.  It\'s no wonder that we were able to overcome significant technical challenges to build a scalable service.  As I\'ve grown and matured as a manager and now a CEO, I\'ve come to understand that the right corporate culture is critical in creating an environment that incites the creativity necessary to achieve disruptive innovation.  That\'s what we had at this time, and it was nothing short of awesome. Phase 2 - Post Hummer Winblad investment until service shutdown (Q1 2000 to Q2 2001):  The lawsuit from the major labels was filed in December 1999.  Things really didn\'t change that much when the lawsuit was filed because as engineers we were still focused on scaling and as a business we were still focused on raising money.  Of course raising money was a bit more challenging with a lawsuit hanging over us, but there was still a significant amount of interest and we ultimately closed a round with Hummer Winblad.  Hummer immediately installed one of their partners, Hank Barry, as the CEO.  At that point we moved into this phase of Napster\'s existence.  Hank (and John Hummer, who took a board seat) was completely focused on resolving the lawsuit.  Hank brought in others to help manage the day-to-day aspects of managing the company while he worked with the labels to try to resolve the dispute.  For all of us internally, there wasn\'t much we could do.  Product changes were minimal to none -- purposely so as to not disrupt our legal efforts.  We were in a wait and see mode.  It was discouraging because we didn\'t know what was going to happen and we didn\'t know what to expect.  Communication to the staff about progress of negotiations was minimal, mostly because discretion was perceived to be critical.  We were continuing to grow organizationally, so it was exciting to be part of something that was getting bigger.  And the service itself was scaling like crazy.  At our peak we had over 70M registered users with 2.5M connected simultaneously at one point.  The statistic that blew me away the most was that the average registered user connected to Napster once every other day (this is of course now completely blown out of the water by Facebook, but for the year 2000 this was astounding).  However, on the whole this phase was characterized by lots of ups and down.  We didn\'t know what was going on with the lawsuit and there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty.  The uncertainty led to total product stagnation, which for engineering and product management was very frustrating.  At the same time, we were growing like gangbusters, so it was exciting.  Then we got the court order to shutdown followed by a stay of the order two days later.  It was like going from total devastation to absolute jubilation.  The emotional roller coaster was draining.  Then during the stay we got the $60M investment from Bertelsmann, which at the time was the owner of one of the record labels suing us, so we really thought this whole thing was really going to work.  But ultimately the court ruled that we needed to shutdown.  I\'ve later been told by multiple people that I had the dubious honor of shutting down all the server processes, though to be totally honest I have zero recollection of doing so.  Repressed memories I guess. Phase 3 - The Bertelsmann Era (Q2 2001 to Q3 2002):  After the Bertelsmann investment, Hank began looking for his replacement.  Ultimately, Bertelsmann installed one of their own executives, Konrad Hilbers, as the CEO.  This was the worst time at Napster, but it wasn\'t Konrad\'s fault.  The truth is that Napster was over, but nobody was willing to admit it.  It was like trying to get an old horse with tired legs to jump over a fence.  And one of the legs was broken.  And the fence was 1,000 feet high.  It wasn\'t going to happen.  Napster as we knew it was dead.  The strategy was to try to build a legal Napster, something that works a lot like Spotify does today.  But the labels just weren\'t going to license a company named ""Napster"" in 2002 with subscription licenses.  That didn\'t stop Konrad and Bertelsmann from trying.  In this era the company was really split in two: the engineering and product side vs. the business side.  The business side was telling the other side ""just build the service and don\'t worry about the licenses, we\'ll get them, trust us.""  The engineering and product side was saying, ""Yeah, we\'ll build it, don\'t worry.  But this sucks.  This isn\'t really Napster.""  And we built it.  I led the development of many of the systems that we built for the ""legitimate Napster.""  And they were all ultimately ready to ship.  But there weren\'t many on the engineering side that thought this would work as a product.  The world was used to the original Napster and we felt like they would hate this product.  It was an absolutely dreadful time trying to build a product that you didn\'t believe in, 180 degrees away from what the first phase of Napster was like.  There was also mistrust between the two sides of the company.  There was always skepticism from the business side about our ability to build the service, while there was similar skepticism from the engineering side about whether or not we would procure licenses.  Ultimately we didn\'t get the licenses.  But it really wasn\'t anybody\'s fault -- the industry just wasn\'t ready for it.  This was a dark time.  The lesson for me here was that when your instincts tell you that it\'s over, you\'re probably right, so just call it like it is and move on.  Doing so would have saved a whole lot of time, heartache, and money.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.4898
Rohit Kashyap,4y,What are some things that good entrepreneurs know that others don't?,"He is Jack Ma, Founder of the Alibaba Group and one of the richest person on the Planet with the net worth of 39.2 Billion Dollars.
In an interview, he shared what is his key to success. He said he is not the Best person but his work is to bring the best people at his company and make them work together.
He said there is always a little gap in the attitude of two best people and a successful entrepreneur is who that fills the gap and make them work together.

Now, Let’s come on the actual question “What are some things that good entrepreneurs know that others don't?”

A good entrepreneur knows how to hire the best people for their startup.
He knows how to make them work together.
He knows that if he is not the best then he will have to hire the best.
He knows Individuals don’t build great companies, teams do.

Namaste,

Håkon Hapnes Strand,1y,"As a startup CTO, how can I protect my web app from security threats?","Startup CTO here. I’m not a security expert, and neither are probably you. Most likely, you can't hire one full-time either.

What you could do is hire the services of a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO). That’s a security expert with long industry experience that bills by the hour. It might be worth the investment to get an assessment of your security stack and some pointers on where to improve. You might even want them to do some penetration testing.

But to some extent, you need to get your own feet wet. You’ll have to answer to customers and investors, so you need to have a good grasp of how you secure your app.

The good news is that it’s not that hard to get the basics right. Most of it can be summed up as “don’t reinvent the wheel” and “follow best practices”.

Well, here is my very quick security 101 guide for CTOs:

HTTPS
I’m going to assume that you have enabled HTTPS on all your endpoints and use some form of login mechanism. This is as basic as it gets.

Authentication
Don’t reinvent the wheel here. OpenID Connect on top of OAuth 2.0 is what everyone uses these days. You probably want to use a third party identity platform instead of self-hosting. Auth0 is a pretty good option, although there are many others.

You’ll definitely want to set up multi-factor authentication at some point.

Secrets and passwords
Don’t expose secrets like API keys and passwords in source code. Just don’t. Make sure that secrets are always encrypted and that they see as few human eyes as possible. Don’t store them on developer laptops.

There are tools you can use like Gitleaks that auto-detect hardcoded secrets in source code.

Recycle keys on regular intervals.

APIs
If you have third party development teams that access any of your APIs, set up an API gateway and some form of access control.

DevOps
CI/CD and high levels of automation will improve security by decreasing the risk for human error. This is generally a good idea to implement for efficiency reasons anyway.

Access management
Don’t give developers and other team members more access than they strictly need to perform their job. Just enough admin rights should be the order of the day.

Logging and monitoring
Log as much as possible and set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as a large number of requests from geographical regions you don’t expect traffic from.

Development team
Having knowledgeable developers that are conscious about security is probably the number one most important thing you can do as a CTO. Always bring this up in recruitment processes. At the end of the day, one bad developer can do lots of damage, while a team of good ones can make sure your web app is robust and protected.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v21ygn60ehcquw4x', 'title': 'As a startup CTO, how can I protect my web app from security threats?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Startup CTO here.

Daniel Zielinski,Updated 5y,"What is your favorite ""going the extra mile"" customer services story?","My favorite going to the extra mile story comes from the Ritz-Carlton hotel.

Some time ago, the hotel hosted a mother with two children for a short holiday. After the family got back home from the trip, the little boy realized that he had left his beloved toy, a giraffe named Joshie, in the hotel. As you may guess, it was the emotional trauma for the boy. He was very attached to the toy and couldn’t fall asleep without the giraffe. To deal somehow with the situation, the father lied that the toy had gone on holiday. The boy believed his loving father and fell asleep.

Surprisingly, the same night the family got a call from the Ritz-Carlton. The hotel service found the toy and gave it to the hotel’s Loss Prevention Team. The parents breathed a sigh of relief and asked the hotel staff if they could take a picture of Joshie that would present her enjoying a holiday. The team agreed and set to work.

After a couple of days, a family got a parcel from the hotel. In included not only Joshie but also a beautiful set of photos showing Joshie spending time with friends, laying on a sunbed or having a massage.

The parents were positively surprised by the hotel’s involvement in their trivial problem. They were happier even more when they saw their beloved son reunited with his favorite toy.

I love this story because it shows that brands don’t need to spend a heap of money to provide unique customer service. Sometimes a bit of goodwill and creativity is sufficient to do outstanding things. And you must admit that these pictures are hilarious :)

If the Ritz-Carlton treats every guest like this giraffe, they must have the best service ever.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7l9bpntd8zcsrji2', 'title': 'What is your favorite ""going the extra mile"" customer services story?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My favorite going to the extra mile story comes from the Ritz-Carlton hotel.\n\nSome time ago, the hotel hosted a mother with two children for a short holiday.

George Paolini,Updated 3y,What are some acquisitions that didn't go through and it is probably for the better?,"I can safely bet that all of our lives would be very different had this one gone through. And I had a front row seat to the drama.

Ever heard of a company called Sun Microsystems? No? How about Apple?

In January 1996, Sun came down to the 11th Hour — literally — before it pulled the plug on acquiring Apple. I can say without equivocation that had this acquisition gone through, Apple would have been relegated to the scrapheap of history.

Sun, for those of you who don’t know, was probably the hottest tech company in the ‘90s. Its slogan was: “The network is the computer.” And its timing couldn’t have been better, as the Internet/Web was exploding.

Apple, at the time, was fumbling badly.

But both companies had one thing in common: They hated Microsoft.

I was working with Eric Schmidt, then the Chief Technology Officer at Sun (later the first CEO of Google) and Bill Joy, one of the most brilliant computer scientists of his generation. Their job was to analyze the technology fit between Sun and Apple.

Other execs at Sun had the notion that Apple real estate was worth the ~$4 billion purchase price (Apple stock was in the $5 range at the time).

The executive team got together in Palm Springs, CA and I tagged along. I was just a lowly marketing dude at the time, but they needed someone to spin the story, so I took on the job and actually wrote the press release that was THIS close to going out on the wire.

Fortunately, Eric and team prevailed. They determined that Sun’s SPARC chip architecture and Apple’s use of IBM’s PowerPC architecture would cause too many problems (Sun hated IBM almost as much as Microsoft).

Had the acquisition gone through, Steve Jobs would have never returned to Apple. None of the consumer devices we know and love (and/or hate) would have come to fruition. Sun hadn’t a clue as to consumer technology.

Today, of course, Apple is valued at $1 Trillion.

Sun? Well, it was the one that died the ignominious death, acquired by Oracle in 2009. Facebook acquired Sun’s campus in Menlo Park and Zuckerberg decided to leave the Sun logo on the back side of the main sign as a snarky reminder to his employees to remain competitive.

Couple of side notes:

The running joke at the time of the nearly ill-fated merger was the new company name combining Sun and Apple would be “Snapple.”

Dennis Mossburg,4y,What is the smartest thing a CEO has done to save his/her company?,"Hey,

When the recession hit, many CEOs reacted with lay offs. That’s straight out of the Jack Welch playbook: when bad things happen to you, punish your employees.

That’s not what Garry Ridge at WD-40 did when hit with a tough economy. When most CEOs cut staff, Garry Ridge mandated that everyone, from him down through the org chart, had to take four weeks off without pay. They could take the time off when they chose.

Very organically, some staff chose to take five weeks off so others only had to take three.

The company survived, and what do you think happened to the company culture? According to Glassdoor, 95 percent of WD-40 employees approve of their CEO.

Thanks for the question.

David Abrams,6y,What is the best position to give your co-founder as a second in command in your startup?,"Everyone is spot on in these answers!

I think it’s so easy for early founder (first time founders especially) to get obsessed with the titles. The truth is you’re just two people who have an idea (probably not even validated yet) and are working together to bring it to fruition.

You may not even have anyone on the team, yet. The only position at this point that matters is Co-Founder.

You have to do whatever it takes to take that idea and turn it into a minimal viable product, validate the product, test the markets, create customer personas, experiment with marketing channels/pricing models, and sell, sell, sell.

The actual positions and title are best served once you start these steps and the team is being hired. When you get out of “start up” mode and into deeper scalability in your business, you’ll be stepping into more defined positions so you can hire great people who know their stuff around you.

But, as mentioned by Tom here… make sure that the co-founder actually has some skill set that they can bring into the company. It can be defined and narrowed, but you want complementary skill sets and not overlapping or similar ones, so you can do more with less early on.

Hope this helps!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qgr237z0yivc4hej', 'title': 'What is the best position to give your co-founder as a second in command in your startup?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Everyone is spot on in these answers!\n\nI think it’s so easy for early founder (first time founders especially) to get obsessed with the titles.

Edouard Renard,5y,Why are there more software start ups than hardware start ups?,"When starting a hardware startup :

You need more money to build prototypes
Much more money to go for mass production
Hardware stuff breaks, so you’ll have to deal with customer returns. Too many customer returns, and you’ll be lost in a vicious circle.
If the hardware is working one time, don’t expect it to work 10 times. And please don’t hope it will work 1000 times.
Selling anywhere in the world ? Great ! Deal with all the transport companies, deal with broken parts on reception, deal with products stuck in customs
Want to change something in your product design ? Well the best time to do it was before you launched the production.
Your accounting is a mess and much harder to maintain

I won’t say that starting a software company is easier than starting a hardware company. However, it’s simpler.

So if it is simpler to start, you can expect to see more software startups than hardware startups.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/c80ftdwhi9x1aeqs', 'title': 'Why are there more software start ups than hardware start ups?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'When starting a hardware startup :\n\nYou need more money to build prototypes\nMuch more money to go for mass production\nHardware stuff breaks, so you’ll have to deal with customer returns.
