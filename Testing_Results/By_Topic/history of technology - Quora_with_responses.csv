Karthik Reddy L,Updated 6y,What are some cool inventions?,"Today while I was scrolling through my google news I came across this,

Turning water cans into urinals

In India where the number of mobiles are higher than toilets, I found this as an amazing thing which was made by a group of school students who were 13 years old.

We all know that in our country in some remote schools there aren't any toilets and students are encouraged to go out.

They made this within a budget of ₹600. The schools that can’t afford the costly urinals can make use of it.

Here are the proud inventors.

Stephen Tempest,10y,"What modern achievement would most impress a random time traveler from the Roman Empire? Feel free to answer from any Roman perspective: a Senator, a Centurion, an actual historical figure, etc.","Strap the Roman visitor into the passenger seat of something like this:


Start the engine. Explain to him that there's a box full of a special sort of oil that's burning in constant tiny explosions, making that thing in front that's like three sword blades fastened together spin around 2700 times per minute. If he's not sure what a 'minute' is, just shrug and say, ""It's really fast, okay?""

Start taxiing towards the runway. You're moving at about walking pace, so while he'll be astonished by the lack of horses pulling this peculiar cart, he won't be too worried. He might wonder why you're talking to thin air when you start saying things like ""Tower, Sierra Tango ready at runway 23"", and even more shocked when a stranger's voice comes out of thin air to say ""Sierra Tango, cleared for take-off"". He might suspect ventriloquism, or possibly ghosts.

However, he won't be thinking about that for long when the noisy thing in front of you both suddenly gets much louder, and you're moving forward again. Faster. At walking speed. Faster. At running speed. Faster. At the speed of a ship under full sail. Faster. At the speed of a galloping race horse. Even faster. Faster still. Impossibly fast.

Brace yourself, as it's possible he may scream in terror as the ground suddenly drops away beneath you, and he's pressed back into his seat as you pull back the stick and soar into the air, like an arrow shot from a bow. Higher and higher, so the people and houses and odd-looking horseless chariots dwindle into small dots far below. If he turns to you in mute astonishment, confirm it to him: ""Yes, we're flying. Like a bird. Except rather faster.""

For maximum effect, I'm going to assume you're starting from Fiumicino, Rome's international airport, and you've got special permission for this flight to ignore the usual laws on restricted airspace. Bank out over the sea, then come in from the west, flying low so you can see all the landmarks. Point out Ostia to him - in his day that was Rome's port at the mouth of the River Tiber, about 20 miles from the city itself.

The most impressive landmarks still visible today were built by Emperor Trajan round about AD 100 - the artificial island now called Isola Sacra, and the huge hexagonal artificial lake called Portus (now Lago Traiano) that was used as an anchorage. If your visitor comes from that time, he'll recognise them - but so small below him, as if in a map or painting. (The Romans did have maps, so he'll be familiar with the concept.)

Now ask him how long it should take to get from Ostia to Rome. 20 miles is about a day's journey on horseback, or two days with an ox cart. In your aircraft? Six minutes. Demonstrate this to him.

Fly down low so he can see the landmarks he'll recognise - the Colosseum, the Forum, the Circus Maximus, the Campus Martius. Then fly high so he can see how much larger the city has grown since his day. Casually remark that Rome now has a population of around three million people - compared to just over one million at its height in ancient times - and that it's no longer the largest city in the world. There are others far larger; some he'll have heard of like Londinium (London), Lutetia (Paris) and Byzantium (Istanbul), some in countries he may believe are only legendary, like India or Sinae (China); and still others in distant lands on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean that he's never dreamed of.

Then if he's feeling overwhelmed by everything he's seen and done, ask him if he'd like to relax and unwind by the seaside. Baiae near Naples was a favourite holiday resort for wealthy Romans: several Emperors built villas there, and it was noted for its hot springs. It's 150 miles south of Rome, about a week's travel by land or two days in a fast ship. In less than an hour you'll be landing at Naples airport, and get a taxi to a good hotel then find a restaurant. The lack of baked dormice and fermented fish sauce might be a disappointment to him, but the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in the middle of winter should make up for it...

I chose 'flight' as the achievement because it's so dramatic. It's far beyond anything the Romans could dream possible, while still being immediately understandable to them.

A computer connected to the Internet containing all the world's knowledge might be more impressive in the abstract, but it's only a box with words and pictures in it.

A diabetic who would have died 20 years ago if not for insulin, a man who's kept alive by the pacemaker in his heart, the woman who's able to lead a normal life because of her kidney transplant, the child who's only alive because of antibiotics - those changes might be far more significant for the human condition, but they're hard to appreciate simply by looking at a group of people walking down the street.

Telling him ""We've landed on the Moon""? Yeah, sure. Prove it. And not just with pictures; the Romans had artists with vivid imaginations too.

But flying at hundreds of miles per hour, soaring thousands of feet above the ground, in a small aircraft where you can feel every shake and vibration of the wind? Now that is a visceral experience he won't ever forget.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ftxbcewdokl71u2y', 'title': 'What modern achievement would most impress a random time traveler from the Roman Empire?

Jay Bazzinotti,Updated 2y,What are some technologies that were once common but many people wouldn’t recognize today?,"Grinding mills. Many people have grinding wheels in their driveways as ornamentation and might know what they are but have never seen how one works. These heavy stones were precision instruments where the top piece had to roll over the bottom, stationary piece with a distance of less then 1/16 of an inch between them. They were powered by wind or water or horses. Having a grinding wheel was a bid deal and a miller was an important person - he fed everyone in town and if the wheel cracked or it needed to be dressed and he didn’t have a spare, the corn piled up, was eaten by rats or rotted away. There are still a few operating grinding mills, such as the one at the grist mill in Sudbury, restored by Henry Ford and one in Rhode Island. There is a massive grinding operation in San Antonio that was part of the Alamo mission complex that still works. And the story of Bob’s Red Mill is incredible: they still salvage and restore old mill wheels to grind their grains. Note that the grooves were specific to what you were grinding and had to be recarved from time to time. Stone grinding was an precision job by an expert. The first and best mill stones came from France. If the top stone touches the bottom stone even for a short time, the stones are ruined and need to be redressed.

Ropewalks. In the old days, ropewalks were critical for sailing ships and making rope. The buildings were up to a quarter mile in length and men would walk that quartermile pulling a rope-spinning machine that would twist fiber into rope. At the end was a pitch pit where the rope was put into boiling pitch. Ropewalks were built on the water because the pitch pits would overflow, catch fire and burn down the entire city. Only a few ropewalks remain. One is in Philadelphia; one is in Baltimore and there was a big one in Boston that was recently converted into condos. It has a museum at one end showing how rope was made.

Shoeing boxes. This was a critical piece of equipment for a farrier. Note that it was a farrier who shoed horses - not Blacksmiths. Blacksmiths could shoe horses but it was a big step down for them. Farriers shoed the horse and horses are heavy. The farrier has to take the horse’s weight while shoeing them and if the horse decides to sit or press down, he can kill a farrier. The shoeing box holds the horse up while he does the work.

Laundry beetles and mangles. This equipment has been around for 100s of years but most people would be hard pressed to know what it does from looking at it. Beetle look like cricket bats and were used for many laundering operations from stirring up the vats with laundry being cleaned to beating the laundry on a rock. Mangles were boxes filled with rocks used to press clothing.

Ice Houses. Not just a place where ice was stored but all the technology for cutting blocks of ice, dragging it from the lake and moving it to the conveyors to position it, cover it with sawdust and prepare it for the summer.

Handrills. These tools were in use in Roman times and were still being used up til the mid-20th century. They were used to drill holes in granite at quarries in preparation for splitting it into blocks. I grew up with hundreds of these lying around the house because my grandfather had been a stoneworker/mason but I never knew what they were for until I saw at demo at the old Granite Quarries in Quincy where a ranger drilled a hole in a piece of granite in five minutes with a hand drill and a sledgehammer. I was amazed. I wish now I hadn’t thrown them all out when my dad died.

Shot towers. At one time you could find shot towers in any city. They were used to drop a spoonful of molten lead from a height into a bucket of water. On the way down, the molten lead would form a perfect sphere, making a musket ball. Balls can be made in hand molds but it’s a slow and arduous task. Using a shot tower was form of mass producing shot. There is a shot tower in Baltimore but I don’t know of any others in America. They were in use in England until the 1960s.

Rag pounding mills - In the time when printing first became established, paper was made in small lots by a few craftspeople but as the demand for books grew, the need for paper grew as well. In various places around Europe, particularly in Holland and France, massive mills grew up to make paper. Paper requires all kinds of long fibers usually found in rope and and cloth. Men scoured the continent buying up old rope from shipyards and collecting rags. One of the highest paid jobs in Europe in the 18th Century was rag sorter, the kind of man who knew how to sort and mix fibers to create various kinds of paper, such as wrapping paper, stationery, wallpaper, and book stock paper. Paper mills were considered high tech. One of the oldest companies in the world is a French paper mill that uses a rag pounder from the 1600s. Rags and rope had to be pounded in an acid solution until they broke down.

There is absolutely no end to this sort of thing. I could go on for hours.

Flint Knapping Mills - in the time of flintlock firearms it was necessary to have flint to strike a spark against steel. Knapping of flint is a time-honored skill that is largely lost now but at one time most people could knap flint because without flint you couldn’t start a fire very easily. While knapping a few stones here and there is okay for common people it is not sufficient for the armies of the day. So everywhere there was flint or chert to be found there were knapping factories. The biggest were in England, the flint suppliers to the world. One factory in England was producing 400,000 flints a month for the British Army during the war with Napoleon. There was still a knapping factory in England until after WW2 but there are none left - it’s a dying art. Note in the photo the little stone in the jaw of the hammer - this is a flint. In the old days everyone would know exactly what was going on with flint knapping. There were even special hammers.

I wonder if anyone can guess what this thing is? In the “old days” possibly even into the 1920s almost everyone would have known what this was for if they didn’t live in a city.

This is a basketmaker’s riving brace. They were very, very common. In the old days, there were no paper grocery bags. Those were invented outside Boston by a woman named Margaret Knight in the mid-1800s. Instead, everyone - and I mean everyone - used baskets for everything. And anyone outside an urban environment had basket-making tools such as this. Baskets can only be made from white or black ash because that would “rive”, that is it splits easily along the growth rings in long lengths. A basket maker would sit in front of this device and pass the strip of ash through a hole on the left (you can’t see in this photo) and up through the compressed point. The knees squeeze the boards together and then the ash is split lengthwise into strips by peeling it, a particular property of ash. Once it’s made into long strips it can be trimmed to width and woven into baskets. We use the term “basket making” as an insult for something easy but actually making baskets was a complex and tedious task that required enormous physical and mental labor. Baskets were absolutely everywhere from the beginning of civilization to the 1900s and were critical to supporting life. There is an entire pantheon of tools required to make the components for basket weaving and weaving the basket is only the final step. And yet everyone would know exactly what this tool was for just by looking at it.

Here is another very common technology that would have been well known to almost everyone, particularly people who lived near the ocean or near large bodies of water:

This is one of a series of “flax combs” used in the making of linen from flax. Linen was made through a labor-intensive, time consuming product and was critical to life particularly on the water because the sails of ships were made primarily from linen made from flax. In the old days, people could always tell a ship going out to sea and coming back. When a ship was going out to sea, the new sails were brown from the color of fresh linen sails and when they came back the sails were white because the linen was bleached by the sun. Linen was the best material for sails because it is extraordinarily strong, stronger than cotton, though cotton and even wool was sometimes used (by the Vikings) for making sails.

Flax is a fast-growing weed that grows near the water. It’s plucked by hand - never with a sickle and bundled and the bundles are thrown into water a process called “rhetting” where it sits for awhile til it softens. Then it is allowed to drive and beaten with a “flax break” and scutching knife to break the fibers up.

Everyone would have known what this tool was for. It hasn’t changed in 5000 years.

Once the flax is broken up, it is pulled through the comb in the first picture - and there were a series of combs of different sizes. The first had the teeth in a pattern that allowed the user to capture the seeds which would then be broadcast back into the field to grow another batch of linen. After passing through five sizes of combs, the flax looks a lot like hair. It is then spun on a wheel into thread and then into cloth. The skill is in the spinner’s hand. They could make the finest or coarsest thread which would then be used to make fine clothing or strong sails. The weaver’s skill was in selecting the various hues of linen and he could make an attractive herringbone pattern or any design his mind could conceive. Linen was an excellent choice for a winter suit or coat because flax is very warm. But everyone would have known what these tools are for and if you go into ANY antique house or museum you will ALWAYS find at least one linen comb such as the one in the first photo. They were ubiquitous for making clothing - and also for making hemp rope. They were also used for breaking down the fibers of hemp into rope and while a homeowner COULD make his own hemp rope in small lots, one of the biggest industrial processes of the 1700s was rope making and all cities had 10 - 12 rope walks, were long lengths of rope were made. Rope walks were always located outside the city or on water because they frequently burned down.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/081tideplhbanj57', 'title': 'What are some technologies that were once common but many people wouldn’t recognize today?', 'score': {'original': 0.943325, 'ai': 0.056675}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Grinding mills.

In various places around Europe, particularly in Holland and France, massive mills grew up to make paper. Paper requires all kinds of long fibers usually found in rope and and cloth. Men scoured the continent buying up old rope from shipyards and collecting rags. One of the highest paid jobs in Europe in the 18th Century was rag sorter, the kind of man who knew how to sort and mix fibers to create various kinds of paper, such as wrapping paper, stationery, wallpaper, and book stock paper. Paper mills were considered high tech. One of the oldest companies in the world is a French paper mill that uses a rag pounder from the 1600s.

Susanna Viljanen,2y,What technology do you wish was never invented?,"Leaded fuel.

Knocking 
- the premature ignition of air-fuel mixture in an Otto engine, also known as “pinging” and “dieseling” - was a problem in the early 1920s, and prevented constructing Otto engines with better compression ratio. So General Motors began to search for an anti-knock agent in 1921.

A young chemist Thomas Midgley experimented with various concoctions, and finally encountered dimethyl magnesium and tetraethyl lead - which were found to be effective antiknock agents. The good thing with tetraethyl lead was that it also lubricated the valves.

So General Motors, Du Pont and Standard Oil founded the Ethyl Corporation to produce tetraethyl lead and sell it to fuel manufacturers. Engine compression ratios, engine power and top speeds could be raised and everyone was happy.

For a while. It came that several Ethyl Corporation employees began to demonstrate symptoms of saturnism and one employee died from it.

As a chemical engineer, when I hear “organoplumbic compound” it is a signal to run fast. Tetraethyllead is extremely toxic, and it is especially damaging to children’s brains. Lead has also a nasty tendency to enrich in the food chain and cause lead poisoning
 among the top predators - including humans.

A much viable alternative - ethanol - had been available since the beginning, but Midgley had dismissed it as “too trivial”. The World War Two saw a gigantic expansion on Otto engines - especially aircraft engines - and while the RAF had resolved the knock issue with aromatic compounds, American aviation fuel contained immense amounts of lead - it can be easily observed by white exhaust stains on cowlings and fuselages. That is lead oxide - widely also used as paint pigment!

leaded fuel ran lean creates white exhaust stains

Gazillions of tonnes of fuel were burnt for over three decades. Then in the 1950s, a geologist Clair Patterson (1922–1995) wanted to determine the age of the Earth from uranium and its decay. The problem was that radioactive heavy elements eventually decay into lead, and he found all his rock samples contained much more lead than what was expected - and they were contaminated all around the world!

The culprit was air - there was lead in the air all around the world. In the end Patterson built a hermetically sealed lab and was able to determine the age of Earth as 4550 million +/-70 million years (which is also today’s estimate). But Patterson got alarmed. He published how lead in the atmosphere had contaminated the air - and it was everywhere. He published his research results on atmospheric lead in 1971. Naturally the automotive industry was not amused, and it tried to silence him.

Finally the health authorities in the USA and Europe got alarmed too. Despite the lobbying of industry, leaded fuel was prohibited - first in the USA 1986 and five years later in the European Union.

Turned out ethanol is a much better anti-knock agent and completely harmless. It lacks the lubricative properties of tetraethyllead, though - but as the lifespan of engines is limited, the solution was simply scrapping the old engines when they came to age. Modern Otto engines are much more fuel efficient than those of the 1960s and 1970s. As of March 2017, only Algeria, Yemen and Iraq continue widespread use of leaded gasoline for automobiles.

But much of the lead is still in the air, and it diminishes by a nasty-looking first order differential equation. It is estimated the American average IQ is two points lower than what it could be due to the lead in the air. The problem is especially prevalent in cities and suburbia. The situation is less dire in Europe due to the popularity of mass transport and diesel engines, but bad still.

Lead does not only impair cognitive development, but it also increases aggression on those who have the MAOA2 genetic variant and increases promiscuous behaviour. The violent crime numbers have decreased everywhere in the First World during the past thirty years, and I can well remember that from my own youth - the teens are far less violent today than what they were when I was young. Likewise unwanted pregnancies are far fewer today than they were in my youth.

Leaded fuel is still allowed to be used in aero piston engines - simply because many of them are decades old legacy engines, many dating to World War Two. Fortunately the turboprop engine has superseded piston engines in all but the very smallest private aircraft, and turbine engines have used unleaded fuel since the beginning. Still the private aviation releases over 200 tonnes of lead into atmosphere annually, and children living next to airfields tend to have much higher concentrations of lead in their bloood than their inner city relatives.

Reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the First World. A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve with a 22-year time lag. After the ban on tetraethyllead, blood lead levels in US children dramatically decreased. Researchers say that declining exposure to lead is responsible for an up to 56% decline in crime from 1992 to 2002. Taking into consideration other factors that are believed to have increased crime rates over that period, the researchers found that the reduced exposure to lead led to an actual decline of 34% over that period.

Although leaded fuel is largely gone in the First World, it has left high concentrations of lead in the soil adjacent to roads that were heavily used prior to its phaseout. Children are particularly at risk if they consume this.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/807z31nx9sur4och', 'title': 'What technology do you wish was never invented?', 'score': {'original': 0.57665, 'ai': 0.42335}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Leaded fuel.\n\nKnocking \n- the premature ignition of air-fuel mixture in an Otto engine, also known as “pinging” and “dieseling” - was a problem in the early 1920s, and prevented constructing Otto engines with better compression ratio.

Steve Baker,2y,"Why haven't cars always been electric, since electric car technology was invented in 1884?","Yes - in the very early days of cars, electric cars did rather well. Just as today, they were more reliable, quieter and didn’t produce huge clouds of foul-smelling effluent.

The problem with them back then is the problem that still plagued them until quite recently … range and recharge times. With early lead-acid batteries, this was a huge problem. Also, advantages of cost per mile driven didn’t matter to early motorists since you had to be really well-off to be able to afford a car at all.

As gasoline cars improved, they gradually became better than electric cars and dominated the market.

It pretty much stayed that way until the Lithium Ion battery appeared…and now, all of the reasons why the original electric cars were better still apply - but this time around, range and recharge times are plenty good enough for the vast majority of drivers.

Steam-powered cars had similar issues - they could easily out-perform a gasoline engined car on every metric - and steam engines had already been perfected by the railways. But they lost out on grounds of convenience. You’d typically have to light the fire and wait 5 to 10 minutes for the boiler to heat up before you could start driving.

When their competitor was the horse, it wasn’t too bad because saddling up a horse and (especially) getting a horse hooked up to pull a carriage was as tortuous as heating up the boiler.

Ollie Tizzard,Updated 3y,What was the most impressive or advanced piece of Roman technology?,"Weirdly, Valves.

Boring, simple valves. They let water out. They keep water in. So what?

But the Romans, lacking machine tools and industrialized manufacturing, produced surprisingly standardized and precise in line valves to finely control the water supply to public baths, fountains and quite often, individual homes.

The design was simple, a bronze or bronze alloy junction piece with a tightly fitting plug cylinder sleeved within it. This had holes in. Turn the spindle at the top and the holes align with the pipe allowing water to pass through and vice versa.

Some modern valves you get from the hardware shop work the same way and look surprisingly similar.

Simple, but to make it work it must be robust and precisely measured. The plug insert has to be a precise fit or it will leak or Caesar up. Ahem sorry, seize up.

You see, a valve isn't just a valve.

If you work back through the reverse butterfly effect of what is required to make a simple device standard across a whole empire that everyone uses, you see it takes a huge amount of collective effort.

We have the benefit of fine machine tools, synthetic polymers, stainless steel, a literate population that can read and count, standardized factories. Decades of craftsmen and engineers talking with each other, comparing designs, sharing best practice.

You need people to travel to demonstrate to craftsmen what is required. To travel you need efficient transport, or at least roads, and therefor a robust government administration to put that in place.

You have to have literacy and numeracy to a degree, otherwise you will have simply a hundred differing artistic interpretations of “valve”, not an empirical design.

You need enough of the workforce producing enough of a food surplus that a segment of the population can specialize in making stuff that isn't food. Like valves.

We have better steels now than they did, and modern manufacturing methods like hammer forging barrels didn’t exist back then. They’d have to substitute for other methods, such as machined barrels.

What would stump them would be some of the materials. Modern weapons have polymer furniture and sometimes composite and ceramic functional parts.

So they’d have to substitute some materials. A modern bullpup with a wooden stock would be kind of fun, you might get something a bit like the EM2:

Pieter,4y,"Was the steam engine the sole trigger that caused the industrial revolution, or were there other technologies involved that were developed around the same time?","Metallurgy.

Though the Iron age is said to have started around 1100 BC. the truth is that for most people the world remained in the ‘wood age’ until the Industrial revolution.

Buildings, wagons, ships, barges, tools, mills. buckets, barrels, furniture etc. etc. were all made out of wood. Stone and ceramics were also used but in many applications they were still supplemented by wood. Versailles may have had stone walls but the floors and roof were still held up by large wooden beams.

Iron and steel was expensive and of variable quality to be used only when necessary. Iron or steel simply wasn’t a material you used to make buildings, transport or consumer items. Today we use the stuff to make anything but that wasn’t the case two centuries ago.

This changed largely because we figured out ways to produce more of the stuff making it sufficiently cheaper to use as a common or default material.

One of the key figures in this change was John Wilkinson
 who was dubbed by his contemporaries John “Iron-Mad” Wilkinson.

Stephen Tempest addressed it in more detail here; Stephen Tempest's answer to When was the first ship with a metal hull built?

The first iron bridge built in 1781 with Wilkinson being one of the main promoters.

Replica of the barge Vulcan, when she was launched in 1819 she was the first all metal vessel in the world

Back in 1790s John Wilkinson had actually tried something similar with an iron plated but wooden framed barge. Iron Mad Wilkinson also paid to have iron windows, a pulpit and other fittings installed in a Chapel in Bradley. Befitting his obsession he was also buried in an iron coffin in 1808.

By 1822 the first all iron ship fitted with steam engines was launched and by 1839 the East India Company launched the Nemesis (1839)
 which was the first steam powered ocean going iron warship.

It should be noted that the steam engine developed partially in symbiosis with this. On the one hand it allowed for cheaper and more abundant iron production but at the very same time it was also dependant on this abundance to be built.

Forged cylinders for example proved to be inadequate to contain the pressures so it was resolved to switch to solid cast and bored ones.

Solid cast and bored cannons were the initial use of such techniques

Not only did the cost of iron go down but the quality could also go up. That is not to say the bulk of what was produced during the Industrial revolution was top notch or significantly better than before but with new technologies it was possible.

It was Benjamin Huntsman, a clockmaker, who required better quality spring steel for his clocks who pioneered the industrial production of crucible steel. Barring the small wootz cakes produced in India nobody had really made steel free of detrimental impurities and having a homogenised distribution of elements.

With his invention extremely high quality (for the time) steel could be produced as bars and then used for other applications. Notably swords, guns and cannons of the mid to late 19th century made use of this stuff and outperformed anything that had gone before by a fair margin.

It was to this special steel that the Krupp family owes its fame and fortune. A six pounder made from cast steel was a world first in the mid 19th century but it soon scaled up drastically.

In 1847 Krupp made his first cannon
 of cast steel. At the Great Exhibition
 (London) of 1851, he exhibited a 6 pounder
 made entirely from cast steel
, and a solid flawless ingot
 of steel weighing 4,300 pounds (2,000 kg), more than twice as much as any previously cast. He surpassed this with a 100,000-pound (45,000 kg) ingot for the Paris Exposition
 in 1855. Krupp's exhibits caused a sensation in the engineering world, and the Essen works became famous.

In 1851, another successful innovation, no-weld railway tyres
, began the company's primary revenue stream, from sales to railways in the United States. Alfred enlarged the factory and fulfilled his long-cherished scheme to construct a breech-loading cannon
 of cast steel. He strongly believed in the superiority of breech-loaders
, on account of improved accuracy and speed, but this view did not win general acceptance among military officers, who remained loyal to tried-and-true muzzle-loaded
 bronze cannon. Alfred soon began producing breech loading howitzers
, one of which he gifted to the Prussian court
.

A solid cast steel ingot produced by Krupp, perhaps not that sensational to us but to people at the time it was like seeing a a massive block of unobtanium. The high quality meant it could also be used for steam train axles and other high stress parts that didn’t just break down at random

To come back to steam engines I really doubt whether the use and proliferation of them, their increasing power, ability to power ships, trains and factories and all that would even have been possible earlier.

The economic landscape of Western Europe and specifically Britain had not been seen before. The use of coked coal, lime flux, hot blasts, puddling furnace, crucible smelting allowed the production of iron/steel items and engines that may not have been economical or possible a mere hundred years earlier.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hwm2s304x1blqknr', 'title': 'Was the steam engine the sole trigger that caused the industrial revolution, or were there other technologies involved that were developed around the same time?', 'score': {'original': 0.99955, 'ai': 0.00045}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Metallurgy.\n\nThough the Iron age is said to have started around 1100 BC. the truth is that for most people the world remained in the ‘wood age’ until the Industrial revolution.\n\nBuildings, wagons, ships, barges, tools, mills. buckets, barrels, furniture etc. etc. were all made out of wood.

Shubham Thakur,5y,What is the greatest mystery of all time?,"“All Officers, including the Captain, are dead. Lying in chart room and bridge. Possibly whole crew dead. … I die.”

This was the radio message received by some ships in Straits of Malacca[1] in 1947–48. Some Morse codes were also there which couldn’t be deciphered.

S.S. OURANG MEDAN, the ghost ship.

The coordinates of the ship was calculated by the message, and was sent to the nearest ship, the SILVER STAR.

Captain of the SILVER STAR wasted no time, and within few hours they found the OURANG MEDAN.

They tried to contact the crew members of the ship, but there was no response, so they decided to board the OURANG MEDAN.

As soon as they boarded the ship, they saw the most horrific thing.

The deck of the ship was filled with dead bodies[2] .

The Captain’s body was there on the bridge. Bridge Officers bodies were there in the chart room. The Radio Operator, who sent the message, was found at his station[3] .

Even the dogs on the ship were dead.

There was something unusual.

Every face had the same expression.

Eyes wide-opened with fear, and twisted face because of terror.

The rescue members noticed something strange.

The temperature was more than 100°F, but it was cold inside the ship.

There were no signs of injuries on the bodies.

The bodies were decaying faster than they should be.

So, they decided to tow the ship to the port.

But as they attached the tow line to the OURANG MEDAN, smoke started coming out of it.

So they cut the tow line, and quickly boarded the SILVER STAR.

As soon as they boarded, the OURANG MEDAN exploded and soon disappeared beneath the water.

And with the ship, the biggest mystery went inside.

Some claimed that it was a ghost ship[4] .
Some claimed that the ship didn’t even exist.
Some claimed that the ship was carrying some biological weapons, which went horribly wrong.
Some claimed that the ship was attacked by some UFO.

Was it a real, or just a sea tale?

No one knows.

One of the greatest mysteries of all time, the OURANG MEDAN…

Emory Kimbrough,5y,What are the most unexplained events that have ever happened?,"Blas Cabrera’s monopole signal.

Magnets always have north and a south pole. A monopole (a solitary north pole or a solitary south pole) has never been observed. But physicists suspect that they might exist, and if they do, there could be monopoles left over from the Big Bang.

Blas Cabrera at Stanford University set up a monopole detector that was, in concept, extremely simple for a modern experiment. It was just a loop of superconducting wire. If a monopole, perhaps coming in from space like a cosmic ray, flew through the loop, it would induce a current in the loop - the same principle as a simple electric generator. Since the loop was superconducting, the current would keep flowing after the monopole sailed through.

If a normal magnet went through, the current would flow one way as the north pole went through, but then reverse and flow the other way as the south pole went through. But a monopole would create just a single current. The loop would jump from having zero current to having a steady current in just one direction.

On the night of February 14, 1982, this happened:

That’s a distinct monopole signal, and discovering a monopole is a guaranteed Nobel Prize. But Blas Cabrera never again saw this signal. Neither did anyone else attempting to repeat the experiment. Science experiments must be repeatable to be accepted, but this one, simple though it was, refused to repeat for anybody.

Adding to the mystery, Cabrera tried everything to make his experiment generate a false signal, even banging on it with a hammer. Nobody has any idea how a false-positive could occur in this experiment.

Michael Mark Ross,3y,What technology was available in the 1880s that would surprise most people?,"A couple of years before the American Civil War, Queen Victoria and President Buchanan had a conversation across the Atlantic ocean.

On August 14, 1858, the Queen expressed the hope that a 2,500-mile cable resting two-and-a-half miles down in the Atlantic ocean would prove ""an additional link between the nations whose friendship is founded on their common interest and reciprocal esteem."" The President responded that, ""it is a triumph more glorious, because far more useful to mankind, than was ever won by conqueror on the field of battle.”

Queen Victoria's message of 98 words took 16 hours to send (in Morse code). Unfortunately, that first undersea cable fell silent after three weeks.

An early version of a multinational company was founded to execute the project: the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company. The shortest route, Newfoundland to Ireland was selected. Arduous surveying of the ocean floor determined there was a plateau or wide ridge along which the cable could be laid (at a depth in excess of two miles)

Enormous sums of money had to be raised and a host of new scientific and engineering challenges had to be overcome to manufacture and deploy a permanent cable connection. There were numerous technologies that were not quite there yet, including the transmission and receiving devices[1], manufacturing cable with sufficient flexibility and tensile strength[2], and securely insulating delicate copper wires without reducing what we call bandwidth today.[3]

Up to that point in history, nothing shrunk the world more than the transatlantic telegraph, which became commercially usable in 1866. Almost “instantaneous” communication between the United States, Great Britain, and other European countries became possible. For five dollars a word, diplomats and bankers were able to “jump ship” - typically, an 8- to 10-day voyage - and send “cables” instead.

(By 1880 there was a second Anglo-American cable and a third Franco-American cable to continental Europe.)

Please look beyond this tiny answer, as it doesn’t do justice to an epic of human effort and ingenuity.

Silk Road,7mo,Why did it take humans so long to discover electricity and technology?,"The first person to experiment with electricity was probably Thales of Miletus, a Greek philosopher who lived around 600 BC. He noticed that rubbing amber with fur would make it attract small objects like feathers or straw.

He called this phenomenon ""electricity"" after the Greek word for amber, elektron.

Electricity is not something that we can easily see or touch. It is a form of energy that flows through wires and circuits, but it is invisible to the naked eye.

It is also very complex and mysterious, involving concepts like voltage, current, resistance, magnetism, and electromagnetism.

These concepts are not intuitive or obvious, and they require a lot of experimentation and observation to understand.

Many different people from different countries and cultures contributed to the development of electricity and technology over hundreds of years, building on each other's work and learning from each other's mistakes.

It was not a linear or straightforward process, but rather a messy and chaotic one, full of trial and error, setbacks and breakthroughs.

It was not until the 18th century that electricity started to attract more serious attention from scientists and philosophers, who began to conduct more systematic and rigorous experiments with electric phenomena.

There was Benjamin Franklin's kite experiment in 1752, which showed that lightning was a form of electricity.

Franklin also invented the lightning rod, which was one of the first practical uses of electricity.

In the 19th century, electricity became more widely studied and applied, thanks to the discoveries of many brilliant minds like:

Alessandro Volta, Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, Heinrich Hertz, Guglielmo Marconi, and many others.

They invented devices like batteries, generators, motors, light bulbs, telephones, radios, and more, which paved the way for the electric power industry and the communication revolution.

In the 20th century, electricity and technology reached new heights of sophistication and diversity, with the development of computers, television, satellites, lasers, nuclear power, solar power, internet, smartphones, artificial intelligence, and more.

These inventions have changed every aspect of our society and culture, from education and entertainment to health care and security.

Thus, electricity and technology are the products of a long and complex history of human curiosity and creativity.

They are not something that we discovered overnight or by accident. They are something that we learned gradually and collectively over time. They are also something that we are still learning about today.

Electricity and technology are not static or finished; they are dynamic and evolving. They are not only our past; they are also our future.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xt8dyshj3iw7lm61', 'title': 'Why did it take humans so long to discover electricity and technology?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The first person to experiment with electricity was probably Thales of Miletus, a Greek philosopher who lived around 600 BC.

The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could be adopted by anyone.

Jack Brownlee,4y,Which is the greatest invention to date?,"I don’t know if it necessarily counts as an ‘invention’, but I cast my vote for adult jokes in kids’ movies.

It isn’t super often that we encounter movies that are appealing to both adults and children. There’s just a lack of plot depth and intensity in children’s movies, deterring most adults, and obviously there can’t be a ton of gunfights and nudity in a kiddie movie. It’s difficult to make movies that appeal to a wide audience.

Adult jokes are the perfect solution to that issue.

I remember watching the Lego Batman movie with my parents and younger siblings a few years back. I was probably just finishing up with middle school, and I had definitely been exposed to some adult humor.

At one point in the movie, a character is talking about how

“My name’s Richard Grayson, but all my friends call me Dick.”

Batman so expertly responds:

“Well, children can be cruel.”

An expertly timed adult joke. Subtle enough that a kid wouldn’t know any better, but apparent enough that the adults in the theater chuckled.

For the rest of the movie, there are little sprinkles of mature comedy throughout:

It took me a few seconds to understand this one, but if you say it phonetically it sounds like a… naughty British epithet.

The jokes just don’t end. The plot is engaging to a younger audience, the humor keeps adults watching; it’s genius.

Jimmy May,Updated 3y,"What 3 ancient tools can we still use today, without any alterations (because they worked so perfectly)?","There are a few of these, where the tool has continued essentially unchanged for all of history. But without any alterations? That’s a bit more difficult.

I think the first one I’d point to is grass rope.

The next is the good old-fashioned wooden mallet.

We see these in art going all the way back to the bronze age. Craftsmen since presumably the dawn of written history have used the simple wooden mallet.

The profile is a little different, but the same curved top and angled faces with a flared handle. And though you can find them made of rubber and plastic, wood is still quite common.

And for my third choice, the saw.

This is a bronze saw blade made roundabouts 4,000 years ago. A long time back. You can see some holes in the back where a handle was presumably mounted. Compare that to the modern carpenter’s saw

Silk Road,9mo,"What is a small, overlooked technology that made a huge impact on how war is waged?","Radar chaff:

Radar chaff is a cloud of tiny metal strips that are released by aircraft to confuse enemy radar detection. It was invented by a woman named Joan Curran, a physicist who worked on military research during World War II. Her work was long overlooked by the male-dominated scientific community, but it helped win the war and still baffles weathermen today.

Radar chaff works by resonating with incoming radio waves and re-radiating them, creating a false echo that masks the real aircraft. It can also create a blob on the weather radar that looks like a thunderstorm, even when the sky is clear. This can be useful for hiding military operations, but also annoying for meteorologists and civilians who rely on accurate weather forecasts.

Radar chaff is a simple and cheap technology that has been used by nations all over the world for decades. It is still effective against modern radar systems, and can be deployed by planes, helicopters, ships, and even rockets. It is also easy to make and store, unlike other countermeasures that require chemicals or electronics.

Radar chaff is an example of how a small invention can have a big impact on warfare. It is also an example of how women's contributions to science and technology are often ignored or forgotten.

Joan Curran deserves more recognition for her brilliant idea that saved lives and changed history.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2hmbzkyvft7n0wdj', 'title': 'What is a small, overlooked technology that made a huge impact on how war is waged?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Radar chaff:\n\nRadar chaff is a cloud of tiny metal strips that are released by aircraft to confuse enemy radar detection.

Colin Zhou,4y,What were the most laughably large first iterations of technology?,"In 1983, Motorola stunned the world when it introduced a revolutionary product called the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone.

Previously, mobile phones had to be used through a dedicated operator or were strictly installed in cars. But the DynaTAC showed that a single person was all that was needed to operate such a device.

This massive brick looking device was the beginning of the mobile revolution. But it wasn’t your average consumer device.

Matt Riggsby,6y,What are some of the most incredible technologies that became lost in time?,"I’m not sure “incredible lost technologies” exist. There are any number of things which were made, then people stopped making them, and then later either started making again, or we started making something comparable or better, or we’ve figured them out and they’re…well, nifty, but incredible? That’s a pretty high bar.

For example, Greek fire is straight-up lost. We have only a vague idea of what it was made out of. But we have far superior incendiaries these days. Raised aqueducts went out with the Romans, and we don’t build them any more. Lost technology? The thing there is that we don’t need to build massive causeways for raised aqueducts because we’ve got better ways of moving water around using pumps and pressure reservoirs and other mechanisms. Classical-era gear trains like Hero’s vending machine or the Antikythera mechanism are cool, but ultimately they’re degenerate clocks. Better technologies appeared by the later Middle Ages.

So while I’m skeptical about “incredible,” there are at least interesting lost technologies in the area of ancient glass and pottery glazes. Many of these are lost both in the sense that nobody knows how to make them and there’s no real modern equivalent. For example, there’s a particular type of Roman glass involving colloidal gold which, when viewed with reflected light, appears a jade-like yellow-green, but when viewed with directly transmitted light appears a ruby red. We can see the final state, but we don’t really know how to make it.

Mark Decker,Updated 1y,What were the most laughably large first iterations of technology?,"This device, the Xerox DocuTech was arguably the first fully integrated scanner/printer and was the predecessor to all the MFP devices we all know and love today.

The DocuTech was introduced in the early 1990s and was a beast, capable of printing at what was then a blazing-fast 135 monochrome pages per minute. It had a scanner that while looking like a standard copier was actually a high-quality 600dpi scanning device with a document feeder. Your scanned files could then be viewed on a high resolution touchscreen and manipulated at will. Features included cut & paste, masking, adjust images, add, remove, reorder pages, and many other operations.

DocuTech 135 Production Publisher

The system was also one of the first of it’s kind with connectivity to ethernet networks, complete with a Postscript print driver allowing the user to create high quality output directly from document creation applications, something we take for granted today. The marketing of the Docutech emphasized the notion of “On Demand Printing”, since you could scan and store an unlimited amount of documents to be printed later. With traditional offset printing you had to print shelves and shelves of manuals and brochures to be distributed as needed, often becoming outdated and trashed. The Docutech offered the ability to print documents as they were needed, eliminating costly storage and disposal issues.

The system also boasted inline stapling and tape binding options for what was to be called a “printshop in a box”. The DT135 and it’s successors were wildly popular and kept me employed at Xerox for a long while.

These days we have devices such as this Epson, which can scan, print, even fax if desired. The resulting files can be manipulated in Adobe Creative Suite, saved and then sent to the printer for final output.

Pratim Sarkar,6y,What are some cool inventions?,"PENCIL WITH POTENTIAL

What if instead of throwing your pencil stubs away you could plant them and have them grow into something delicious, beautiful, and fun? What if pencils could grow?

CSAIL graduate Mario Bollini has transitioned from programming robots that bake cookies
 to developing pencils that when planted will sprout fresh herbs and vegetables. In a new endeavour called Sprout, Bollini, who was previously a member of CSAIL Director Daniela Rus’ Distributed Robotics Lab, and fellow MIT classmates from a product development course have developed a “pencil with potential.”

Each pencil has a different seed located inside. When the pencil is too short to use, users can plant it, and when watered the pencil will sprout anything from cherry tomatoes to radishes and marigolds.

Sprout is a pencil with a seed inside. When it's too short to use, it can be planted at home, at the office, or in the classroom.

We really like writing with wooden pencils. They have a tactile feel that even the best mechanical pencils can't match. When Sprout is too short to use, it can be planted to grow into a wonderful flower, herb, or vegetable.The seed capsule is water activated, the first few times you water Sprout dissolves the protective capsule and starts the seed's germination.

Isn’t it amazing?

Geoffrey Thorndyke,2y,Why did the British dismantle their Colossus computers after WWII? They were 3 years ahead of the world in computer technology by the end of the war.,"Well according to a recent documentary I watched, they were moved to another location and used to decode messages sent by the Soviets on Enigma and Lorenz machines they had captured from the Germans. The Soviets not actually being privy to the fact that we could decipher messages from these machines.

The whole “Ultra” episode was kept secret for 25–30 years after the War ended so the Colossus was top secret for many years.

Colossus was designed and built by one Tommy Flowers, who worked for the British Post Office. After the war he returned to his old job. He did try and devolop the machines after the war, but as this wiki extract points out, he could not actually say he’d built a computer as that would have broked the Official Secrets Act

“After the war, Flowers received little recognition for his contribution to cryptanalysis
.[20]
 The government granted him £
1,000 payment which did not cover Flowers' personal investment in the equipment; he shared much of the money amongst the staff who had helped him build and test Colossus. Flowers applied for a loan from the Bank of England to build another machine like Colossus but was denied the loan because the bank did not believe that such a machine could work.[21]
 He could not argue that he had already designed and built many of these machines because his work on Colossus was covered by the Official Secrets Act

Hansel Sapkota,21-Dec,What strange archaeological finds could suggest an ancient technological civilization?,"This huge sphere was found by an archaeologist in 2016 in a forest in Bosnia.

The name of the discoverer is Semir Osmanagich, who describes the stone sphere as the largest in Europe.

It measures three meters wide, weighs 35 tons and is very ferruginous.

And if this sphere was created by human hands - and if not, how? - indicates that in Europe there were advanced civilizations about which we know absolutely nothing.

These ancestors of ours had different technologies from those we know.

Mounds and pyramids are also found in Bosnia, connecting this place with many other mysterious places where similar structures are found again and again.

Stone spheres have also been found almost everywhere, but this one is truly a colossus.

And here is the second part.

It looks like Stonehenge.

And it is located 12 meters underwater in Lake Michigan.

Why are structures repeated in so many distant places?

Hagop Tashjian,6y,What is an invention everybody uses but the inventor didn't make any money from it?,"Diamonds.

Well, synthetic ones.

I don't know if anyone answered before me, but…

Tracy Hall was an American physical chemist and the first person who grew a synthetic diamond by a reproducible, verifiable, and witnessed process, using a press of his own design.

At that time, he worked for General Electric. Naturally, his discovery changed the world market- forever. GE went on to make billions out of this new business. So a lot of money was (and is) actually being made out of the synthetic diamonds business and its derivatives.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Dr. Hall's reward, you ask?

A 10$ US savings bond.

Susanna Viljanen,2y,Did technology really stagnate in the dark ages? What were some important technological advances made during the era?,"No.

The Dark Ages (476 to 800 AD) were actually an era of innovation and invention. The reason is simple: abolition of slavery and collapse of the maritime trade.

I call it creative destruction. The Dark Ages were an era of turmoil, but like all ages of chaos, they were also an era of invention and inovation.

Necessity is the mother of invention, and the disappearance of cheap and easily whippable and coercible labour in form of slaves, and disappearance of cheap imported victuals propelled the need to develop technology. As the slavery was abolished, the price of labour rose skyhigh, which meant the need to develop labour-saving technology. As the imports of cheap grain from Egypt ceased, it meant the resurgence and recovery of local agriculture and production. These created necessities, which were resolved by invention - both domestic and imported from China.

The Dark Ages (476 to 800) saw the following innovations:

Decent horsecollar. It meant horses could now be harnessed to pull ploughs and carts. They superseded slaves on plowing the fields.
Decent bullock yoke. It meant bulls could now be harnessed efficiently, and they could operate ploughs and capstans. They superseded slaves.
Catalan forge. It meant abundant cheap iron.
Lateen sail. It meant ability to tack (sail against the wind): It superseded the rowers.
Three-field rotation cultivation. It meant better crops and recovery of the land.
Barrel. It superseded the amphora, and was far more durable and lightweight than any terracotta vessel. Improved ironmaking meant the hoops could be made from metal. Much better wine could now be made by aging the wine in barrels. Unlike amphorae, barrels could be reused, and could be used on both liquids and dry stuffs.
Heavy wheeled iron plough. It meant the clay terrains of England and Central Europe could now be used for grain cultivation. It superseded the slave-pulled light ard.
Cantled saddle, spurs and stirrups. Cantled saddle meant heavy cavalry could now charge in full gallop with couched lance and stirrups meant they could fight with sword on horseback efficiently. Spurs meant the horseman could control the horse without using his hands.
Horseshoe arch. It meant vaults could be made larger and more airy.
Overshot waterwheel. It has much better efficiency than the Roman undershot wheel.
Water turbine (vertical axis waterwheel) to provide continuous power
Efficient windmill. That is why factories are also called “mills” in English.
The hourglass. It superseded the clepsydra and time-keeping candles.
Horseshoe. Cheap iron replaced the Roman leather bags.
Skeleton first shipbuilding instead of the mortise and tenon.

The Carolingian Renaissance (800–841) meant the resurgence of Roman traditions and innovation, and it spurred the Medieval era in full speed. But the Medieval innovations are another story.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8ebnjtxic56dqvr1', 'title': 'Did technology really stagnate in the dark ages?

David Henderson,1y,How has technology changed since the 1980s?,"In many ways, obviously, but the most striking example is in size.

Imagine in the 1980’s you rented a massive warehouse.

You (attempt to) fill that warehouse with the following items:

The worlds most advanced supercomputer
At least two top of the range camcorders
At least two high end cameras
A VHS player
A stereo
A walkman
An entire library’s worth of books
An entire branch of Blockbusters worth of films
An entire branch of Virgin Megastores worth of music
Top of the line games consoles
And a branch of GameStop’s worth of games for them
Very detailed maps of the entire world, and a better than top of the range GPS device
A mobile telephone
A video phone
A Bank
A post office
The worlds biggest supermarket
A stockbrokers
A travel agency
Various other useful gadgets such as a watch, a pen and paper, a dictaphone, a translator, a calculator, an alarm clock, a calendar, a diary a torch and a compass.

Now, in the unlikely event that you actually manage to get all of those items together and crammed into your massive warehouse - congratulations! You now have roughly half the services that we currently carry around in our pocket in the form of a 4-inch long, 140g glass slab.

Akash Nagpal,6y,What are some coolest inventions ever made?,"Summer is in full swing and many of us are complaining about the heat. But few places reach the scorching temperatures residents of Bangladesh experience, and air conditioning is simply not an option for most people living in rural areas. Ashis Paul developed a clever DIY cooling system that doesn’t need any electricity
 and is built from a common waste item: empty plastic soda bottles. In just three months, Paul’s company has helped install its smart powerless air conditioners, called Eco Coolers
, in 25,000 households, with many more still ahead.

The Eco Cooler method is fairly simple, from a construction standpoint. A board is cut to fit the desired window, and bottleneck-sized holes are cut out in a grid pattern. The bottoms of empty plastic bottles
 are cut off and discarded, leaving funnel-shaped bottlenecks that are placed on the grid. That’s all there is to the Eco Cooler, except for the task of installing it in place of the regular window. When mounted, the wider part of the bottles faces outward and catches the passing wind, literally funneling cool air into the building’s interior.

Leave everything aside. In layman's language, blow air from your mouth wide and feel the air. Now blow air again keeping mouth narrow. Feel the difference. Thats all the concept!

The efficacy of the Eco Cooler varies widely based on conditions, but Grey Group reports it has the ability to reduce indoor temperatures as much as 5 degrees Celsius, which is on par with what an electric centrally installed air conditioning
 system can do. In some instances the Eco Cooler can reduce indoor temperatures from a sweltering 86F (30C) to a comfortable 77F (25C). For the 70 percent of residents who live in tin-roofed huts that amplify the sun’s heat, the Eco Cooler could be a breath of fresh air just in time for summer.

Jon Mixon,9mo,"What is a small, overlooked technology that made a huge impact on how war is waged?","Question: What is a small, overlooked technology that made a huge impact on how war is waged?

Antibiotics.

The last major conflict that was fought without the widespread use of either sulfa drugs or gram-positive defeating antibiotics was WWI. As can be seen by the limited number of casualties on the American and UK side of the equation, antibiotics saved millions of lives during the Second World War while limiting many of Germany’s, which only had access to sulfa medications. The Soviet Union and Japan’s massive death tolls were due to their lack of antibiotics in addition to their questionable military strategies.

With antibiotics, troops can be cured of minor illnesses (including STDs which have taken a toll since antiquity), dental issues, and even common ailments brought on by the spotty hygiene conditions that exist. Antibiotics could not only reduce casualties, troops could be returned to combat much faster and that was a huge advantage if your enemy had limited to no access to the drugs. In modern warfare, antibiotics are at least equal to bullets, fuel and intelligence, if not greater.

The 10% point - about 680M - was hit in late 2003. That seems to be a safe point at which it’s safe to say “essential”.

Pieter,2y,Why did we see huge constant progressions in firearms throughout the late 19th and entire 20th century but basic firearms technology like muskets seemed stagnant in progression for centuries before?,"Most of the major leaps in firearms technology occurred between about 1820 and 1900. Things like assault rifles are just 19th century semi-automatic and automatic firing technology applied to medium and pistol caliber rounds. Sure there were some engineering challenges but its nothing Hiram Maxim wouldn’t recognize. Caseless ammo isn’t really that widespread and I believe electronic ignition also failed to reach much of a market.

The same goes for muskets more or less.

The matchlock arrived sometime around the 1480s or 1490s, the wheellock followed around 1500–1510, the snaphaunce around the 1540s or 1550s, the doglock not much later and the fully modern flintlock was invented in the early 17th century.

Almost all ignition technology was invented in the span of slightly more than a century and remained unchanged until the early 19th century. Most changes to military issue muskets consisted of changes to length, caliber, barrel bands, ramrods, cartridges and the like.

Another thing is the roll-out or actual production of these technologies. The flintlock may have been invented around 1600 but it would take a century before soldiers were generally equipped with them.

The basic paradigm of a muzzle loading firearms firing round balls remained the same because of several technological hurdles.

If you wanted to fire a blackpowder muzzle loading piece at any speed and without difficulty you had to use an undersized projectiles. If you used an undersized projectile you couldn’t use rifling. If you can’t use rifling and a tight fitting projectile an elongated bullet is fairly pointless.

The only way to overcome this would be to either develop a breechloading musket or a muzzle loading rifled musket that could be loaded with undersized balls that would expand in the chamber. The latter was only developed during the early 19th century.

Breechloading technology on the other hand had a long pedigree but few of the designs made it out of the civilian market for reasons of cost and reliability. Improving the rate of fire was also an objective that they tried to achieve through breachloading and magazines or multiple barrels.

Below are some of the designs that didn’t see mass usage in the military.

Break action breech loading flintlocks, doglocks and snaphaunces

Ye olde revolving gonne! complete with tube sights.

A breechloading magazine rifle by one of the Kalthoff family of gunsmiths, used by the Danish lifeguard during the 17th century but eventually abandoned.

A Venetian multi barreled team operated gun

A lorenzoni breechloading magazine rifle, arguably a bit more unsafe than the kalthoff design!

Hans Martin Asheim,Updated 4y,How did Amish people decide that mid 1800's technology was just the right amount?,"Well, they never did make that decision. It is largely a myth that the Amish froze time around 1850, and refuses to acknowledge anything newer.

I say “largely”, because their conservative approach towards new technology can easily be mistaken for outright denial. But the Amish have never said that new technology is perma-banned, just that they will think long and hard before they introduce something new into their communities.

First of all, the Amish are not a monolithic group, some areas are more open to new technology than others. Second, the key issue is always if this particular piece of machinery something that will benefit the community.

Many Amish businesses have accepted telephones. Only in the office, and never for personal calls. But running a business without a telephone is hard, so telephones are OK within certain parameters.

Some communities have telephones located on the outskirts of the settlement. Again not for personal calls, but if they need a doctor or a veterinarian they can run out and get the necessary assistance.

Dairy farms may have electricity to keep the milk cool, otherwise they would not be allowed to sell it. Construction businesses may use some power tools. If you need dialysis, you can run an electric line to the house to power the equipment, if you cannot walk you can use an electric wheelchair.

They do not ban new technology by definition, they just want to make sure that it does not disturb their way of life before allowing it.

Tomaž Vargazon,2y,Do you believe that there were ancient civilizations on Earth that were more advanced than our present day technological achievements? What are your theories?,"My theory (and I’m calling it a theory, not a hypothesis) is such an advanced civilization would have left behind a footprint that couldn’t be concealed by rock.

Archeology

I’m not even necessarily talking about monuments and ancient cities. Even if they were all in lowlands and got flooded at the end of the last ice age or something like that, a civilization like our own or even more modern would have left an imprint everywhere. If they used plastics there would be plastics found in ocean, at least in deep ocean draws, plus there would be plastic digesting microbes already somewhere. It only look them a few decades when we started dumping plastics en masse to figure out how to digest it, albeit ineffeciently.

There would also be an imprint found in arctic or antarctic ice samples, where we look for atmospheric changes back to before we were homo sapiens. There is simply no way we would overlook a sudden shift in the atmospheric composition that wouldn’t be explained by natural phenomena.

There would also be a freak show in fossil record, with some animals suddenly dominating over the others. Seriously, mammalian biomass and the corresponding fossil record right now is 36% homo sapiens, 60% livestock and companion animals (14 species in total, mostly cows, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, dogs and cats) and 4% is all the mammalian wildlife we all love and cherish.

Biomass of different categories of animals. Green bits are the ones not directly associated with humans

It’s only marginally better with avians, because there about twice as many bird species as there are mammalian species and because polutry industry is smaller than cattle industry. Despite this the same extreme specialization is also seen there.

Israel Ramirez,11mo,Why was Europe more advanced than most of other civilizations during history?,"I want to focus on one narrow aspect of the question, race. Some people have claimed that the greater level of prosperity among European peoples today is evidence of their racial superiority.

What those people miss is that history tells a different story. Europe wasn’t more advanced than other civilizations during most of history. This chart shows estimated income for various countries over the last several centuries. You can see that countries began to diverge around the year 1800. Britain was the leader at that time, though in the 21st Century Britain has stagnated.[1]

Some scholars have looked at advances in science and technology. A thousand years ago, Chinese were advancing faster than Europeans.[2]

If we go farther back in time, and look at the birth of agriculture and civilization, Northern Europe looks backward. The earliest centers of civilization were in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Far East, Africa, and the Americas.[3]

Scholars disagree on why Northern European countries advanced so far beyond the rest of the world in recent centuries, but it wasn’t on account of superior genes.

Wikipedia’s article on the topic is a good introduction:

Great Divergence - Wikipedia
Period/event in European history Maddison's estimates of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity in 1990 international dollars for selected European and Asian nations between 1500 and 1950, [1] showing the explosive growth of Western Europe and Japan in the 19th century. The Great Divergence or European miracle is the socioeconomic shift in which the Western world (i.e. Western Europe and the parts of the New World where its people became the dominant populations) overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilizations , eclipsing previously dominant or comparable civilizations from the Middle East and Asia such as Qing China , Mughal India , the Ottoman Empire , Safavid Iran , and Tokugawa Japan , among others. [2] Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including geography , culture , intelligence , institutions , colonialism , resources , and pure chance . [3] There is disagreement over the nomenclature of the ""great"" divergence, as a clear point of beginning of a divergence is traditionally held to be the 16th or even the 15th century, with the Commercial Revolution and the origins of mercantilism and capitalism during the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery , the rise of the European colonial empires , proto-globalization , the Scientific Revolution , or the Age of Enlightenment . [4] [5] [6] [7] Yet the largest jump in the divergence happened in the late 18th and 19th centuries with the Industrial Revolution and Technological Revolution . For this reason, the ""California school"" considers only this to be the great divergence.

Technology led to increased industrialization and economic complexity in the areas of agriculture, trade, fuel, and resources, further separating east and west. Western Europe's use of coal as an energy substitute for wood in the mid-19th century gave it a major head start in modern energy production. In the twentieth century, the Great Divergence peaked before the First World War and continued until the early 1970s; then, after two decades of indeterminate fluctuations, in the late 1980s it was replaced by the Great Convergence as the majority of developing countries reached economic growth rates significantly higher than those in most developed countries .

David Henderson,1y,"Is there such thing as ""Lost Technology,"" or is that a myth?","Technically, yes, but not in the way some people represent it.

When people talk about ‘Lost Technology’ they often imply that it is some kind of mystical knowledge of the ancients to create something that we cannot replicate today with all our modern technology. That’s mostly not true, we can now surpass basically everything the ancients did. ‘Lost Technology‘ usually just means ‘we don’t know the precise method by which this thing was done out of the many, many options we have.’

Often, you will come across someone online claiming that we cannot today replicate the Egyptian Pyramids. To these people I have to ask, have you looked at what modern architects are able to do? Do you really think that a construction industry that can do things like this:

Is going to struggle to build a stone pyramid that is a fraction of the size of modern buildings?:

Realistically, we could knock out a new Great Pyramid of Giza with a tiny fraction of the manpower and time it took to build the original one. We don’t know precisely how they did it, but we have cranes, and however it was done, cranes are better.

A similar line of logic runs through most of the classic examples of what people term ‘Lost Technology’. We don’t know exactly what ‘Greek Fire’ was, but we have Napalm and several other options that can easily do what Greek Fire was purportedly capable of. We don’t know the original mechanism for creating ‘Damascus Steel’, but we can create blades that are both many times sharper than Damascus and also have the signature ‘Damascus’ pattern. In fact, we have perfected the patterning to the extent that you can specify your exact style of Damascus from a shopping list when picking out your kitchen knives online:

Almost everything that is considered a ‘Lost Technology’ is something that modern humans have been able to surpass at this point via other means. It’s just not in human nature to stand still and not create solutions to problems.

None of this should take away from how amazing these technologies are however, the amazing thing about these isn’t that we aren’t able to do it today, it’s that they were able to do it then.

Matt Riggsby,6y,What was so hard about inventing the stirrup?,"Because the stirrup, implemented the wrong way, actually hurts the horse a lot. You need a different technology to make stirrups functional.

The stirrup would seem pretty obvious, wouldn’t it? Attach some kind of foot-hold to a saddle to make it easier to mount a horse and easier to stay in once you’re there.

The hidden problem, though, is that you need a special kind of saddle first before you can usefully add stirrups. Up until not long before the invention of the stirrup, a saddle was a glorified blanket. It might be an actual blanket, a sheet of leather, a padded blanket, or something like that, but it was basically a soft, flexible seat thrown across the horse’s back. It turns out that if you attach stirrups to that kind of saddle, it’s immensely painful, even injurious to the horse. When you put your feet in stirrups on a flexible saddle, that concentrates the rider’s weight on a line between the points where they attach to the saddle. In practice, this abrades the horse’s skin, scraping off hair and even causing bleeding along that narrow line.

The enabling technology for the stirrup, then, is a slightly earlier development: the saddle tree. At the core of modern saddles, you’ll find a wooden frame which is then covered with padding and so on.

My mother, for example, who is almost 70, retired, and lives in a small town, does not have the internet at home. It’s still not necessary for her. Likely never will be. She gets along just fine.

My father did have the internet from about 1997 until he died in 2012. He used it to check the news and pay the occasional bill. My mother kept it for a year or so after he died, realized she never used it, and cancelled it.

I, on the other hand, have used the internet every single day since about 1998. I used it almost every day from about 1994–1998. And before that, I used BBS’s. But I was a nerdy high schooler then, and one of the few people in my high school who went online at home, just for fun. Most teens back then just used the internet when they had a report to do for school, and they used it in the school’s library.

I’d say, based on my experiences, that for the average American student or young adult, the internet became somewhat necessary (or not having it made life much more difficult) by 2000. By then, almost everyone had access to affordable, high-speed internet, and the web was easy enough to navigate that even the non-nerdy types could figure it out.

For blue-collar workers, and middle-aged or older Americans, I’d push that year back to about 2008.

When I was in my early 20s (2000–2004), I worked for a couple of wealthy families with disabled children. I helped them with their children. They all had internet access in their homes… for their children (the disabled ones, and their other children). The adults themselves NEVER went online. Of course, they were the types of families who still used travel agents and hired people to help them with their children. They didn’t need the ease of doing things online, because those things were already easy for them.

From 2005–2009, I worked in retail management, and had plenty of coworkers who shunned the internet.

C Stuart Hardwick,Updated 2y,"Why do people falsely claim Antonio Meucci invented the telephone? It is widely known that Alexander Graham Bell, the Scottish-born inventor, scientist, and engineer, invented and patented the first practical telephone?","Neither Antonio Meucci nor Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. And they both did.

What Alexander Graham Bell filed for patent protection for on February 14, 1876 was what we would call an “intercom.” It was a means of electronically projecting a voice through a wired connection, but what we call a telephone also includes a means of addressing one of many remote receivers and the switches and trunks necessary for multiplexing many lines over few, something Bell could have scarcely dreamed of. His invention was very different from the modern telephone (and here were are talking about the telephone of say, 1960, before touch-tone and digital and cell technology) in just about every possible way.

Sixteen years earlier, Philip Reis had built and operated what he called the “telephon,” which in many ways was similar the Bell’s device. But it tried to reproduce sounds by simply making or breaking a telegraph-style circuit once for each wave of the received sound, but this produced a sound so garbled that speech was rendered unintelligible.

A Late Model Reis “telephon”.

This was two years before Hermann von Helmholtz published his seminal “ On the Sensations of Tone (Lehre von der Tonempfindungen)” (which Bell was familiar with), but which I mention here to illustrate the many hands involved in the technological change that led to (and beyond) the patent. Helmholtz explained the mechanics of auditory perception and presented a wood carving of an electro-mechanical sound demonstrator that deserves to be remembered as the world’s first musical synthesizer.

Elisha Gray is often portrayed as some random hobbyist, but in fact was what we would call the chief engineer for the company that would become Western Electric before he started working on his own “telephone.” In 1872, he developed a “muscial telegraph” similar in principle to Helmholtz’s device and like it, used many of the fundamental principles that would later serve voice transmission. Gray’s idea was to transmit multiple telegraph signals over a single wire but letting each transmit at a different frequency, eliminating much of the rat’s nest of telegraph wiring then in use. In practice, this good idea was not the one needed by the times, and the novelty of transmitting crude musical performances over 200 miles was about the extent of its impact.

However, in 1875, the president of Western Union got wind of Gray’s work and, fearing a future in which the telegraph would be rendered obsolete or forced to pay expensive licensing to Western Electric, called on a young inventor named Thomas Edison whom he had recently put on retainer.

Edison looked at Gray’s work and Helmholz’s book and tried to adapt Gray’s tuned forks and reeds vibrating in an electromagnetically self-sustaining field hopeless for this task.

A little aside: Having grown up taking apart old telephones, I can tell you with confidence that Gray’s electromagnetic oscillators did in fact make their way into telephones—as the bell ringer.

Meanwhile, Bell had read Helmholtz’s book and come up with the same idea as Gray—no, not the telephone, the “harmonic telegraph” as a way to multiplex signals only fewer wires.

However, one day (so the story goes) Bell was talking to the father of a deaf girl under his tutelage (Bell was teaching as a school for the deaf) who mentioned how a loud voice can cause a piano wire to visibly vibrate. Bell was familiar with the phenomenon, and (like Gray) had designed acoustic isolation into his musical telegraph to prevent what we would call “cross talk” between the signals. However, on this conversation, he realized that the vibrations of the wire would closely match the vibrations of the voice that produced them, and if they could be transmitted and reproduced…

By 1874 ( a year before Edison) this idea had jelled into what Bell called the Telephone (and what we would call an intercom) and by the summer of 1875, he’d seen what Edison didn’t and what to modern eyes seems rather obvious, but which was honestly revolutionary at the time: The vibrating bars and reeds used by both Gray and Bell in their polyphonic telegraph devices, if vibrated in an electric field, would produce an electric current mirroring the vibration.

Alexander Graham Bell did not invent the Telephone as we know it, but he arguably did invent the microphone.

Bell’s financiers were unimpressed, and told him to get back to his real work. But he did convince them to file for a patent.

Before this could happen however, Bell added to the application a second type of (what we would call a microphone) that involved tipping a vibrating platinum wire into a liquid acid bath in order to vary the resistance through the circuit in tune to an auditory source—which is clearly nuts, right? Who the hell wants a telephone full of acid? Why would he even propose such a thing?

The answer, gentle reader, is that this was 1875, and electronic amplification had not yet been invented. An electromagnetic pickup (microphone) could never produce a signal powerful enough to be useful from one side of a building to another, much less across town. But a microphone that modulated electrical resistance could be used to modulate a powerful external signal, and that signal could be amped up (pun intended) as high as necessary to be useful.

That’s not the way phones work (at all, in fact it’s pretty much how they burned out the first transatlantic cable) but it seemed like the only way at the time. In fact, it was a good enough idea that it led Thomas Edison (remember him) to develop his idea for a resistance modulating microphone (modern words) based on the compression of carbon, which ended up being the genesis for the standard telephone microphone used right up into the 1990s.

So where does Antonio Meucci fit into all this?

Well, Meucci does indeed appear to have been way ahead of everyone. Notes written by him in 1857 describer an apparatus built on his property that:

consists of a vibrating diaphragm and an electrified magnet with a spiral wire that wraps around it. The vibrating diaphragm alters the current of the magnet. These alterations of current, transmitted to the other end of the wire, create analogous vibrations of the receiving diaphragm and reproduce the word.

This appears to describe what we now call a “dynamic microphone,” in which current passing through the coil of the electromagnet is what gets modulated to mirror the sound.

So, did Antonio Meucci invent the telephone? No, not really. But he invented and built an intercom 20 years before Gray and Bell invented theirs—but he never filed a patent. As in Gray’s case, a caveat on behalf of Meucci was filed with the US patent office, but Bell got his patent and history went on.

Bell connected intercoms through switchboard operators. Other inventors added amplification and eventually, electromagnetically switching. Invention built upon invention and Bell’s humble intercom was slowly elaborated into what we know as a telephone.

So who invented the thing? Bell. Gray. Helmholtz. Edison. And the many, many, many others who contributed parts, ideas, components and intellectual property to its technical and commercial development. And as for Antonio Meucci, he apparently invented something equal to if note beyond what Bell would later produce, but he didn’t publish his work, file a patent, or commercialize a product, so in the end he did not participate in the broader development.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/c8wd2t9b7voi3yla', 'title': 'Why do people falsely claim Antonio Meucci invented the telephone?

And as for Antonio Meucci, he apparently invented something equal to if note beyond what Bell would later produce, but he didn’t publish his work, file a patent, or commercialize a product, so in the end he did not participate in the broader development.', 'result': {'fake': 0.1782, 'real': 0.8218}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 13, 'credits': 1996951, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Neither Antonio Meucci nor Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. And they both did.\n\nWhat Alexander Graham Bell filed for patent protection for on February 14, 1876 was what we would call an “intercom.” It was a means of electronically projecting a voice through a wired connection, but what we call a telephone also includes a means of addressing one of many remote receivers and the switches and trunks necessary for multiplexing many lines over few, something Bell could have scarcely dreamed of. His invention was very different from the modern telephone (and here were are talking about the telephone of say, 1960, before touch-tone and digital and cell technology) in just about every possible way.\n\nSixteen years earlier, Philip Reis had built and operated what he called the “telephon,” which in many ways was similar the Bell’s device. But it tried to reproduce sounds by simply making or breaking a telegraph-style circuit once for each wave of the received sound, but this produced a sound so garbled that speech was rendered unintelligible.\n\nA Late Model Reis “telephon”.\n\nThis was two years before Hermann von Helmholtz published his seminal “ On the Sensations of Tone (Lehre von der Tonempfindungen)” (which Bell was familiar with), but which I mention here to illustrate the many hands involved in the technological change that led to (and beyond) the patent. Helmholtz explained the mechanics of auditory perception and presented a wood carving of an electro-mechanical sound demonstrator that deserves to be remembered as the world’s first musical synthesizer.\n\nElisha Gray is often portrayed as some random hobbyist, but in fact was what we would call the chief engineer for the company that would become Western Electric before he started working on his own “telephone.” In 1872, he developed a “muscial telegraph” similar in principle to Helmholtz’s device and like it, used many of the fundamental principles that would later serve voice transmission. Gray’s idea was to transmit multiple telegraph signals over a single wire but letting each transmit at a different frequency, eliminating much of the rat’s nest of telegraph wiring then in use. In practice, this good idea was not the one needed by the times, and the novelty of transmitting crude musical performances over 200 miles was about the extent of its impact.\n\nHowever, in 1875, the president of Western Union got wind of Gray’s work and, fearing a future in which the telegraph would be rendered obsolete or forced to pay expensive licensing to Western Electric, called on a young inventor named Thomas Edison whom he had recently put on retainer.\n\nEdison looked at Gray’s work and Helmholz’s book and tried to adapt Gray’s tuned forks and reeds vibrating in an electromagnetically self-sustaining field hopeless for this task.\n\nA little aside: Having grown up taking apart old telephones, I can tell you with confidence that Gray’s electromagnetic oscillators did in fact make their way into telephones—as the bell ringer.\n\nMeanwhile, Bell had read Helmholtz’s book and come up with the same idea as Gray—no, not the telephone, the “harmonic telegraph” as a way to multiplex signals only fewer wires.\n\nHowever, one day (so the story goes) Bell was talking to the father of a deaf girl under his tutelage (Bell was teaching as a school for the deaf) who mentioned how a loud voice can cause a piano wire to visibly vibrate. Bell was familiar with the phenomenon, and (like Gray) had designed acoustic isolation into his musical telegraph to prevent what we would call “cross talk” between the signals. However, on this conversation, he realized that the vibrations of the wire would closely match the vibrations of the voice that produced them, and if they could be transmitted and reproduced…\n\nBy 1874 ( a year before Edison) this idea had jelled into what Bell called the Telephone (and what we would call an intercom) and by the summer of 1875, he’d seen what Edison didn’t and what to modern eyes seems rather obvious, but which was honestly revolutionary at the time: The vibrating bars and reeds used by both Gray and Bell in their polyphonic telegraph devices, if vibrated in an electric field, would produce an electric current mirroring the vibration.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell did not invent the Telephone as we know it, but he arguably did invent the microphone.\n\nBell’s financiers were unimpressed, and told him to get back to his real work. But he did convince them to file for a patent.\n\nBefore this could happen however, Bell added to the application a second type of (what we would call a microphone) that involved tipping a vibrating platinum wire into a liquid acid bath in order to vary the resistance through the circuit in tune to an auditory source—which is clearly nuts, right? Who the hell wants a telephone full of acid? Why would he even propose such a thing?\n\nThe answer, gentle reader, is that this was 1875, and electronic amplification had not yet been invented. An electromagnetic pickup (microphone) could never produce a signal powerful enough to be useful from one side of a building to another, much less across town. But a microphone that modulated electrical resistance could be used to modulate a powerful external signal, and that signal could be amped up (pun intended) as high as necessary to be useful.\n\nThat’s not the way phones work (at all, in fact it’s pretty much how they burned out the first transatlantic cable) but it seemed like the only way at the time. In fact, it was a good enough idea that it led Thomas Edison (remember him) to develop his idea for a resistance modulating microphone (modern words) based on the compression of carbon, which ended up being the genesis for the standard telephone microphone used right up into the 1990s.\n\nSo where does Antonio Meucci fit into all this?\n\nWell, Meucci does indeed appear to have been way ahead of everyone. Notes written by him in 1857 describer an apparatus built on his property that:\n\nconsists of a vibrating diaphragm and an electrified magnet with a spiral wire that wraps around it. The vibrating diaphragm alters the current of the magnet. These alterations of current, transmitted to the other end of the wire, create analogous vibrations of the receiving diaphragm and reproduce the word.\n\nThis appears to describe what we now call a “dynamic microphone,” in which current passing through the coil of the electromagnet is what gets modulated to mirror the sound.\n\nSo, did Antonio Meucci invent the telephone? No, not really. But he invented and built an intercom 20 years before Gray and Bell invented theirs—but he never filed a patent. As in Gray’s case, a caveat on behalf of Meucci was filed with the US patent office, but Bell got his patent and history went on.\n\nBell connected intercoms through switchboard operators. Other inventors added amplification and eventually, electromagnetically switching. Invention built upon invention and Bell’s humble intercom was slowly elaborated into what we know as a telephone.\n\nSo who invented the thing? Bell. Gray. Helmholtz. Edison. And the many, many, many others who contributed parts, ideas, components and intellectual property to its technical and commercial development. And as for Antonio Meucci, he apparently invented something equal to if note beyond what Bell would later produce, but he didn’t publish his work, file a patent, or commercialize a product, so in the end he did not participate in the broader development.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.8766

Barrie Rodliffe,Updated 1y,Which country in World War II had the best technology?,"The best technology or the best use of technology? Germany had good radar at the start of the war but never developed a fighter control system anything like the RAF. Germany had jet engines having copied and studied Frank Whittles patents but failed to make a reliable jet engine. Germany had precision made machine guns but they were unreliable in dusty conditions.

Britain used technology to defeat German technology, an early instance is the German use of radio signals sending a beam which the bombers could follow and an intersecting beam to tell them when to drop the bombs, very clever but someone in Britain found a way to bend the beams.

Germany came up with the V 1 and V 2 to target cities like London. Most of the V 1’s were shot down. The V 2 which couldn’t be shot down but Britain had a countermeasure, they fooled the Germans into thinking these were overshooting London so the Germans reduced the range and most missed London.

Britain found ways to confuse German radar. Britain also used other types of technology to fool the Germans

In 1942 in North Africa tanks were disguised as trucks and trucks disguised as tanks. Rommel was misled as to where the British were going to attack.

Then later there were inflatable tanks.

These wouldn’t fool anyone close up but they did fool the Germans, there was a story about a British farmer, he went out one morning and in a field was his prize bull pawing at the ground and the bull charged, the poor farmer saw these tanks lined up and closed his eyes expecting the worst, the only noise he heard was aloud hissing noise, he opened his eyes and there was his bull triumphantly standing next to a very deflated tank.

Other things like Germany having the Tiger tank armed with an 88. The British had their own tanks and Sherman tanks but apart from the Churchill none of them were able to take on the Tiger tank so the Firefly was born, fit the best anti tank gun you have to a Sherman and produce thousands of them.

The Germans soon realized the long barrel was a rather dangerous tank and tried to target the Firefly tanks first so the British came up with this simple but effective counter.

This is rather obvious against a plain background but in the heat of battle easy to mistake this for an ordinary Sherman, a rather fatal mistake.

So in WW II did Britain have the best technology?

In some areas they did but it was really the use of existing technology rather than a desperate attempt to find some new wonder technology that was important.

A lot of technology was shared between Britain and USA.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0a5nvreq14hosdyi', 'title': 'Which country in World War II had the best technology?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The best technology or the best use of technology?

Sean Lyndersay,Updated 11y,"Why do non-Mozilla browsers include ""Mozilla"" in their user agent strings?","It's very historical and predates the ""Mozilla"" we know today (though current Mozilla is the spirtual descendent).

Let's break down the question:

First: what does the term ""mozilla"" in this context refer to? Hint: It does not refer to the Mozilla Corporation or Foundation, or to the Gecko engine.

In the early nineties, the Mosaic browser was made by a group at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. Mosaic's ease-of-use and features helped popularize the ""world-wide web."" One of the co-authors founded a company called Netscape. This new company created a commercial web-browser called Netscape. Before it was released (and named), it was internally code-named ""Mozilla"" (apparently a contraction of ""Mosaic Killer"", since the new company intended to supplant the free, still-NCSA-produced Mosaic with their new browser).

When Netscape was released, it carried the user-agent ""Mozilla/1.0"", in homage to the code-name for the product. All subsequent versions of the Netscape product used that user-agent.

Edit: See Lou Montulli's answer for a first-hand account of how Mozilla came to be in the user-agent string.
Lou Montulli's answer to Why do non-Mozilla browsers include ""Mozilla"" in their user agent strings?

Second: why did non-Netscape browsers adopt it?

Netscape quickly became the dominant browser, and, as it improved, they added lots of features that websites would code for. A website would detect that they could use these new Netscape-invented features by looking for the string ""Mozilla"" in the user-agent.

When other browsers came onto the market trying to compete with Netscape (most famously, Internet Explorer), they would clone Netscape's features, but they found when websites didn't see ""Mozilla"" in the user-agent string, the websites would serve up less-interesting/impressive versions of their sites, making the competitor browsers look less interesting.

So, browsers, particularly IE (but other browsers like all WebKit-based browsers joined in) started including the ""Mozilla"" string at the beginning of their user-agent, along with some parenthical information that implied that it was really saying that it was ""compatible"" with Mozilla, and that it's really IE. That way, sites started sending ""Netscape""-versions of their site to IE as well.

Third: why do browsers still use it?

It's basically ""too late"" to change it now. Removing the string may break a lot of code that tries to parse the user-agent string and make sense of it.

Alan Mellor,Updated Oct 30,What technology was available in the 1880s that would surprise most people?,"The Nipkow disc, patented in 1888, surprised me.

This was a flat disc that could spin on an axle. Its special feature was a spiral of small holes drilled through the disc.

The reason this was patented was that it gave a way to slice a moving image up in real time. Electronics could then send the picture over wires or over the air.

It was the core component of Television. In 1888.

The electronics to actually make this work would not be available for another 30 years. John Logie Baird was the first to get a usable television picture using this system in the 1920s.

I’ve got a modern version of his televisor just for fun:

You can see the Nipkow disc with its black and white stripes. They help keep the picture steady using electronic synchronisation.

The holes themselves are tiny:

So the idea of Television was thought about in the 1800s, which surprised me by how early that was.

Mike Jones,2y,How common was it for radio stations to use carts in the past?,"Well, there’s something I haven’t thought about in a while.

That is a Fidelipac cartridge — a “cart” in radio parlance. When I worked in radio around 1980, they were ubiquitous. These had a continuous loop of magnetic tape and recorded either one (for mono) or two (for stereo) audio tracks plus a “cue” track. Cart recorders could put a tone on the cue track that was read by a cart player to stop playback. By recording this too at the very beginning of the audio recording, it ensured that whenever you put a cart into the player it was at the beginning of the recording.

This meant that you could record a “spot” — a commercial, a “SPID” (station promo/ID), a public service announcement, or anything else you wanted to be able to play frequently — and it would always be ready to play by slapping the cart into the machine and hitting “play”. You could put a scheduled announcement/ad/whatever into the machine and let it sit until you needed it.

Most stations had 2 or 3 cart machines. One of the things I learned early on was that you should always keep a spot (a SPID or PSA in our case because I worked at a non-commercial station) cued up just in case. If something went wrong, you could hit “play” on the cart and give yourself a minute to figure things out instead of having dead air.

They came in different lengths, though :35 and 1:05 were the most common. That let you record a :30 or 1:00 bit and have a little space left, but longer versions were available. I think the longest I ever saw was abbot 5 minutes; those were used for music or longer announcements.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8rj6oekunfpah0yw', 'title': 'How common was it for radio stations to use carts in the past?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Well, there’s something I haven’t thought about in a while.\n\nThat is a Fidelipac cartridge — a “cart” in radio parlance.

Silk Road,29-Nov,What is the greatest human achievement in terms of technology?,"The year is 1969.

The world is divided by the Cold War, a tense rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Both superpowers are competing for supremacy in space, launching satellites, probes, and astronauts into orbit.

The Soviets have the upper hand, having achieved the first artificial satellite (Sputnik), the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin), and the first spacewalk (Alexei Leonov).

The Americans are desperate to catch up and beat their rivals.

The ultimate prize is the moon, a barren and mysterious world that has fascinated humans for millennia.

It is not only a symbol of exploration and discovery, but also a strategic asset that could give an edge to whoever controls it.

The race to the moon is on, and both sides are willing to do whatever it takes to win.

The Americans have a bold plan: Project Apollo, a gargantuan effort to land humans on the moon and return them safely to Earth.

It's a daring and risky mission that requires unprecedented levels of technology, science, engineering, and courage.

It's also a mission that will cost billions of dollars and tragic losses of life.

The Apollo program faces many challenges and setbacks along the way.

There are technical glitches, design flaws, launch failures, and horrific accidents.

The most devastating one is Apollo 1, in which three astronauts die in a fire during a routine test on the launch pad.

The program is almost canceled, but the determination and resilience of the engineers, scientists, and astronauts prevails.

After years of hard work and sacrifice, the Apollo program reaches its climax on July 16, 1969.

Apollo 11 blasts off from Cape Kennedy, Florida, carrying three brave men: Neil Armstrong, Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin, and Michael Collins.

Their destination: the Sea of Tranquility, a flat and smooth area on the lunar surface.

The journey takes four days, during which the crew performs various maneuvers and checks to ensure everything is working properly.

On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin enter the lunar module Eagle, leaving Collins behind in the command module Columbia.

They detach from Columbia and begin their descent to the moon.

The landing is not easy.

The Eagle has to dodge craters, boulders, and them slopes as it approaches the landing site.

The onboard computer is overloaded with data and alarms go off. The fuel is running low. The tension is high.

But Armstrong keeps his cool and guides the Eagle to a safe spot. He flips a switch and says: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.""

The world holds its breath as Armstrong opens the hatch and climbs down the ladder.

This is Buzz Aldrin climbing down the ladder. Photo taken by Neil Armstrong. Remastered in 4k.

He pauses at the bottom step and says: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""

He plants his boot on the dusty surface and becomes the first human to walk on the moon.

Aldrin joins him shortly after and they spend about two hours exploring, collecting rocks, planting flags, talking to President Nixon, and taking pictures.

They also leave behind a plaque that reads: ""Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.""

Surreal image taken by Collins. Remastered in 4k.

Meanwhile, Collins orbits the moon alone in Columbia, waiting for his comrades to return.

He later says: ""I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life. I am it.""

After completing their historic mission, Armstrong and Aldrin rejoin Collins in Columbia and begin their journey back to Earth.

They splash down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 and are greeted by cheering crowds and global acclaim.

The Apollo 11 mission is a triumph of human ingenuity, creativity, and courage.

It's a testament to what we can achieve when we work together for a common goal. It's a milestone in our evolution as a species.

It's a story that inspires us to dream big and reach for the stars.

It is the single greatest engineering and technological achievement in history.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lq7k9gno84ixd05s', 'title': 'What is the greatest human achievement in terms of technology?', 'score': {'original': 0.0001, 'ai': 0.9999}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The year is 1969.\n\nThe world is divided by the Cold War, a tense rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nBoth superpowers are competing for supremacy in space, launching satellites, probes, and astronauts into orbit.\n\nThe Soviets have the upper hand, having achieved the first artificial satellite (Sputnik), the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin), and the first spacewalk (Alexei Leonov).\n\nThe Americans are desperate to catch up and beat their rivals.\n\nThe ultimate prize is the moon, a barren and mysterious world that has fascinated humans for millennia.\n\nIt is not only a symbol of exploration and discovery, but also a strategic asset that could give an edge to whoever controls it.\n\nThe race to the moon is on, and both sides are willing to do whatever it takes to win.\n\nThe Americans have a bold plan: Project Apollo, a gargantuan effort to land humans on the moon and return them safely to Earth.\n\nIt\'s a daring and risky mission that requires unprecedented levels of technology, science, engineering, and courage.\n\nIt\'s also a mission that will cost billions of dollars and tragic losses of life.\n\nThe Apollo program faces many challenges and setbacks along the way.\n\nThere are technical glitches, design flaws, launch failures, and horrific accidents.\n\nThe most devastating one is Apollo 1, in which three astronauts die in a fire during a routine test on the launch pad.\n\nThe program is almost canceled, but the determination and resilience of the engineers, scientists, and astronauts prevails.\n\nAfter years of hard work and sacrifice, the Apollo program reaches its climax on July 16, 1969.\n\nApollo 11 blasts off from Cape Kennedy, Florida, carrying three brave men: Neil Armstrong, Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin, and Michael Collins.\n\nTheir destination: the Sea of Tranquility, a flat and smooth area on the lunar surface.\n\nThe journey takes four days, during which the crew performs various maneuvers and checks to ensure everything is working properly.\n\nOn July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin enter the lunar module Eagle, leaving Collins behind in the command module Columbia.\n\nThey detach from Columbia and begin their descent to the moon.\n\nThe landing is not easy.\n\nThe Eagle has to dodge craters, boulders, and them slopes as it approaches the landing site.\n\nThe onboard computer is overloaded with data and alarms go off.

Chris Everett,3y,"Could a gunsmith 100, 200, or 300 years ago reverse engineer modern small arms?","100 years ago?

1920? For the most part, yes. The biggest change since then is in metallurgy and materials, not really any grand new invention. There is very little new under the sun in basic operating principles in the last 100 years.

200 Years ago?

1820 puts us right at the invention of the percussion cap, and well before metallic cartridges and smokeless powder.

Nonetheless, an experienced gunsmith (or more likely some sort of manufacture) could eventually reverse engineer most everything. I suspect that the smokeless powder would be the biggest challenge for the chemists of the day. A typical gunsmith would have little hope of figuring that out. Challenges will also be present in materials. This is before modern steel production, and of course well before modern polymers and the like. This is really right at the crossroads of time for this. Give the right person a modern rifle, and it would be a big step… But it would have to be the right person.

300 years ago, at 1720, is far more challenging. This puts you before the industrial revolution, and machine tools like modern metal lathes. Material challenges would be significant. It would be very difficult to contain modern high pressure rounds in steels of the day. This is the point that I think it’s a bridge too far. The materials change too much, the chemistry is too far advanced, the manufacturing processes just aren’t there yet, and all are far enough away that you need a lot of precursor technology that just doesn’t exist yet. You don’t just need tools to make the guns, or even tools to make the tools to make the guns. You need about three more levels of that sort of thing.

Then most of the Greek technology was lost due to the Arab conquest of North Africa and in Europe such things were considered diabolical during the Dark Ages.

Approximate scheme of the Taqi al-Din turbine based on written description.

Anubhav Jain,3y,How has technology changed our lives?,"A year back, one day, my son got hold of my cousin's phone as his child was playing a game on it.

The game fascinated my son, and he started playing it.

The moment I saw him playing the game, I took away the smartphone although he cried for a while.

As a father, it's my responsibility to make sure children don't get addicted to technology, and I am very particular about it.

When we were in the five to ten age group, we would make houses of mud, raise puppies in the vicinity, make homes for them out of bricks and cardboard, play games like hide and seek, hand cricket, kho kho, pitthu game, we would cycle for hours, climb trees and pluck fruits like shehtoot and Jamun, play badminton in the streets.

In the home, we had carrom, ludo, snake and ladders, four corners, dark room, raja Mantri chor sipahi, business.

Life was fun; there was so much to do, explore and learn and adjust ourselves to different climatic conditions, to boost our immunity and to have an athletic body.

Today, I see five-year-olds, wearing bulky glasses, continuously playing games on their parent's smartphones or personal tabs for hours at a stretch.

They will eat, drink, talk but the gadget wouldn't move from their hands as if their fists are pasted with few quick on the phones.

David Rendahl,Updated 3y,Is it possible that it was the rapid advancement of technology in the twentieth century which also led to a change in combat styles during battles and wars?,"The biggest changes to the art of warfare occurred in the ‘long’ 19thC (1789 - 1914)*.

If you took Alexander the Great from his rightful place in history and dropped him 2,150 years later in command of the Waterloo campaign (1815) I believe he would make a decent fist of it.

He would need instruction in musketry and cannon, but they could teach the drills and formations to illiterate jailbirds in a couple of weeks.

But If you took Wellington from his rightful place in history (1815) and dropped him just 100 years later in command of the Western Front in WW1, there is no way he could’ve comprehended the scale and impact of scientific and engineering advances on his trade.

Outside of sieges** Alexander and Wellington spent less than a few days a year engaged in battle. The rest of the time, and the real skill of a commander, was spent manoeuvring his men, resources, allies and enemy into a position where battle could be met with the greatest advantage.

Find em, Fix em and Finish em! Be the firstest with the mostest! Amateurs talk of battle, professionals talk of logistics! The principles still haven't changed, but between Alexander and Wellington what a commander needed in knowledge and instinct to meet those principles were confined to the physical, visual world.

Alexander’s Aristotelian schooling and service in his father’s Army had given him the requisite mind and judgement to assess: time and distance; physical geography; the impact of seasons and weather on muscle and stores; how far men can march, carrying how much over what terrain; the limits of perishable food and water supply using forage and animal drawn carts; terrain appreciation by scouting, hand drawn map, local knowledge and guides. Finance was via big chunks of gold you carried with you, and rents in the form of food from the territory you controlled.

He had learnt through experience what vital features and vital effort were in a battleground confined to a sweep of the head. The psychology of leading men through heroic example and direct oratory, were required because the entire Army could see him from one position. These had been drilled into him from birth.

Wellington received an enlightened Gentleman’s education of letters and science not massively moved on in practical terms from Aristotle’s times. He often said he learnt his soldiers trade watching others blunder and figuring out “what not to do” but in Flanders and India he excelled at logistical calculations and honed his understanding of ground and movement from the same horseback perspective Alexander did. This is what propelled him from Major to General in record time.

Your limitations were your enemies and he too wanted to find you, fix you and finish you. He was searching for the most favourable ground, time and opportunity. So the final skill of the commander was to put his instincts ‘over the hill’ into his opponents camp and guess his moves.

Alexander’s movements leading to the Battle of Issus 333BC, 40 miles from one end to the other.

Wellington and Blucher’s movements leading to the Battle of Waterloo 1815, 40 miles from one end to the other.

When battle was joined in Alexander’s day and Wellington’s it all took place in a single decisive effort. You could see your entire front line from one position, eyes, flags, trumpets and riders were enough to encompass it. The objective was as simple as capture the flag, take the king, stay alive, destroy the enemy’s means to continue and you walked away with all the chips on the table.

Alexander had foot infantry and cavalry armed with pointy bits of metal, archers and slingers firing more metal out to visual distance. By Waterloo these had been amalgamated into foot infantry and cavalry with pointy bits of metal and firing lumps of the stuff out to visual distance, but winning was still about resolve and discipline in block ranks, forcing the other guys out of their formations.

The Battle of Issus, 333BC, left flank to right flank just over a mile

The Battle of Waterloo, 1815, left flank to right flank just under two miles

The Western Front 1914–1918, 440 miles from one end to the other

The Battle of the Somme 1916, left flank to right flank 36 miles.

It wasn't just the scale of the battlefield that changed in those 100 years. When Joffre, Foch or Haig were planning a battle they had to consider chemical production totals in factories in India, shipping timetables across the Atlantic, railway schedules across Europe, disposition of coal reserves, availability of steel production in America, concurrent operations in the Western Approaches, Russia, Italy the Balkans and Mesopotamia. They had to consider headlines in newspapers stretching the whole world.

Communications in Wellington and Alexander’s day meant writing something down on paper and sending it by the fastest horse - when you left for campaign you said I’ll be back in the Spring or dead by Autumn. You’d be lucky to get a dozen messages between the source of revenue and front line in that time.

Haig and Foch had telephones on their desks capable of putting them through to political leaders. Their control of the campaign was scrutinised by those far away, with different priorities. GHQ cleared tens of thousands of messages a day. Wellington and Alexander were spared daily debates on priorities and cost management.

There was no single position a General could see their entrenched army or be seen by them in 1916. Telephone, telegram and wireless connected them to junior commanders. If their men saw them it was in a photograph in a magazine. Heroic example was hard to convey when orders and instructions came off paper receipts from far away. Abandoning distant headquarters to jump in a forward positions would swiftly blinker your leaders to events.

Their field of vision stretched across continents, included photographs of enemy dispositions and railheads hundreds of miles behind their lines. Their intelligence had to include pre-war reserves of rare metals, likely scientific advances and the calorie intake of civilians. Their political masters spent their days profiling every piece of information filtering though world leaders and interlocking markets.

One of the first things the British Army did in 1914 was order the construction of several new factories for producing propellants and securing stocks of chemicals from across the world. Within months they were ordering enough barbed wire to encircle the world several times over.

To keep their armies going Alexander and Wellington took blacksmiths, carpenters and cobblers who could make most of their own tools and resources. Haig and Foch depended on a host of scientists and industrialists spread around the globe in specialisations undreamt of at Waterloo.

If they wanted to use their artillery to rearrange the scenery behind the horizon, they needed information on cartography, geology, meteorology and chemistry, exact to the last decimal point. Get it wrong, like 3rd Ypres, you failed.

Enemy reserves could move at 40mph on trains, food could be refrigerated and sent from the Southern Hemisphere in cans that lasted years. Whole hillsides could be blown up with high-explosive, dangerous flanks could be covered by field guns from 6 miles away, strewn with mines or a battalion of rifles replaced by pairs of mechanical machine guns that interlocked their fields of fire for 440 miles.

And they were engaged 24/7 for four years, with respite only by exhaustion.

The biggest change to warfare was the nature and expectations of decisive victory. How could you pin an army that stretched over the horizons, that could resupply from a different country overnight by rail? When was it safe to claim all the chips on the table, when winning could cost almost as much as loosing?

The pivot of this change was General Ulysses S Grant in 1863. Before him the education of a gentleman solider was still - get your guys into a field, show some example and have it out.

General Lee was an undoubted genius at the Alexanderian, Wellingtonian school of manoeuvre. He could pin anyone in a single field and wise enough not to get pinned himself. His men were brave and hardy, their weapons equal to their enemy’s. But still they lost.

Grant’s vision stretched from coast to coast, encompassed steel production, railway gauges and new technology. He was already getting a couple telegrams a day from his bosses, and unlike his predecessors had learnt how to respond. He had closed his mind to the heroic and focused on the cold truths of data.

Attrition was anathema to the 2,000+ year old school of military thinking. There is evidence Lee understood that, which is why he targeted his enemies will to continue not his means. But it was very shortsighted to conflate what he was good at with the solution - a decisive battle. He could find em, he could fix em, but he could never finish em.

The French would continue with their school of Élan vital
 into 1917, The Germans would believe in the masterstroke until 1944, when the writing was clearly on the wall. The real end came with atomic weapons when no general or admiral could afford to concentrate his forces for a decisive push. Its replacement was asymmetric attack and defence. Blue jeans and Coca Cola were as vital as century series fighters.

Since WW1 a habit of counting statistics gives us the impression things have changed even more - computers work quicker, planes fly faster, you can see from space, you can guide your weapons with lasers, you can communicate in secrecy in real time video conferences from every point of the compass.

Great stuff, but it’s only the rational extension of the massive cultural change that occurred in military thinking between 1863 and 1914.

* Eric Hobsbawm
. and Ilya Ehrenburg

** Sieges were virtually identical in Alexander’s and Wellington’s time, against identical features, a job for carpenters, artillerymen hurling fire and big rocks and sappers. The shovel and axe were the most important tool’s and they hadn't changed in all that time.

The entirety of Germany was besieged twice in the 20thC by submarines, warships, telegraph lines, trenches, tanks, bomber fleets, economic isolation and blockade of vital materials.

The first action of the Royal Navy in 1914 was to send a trawler with a grappling hook out in to the channel. They fished up the trans Atlantic cables and cut those leading to Germany. Immediately cutting them off from rest of the world and their markets. Wellington wouldn't have thought of that.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9klasth6rodygp31', 'title': 'Is it possible that it was the rapid advancement of technology in the twentieth century which also led to a change in combat styles during battles and wars?', 'score': {'original': 0.76185, 'ai': 0.23815}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The biggest changes to the art of warfare occurred in the ‘long’ 19thC (1789 - 1914)*.\n\nIf you took Alexander the Great from his rightful place in history and dropped him 2,150 years later in command of the Waterloo campaign (1815) I believe he would make a decent fist of it.\n\nHe would need instruction in musketry and cannon, but they could teach the drills and formations to illiterate jailbirds in a couple of weeks.\n\nBut If you took Wellington from his rightful place in history (1815) and dropped him just 100 years later in command of the Western Front in WW1, there is no way he could’ve comprehended the scale and impact of scientific and engineering advances on his trade.\n\nOutside of sieges** Alexander and Wellington spent less than a few days a year engaged in battle.

They had to consider headlines in newspapers stretching the whole world.\n\nCommunications in Wellington and Alexander’s day meant writing something down on paper and sending it by the fastest horse - when you left for campaign you said I’ll be back in the Spring or dead by Autumn. You’d be lucky to get a dozen messages between the source of revenue and front line in that time.\n\nHaig and Foch had telephones on their desks capable of putting them through to political leaders. Their control of the campaign was scrutinised by those far away, with different priorities. GHQ cleared tens of thousands of messages a day. Wellington and Alexander were spared daily debates on priorities and cost management.\n\nThere was no single position a General could see their entrenched army or be seen by them in 1916. Telephone, telegram and wireless connected them to junior commanders. If their men saw them it was in a photograph in a magazine. Heroic example was hard to convey when orders and instructions came off paper receipts from far away. Abandoning distant headquarters to jump in a forward positions would swiftly blinker your leaders to events.\n\nTheir field of vision stretched across continents, included photographs of enemy dispositions and railheads hundreds of miles behind their lines. Their intelligence had to include pre-war reserves of rare metals, likely scientific advances and the calorie intake of civilians. Their political masters spent their days profiling every piece of information filtering though world leaders and interlocking markets.\n\nOne of the first things the British Army did in 1914 was order the construction of several new factories for producing propellants and securing stocks of chemicals from across the world. Within months they were ordering enough barbed wire to encircle the world several times over.\n\nTo keep their armies going Alexander and Wellington took blacksmiths, carpenters and cobblers who could make most of their own tools and resources. Haig and Foch depended on a host of scientists and industrialists spread around the globe in specialisations undreamt of at Waterloo.\n\nIf they wanted to use their artillery to rearrange the scenery behind the horizon, they needed information on cartography, geology, meteorology and chemistry, exact to the last decimal point. Get it wrong, like 3rd Ypres, you failed.\n\nEnemy reserves could move at 40mph on trains, food could be refrigerated and sent from the Southern Hemisphere in cans that lasted years. Whole hillsides could be blown up with high-explosive, dangerous flanks could be covered by field guns from 6 miles away, strewn with mines or a battalion of rifles replaced by pairs of mechanical machine guns that interlocked their fields of fire for 440 miles.\n\nAnd they were engaged 24/7 for four years, with respite only by exhaustion.\n\nThe biggest change to warfare was the nature and expectations of decisive victory. How could you pin an army that stretched over the horizons, that could resupply from a different country overnight by rail? When was it safe to claim all the chips on the table, when winning could cost almost as much as loosing?\n\nThe pivot of this change was General Ulysses S Grant in 1863. Before him the education of a gentleman solider was still - get your guys into a field, show some example and have it out.\n\nGeneral Lee was an undoubted genius at the Alexanderian, Wellingtonian school of manoeuvre. He could pin anyone in a single field and wise enough not to get pinned himself. His men were brave and hardy, their weapons equal to their enemy’s. But still they lost.\n\nGrant’s vision stretched from coast to coast, encompassed steel production, railway gauges and new technology. He was already getting a couple telegrams a day from his bosses, and unlike his predecessors had learnt how to respond. He had closed his mind to the heroic and focused on the cold truths of data.\n\nAttrition was anathema to the 2,000+ year old school of military thinking. There is evidence Lee understood that, which is why he targeted his enemies will to continue not his means. But it was very shortsighted to conflate what he was good at with the solution - a decisive battle. He could find em, he could fix em, but he could never finish em.\n\nThe French would continue with their school of Élan vital\n into 1917, The Germans would believe in the masterstroke until 1944, when the writing was clearly on the wall. The real end came with atomic weapons when no general or admiral could afford to concentrate his forces for a decisive push. Its replacement was asymmetric attack and defence. Blue jeans and Coca Cola were as vital as century series fighters.\n\nSince WW1 a habit of counting statistics gives us the impression things have changed even more - computers work quicker, planes fly faster, you can see from space, you can guide your weapons with lasers, you can communicate in secrecy in real time video conferences from every point of the compass.\n\nGreat stuff, but it’s only the rational extension of the massive cultural change that occurred in military thinking between 1863 and 1914.\n\n* Eric Hobsbawm\n. and Ilya Ehrenburg\n\n** Sieges were virtually identical in Alexander’s and Wellington’s time, against identical features, a job for carpenters, artillerymen hurling fire and big rocks and sappers. The shovel and axe were the most important tool’s and they hadn't changed in all that time.\n\nThe entirety of Germany was besieged twice in the 20thC by submarines, warships, telegraph lines, trenches, tanks, bomber fleets, economic isolation and blockade of vital materials.\n\nThe first action of the Royal Navy in 1914 was to send a trawler with a grappling hook out in to the channel. They fished up the trans Atlantic cables and cut those leading to Germany. Immediately cutting them off from rest of the world and their markets.

The setting is a damp, drafty chamber, candlelit with a smoldering fire. A solitary figure is bent over a sheet of parchment, dipping their quill into a small pot of brilliant blue ink preparing to illuminate the text in front of them.

Typically, many assume that this activity occurred in a monastery. That is until this week, when a team scholars from the University of York and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History released their findings, challenging assumptions that male monks were the sole producers of books throughout the Middle Ages.[1]

Recent historical research reveals that religious women were not only literate but also prolific producers and consumers of books.[2] In Germany and Austria, religious women played a particularly active role in book production, and their work as scribes and illuminators can be traced to as early as the late eighth century [3]. Although surviving examples of these early works are rare and relatively modest, there is a growing body of evidence that women’s monasteries were actively producing books of the highest quality by the 12th century.[4]

Dalheim archaeological site in Germany, where individual B78 was buried (Blue pigment found on a medieval woman's teeth suggests she was a skilled, literate artist | CBC Radio
)

Archaeologists from York University, have been excavating the remnants of a small convent or monastery in Dalheim, Germany., occupied in the 10th to the 14th century.[5] The convent was destroyed by fire during a civil war,[6] leaving only its foundations and a small burial ground.The monastery is known only from a few scraps of text, the earliest of which date to 1244.[7]

While investigating the health of individuals from the Middle ages, the team encountered one set of skeletal remainst that has revolutionized scholar's understanding of women in religious life nine centuries ago. B78 belonged to a woman, estimated to be between 45 and 60 years old when she died sometime between 997 and 1162.[8] The skeleton itself was unremarkable, lacking visible signs of trauma or infections. It suggests that she never engaged in hard physical labor and was a member of the upper strata of society, a common occurrence within religious communities. Her teeth however, are a different story.

The tartar of the female individual known as B78 can be seen deposited on her teeth (A Blue Clue In Medieval Teeth May Bespeak A Woman's Artistry Circa A.D. 1000
)

Experts discovered something very unusual, over 100 particles of blue paint in the form of small crystals and flecks on her teeth in her fossilised dental plaque.[9] It suggested a repeated exposure to an unknown blue dust or powder.

In most societies today, oral hygiene practices are part of our daily routine, meaning that dental plaque is regularly removed and doesn’t have a chance to build up on our teeth. This was not the case in the past. Plaque built up and mineralised over the course of people’s lives.

A key characteristic of dental plaque is that while it forms it has the ability to entrap a wide range of microscopic and molecular debris that comes into contact with a person’s mouth.[10] When dental plaque becomes “tartar” it can entomb and preserve these particles and molecules for hundreds or thousands of years.[11] With the right scientific and archaeological analysis, tartar provides insight on the individual level, of the diet and living conditions of ancient people.

Until recently, the bulk of analyses conducted on ancient tartar has centred on reconstructing diet. [12] Besides the ingestion of food, the human mouth is subject to a constant influx of particles of varying types directly from the environment. Tree and grass pollen, spores, cotton and bast fibres, medicinal plants, as well as diatoms, sponge spicules and micro-charcoal have all been reported among the finds from ancient tartar. [13] Despite this promising evidence, the value of dental calculus as environmental evidence has been under-utilized.

Images (B) to (I) are shown to the same scale, as indicated in (I). (Medieval women’s early involvement in manuscript production suggested by lapis lazuli identification in dental calculus
)

But a multidisciplinary collaborative team from the University of York, the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and Yale University have demonstrated the potential for human dental calculus to reveal an unprecedented level of insight into the lives and working conditions of our ancestors.

Multiple spectrographic analyses revealed the blue pigment to be lazurite/ultramarine, a rare pigment made from crushed lapis lazuli stones.[14] It was as expensive, if not more as gold at the time, mined from a single region in Afghanistan and the ultimate luxury trade good then.[15] Preparation of the pigment required an intricate skill known by few.

Creating a vivid blue pigment from lapis lazuli required an Arabic method of oil flotation that did not appear in European artist manuals until after the 15th century.[16] So it’s more likely that ultramarine pigment was imported into the region as a finished product.

Ultramarine was only used in the production of artistic works for the elite and especially for religious art.[17] Most artists could not afford it even in the Renaissance, where it was one of the most revered shades used by artists to color the Virgin Mary clothing.[18] Michelangelo ordered large quantities of ultramarine for his work on the Sistine Chapel, but reportedly couldn't afford enough to finish his painting The Entombment.[19]

This pigment was used in the production of illuminated manuscripts . An illuminated manuscript is a manuscript in which the text is supplemented with such decoration as initials, borders (marginalia) and miniature illustrations.[20] In the strictest definition, the term refers only to manuscripts decorated with either gold or silver;[21] but in both common usage and modern scholarship, the term refers to any decorated or illustrated manuscript from Western traditions.[22] Islamic manuscripts may be referred to as illuminated, illustrated or painted, though using essentially the same techniques as Western works.

The Entombment (or Christ being carried to his Tomb)

Until the 13th century, manuscripts were created solely under the devotion of monks and nuns across Europe.[23] In exchange for arduous labor, monastic life offered the comfort of meditation, ascetic discipline, and eternal peace. In many instances, the monastery was the foremost intellectual, religious, and agricultural facility in a medieval city center.[24] By extension, the ability to serve within a monastery was deemed a privilege.

The process of creating manuscripts required both physical and mental stamina, as the work was incredibly tedious, detailed, and demanding.Larger monasteries commonly housed scriptoriums, which were reclusive spaces built for the purpose of writing, copying, illuminating, and binding manuscripts. As a testament to their devotion, it was not uncommon for scribes and illuminators to work in solitude from morning until night.[25]

While the use of gold is by far one of the most captivating features of illuminated manuscripts,[26] the bold use of varying colors provided multiple layers of dimension to the illumination. From a religious perspective, ""the diverse colors wherewith the book is illustrated, not unworthily represent the multiple grace of heavenly wisdom.""[27]

While religious authors view themselves as instilling a part of God's vast glory on the work, many illustrations can be linked to the history of the texts that were required to be illustrated and the needs and tastes of the readers of those manuscripts.[28] Color brought the images on the page to life and captivated the readers. Without color the impact of the image would have been completely lost.

Given the destruction at the site due to the fire, this woman's skeleton may be the only record of the activity at the monastery.

The scribe was an active participant in a vast global commercial network that stretched from the mines of Afghanistan to her community in medieval Germany through the trading metropolises of Islamic Egypt and Byzantine Constantinople. The growing economy of 11th century Europe fired demand for the precious and exquisite pigment that traveled thousands of miles via merchant caravan and ships to serve this woman artist's creative ambition.[29]

)

The community of nuns at the site was not large, only about 15 or twenty.[30] It seemed that they had more than adequate funds to acquire this expensive artistic material. Convents received massive support from the local elite and were powerful and influential in the local society.

Medieval dental plaque suggests women played important role as scribes

Given the size of the community, the woman was probably the only scribe.[31] She would have worked in isolation in a room in the convent known as a scriptorium, painstakingly producing beautiful books for the community and local patrons among the aristocracy.[32] Sadly, the dead women’s art was most likely destroyed in the fire that gutted the monastery.

Researchers struggled to comprehend how this precious material end up deposited on this woman’s teeth? A variety of reasons were possible, from painting to accidental ingestion during pigment preparation, perhaps the woman had kissed an image containing lapis as part of a devotional ritual, or engaged in “lapidary medicine,” a medieval practice of ingesting precious stones as curatives.[33] Researchers discounted the later.[34]Perhaps, she kissed an image containing lapis as part of a devotional ritual.[35]

The way in which the blue particles were found in tartar – single flecks in different areas – pointed to a repeated exposure, not a single ingestion.[36] The most likely explanation, then, is that this was an artist who repeatedly used her lips to shape her brush into a fine point in order to paint intricate detail on manuscripts, a practice commonly attested through the early twentieth century.[37]

This finding suggests that women were more involved in the production of books throughout the Middle Ages than previously considered. Manuscripts found in the libraries of women's monasteries have fewer than 15% of female names on them[38] , and before the 12th century, that number drops to fewer than 1%.[39] A few rare surviving works from as early as the eighth century reveal that women were scribes.[40]

Artists are largely invisible in both the historic and archaeological records as they rarely signed their work as a gesture of humility before the 15th century. There have been no known skeletal markers directly associated with producing art.[41]

But this study makes identifying historical artists a realistic possibility, using microscopic particles entombed in their ancient tartar. Expanding the methodology should make possible to track other crafts using this a variety of pigments, thereby revealing the artist behind the masterpiece.

A solitary figure is bent over a sheet of parchment, dipping their quill into a small pot of brilliant blue ink preparing to illuminate the text in front of them.\n\nTypically, many assume that this activity occurred in a monastery. That is until this week, when a team scholars from the University of York and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History released their findings, challenging assumptions that male monks were the sole producers of books throughout the Middle Ages.[1]\n\nRecent historical research reveals that religious women were not only literate but also prolific producers and consumers of books.[2] In Germany and Austria, religious women played a particularly active role in book production, and their work as scribes and illuminators can be traced to as early as the late eighth century [3]. Although surviving examples of these early works are rare and relatively modest, there is a growing body of evidence that women’s monasteries were actively producing books of the highest quality by the 12th century.[4]\n\nDalheim archaeological site in Germany, where individual B78 was buried (Blue pigment found on a medieval woman\'s teeth suggests she was a skilled, literate artist | CBC Radio\n)\n\nArchaeologists from York University, have been excavating the remnants of a small convent or monastery in Dalheim, Germany., occupied in the 10th to the 14th century.[5] The convent was destroyed by fire during a civil war,[6] leaving only its foundations and a small burial ground.The monastery is known only from a few scraps of text, the earliest of which date to 1244.[7]\n\nWhile investigating the health of individuals from the Middle ages, the team encountered one set of skeletal remainst that has revolutionized scholar\'s understanding of women in religious life nine centuries ago. B78 belonged to a woman, estimated to be between 45 and 60 years old when she died sometime between 997 and 1162.[8] The skeleton itself was unremarkable, lacking visible signs of trauma or infections. It suggests that she never engaged in hard physical labor and was a member of the upper strata of society, a common occurrence within religious communities. Her teeth however, are a different story.\n\nThe tartar of the female individual known as B78 can be seen deposited on her teeth (A Blue Clue In Medieval Teeth May Bespeak A Woman\'s Artistry Circa A.D. 1000\n)\n\nExperts discovered something very unusual, over 100 particles of blue paint in the form of small crystals and flecks on her teeth in her fossilised dental plaque.[9] It suggested a repeated exposure to an unknown blue dust or powder.\n\nIn most societies today, oral hygiene practices are part of our daily routine, meaning that dental plaque is regularly removed and doesn’t have a chance to build up on our teeth. This was not the case in the past. Plaque built up and mineralised over the course of people’s lives.\n\nA key characteristic of dental plaque is that while it forms it has the ability to entrap a wide range of microscopic and molecular debris that comes into contact with a person’s mouth.[10] When dental plaque becomes “tartar” it can entomb and preserve these particles and molecules for hundreds or thousands of years.[11] With the right scientific and archaeological analysis, tartar provides insight on the individual level, of the diet and living conditions of ancient people.\n\nUntil recently, the bulk of analyses conducted on ancient tartar has centred on reconstructing diet. [12] Besides the ingestion of food, the human mouth is subject to a constant influx of particles of varying types directly from the environment. Tree and grass pollen, spores, cotton and bast fibres, medicinal plants, as well as diatoms, sponge spicules and micro-charcoal have all been reported among the finds from ancient tartar. [13] Despite this promising evidence, the value of dental calculus as environmental evidence has been under-utilized.\n\nBlue particles observed embedded within archaeological dental calculus.

(Medieval women’s early involvement in manuscript production suggested by lapis lazuli identification in dental calculus\n)\n\nBut a multidisciplinary collaborative team from the University of York, the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and Yale University have demonstrated the potential for human dental calculus to reveal an unprecedented level of insight into the lives and working conditions of our ancestors.\n\nMultiple spectrographic analyses revealed the blue pigment to be lazurite/ultramarine, a rare pigment made from crushed lapis lazuli stones.[14] It was as expensive, if not more as gold at the time, mined from a single region in Afghanistan and the ultimate luxury trade good then.[15] Preparation of the pigment required an intricate skill known by few.\n\nLazurite in calculus of female B78. Photo by Monica Tromp, CC BY-NC\n\nCreating a vivid blue pigment from lapis lazuli required an Arabic method of oil flotation that did not appear in European artist manuals until after the 15th century.[16] So it’s more likely that ultramarine pigment was imported into the region as a finished product.\n\nUltramarine was only used in the production of artistic works for the elite and especially for religious art.[17] Most artists could not afford it even in the Renaissance, where it was one of the most revered shades used by artists to color the Virgin Mary clothing.[18] Michelangelo ordered large quantities of ultramarine for his work on the Sistine Chapel, but reportedly couldn\'t afford enough to finish his painting The Entombment.[19]\n\nThis pigment was used in the production of illuminated manuscripts . An illuminated manuscript is a manuscript in which the text is supplemented with such decoration as initials, borders (marginalia) and miniature illustrations.[20] In the strictest definition, the term refers only to manuscripts decorated with either gold or silver;[21] but in both common usage and modern scholarship, the term refers to any decorated or illustrated manuscript from Western traditions.[22] Islamic manuscripts may be referred to as illuminated, illustrated or painted, though using essentially the same techniques as Western works.\n\nThe Entombment (or Christ being carried to his Tomb)\n\nUntil the 13th century, manuscripts were created solely under the devotion of monks and nuns across Europe.[23] In exchange for arduous labor, monastic life offered the comfort of meditation, ascetic discipline, and eternal peace. In many instances, the monastery was the foremost intellectual, religious, and agricultural facility in a medieval city center.[24] By extension, the ability to serve within a monastery was deemed a privilege.\n\nThe process of creating manuscripts required both physical and mental stamina, as the work was incredibly tedious, detailed, and demanding.Larger monasteries commonly housed scriptoriums, which were reclusive spaces built for the purpose of writing, copying, illuminating, and binding manuscripts. As a testament to their devotion, it was not uncommon for scribes and illuminators to work in solitude from morning until night.[25]\n\nWhile the use of gold is by far one of the most captivating features of illuminated manuscripts,[26] the bold use of varying colors provided multiple layers of dimension to the illumination. From a religious perspective, ""the diverse colors wherewith the book is illustrated, not unworthily represent the multiple grace of heavenly wisdom.""[27]\n\nWhile religious authors view themselves as instilling a part of God\'s vast glory on the work, many illustrations can be linked to the history of the texts that were required to be illustrated and the needs and tastes of the readers of those manuscripts.[28] Color brought the images on the page to life and captivated the readers. Without color the impact of the image would have been completely lost.\n\nGiven the destruction at the site due to the fire, this woman\'s skeleton may be the only record of the activity at the monastery.\n\nThe scribe was an active participant in a vast global commercial network that stretched from the mines of Afghanistan to her community in medieval Germany through the trading metropolises of Islamic Egypt and Byzantine Constantinople. The growing economy of 11th century Europe fired demand for the precious and exquisite pigment that traveled thousands of miles via merchant caravan and ships to serve this woman artist\'s creative ambition.[29]\n\nSelf portrait of Guda, a 12th century nun. The inscription she holds reads, “Guda, peccatrix mulier scripsit et pinxit hunc librum,” translated as “Guda, a sinful woman, wrote and painted this book.”(Guda - Wikipedia\n)\n\nThe community of nuns at the site was not large, only about 15 or twenty.[30] It seemed that they had more than adequate funds to acquire this expensive artistic material. Convents received massive support from the local elite and were powerful and influential in the local society.\n\nMedieval dental plaque suggests women played important role as scribes\n\nGiven the size of the community, the woman was probably the only scribe.[31] She would have worked in isolation in a room in the convent known as a scriptorium, painstakingly producing beautiful books for the community and local patrons among the aristocracy.[32] Sadly, the dead women’s art was most likely destroyed in the fire that gutted the monastery.\n\nResearchers struggled to comprehend how this precious material end up deposited on this woman’s teeth? A variety of reasons were possible, from painting to accidental ingestion during pigment preparation, perhaps the woman had kissed an image containing lapis as part of a devotional ritual, or engaged in “lapidary medicine,” a medieval practice of ingesting precious stones as curatives.[33] Researchers discounted the later.[34]Perhaps, she kissed an image containing lapis as part of a devotional ritual.[35]\n\nThe way in which the blue particles were found in tartar – single flecks in different areas – pointed to a repeated exposure, not a single ingestion.[36] The most likely explanation, then, is that this was an artist who repeatedly used her lips to shape her brush into a fine point in order to paint intricate detail on manuscripts, a practice commonly attested through the early twentieth century.[37]\n\nThis finding suggests that women were more involved in the production of books throughout the Middle Ages than previously considered. Manuscripts found in the libraries of women\'s monasteries have fewer than 15% of female names on them[38] , and before the 12th century, that number drops to fewer than 1%.[39] A few rare surviving works from as early as the eighth century reveal that women were scribes.[40]\n\nArtists are largely invisible in both the historic and archaeological records as they rarely signed their work as a gesture of humility before the 15th century. There have been no known skeletal markers directly associated with producing art.[41]\n\nBut this study makes identifying historical artists a realistic possibility, using microscopic particles entombed in their ancient tartar. Expanding the methodology should make possible to track other crafts using this a variety of pigments, thereby revealing the artist behind the masterpiece.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Medieval woman artist unmasked by her teeth\n[2] Blue tooth reveals hidden medieval artist\n[3] http://A.
