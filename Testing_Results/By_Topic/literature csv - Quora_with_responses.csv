Viral Suchak,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I was scrolling through my facebook feed and I saw a post by Mr.Randeep Hooda. He is a well known Bollywood actor.

Here's his facebook post:

If you are Muslim and suddenly start feeling unsafe in country where you lived for more than thousand years..

If you are Dalit and start feeling insulted on every moment of life..

If you are Hindu and suddenly start feeling that cows are being slaughtered everywhere...

If you are a Jain and suddenly start feeling that your religious piety is being compromised...

If you are punjabi and think all the youth are on drugs.

Just do one thing...

- Stay away from social media...

- Don't watch news...

- Stay away from debates on

religion...

Just look around you at your friends who belong to different castes , communities and religions...

And you will find that you are living in one of the best countries in the world!!

This is the best thing I read today…

Reetesh Gupta,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"In an interview a question was asked to APJ Abdul Kalam.

Interviewer- You have completed so many great tasks for the country. What was the moment when you felt the happiest..?

APJ Abdul Kalam-- Once I was working for Agni missile. I saw a professor come into my laboratory and he was seeing some materials which was light in weight and very hard. I was using this material for Agni missile. He asked me to come with him and took me to a hospital and showed me around 40 children. All of them were under 15 years. And none of them had two complete legs and they used calipers.

Whose weight was around 4kg. They faced difficulty during walking; then professor suggested me to make calipers by the material which is used in Agni missile. After making calipers by that material, the weight of calipers was around 400g. I saw children are running on their own feet and their parent’s eyes were filled with tears(tears of happiness). When I saw their parents, I felt like I am the happiest soul on Earth and that is the happiest moment of my life.

Great soul- APJ Abdul Kalam.

Satendra Singh,Updated 5y,What interesting thing did you read today?,"When China refused to share technology with India-

Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh is dealing with severe water crisis. It receives lowest rainfall and underground water levels are at all time low with Mahoba being the most parched district. So Uttar Pradesh government decided to moisten the ground by inducing rain artificially.

But India doesn't have such technology so they contacted pioneer of this technology, their neighbour cum rival, China. According to Dharampal Singh, State irrigation minister, “China had offered to share the process with us for about Rs 10.5 crore but for reasons best known to them, they backed out in February this year. We even asked them to participate in a global tender but they didn’t.”

After China turned their back IIT Kanpur was asked to undertake the project. The process, known as cloud seeding, involves spraying a mixture in atmosphere around which water vapours condense and when these water droplets become too heavy to stay in air they fall down as rain. Development of this mixture was the most difficult part of the project but IIT Kanpur in collaboration with department of aerospace engineering, civil engineering and bio engineering developed it in just five months. In IIT Kanpur’s deputy director Manindra Agarwal’s words “The mixture is most critical part and we have perfected it. The rest of the technology is quite standard.”

Also the estimated cost of inducing artificial rain over 1000 square kilometre using the IIT Kanpur technique would come to around Rs 5 crore.

Once America and now China…never underestimate the power of Indian scientists.

Her frowned eyes

Poor kid, he thought his mother will be happy and appreciate his efforts

Now look at this woman

She is also surprised but her facial expressions show that she is happy for this little achievement of the child.

Now this is what one teacher does, Appreciates efforts and then Corrects your mistakes.

Vignesh Atm,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I'm pretty sure most of you here know Nicki Minaj. She's an American singer/rapper.

And I'm pretty sure most of you hate her as well. She's not exactly known for all the good reasons. I used to hate her too but then she did something that just forced me to change.

I think this deserves respect. A LOT of respect.

So it all started when a fan replied to her tweet and asked if she wanted to pay his tuition fees.

And then Nicki Minaj replied. (I’m pretty sure he didn't expect it)

And then she actually did setup a contest, helping over 50 of her fans. Sure, she probably has a lot of money, but it takes some massive generosity to help her fans like this.

Here's something she posted on Instagram after:

She spent over $50,000 dollars on that day. She has actually started a student charity that's constantly helping students around the world for the past one month or so.

I'm actually astonished by how a social image can be deceptive. She's known for twerking among other things and her songs all portray her in some sort of bad light.

But to see this was truly astounding.

And today, Nicki Minaj, you've earned my respect.

Edit: Ketan Pande, down in the comments, has just informed me that Nicki Minaj has been secretly helping a Village in India! Thanks Ketan!

Rajib Dutta,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"50 tough bikers escort a bullied student to school.

11-year-old Phil Mick a sixth-grade student of DeKalb Middle School, Indiana (USA) was a victim of intense bullying. It eroded the kid’s self-esteem so badly that he wanted to kill himself. The Auburn teen’s plight somehow reached the ears of a bikers group in the area and they decided to boost the boy’s confidence.

On Phil’s first day of sixth grade on August 1, more than 50 bikers from Fort Wayne and Columbia City gathered at Richards Restaurant in Auburn to escort the harried kid to school. The bikers prayed for Phil before hitting the road to reach the school.

The motorcycles’ roar was difficult to miss as they arrived at the school. Fellow students rushed out to see as sound of the mean machines reverberated off the brick walls of the school. It was a sight to behold as young Phil stepped out in full grandeur, his confidence touching sky-high.

Aayushi Tiwari,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"The best thing I came across:

“If someone pronounces a word wrong, it means he has learnt that word by reading.”

Now I find this very apt for people who are avid readers and are not confident enough about their speaking skills in public. Also, those who make fun of people who pronounce a word or two wrong should understand this fact very well.

One day she developed a skin disease. Slowly she started to lose her beauty. It so happened that one day her husband left for a tour.

While returning he met with an accident and lost his eyesight. However their married life continued as usual. But as days passed she lost her beauty gradually.

Blind husband did not know this and there was not any difference in their married life.

He continued to love her and she also loved him very much. One day she died. Her death brought him great sorrow.

He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town. A man from behind called and said, now how will you be able to walk all alone? All these days your wife used to help you. He replied, I am not blind.

I was acting, because if she knew l could see her ugliness it would have pained her more than her disease. So I pretended to be blind.

She was a very good wife. I only wanted to keep her happy.

Moral: Some times it is good for us to act blind and ignore one another's short comings, in order to be happy. No matter how many times the teeth bite the tongue, they still stay together in one mouth. That's the spirit of FORGIVENESS.

Sudhanshu Kumar,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Indian Man Declares Himself As King Of An Unclaimed Strip Of Land Near Egypt and a Own Kingdom (800 sq miles) -Yes it’s his Land now !

Hell, it's a dream of most of us that we could claim free land as in older times the one who grow crops on a unclaimed land is the owner of that land !

However, majority of us have accepted the fact that this dream is most likely to remain unfulfilled.

Here is how he did it : The strip of land that Suyash has declared himself to be the king of is in reality an unclaimed area i.e. it belongs to no country. The area is called Bir Tawil and is on the South of Egypt's border and the North of Sudan's border

It is said to be the the only known land on earth where humans can live and survive but is not a part of any state or country

Mr Dixit travelled from his hometown of Indore, India, to Bir Tawil to declare himself the 'first king of Dixit

Now, the problem arises because Egypt follows the 1899 border set by the British administration at the time of its colonization however, Sudan follows the 1902 border as its official border. Henceforth, neither country claims the smaller Bir Tawil Triangle as it would mean losing control of the larger Hala’ib Triangle.

His Facebook post reads :

“I traveled 319KM (to and fro) in far desert with no roads to claim this unclaimed land of Bir Tawil. It was an epic journey starting from Abu Simbel at 4 am. I took help from a local driver Mustafa for the car and most part of driving. When I told him about the plan first he thought I am crazy but then he agreed (yeah I paid him a lot). I and Suyog spent 2 nights planning a highly optimised route for my travel where we can take the car.”

How he claimed the land to be his own :

It was a dangerous journey for him as he explains later ,Now if you are wondering ,he actually went old school,

“Following the early civilization ethics and rule, if you want to claim a land then you need to grow crops on it. I have added a seed and poured some water on it today. It is mine”

Here are some exciting stats about KoD

Name: Kingdom of Dixit (KoD)

Flag: (images attached)

Current population of country: 1

Capital city: Suyashpur

Ruler: King Suyash I

Date of establishment: Nov. 5, 2017

National animal: lizard (I didn’t see any other animal there)

I hereby declare Suyog Dixit as the acting Prime Minister and the Head of Military (if we have any) from today. We are accepting applications for other posts.

I am proud to announce my father as the President of KoD as a birthday gift to him. Happy birthday Papa!

Life is either an incredible adventure or it is nothing at all. If you are not doing something epic, you’re gonna end up in a yet another grave.

I am the king! (Please?)

This is no joke, I own a country now! Time to write an email to UN.""

He has opened foreign investments to his country and nationality applications from his website: https://kingdomofdixit.gov.best/
 (I would like to be home minister )

You may wanna Apply, I am Jealous of him now :D

This News has been reported by The Telegraph, TOI, IBtimes .Read More from sources I used to write this below.

So, this girl called Oakley Maverick who was using fake credentials and fake profile picture was exposed and it's the best thing I’ve read today and I felt good.

Why?

Because Quora doesn't stand for this. And, I and thousands of other quorans didn't sign up here to see a fake person using fake credentials and writing about their fake experiences, sharing their “knowledge”, just for the sake of popularity.

I wonder how many people were misinformed due to her, and how many people had read her content and had believed her.

Lavina Tandon,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I had read this on whatsapp-

A few years ago in-front of his eyes his girlfriend was brutally raped by six bastards in a running bus of Delhi.

He fought till the time he was beaten blue with an iron rod.

They broke his leg, robbed him, snatched his mobile & left him almost naked..

He fought till the time he could. Then on that chilling cold night he was thrown from the running bus along with his girl friend.

They were naked, drained, exhausted & both were bleeding for different reasons.

He tried to stop passing cars & kept on begging for a piece of shawl to wrap his naked girl friend & finally he got it after 40 minutes.

Then he took her to the hospital, admitted her, called the police,called her parents & did every possible co-operation that a true friend should do in the hour of need.

He could have fled from the bus - he did not.

He could have left her on the road - he did not.

He could have claimed fame & money ( as the father of Nirbhaya got Rs 25 lakhs from UP CM,his son got a job & many more ) - but he did not.

He could have claimed his treatment money from Govt - he did not.

He could have become the most frequently seen face in the electronic media in exchange of money - he did not.

*If this is not friendship then what is friendship??*

When the entire country roared for the girl no one thought what this boy had gone through that night.

He is not a film star or a cricketer.

He is *Awindra Pratap Pandey,* a boy from Gorakhpur in UP, the boy who loved his girl friend from the core of his heart.

When this boy is there somewhere in anonymity, why we Indians should celebrate Friendship Day on 3rd August to copy the Americans?

We should celebrate Friendship Day in India on *16th December* to salute the spirit of Awindra who proved what friendship means.

Let *16th December* be the official Friendship Day in India.

Am I talking sense??

If *yes* then please share & forward this to as many as you can…

Aniket Kadam,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I was scrolling down my Facebook wall, until I came across a status update from my professor. He always comes up with motivating or morally riveting statuses. He posted a wonderful story with a sweet message in the end. The story moved me, and the message it gave had shivers down my spine with a subtle adrenaline rush!!

Here it is..

A teacher narrated a story to his class:

“A cruise ship met with an accident at sea. On the ship was a married couple. After having made their way to the lifeboat, they realized that there was only space for one person left. At this moment, the man pushed the woman behind him and jumped onto the lifeboat himself. The lady stood on the sinking ship and shouted one sentence to her husband.”
The teacher stopped and asked, ""What do you think she shouted?""

Most of the students excitedly answered, ""I hate you!""

The teacher noticed a boy who was silent throughout, he got him to answer and he replied, ""Teacher, I believe she would have shouted - Take care of our child!""
The teacher was surprised, asking ""Have you heard this story before?""
The boy shook his head, ""No, but that was what my mum told my dad before she died to disease"".

The teacher lamented, ""The answer is right"".

The ship sank; the man went home and brought up their daughter single-handedly. Many years later, after his death, their daughter found his diary while tidying his belongings. It turns out that when the parents went on the cruise, the mother was already diagnosed with a terminal illness. At the critical moment, the father rushed to the only chance of survival.
He wrote in his diary, ""How I wished to sink to the bottom of the ocean with you, but for the sake of our daughter, I can only let you lie forever below the sea alone"".

The story was finished, the class was silent.

The teacher knew that the students had understood the moral of the story, that of the good and the evil in the world, that there are many complications behind them which are hard to understand.
This is why we should not focus only on the surface and judge others without understanding them first.

Those who like to pay the bill, do so not because they are loaded but because they value friendship above money.

Those who apologize first after a fight, do so not because they are wrong but because they value the people around them.

Those who are willing to help you, do so not because they owe you anything but because they see you as a true friend.

One day, all of us will get separated from each other; we will miss our conversations of everything & nothing; the dreams that we had. Days will pass by, months, years, until this contact becomes rare.

One day, our children will see our pictures and ask 'Who are these people?' And we will smile with invisible tears and say:
IT WAS WITH THEM THAT I HAD THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE !!

Sarhad Choudhary,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"This one I read on WhatsApp. But strangely I found it worth sharing. It's really good. I hope we can share something that we read on WA.

A wise man asked, why do you have brakes in cars?

There were some logical replies,

To avoid accidents.
To reduce speed.
Basically, for safe driving.

That's not how the wise man perceived the importance of a brake. His answer was:

We have brakes, so that we can drive faster.

Now that was unexpected. People didn't agree at first. It didn't make much sense. But listen to the logic behind it…

If there are no brakes, any person would try to avoid accident by driving slow. Infact he won't drive at all. It's the security of working brakes that allows him to pick up speed, accelerate and reach his destination.

We can apply the same for life.

It's necessary to have a fallback option. It's necessary to have a source of mental support. Without their help, no man can rise. Who're they? Friends, family and colleagues.

They often question your actions, which may cause us to get irritated. But it's their constant nagging which involuntarily helps us stay right on track.

Without those brakes, we can skid, lose direction, and meet with an unfortunate accident.

Now I won't mind if my mom scolds me. I'll give her a kind smile and comply with whatever she asks.

Ok, no… I'll retaliate at times.

Niaz Maksud,Updated 5y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Have you heard about this man?

Yes, This is Afroz Shah, a Mumbai based lawyer who, a year back, was conferred with Champion of the Earth award, UN’s top reward recognising outstanding leaders who have striven to lead a positive impact on environment.

What did he do?

Look at the pictures..

He initiated the world's largest beach cleanup project at Versova Beach.

How did it begin?

Shah and his 84 year old neighbor Harbansh Mathur, were fed up of the debris and waste accumulated on Versova beach. They were determined to do something and took the colossal task of cleaning the beach into their own hands!

The pair started cleaning up the beach themselves, one piece of rubbish at a time. But they wanted others to join in this movement and spread awareness. Hence, they inspired youth and their neighbors and locals to get involved in the cleaning drive. His call was responded also by slum dwellers, journalists and celebrities. They came every weekend for their date with the ocean and contributed to Shah's effort. They did this continuously every weekend for almost 2 years in a knee deep rotting pile of garbages and the scorching Indian sun!

What was the result?

A clean beautiful beach!

The volunteers collected over 4,500 tons of trash from the 2.5 kilometre beach.

Hats off to Shah and Team. Take a bow!!

And what I read today made me super duper happy!!

“Olive ridley turtles hatch in Mumbai after two decades at Versova Beach""[1]

The ecosystem is returning to a place that was buried under tons and tons of garbage and waste for 20 long years!

Afroz Shah’s effort has been paid off! Respect you sir!!

You have set an example for the youth and for the public with your efforts and good work!

This is something surreal!

Our country needs people more like you.

You have really inspired us!

Asheet Sinvhal,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Converting DEAD PLASTIC into PETROL & DIESEL by an INDIAN.

We all know about plastic being a necessary evil in today’s world. Its the cheapest and most convenient form of packaging for daily purposes. But its not environment-friendly.

Even after recycling it becomes thicker. After multiple recycles it becomes bad plastic or dead plastic which has to be dumped in landfills. But dumping doesn’t solve the problem. The plastic takes forever to degrade and the sight of landfill is like this:

But this man from Hyderabad experimented on how to convert waste plastic to usable fuel i.e. Petrol and Diesel and is now running a business out of it.

He is Satish Kumar, a 45- year old man from Hyderabad.

The process involves de-polymerization of plastic( a polymer) into monomer by subjecting plastic to high temperature(350–400 °C) in absence of oxygen. Its called Pyrolysis.

So all the waste plastic is bought from scrap owners

Put in this chamber for pyrolysis

Then a little magic through the hands of Mr. Satish Kumar and his team:

And the end result is this:

The process yields Diesel(leftmost),High Speed Diesel(centre) and Petrol(rightmost).

He began working on the idea himself and slowly scaled up the plant facilities to handle 15 tonnes of plastic waste every month.

Each batch yields 250 to 300 litres of diesel, 100 litres of high-speed diesel and 50 litres of petrol which can be used in vehicles/machines without further processing it.

Another plus point of this method is that it does not release any pollutants or solid waste as the process takes place in absence of oxygen. Just fuel.

This is his small factory solving a big problem:

This is an indeed a great effort by an Indian who did not do it for fame or money but for the mutual benefit of everyone. This would go a long way in solving the problem of plastic recycling and dumping.

Hope he continues it this way for the world to see it and start it in their lands.

“Why do we want to wait for a few more years, till the threat is staring us in the face?”-Satish

Neha Batra,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Police comes to Russian guy's rescue who was seen begging near a temple.

“Atithi devo bhavah”... This is not only something we Indians take pride in saying, this is the motto we live by.

The below example truly shows this spirit.

A tourist from Russia was seen begging outside the Kumarakottam Murugan temple in Kanchipuram. People there inquired about him and informed police to look into the matter as he seemed lost. A team of police from Siva Kanchi police station arrived and found out that he was a 32 year old research student from Russia, who has simply exhausted all his money.

The guy's name was “Evangelin Burngowe”. He had arrived in India on 8th September on tourist visa.

After touring places in North India, Burngowe had reached Kancheepuram by bus from Bangalore. He exhausted all his money on mobile phone and the main problem arrived when he forgot the pin of his debit card. He said he had no other options so he decided to beg for money.

The police verified his documents and found that his documents were all valid and the story was indeed true.

Then he was given Rs. 500 and the police authorities put him on a train to Chennai. They asked him to get down at Egmore and take an autorickshaw to the Russian embassy in the City.

Given the image of police in today's scenario, this was a worth mentioning effort by them. Also salute to the local people for their spirit.

Amidst all the negative issues that media portrays, this was indeed a breath of fresh air.

Humanity is still alive.

Hail humanity.

“We both left home at 18,

You cleared JEE, I got recommended.

You got IIT, I got NDA.

You pursued your degree, I had the toughest training.

Your day started at 7 and ended at 5, mine started at 4 till 9 and some nights also included.

You had your convocation ceremony, I had my POP (Passing Out Parade).

Best company took you and best package was awarded, I was ordered to join my Paltan with 2 stars piped on my shoulders.

You got a job,I got a way of life.

Every eve you got to see your family, I just wished I got to see my parents soon.

You celebrated festivals with lights and music, I celebrated with my comrade in bunkers.

We both married and your wife got to see you everyday, My wife just wished I was alive.

You were sent to business trips, I was sent on line of control.

We both returned, Both wives couldn't control their tears, you wiped hers but, I couldn't...

You hugged her but, I couldn't. Because I was lying in the coffin, with medals on my chest and coffin wrapped with tricolor.

My way of life ended... Your continued.

We both left home at 18.”

Salute to all the Indian soldiers!!!

Jai Hind!!!

Ravi Chandra,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"How many long years can you hide a great secret when you have helped many persons?

This man is Absolute wonder and a Selfless creature that the world has ever witnessed.

In 1939, the English stockbroker Nicholas Winton rescued 669 (Jewish) Czech children from the Nazi’s holocaust, but his achievement went unrecognized for 50 bloody years.

Yes…. FIFTY years!!!!!

He was invited to a TV show by a journalist without any prior information regarding the show’s subject.

He sat like a normal audience

Twist behind the scene : His wife found a notebook in the attic which contains the names and pictures of all children that Winton had saved. She was surprised to see the noble deed done by her husband and handed over it to a TV journalist.

Suddenly something abnormal happened. The TV journalist then reads a name of the person DIAMANT from the book and she stood up and thanks him for saving her life from Holocaust which leaves him in tears.

and then the Journalist asks I request everyone to stand up who owe their life to Winton.

Everyone in the auditorium stood up leaving him bewildered.

Then the above twist opens up each and every person in the auditorium is the child he rescued half century ago. They all gathered in that hall with the help of journalist to THANK the man who gave them a new life.

Just imagine the moment, GOOSEBUMPS guaranteed. He was left in this state .

Crying like a child , wiping his tears.

The untold Story :

When he spent a few months in Prague in late 1938 at the invitation of a friend at the British Embassy, and was alarmed by the influx of refugees endangered by the imminent Nazi invasion. He immediately recognized the advancing danger and decided to make every effort to get the children outside the reach of Nazi power.

As the World war II continued, Nicholas Winton managed to arrange for 669 children to leave on eight different trains across four countries from Prague to London. English foster parents collected the refugee children at London railway station by placing advertisements in newspapers and took them home.

Below was the picture with one of the rescued children.

Honours:

He was knighted
 in recognition of his work by the Queen during 2003 New Year Honours.

A statue of Winton stands on Platform 1 of the Prague railway station.

A statue in front of London’s Liverpool Street Station commemorates the Kinder transport.

Cheers and Peace :)

Naman Gupta,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Read an amazing story of an inspiring woman.

At the age of 23, she lost her husband and was left with a two-year-old son. This brave mother fought against all odds, overcame weaknesses and became a role model for many. TRUE spirit of Motherhood! Here is her story, in her own words:

“It was year 2001. I was happily married. I had an army officer as a loving husband. Maj Avinash was posted in Kashmir. The separation seemed tumultuous enough. But I did not know at that time, our destiny wasn’t to be an average fauji family.

Married at the age of Nineteen, I continued my studies after marriage too. We were blessed with a baby boy in 1999. I was a happy fauji wife, blessed mother and busy student. Life was great.

Mobiles were not yet common. We used to be connected through phone calls, which were either patched up through many Army Exchanges or made after a long waiting in the only STD booth available for thousands of soldiers.

Considering the quality of the connection and the rarity of it, each successful conversation was like a battle won. He used to love listening to the meaningless chatter of our son over the phone. Life was a true wonder. And we used to desperately wait for those phone calls.

Until one morning when a phone call from Kashmir hit us like a bolt of lightning.

Early morning on 28 Sep 2001 we got a call from his unit that he is seriously injured with gunshot wounds.

We were shaken. The worst fear of a fauji family had come true. Our universe went dark. Our world came to a standstill. We prayed and prayed and prayed. But it was futile.

Second call after two hours turned our world upside down. I lost my husband, at the age of 23. My two year old son lost his father.

(We got to know later that Maj Avinash Singh Bhadauria, Kirti Chakra (Posthumous) had already made the supreme sacrifice when the first phone call was made by his then unit, 8 Rashtriya Rifles, to us. He had single handedly killed 04 terrorists. But in the fierce fight that followed he had suffered gunshots and attained martyrdom. He was 29.)

I was 23 and my son was two. My mind went still. Body was numb. Time was passing in a haze, like a glint of darkness in a pale, dull universe.

I did not know how to react when people gave condolences. I could see the faces, feel the movement around me and hear the buzzing sounds, but everything seemed unreal. Nothing made sense. Nothing had a meaning. My life had lost meaning so early in life, all of a sudden.

I felt like finishing myself. But there, I had my innocent baby in my lap. Playing around, giggling and chattering with people, chuckling and laughing, and crying over small matters at times, enjoying all the attention and drama. Full of life, clueless to what had just happened to us, Dhruv brought life back in me. I had to be strong, for him.￼

I decided to join the Army. I was not sure how I will do it. I was very fragile and delicate physically. I was a pampered child of my family. When I met his unit officers at my home, I told them that I had decided to join Army.

Most were pleasantly surprised and extremely supportive. They had seen me as a delicate Army wife, so some of them were sceptical too. They made me aware of the challenges. The selection was tough and the training was tougher.

Life as an officer and the work is not any less tough, they used to say. Frequent movements, remote postings and lots of instability, they said, may cause lots of problems as I had Dhruv, wholly dependent on me.

But I had decided that my son is my biggest strength and I will not let him be a weakness. I was not listening. I had just one thought in my mind. I have to be strong. I have to wear the uniform and hit back at life. For us.

I quit my Post graduation studies in between and applied. I prepared hard and also took coaching for Service Selection Board (SSB) interview. I even had a nose injury due to wrong long jump attempt while being coached for SSB.

In December 2001 (03 months after my husband attained Martyrdom) I was called for a week long interview at SSB, Allahabad.

My son had never stayed without me.I could not have left him for a week. My parents accompanied me to Allahabad. Understandably, they were not allowed inside the SSB centre. My son refused to eat from them. They used to wait outside in a nearby park with him. I used to come out at every break and feed him.

It was tough. My SSB co-candidates were moved to see my difficulties and were all praises for my strength. It was difficult but I was determined.

For a week, I went through the rigorous procedure with determination and focus. Tears only used to roll out at night when I was inside the centre alone and my son was not with me.

When the results were announced, I couldn’t believe my ears. Yes, I had made it! I cried and cried and cried… don’t know for how much time and ran outside in full speed to inform my parents. We all cried together with immense joy and remembered my husband.

Thereafter, I had to spend another week for the medical tests. I could not have asked my parents to continue sitting at the park for another week. So I thought of speaking to my little child and making him understand that he should go with his Nana-nani.

Dhruv did not cry as I had expected. He gave a smile and a flying kiss, then waived me good bye. I controlled my tears. I am still grateful to him for his understanding. We connected through our soul. And he understood my pain and the need for him to stay away from me. He became my strength.

But this one week of staying away from his mother was only a small rehearsal for my little one. It was a precursor to the many long periods in future when his mother would be away, not for days but for months at a stretch.

The beginning was a six months long training in Officers Training Academy (OTA), Chennai starting in March 2002. Life had changed 360 degrees. From sari/suit to uniform and army boots… I never had imagined in wildest of my dreams ever. But I was there. Such is life.

Was Academy training tough..? No, it was very very tough. To put it bluntly, it was beyond my imagination and physical stamina. At times I used to cry in pain, overwhelmed by sadness and silently angry at my destiny, but I couldn’t have given up.

Hard work paid off. On 07 Sep 2002, twenty days short of my husband’s first anniversary of Martyrdom, I was a Comissioned Officer in the Indian Army. Everyone present for the commissioning ceremony had tears when my three year old son pipped the epaulettes on my shoulders.

Life was getting back on track. My husband was awarded Kirti Chakra (Second Highest Peace Time gallantry award) posthumous which I received in uniform from President Shri APJ Abdul Kalaam.

For a young single mother working in a mostly male dominated environment, life had many challenges too. But I faced them with positivity and a smile on my face. I learnt to move on with more courage each passing day.

Life has been full of struggles, but I guess that is the case with everybody. Ours may be a little more intense. There is not one but many low moments and every time it felt the lowest.

After eight years of losing my husband, when I lost my own dad it was the worst. My husband and my dad were two pillars of strength in my life. One gone the other supported me with equal energy and love but both gone the vacuum in my life became inconsolable. This time my mom, brother and son proved to be my support helping me stand up again.

The organisation was very supportive. I received all the monetary and pension benefits from the Army.

However, it’s been 15 years and I have yet not received Ex-gratia fund from UP government and my fight is still on for the same.

Sometimes I wonder when it is so difficult for me – an educated lady with an unparalleled official and administrative exposure as an Officer – to get her dues from the Government, how difficult it must be for a Jawan’s wife with much less education and almost no exposure.

After six years of service I decided to leave Army to give a more settled life to my son. And today I am a mother of 16+ year old boy. We are settled in Delhi. I am working and we are happy as a family. We are each other’s strength.

I have taken a sabbatical this year to support my son with his studies and career goals. He is in class XIIth. As a single parent, if you really ask me my dreams and aspirations in life, I only wish to see my son grow big in life and live up to his father’s name. That’s what I tell him. That’s all that I want and wish for. If he does well my sacrifices of this life does not matter at all. I will thank my stars for being kind on us now.

- Captain Shalini Singh (Retd)

And now Mrs India 2017 and a mother of 16 year old son.

Never lose hope.

This brave mother fought against all odds, overcame weaknesses and became a role model for many. TRUE spirit of Motherhood! Here is her story, in her own words:\n\n“It was year 2001. I was happily married. I had an army officer as a loving husband. Maj Avinash was posted in Kashmir. The separation seemed tumultuous enough. But I did not know at that time, our destiny wasn’t to be an average fauji family.\n\nMarried at the age of Nineteen, I continued my studies after marriage too. We were blessed with a baby boy in 1999. I was a happy fauji wife, blessed mother and busy student. Life was great.\n\nMobiles were not yet common. We used to be connected through phone calls, which were either patched up through many Army Exchanges or made after a long waiting in the only STD booth available for thousands of soldiers.\n\nConsidering the quality of the connection and the rarity of it, each successful conversation was like a battle won. He used to love listening to the meaningless chatter of our son over the phone. Life was a true wonder. And we used to desperately wait for those phone calls.\n\nUntil one morning when a phone call from Kashmir hit us like a bolt of lightning.\n\nEarly morning on 28 Sep 2001 we got a call from his unit that he is seriously injured with gunshot wounds.\n\nWe were shaken. The worst fear of a fauji family had come true. Our universe went dark. Our world came to a standstill. We prayed and prayed and prayed. But it was futile.\n\nSecond call after two hours turned our world upside down. I lost my husband, at the age of 23. My two year old son lost his father.\n\n(We got to know later that Maj Avinash Singh Bhadauria, Kirti Chakra (Posthumous) had already made the supreme sacrifice when the first phone call was made by his then unit, 8 Rashtriya Rifles, to us. He had single handedly killed 04 terrorists. But in the fierce fight that followed he had suffered gunshots and attained martyrdom. He was 29.)\n\nI was 23 and my son was two. My mind went still. Body was numb. Time was passing in a haze, like a glint of darkness in a pale, dull universe.\n\nI did not know how to react when people gave condolences.

“Dear NASA,

My name is Jack Davis and I would like to apply for the planetary protection officer job. I may be nine but I think I would be fit for the job. One of the reasons is my sister says I am an alien. Also, I have seen almost all the space movies and alien movies I can see. I have also seen the show Marvel Agents of Shield and hope to see the movie Men in Black. I am great at vidieo [sic] games.

“Dear Jack,

I hear you are a ‘Guardian of the Galaxy’ and that you’re interested in being a NASA Plantary Protection Officer. That’s great!

Our Plantary Protection Officer position is really cool and is very important work. It’s about protecting Earth from tiny microbes when we bring back samples from the Moon, asteroids and Mars. It’s also about protecting other planets and moons from our germs as we responsibly explore the Solar System.

We are always looking for bright future scientists and engineers to help us, so I hope you will study hard and do well in school. We hope to see you here at NASA one of these days!

Rahul Sinha,8y,What are some short stories where you don't know whether to laugh or cry?,"Our 14 year old dog, Abbey, died last month. The day after she died, my 4 year old daughter Meredith was crying and talking about how much she missed Abbey.


She asked if we could write a letter to God so that when Abbey got to heaven, God would recognize her. I told her that I thought we could, so she dictated these words:

""Dear God,

Will you please take care of my dog? She died yesterday and is with you in heaven. I miss her very much. I am happy that you let me have her as my dog even though she got sick.

I hope you will play with her. She likes to play with balls and to swim. I am sending a picture of her so when you see her, You will know that she is my dog. I really miss her.

Love, Meredith.""



We put the letter in an envelope with a picture of Abbey and Meredith, and addressed it to God/Heaven. We put our return address on it.
Then Meredith pasted several stamps on the front of the envelope because she said it would take lots of stamps to get the letter all the way to heaven. That afternoon she dropped it into the letter box at the post office.
A few days later, she asked if God had gotten the letter yet. I told her that I thought He had.
Yesterday, there was a package wrapped in gold paper on our front porch addressed, ""To Meredith"" in an unfamiliar hand writing. Meredith opened it.
Inside was a book by Mr. Rogers called, ""When a Pet Dies"". Taped to the inside front cover was the letter we had written to God in its opened envelope.
On the opposite page was the picture of Abbey & Meredith and this note:

""Dear Meredith,

Abbey arrived safely in heaven.

Having the picture was a big help. I recognized Abbey right away. Abbey isn't sick anymore. Her spirit is here with me just like it stays in your heart.
Abbey loved being your dog.

Since we don't need our bodies in heaven, I don't have any pockets to keep your picture in, so I am sending it back to you in this little book for you to keep and have something to remember Abbey by.

Thank you for the beautiful letter and thank your mother for helping you write it and sending it to me. What a wonderful mother you have. I picked her especially for you.

I send my blessings every day and remember that I love you very much.
By the way, I'm easy to find, I am wherever there is love.

Love, God""

Eleftherios Tserkezis,Updated 4y,"How were Greeks able to orally pass down the Iliad and Odyssey despite there being nearly 28,000 total lines of metered poetry between them? Without memorizing the words verbatim, they would have had difficulty speaking the poem in meter.","This question did trouble researchers for quite some time. You see, our modern societies differ from the archaic Greek world in numerous ways, and even the most objective and impartial mind cannot always fully grasp the discrepancy and walk in the shoes (or sandals) of people who lived 3,000 or 2,500 years ago.

A major difference between the two worlds is the level of literacy. That doesn’t have to do only with the number of people who knew how to read and write, but goes even deeper. The ancient Greek society was an oral one in general. Everything, including written texts, existed to be read aloud. Wealthy Classical-age Athenians had slaves called anagnōstai ‘readers’ read to them aloud (fun fact: Plato used to teasingly call Aristotle anagnōstēs, because the latter often stayed at home to read by himself instead of going to the Academy). It’s believed that this changed only during the Roman-Byzantine era, when silent reading became prevalent.

In the early 20th c., a young American Homerist named Milman Parry thought of studying actual bards or rhapsodes in an attempt to better understand how the Homeric epics were passed down before their official recording, which came later. To do so, Parry travelled to Yugoslavia, where literacy rates were low, and small oral cultures still existed, almost detached from the so-called modern world. Parry found that those bards were capable of reproducing thousand-verse long poems.

Above: Milman Parry (right) in Yugoslavia.

Parry’s study and the scholarly tradition it created also answers what seems to trouble the OP the most. You see, for a modern literate person, poetry seems more difficult than prose, right? After all, you have to think about the meter, the rhyme etc., while in prose you simply write anything you want.

Well, for pre-modern oral communities, it seems that the opposite was the case. Poetry is more primitive than prose, at least as far as literature is concerned, because it makes memorization and repetitiveness simpler. Rhythmic schemes offer the bard a strong frame which he simply has to fill in and make it easier for him to recall what remains to be said at any given time.

Closely connected with this trait of poetry is the matter of formulas, also studied by Milman Parry in the context of oral composition and transmittance. The Homeric epics are full of formulas, standard phrases that occupy specific places in verses (usually half-a-verse each) because of their metric pattern. Formulas can also be adapted so that various names can fit in them.

One example will suffice, I think. One of the most commonly used formulaic verses in both the Iliad and the Odyssey is ‘Answering to x, y said.’ Just see how many different forms it can take.

First part—note that all four versions follow exactly the same metric pattern.
Ton d’ apameibomenos prosephē…: Both x and y are male.
Tēn d’ apameibomenos prosephē…: X is female, but y is male.
Ton d’ apameibomenē prosephē…: X is male, but y is female.
Tēn d’ apameibomenē prosephē…: Both x and y are female.
Second part.
…nephelēgereta Zeus: …Zeus, the cloud-gatherer.
…polumētis Odusseus: …Odysseus of many devices.

Darragh Groeger,5y,Which was J.R.R. Tolkien's single best line of writing?,"You asked for a single line, and I will quote a passage but only to put a single line into its proper context.

The line itself is the very last line in the following passage, and to this day I cannot read it without the hairs on the back of my neck standing up.

It ends the chapter, and comes as both as stirring war cry, and a collective sigh of relief.

Succinct, simple, beautiful:

In rode the Lord of the Nazgûl. A great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of the Nazgûl, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.

All save one.

There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dínen.

""You cannot enter here,"" said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. ""Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your Master. Go!""

The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.

""Old fool!"" he said. ""Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!"" And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.

And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of war nor of wizardry, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.

And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns, in dark Mindolluin's sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the north wildly blowing.

Rohan had come at last.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9tjobifxyh08v21p', 'title': ""Which was J.R.R.

From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.\n\n""Old fool!"" he said. ""Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!"" And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.\n\nAnd in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of war nor of wizardry, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.\n\nAnd as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns, in dark Mindolluin\'s sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the north wildly blowing.\n\nRohan had come at last.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9998

Shubham KP,1y,What book are you reading now?,"My sister was struggling to get a job.

According to me, every girl should be independent. Every girl needs to earn their own money.

Girls don’t need to bear any domestic abuse just because she’s not earning. Girls should have a job so that they don’t become a burden to anyone at any point in life.

I told my father, strictly, that didi is not getting married unless she gets a job. Thankfully, this year she cleared a government exam and now she’s a Rural Agriculture Extention Officer. This is just the beginning for her, I hope, and she gets more in her life.

At that time, I came across a beautiful strong woman from Quora. I messaged her, personally, and thanked her as she was brave enough to share her story to motivate others.

I kept pushing my sister because of her. I wanted her to become as strong as that Quoran.

The moment didi’s results were out, I was so thankful to that Quoran. Because, like didi, she’s also like my elder sister. I wanted to dedicate an answer to her for a long time. But, I guess, this is the right time. She’s a published author now and I can’t be happier for her.

Manager asked him how is his business to which he replied it's going on superb and he could amass good amount in short period.

Manager thought of his deposit target for march and asked what is he doing with the money earned. He replied that he kept it in his house in locked box.

Sharmila Thaj,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"He Scored only an average mark of 750 in his 12th Board Exam. But he was awarded as a ‘Young Scientist’ by NASA! (These Headings in the News paper attracts me towards the best read today)

World’s lightest and smallest Satellite.

Mohammed Rifath Sharukh, a 17 year old young scientist made the World’s Lightest and Smallest Satellite!
Pallapatti born, Karur district; Tamilnadu.
NASA organised a competition. Over 8000 students from 57 countries participated. He was the only Indian who was selected among the 80 final selections.

About his Satellite:

He named the Satellite ‘ KALAM SAT’ in memory of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul kalam.
It weighs only 64 grams.(0.1 kg and 3.8 cm in size)
“Space Kidz India” supported him.
It was a complete Indian made Satellite.
Uses:
It will be used to detect the radiation in Space, and the changes in the atmosphere.
It will stay only 240 minutes in space, then it will automatically fall in to the specified ocean. Finally, it will be taken out for research.
Launch:
On June 22nd, 2017 it will be launched through the SRK Rocket.
If they launch successfully, then it will be used for Agriculture and Weather Monitoring.
I wondered when I saw Mohammed Sharukh’s 12th Board Exam Mark Details:
In Mathematics: 92/200.
In Physics: 89/200(Practical Mark: 50)

(For the rest, he wrote only for 39 marks in theory! (Less than my marks!))

He is one of the inspirations to the Students, who scored average marks in their Board Exams.
For Parents: Marks don’t determine your Children, who they are. Every Child is born with talents.

This will be the first time Indian student’s experiment will be flown by NASA.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,4y,What is the most life changing book you've ever read?,"I don’t write in “self improvement” topic, but there is a first for everything. Two of my favorite books that I read together are: “How to get whatever you want” and “Think and Grow Rich”. I read these as a 17 year old and they were phenomenal. I tried to apply a lot of it during that time and had quite a bit of fortune implementing them. How to Get Whatever You Want
 and Think and Grow Rich
.

The key concepts like “just show up” and “just ask” —are so simple and yet so powerful.

I will give you examples of how I used it.

I was in my second year of college when we had the annual programming contest to select the top team to go to the prestigious ACM ICPC. I was preparing for the contest since the time I joined college. I led a team that was short of 1 person [he had to leave another contest in the last minute] and we tied up for the top slot. The other team were one year senior to us and the college gave them the slot to go to the Asia regionals in IIT Kanpur. I didn’t like the idea of seniority just used to break the tie.

I would have given up if not for that crazy book above. I just explored for sometime the other alternatives in the days before social media and found an Asia regionals happened in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I just found out the organiser’s number and called him out of the blue [when it cost over $1/min for the international call from a public booth and I had very little money]. I convinced him to take our team from India. I went through all the rules and he could not find any hole in my argument. He was more amused by the strange request from a teenager from abroad and okayed my proposal.

And then came the task of convincing my teammates that Bangladesh was a safe country to go to. We had a trip of our lifetimes taking a 3.5 day travel one way from the southern part of India to Bangladesh over 2 trains and a bus. It was an amazing experience interacting with everyone there and although we could not make it to the world finals we got home with a honorable mention for being in the top 10%. I should have tried the following 2 years too, but somehow never participated [and of course I regret that now for not showing up].

From sitting in a small town in the middle of nowhere in a day without all the information revolution to getting there was a big win for me.

Two months later I did an even crazier thing. I was in New Delhi attending a college competition. I got a strange idea to walk up to the Rashtrapati Bhavan [President’s palace] to get a meeting with the President of the largest democracy. In an another time I would not have done that, but I was crazy in the power of asking. It could not harm, right?

I just showed up and asked. The secretary thought it was funny that a teenager was walking up to get an appointment with the President of India. She still passed up my request to President’s PA. A day later my relative got the call that the President wanted to talk to me. He was genuinely curious about a teenager who came all the way from the southern part of India and had gumption to write to him.

That led to the greatest day in my life: Why is Abdul Kalam widely loved and respected by everyone? — where I got a 40 minute one-on-one with the President and got another such meeting just 6 months later.

A year later I was applying for grad school. I got an admission, but without a scholarship. I called up a professor and explained the situation. He not only gave the scholarship that enabled me to go to gradschool, but someone who is still in touch with me after so many year.

I applied the same principles to a lot of smaller successes too — from getting airline seats upgraded to getting into contests. Once I was in Linuxcon where there was a Linux quiz & raffle. I answered the quiz and they asked us to come for a raffle in the afternoon. I usually don’t go for this and thought there will be a big crowd. When I showed up there was just 1 other guy and I had a 50% chance of winning. And winning I did of a good laptop that I immediately sold on eBay. All I had to do was just show up. Another time I saw a startup competition going on. I was in for an another event and asked if I could pitch. The qualifiers were already over a long time ago, but they still let me pitch in the finals. I strangely won the pitch prize for someone who knew about the contest only 30 min before.

After I graduated from college, I failed to use many of the principles as I grew to think that “self improvement” stuff is just icky. That means that I also went back to my old ways of being too shy to ask for stuff and thus went on a period of plateau with no major success in life. Now putting those principles back to motion. If you aim for the right thing, be reasonable, persistent and show up everytime you could very likely get that thing.

We often think of success as a cut throat race where you race against thousands. Often what I found was success was a race where only a handful even show up — others are either lazy, unaware or too shy to even ask to get in. Winning often happen in contests that most don’t even know exists.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3wfz81h47gxmcju6', 'title': ""What is the most life changing book you've ever read?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9011, 'ai': 0.0989}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I don’t write in “self improvement” topic, but there is a first for everything.

Chris O'Leary,3y,What is the last book you tried to read that was so bad you just could not finish it?,"That would be “Inferno” by Dan Brown.

Like most people, I got turned on to Dan Brown because of The DaVinci Code and followed back around to read Angels and Demons. When it came out, I read the Lost Symbol too.

I enjoyed the first two as good light reading. The third just started stretching the premise of a hero symbologist a little too far for my taste, but it wasn’t so bad that I didn’t finish it.

When Inferno came out, I bought it, hoping it would get back to the quality of at least Angels and Demons.

As the premise started to unfold, I tried to keep with it, but, my brow a bit furrowed, I turned my head to Dr. Scott, my wife, and asked for clarification…

“Isn’t Plague Bacterial” Can’t it be cured with antibiotics?”

“Of course,” she replied.

I tossed the book aside and never picked it up again.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ek4d8rh2vw3i6btp', 'title': 'What is the last book you tried to read that was so bad you just could not finish it?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'That would be “Inferno” by Dan Brown.\n\nLike most people, I got turned on to Dan Brown because of The DaVinci Code and followed back around to read Angels and Demons.

Mayur Tasre,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Do you know who the man is in the photo below?

By his appearance, you must be thinking that he might be a boy from lower middle class family, working in a bakery to earn money and support his family.

But no, that's not the truth.

He is Dhravya Dholakia[1], son of a billionaire Savji Dholakia.[2]

Surat diamond magnate Savji Dholakia caught the world’s attention two years ago when he rewarded 1200 employees with apartments and cars as Diwali bonus.[3]

For teaching his son how challenging life is, he decided to ask his son Dhravya Dholakia to go to an unfamiliar place and earn livelihood through odd work.

Dhravya Dholakia(21) who is studying Business management in US, came to India on summer holidays to enjoy with family.

Dhravya Dholakia accepted his father's challenge and left for Kochi with Rs 7000, a pair of clothes and nothing else.

Condition of his challenge

First Dharvya needed to find some work but wherever he joins, he should not stay there for more than a week.
He should not use his father’s identity
He should not use those Rs 7000 until an emergency.

Dhravya accepted the challenge and went to Kochi where Hindi would not help him.

Difficulties he faced

For 5 days, Dhravya did not have any proper place to stay nor did he have any job. He was rejected from 60 places, he lied that he was from a very poor family and wanted to earn money to help his family. At last he got a job in a bakery. He kept switching jobs. Do you know how much he earned? He earned Rs 4000.

Dhravya Dholakia said

I never worried about money and here I was struggling to get a one time meal worth Rs 40 and I needed another Rs 250 per day to stay in a lodge.

What do you think? Isn't that great? Isn't it a good lesson for life?

Every father (whether from rich or middle class family) should do this experiment with his son/daughter to teach them true values of life.

Thanks

Abhigyan Biswas,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Do you know this girl?

She is Ummul Kher, AIR 420 , UPSC exams.

She has been suffering from fragile bone disorder from her birth which has made her disabled.

Being a good student she always wanted to study despite her odds. For this she needed a constant support system. And for such person who it can be better than her parents.

But unfortunately she wasn't lucky. Her parents who lived in the slums of Old Delhi didn't want to spend on her education after class 8, but she was determined to study further.

She was given two options .. Either listen to her parents or leave the house at the age of 12.

She chose the 2nd option .

Leaving everything behind, she had to leave her home and start a new life in a jhopparpatti (slum type house) without any support. To fund her school fees she used to take tuitions from 3 pm to 11 pm and earn around 50–100 rupees from the slum children. She passed her 12th with an excellent 91%.

After that she joined Gargi college and continued to fund her education through tuitions and the prize money she won through college debates.

In 2012, she met a small accident and was confined to a wheelchair for a year due to her bone disorder.

After graduation , she cracked the entrance exams of JNU for Masters of International studies. She was getting a scholarship of Rs 25000 which meant she didn't have to take tuitions. And after so much hardwork she cleared her UPSC exams under disability quota.

Despite all these sufferings she didn't have any complaint against her parents and she believed that it was the situation which forced them to take this decision..

While many of us who aren't disabled get exhausted after some hardwork and there is this girl who defied all odds and made us believe in determination and hardwork.

Where there is a will there is a way…

Respects to you ma'am...

Cheers!!!

Dinesh Nagar,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"While scrolling my news feed i saw Gautam Gambhir’s post

Zohra is the daughter of the late Abdul Rashid, assistant sub-inspector, Jammu and Kashmir Police, who was martyred last month

Photographs of his young daughter sobbing at her father's funeral broke hearts all over the country

Gambhir said he would support Zohra's education so she can ‘live her dreams’

This is not the first time Gautam Gambhir is doing such acts his foundation GGF is also running one Community Kitchen in West patel Nagar Delhi

I always Respect Gautam Gambhir for his Acts as he's helping society and motivating others to help the needy ones.

EDIT 1: I just saw one more post by Gautam Gambhir while i was writing this Answer

Edit 2 : I saw many comments that why he’s showing off, why he’s not doing charity quietly, why there’s need of telling everyone and media that he’s doing charity,

so listen its upto you how you’re looking at this matter, for me he is inspiring others to help like if i can help why can’t you think if this news reaches 10 lakh people maybe just 1 people out there get inspired by his Act and start helping someone else in need.

Help someone and start shouting start telling everyone that you helped someone in need so out of hundreds even if 1 start folllowing you this is going to be the real Charity because now there are 4 helping hands and i think 4 > 2","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wsta9zim2b1fkj7e', 'title': 'What is the best thing you read today?', 'score': {'original': 0.9973, 'ai': 0.0027}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""While scrolling my news feed i saw Gautam Gambhir’s post\n\nZohra is the daughter of the late Abdul Rashid, assistant sub-inspector, Jammu and Kashmir Police, who was martyred last month\n\nPhotographs of his young daughter sobbing at her father's funeral broke hearts all over the country\n\nGambhir said he would support Zohra's education so she can ‘live her dreams’\n\nThis is not the first time Gautam Gambhir is doing such acts his foundation GGF is also running one Community Kitchen in West patel Nagar Delhi\n\nI always Respect Gautam Gambhir for his Acts as he's helping society and motivating others to help the needy ones.\n\nEDIT 1: I just saw one more post by Gautam Gambhir while i was writing this Answer\n\nEdit 2 : I saw many comments that why he’s showing off, why he’s not doing charity quietly, why there’s need of telling everyone and media that he’s doing charity,\n\nso listen its upto you how you’re looking at this matter, for me he is inspiring others to help like if i can help why can’t you think if this news reaches 10 lakh people maybe just 1 people out there get inspired by his Act and start helping someone else in need.\n\nHelp someone and start shouting start telling everyone that you helped someone in need so out of hundreds even if 1 start folllowing you this is going to be the real Charity because now there are 4 helping hands and i think 4 > 2"", 'result': {'fake': 0.0042, 'real': 0.9958}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1990660, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""While scrolling my news feed i saw Gautam Gambhir’s post\n\nZohra is the daughter of the late Abdul Rashid, assistant sub-inspector, Jammu and Kashmir Police, who was martyred last month\n\nPhotographs of his young daughter sobbing at her father's funeral broke hearts all over the country\n\nGambhir said he would support Zohra's education so she can ‘live her dreams’\n\nThis is not the first time Gautam Gambhir is doing such acts his foundation GGF is also running one Community Kitchen in West patel Nagar Delhi\n\nI always Respect Gautam Gambhir for his Acts as he's helping society and motivating others to help the needy ones.\n\nEDIT 1: I just saw one more post by Gautam Gambhir while i was writing this Answer\n\nEdit 2 : I saw many comments that why he’s showing off, why he’s not doing charity quietly, why there’s need of telling everyone and media that he’s doing charity,\n\nso listen its upto you how you’re looking at this matter, for me he is inspiring others to help like if i can help why can’t you think if this news reaches 10 lakh people maybe just 1 people out there get inspired by his Act and start helping someone else in need.\n\nHelp someone and start shouting start telling everyone that you helped someone in need so out of hundreds even if 1 start folllowing you this is going to be the real Charity because now there are 4 helping hands and i think 4 > 2"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9973
Roland Bartetzko,2y,Why do people go to poetry readings?,"If I say that I'm not fond of poetry, it's an understatement. I even wrote an anti-poetry answer here (“poetry is dead!”). Nevertheless, I recently went to my first poetry reading.

It was a rather small event (about 30 people in the backyard of a local pub). With poetry, you clearly can’t attract the masses. While our poetess, a very smart and talented young woman, was reciting from her work, I took a good look at the people around me.

Our young poetess, Uresa Ahmeti, reading from her work.

Here are my thought on why I think they were gathered there:

Friends and family of the poet(s). More than half of the people knew the artist. Most of them were her friends from high school and university, the rest family. I know that because she mentioned them all by name.
Other poets. Unlike people like me who are into prose, poets seem to be less jealous of each other. Maybe it's because they are all suffering from the same non-recognition of their efforts.
People who work in the pub. Our lovely pub manager was there and one of her staff members.
Guests of the pub. People like me and my buddies. I saw this quite often: when artists put their venue in a semi-public place, you get a crossover public. The beer-drinkers listen to the poetry while the poetry lovers have a beer.
People who helped the poet or worked with them (patrons, publishers, editors, translators, etc.).
Often, you also have some journalists at these events but not in this case.

Last but not least:

People who like poetry. Yes, these folks do exist! There was an actress sitting right next to me who has worked for the same TV production company I have worked for. I know that she loves poetry, after the recital, I had a chat with her about it.

It must be said that for poetry, having the author recite their own poems really makes a big difference in how you perceive their work. It’s also interesting to learn how the poems were created, especially how the author felt when she wrote them down. With prose, it doesn’t matter that much.

Ankesh Bhati,4y,What interesting thing did you read today?,"I read this on Telegram -

A multi millionaire was travelling in his car. On the way, he was listening to a Satsang of a certain religious Saint.

The Saint was preaching that, everyone in the world is after money only. But they are ignorant that they cannot take their money with them after their death. But Still they are after money only and do whatever way possible to earn more and more money

The millionaire got annoyed of this statement.

He said to himself that since the Saint has no money with him, he is giving a Lecture like this.

The next day, the millionaire called all his employees and advised them to give him an idea so that he can take all his wealth alongwith him after his death. Every one thought that their boss has gone mad and tried to avoid him.

Days passed by.

Suddenly one day a stranger approached the millionaire and informed him that he had heard about his query & he has one brilliant idea.

The millionaire could not believe his ears as everyone has declared him ""Mad"".

The millionaire was very eager to hear his idea.

The stranger first asked him whether he had travelled abroad?

The millionaire said that he had visited many countries.

Then the stranger asked him what he had done with money before he went to USA?

The millionaire said that he had converted the Indian rupees into American dollars and went to USA.

The stranger again asked him, what he had done when he went to UK ?

The millionaire replied that he had converted Indian rupees into Pounds Sterling and went to England.

The stranger asked him why he did all this?

The millionaire laughed and told the stranger that our Indian rupees have no value in USA and in England.

The stranger replied that you are very correct and continued.

Mr. Millionaire, now you want to go to the Heaven after your death, correct?

Well, in the Heaven, the name of the currency is “Punnya” So you convert your entire Indian rupees into the currency of Punnya so that you can spend very happily there after your death.

The rich man was convinced and very happy to hear his idea and started doing Dharma (charity - helping the needy without expecting anything in return.)

Yes you read that right.

Can you imagine the President of India, who is also the 1st Citizen of the country, being stopped by a traffic cop?

But it just happened on 19th June,2017 in Bengaluru.

A traffic PSI named Shri. Nijilingappa who was on duty to maintain traffic in Bengaluru due to President Pranab Mukherjee’s presence in the city suddenly stopped the pool of cars in the President’s troop.

The reason?

Well there was an ambulance who needed to be given a way in the crossing.

Shri. Nijilingappa felt that the life of a person in the Ambulance was more important than the President of the Country. So he immediately contacted his seniors to seek their permission. They all agreed and finally the Ambulance was given a way before the President.

This daring act of Shri. Nijilingappa was widely applauded all across the country and even the IPS Association of India couldn’t stop praising.

Well that was the best thing I just read today.

Zakary Stahlsmith,Updated 3y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Today I read something so powerful that it makes me want to be a better man.

I’ve copied it below but honestly, before you read it, you should know that it’s truly heartbreaking. Not in a way that will hurt you, but it’s so brutally honest I think this will remind you, like it did for me, of why we are on this rock to begin with.

Today, I read a letter from the late Richard Feynman to his dead wife. If you aren’t aware of who Richard Feynman is, he was a Nobel Prize winner and one of the world’s best-known and most influential physicists. To me, he was just an incredibly warm and passionate human being who gave so much love to the world that it’s still here after he left.

I read that in June of 1945, Richard’s wife and high-school sweetheart, Arline, passed away after succumbing to tuberculosis. She was 25-years-old. 16 months later, in October of 1946, Richard wrote his late wife a heartbreaking love letter and sealed it in an envelope. It remained unopened until after his death in 1988.

(Source: The Letters of Note book - reproduced with permission of Richard Feynman's Estate.)

October 17, 1946

D’Arline,

I adore you, sweetheart!

I know how much you like to hear that — but I don't only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.

It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you'll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.

But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.

I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can't I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the ""idea-woman"" and general instigator of all our wild adventures.

When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.

I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don't want to be in my way. I'll bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can't help it, darling, nor can I — I don't understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don't want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.

My darling wife, I do adore you!

I love my wife. My wife is dead.

Rich.

P.S. : Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don't know your new address.

If you’ve watched or listened to any of Richard Feynman’s work, I know you read this with his quirky voice in your head. And as you know, imagining anything coming from this man other than passion, just overwhelming love and heart, is impossible.

So there you have it, that was the best thing I read today. I hope it moved you like it did me.

“I am from the village of Parra in Goa, hence we are called Parrikars. My village is famous for its watermelons. When I was a child, the farmers would organise a watermelon-eating contest at the end of the harvest season in May. All the kids would be invited to eat as many watermelons as they wanted. Years later, I went to IIT Mumbai to study engineering. I went back to my village after 6.5 years. I went to the market looking for watermelons. They were all gone. The ones that were there were so small. I went to see the farmer who hosted the watermelon-eating contest. His son had taken over. He would host the contest but there was a difference. When the older farmer gave us watermelons to eat he would ask us to spit out the seeds into a bowl. We were told not to bite into the seeds. He was collecting the seeds for his next crop. We were unpaid child labourers, actually. He kept his best watermelons for the contest and he got the best seeds which would yield even bigger watermelons the next year. His son, when he took over, realized that the larger watermelons would fetch more money in the market so he sold the larger ones and kept the smaller ones for the contest. The next year, the watermelons were smaller, the year later even small. In watermelons the generation is one year. In seven years, Parra’s best watermelons were finished. In humans, generations change after 25 years. It will take us 200 years to figure what we were doing wrong while educating our children.’’

When the older farmer gave us watermelons to eat he would ask us to spit out the seeds into a bowl. We were told not to bite into the seeds. He was collecting the seeds for his next crop. We were unpaid child labourers, actually. He kept his best watermelons for the contest and he got the best seeds which would yield even bigger watermelons the next year. His son, when he took over, realized that the larger watermelons would fetch more money in the market so he sold the larger ones and kept the smaller ones for the contest. The next year, the watermelons were smaller, the year later even small. In watermelons the generation is one year. In seven years, Parra’s best watermelons were finished. In humans, generations change after 25 years. It will take us 200 years to figure what we were doing wrong while educating our children.’’\n\nSource : SCAEC Editorial.\n\nThe Story of Watermelons: Manohar Parrikar\n\nYoutube - Video\n\nEdit 1: R.I.P.

Jean Willow,Updated 4y,What’s the worst dystopian future book you’ve read?,"Oh so many.

Matched

The world where sixteen year olds are matched with their perfect partner of opposite gender and everything is decided by the Evil Government. Cassie, the completely boring protagonist with the normal family of Mother, Father, and little sister (or was it brother? I can’t even remember) is matched; shocker of all shocks — with her best friend. This is very rare, as normally the person you're matched with doesn’t even live in your city. So she should be happy, matched up with this boy she both knows and likes. Buutttttt….

She also sees another boy on her Match list. Evil Government insists it’s a mistake; the boy isn’t even matched with anyone because he’s a rebel and poor and mysterious. But she decides to fall in love with him anyway. Also she finds out the government is evil: it does stuff like poison her beloved grandfather, kill poor people, and wipe memories. The boy shows her this, naturally. The story ends with Evil Government finding out, the boy being dragged away, and her deciding to run away and live with him.

No, this is not a teenage girl’s crappy Wattpad dystopian story. It was written by a grown adult and it made lots of money, mainly because of its pretty cover.

But that’s great compared to

This is a novel where some idiot decided to outlaw love. I really don't have to explain the rest to you. Two hormonal teens end up falling in love before they can get the dreaded surgery that removes love. Despite love being illegal they don’t get caught until the end of the book, despite constantly making out and doing practically everything but sex. Then the boy gets dragged away to prison while the girl gets the surgery. Honestly that was really an amazing ending, except the rest of the books apparently added a love triangle and the girl being immune to the surgery. They should have just kept the downer ending.

A dystopian where everything is based on castes. The main character is so poor, but still can afford her own room and popcorn for the TV. Instead of the Hunger Games, we have the Selection, where random girls are selected to live at the palace, wear fancy clothes, eat rich food, and hope the prince decides to marry them. How terrible this thing is is beyond me. It’s not even mandatory. The worst evils seem to be the rebels attacking the dystopian nation.

Anyway, in the story the main character is caught between the prince, who decides he loves her whining about how evil is country is, and her poor boyfriend who throws a fit when she tries to help out with money. *eyeroll*

I don't know how many times I've read this novel. It was introduced to me by a girl. We’ll probably never talk to each other, again, yet I'm so grateful to her.

This novel is not for everyone.

I still remember when I first finished it— I thought someone has slumped me into a big, dark void. I couldn't get out of it for days. Everything around me felt so colourless. And I no longer believed in human relationships.

For me, nothing comes close to this novel. It's the greatest melancholy. A craft that can never be repeated.

I've slept with this novel for numerous nights. I kept it beside my cushion. And I moved my fingers on it, gingerly, to admire the magical flow of the words inside.

She knew that my memories of her would fade. Which is precisely why she begged me never to forget her, to remember that she existed.

The thought fills me with almost unbearable sorrow. Because Naoko never loved me.

Niks González,Updated 3y,What is the most horrible children's book ever written?,"I was in a children's camp four years ago. My fellow volunteers and I were teaching the children to read and encouraging them to write their own short stories. Someone donated a book My Beautiful Mommy it was written by a plastic surgeon, Dr. Michael Salzhauer and was published in 2008.

The book tells the story of a little girl whose mother gets a tummy tuck, breast implants and nose job and comes complete with cartoon-style illustrations. There's nothing wrong with plastic surgery, but in a children’s book? That’s inappropriate.

I couldn't imagine if my future six-year-old daughter says to me, “Mum, I’ve read a book about her mum getting plastic surgery. You should get a tummy tuck and breast implants too because your breasts are saggy.”

Me: “You don't think mum’s beautiful?”

My daughter: “You’ll be more beautiful when you have plastic surgery. Dad will love you more.”

Me: “Yes, mum’s breasts are saggy so I could provide you milk when you were a baby.” I would cry.

""That’s sweet of you to say, my love, but Mommy is also having her tummy made smaller. You see, as I got older, my body stretched and I couldn't fit into my clothes any more. Dr. Michael is going to help fix that and make me feel better.""

When it comes to her nose job, the mother warns her daughter that she will look different when the bandages come off.

The little girl asks: ""Why are you going to look different?""

The mother responds: ""Not just different, my dear - prettier!""

The book implies one thing: The person is not happy with her body. By making plastic surgery sound like a perfectly natural and fascinating process, it warps a child's view of their own body. There’s already so much pressure on girls in their adolescent years to achieve that perfect, skinny body that all magazine models are expected to have.

I hid the book away from the reading area and showed it the next day to our cluster leader. It’s horrible and revolting to teach the young children to alter their body parts because it will make them look prettier. You don't need surgery. Live with what you've got and thereby teach your kids to do the same.

And this is how the doctor was illustrated in the book:

Kanchan Singh,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Two Australians came to India to find a girl with a PINK bracelet.

Chris Bray and his wife Jess visited India with one very specific mission in mind- to locate a girl and her family. Smith showed Chris a photo he had taken from a train.

The photo was of a homeless family living under the bridge and included a little girl who wasn't wearing anything but a PINK bracelet.

Smith wanted to help the family to get accommodation and perhaps get the girl an education. Smith wanted Chris and Jess to go to vadodara where the photo was taken and find the family to help them out.

Chris and Jess flew to India- their adventure began in Vadodara.

With the help of the receptionist who acted as a hindi/english translator and local people they managed to find the family.

And finally the girl!

The girl's name is Divya. The family had been living under the bridge for 12 years. To Chris they seemed the perfect family: able and willing to work and not averse to help. They set up a bank account in Divya's name so that Smith could transfer money into account every month. A formal contract was linked to the account specifying what the funds could be used for: rent and education. A clause was added specifying that the fund would be stopped if Divya stopped attending school.

After their lovely goodwill adventure, Chris and Jess headed back to the airport.

Edit: Mr. Smith , full name Dick Smith is an Australian entrepreneur and aviator who is also known in Australia for taking the solo helicopter flight around the world in 1983. He is the one who spotted the girl near the railway track under the Shastri bridge. He went back to Australia and showed the picture to Jess and Chris who are travel photographers.

Franklin Veaux,2y,Why does transposing Stephen King's works to the cinema almost always work?,"Ah HA ha ha ha. Sit down, young Padawan, and let me tell you a story.

It’s a story of a movie called Maximum Overdrive.

I went to see this movie with my friends Tim and Henry in the theater, and we thought it was awesome. Funniest so-bad-it’s-good spoof of horror movie tropes we’d ever seen. I mean, there’s a scene where a guy is attacked by a possessed electric carving knife, and he doesn’t think to step back out of reach of its power cord!

We were rolling with laughter. We thought this was the funniest movie since Killer Klowns from Outer Space.

And then…and then…

About halfway through the movie, the horrifying but unavoidable realization dawned. Henry and I looked at each other, and he said, “I don’t think this movie is supposed to be funny, is it?”

“No,” I said, “I think this is trying to be serious.”

Stephen is one of the sharpest, kindest people I know. For that matter so was Bob Bloch (who wrote Psycho).

The only person who could assume that you have to be deranged in order to write works that person finds uncomfortable, is someone who has no imagination. Not even enough imagination to be able to imagine that someone else can write dark subjects without being, himself, a seething mass of horror.

Was Agatha Christie a serial killer? Does Stephanie Meyer harbor vampires in her spare bedroom? Do I secretly have a herd of talking white horses on my property?

Brian Overland,Updated 2y,Why did William Shakespeare make use of archaic English in literature?,"Are you serious or just telling a joke? Here is a true (?) story that made me laugh like crazy, that reminds me of your question….

There once was a man who went to see a performance of “Hamlet” and said, “I don’t see what the big fuss is. All Shakespeare did was string together a bunch of great quotations.”

And anyone who KNOWS the play finds that immensely funny; others will miss the humor. The humorous point, in case you miss it, is that almost none of those “great quotations” were great quotations before Shakespeare wrote them!!!! And the fact he was able to write a play full of what BECAME great quotations, wins him the title of Greatest Writer Who Ever Lived.

And that's what the “fuss” is all about. In part.

So we have a similar question here. As many answers have already said, nothing Shakespeare wrote (other than the occasional Latin quotation) was “archaic” when he wrote it…. and in fact Shakespeare was super keen on getting butts into seats. He wrote for the masses, he wrote to entertain. Were he alive today, he’d probably be writing the most current and “edgy” material.

Along a similar line, we might come up with other goofy questions such as:

Why did Caesar speak Latin?

Why did Jesus give sermons on the side of a mountain and not on television?

Why did Alexander the Great use swords, shields, and horses?

Why did Leonardo (da Vinci) paint with oil paint?

Why did Tolstoy write “War and Peace” in Russian?

Why did George Washington have wooden teeth, instead of nice crowns and implants?

I hope you’re getting the picture.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/98h7m0o6wyira5ng', 'title': 'Why did William Shakespeare make use of archaic English in literature?', 'score': {'original': 0.9971, 'ai': 0.0029}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Are you serious or just telling a joke?
