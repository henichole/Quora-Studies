Ishtmeet Singh,Updated 4y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"This may change your life, or a part of it, for sure.

You must know this man, right?

For those who don’t know, this gentleman is Cristiano Ronaldo, born in Portugal, is one of the most popular and talented players in Football history.

One fine day, Cristiano Ronaldo dressed up as a homeless man, with moustache and beard - went out in Madrid City to show some Football skills anonymously.

His appearance? This is how he was looking in that make-up -

No one could’ve imagined Cristiano Ronaldo behind that make up. He picks up his football, ties his (borrowed) dog to a chair and starts doing kick-ups. The disguise works.

No-one gives him a second glance. To everyone else in the Plaza, he just looks like a homeless guy trying to earn a few euros from the locals.

Occasionally, passers-by will stop to watch the homeless man's impressive football skills, especially when he decides to replicate Ronaldo's trade-mark step-overs.

Several hours pass before the heart-warming pay-off finally happens. A kid decides to play with him and the two take part in a bit of one-on-one.

After few moments, Ronaldo gives him a hug (still dressed as a tramp), picks up the ball and signs it.

The little boy looks confused, wondering why this man has signed the football - that is until Ronaldo begins to peel off the disguise, leaving his new best friend in open-mouthed wonder and on the verge of (happy) tears.

And, no doubt, everyone else was shocked.

There’s a lesson :

No one gives a fuck to your football skills, unless you're Ronaldo.

What should you learn from this?

No one in this world cares who you are, what you are doing, and what you’re going to do unless you’re someone very famous.

If you’ve an aim in life, don’t be worried about - what will he/she think about it? If you have a doubt, raise your hand and ask your professor/teacher about it, because at the end, no one cares if you ask or you choose to remain silent. If you’re thinking about a startup, consider making it a reality without a thought of - what will he/she think if it fails.

There are 7.8 billion people in this world, you can’t expect everyone to appreciate what you’re doing. Instead, you need to appreciate what you’re doing, and continue doing it.

I’ve started applying this formula in my life, and I’ve become a very strong person, than I was an year ago.

This might be the secret mantra of success.

Rafael Eliassen,Updated 3y,What are some financial tips that everyone should know?,"Live below your means. I used to eat cheap Ramen and Tuna fish to invest the saved money in my business. Now, I have a six-figure business. You must deprive yourself of money early, so you can invest your way to wealth.
Build a machine. An average millionaire has 7-income streams. You can’t become wealthy by your job or business alone. You need to create systems of passive income where you put invest $10k in ads and get $100k back.
Good debt vs Bad debt. Bad debt is that loses you money like credit card or high-interest loans. Good debt is that makes you more money than the interest you pay. Example: If you buy a property on debt and have the rental income higher than your loan payments.
Save 10% every month. People who don’t have money saved, are one disaster away from a debt spiral. They can lose their job or get an accidental medical bill and resort to high-interest debt. Don’t be those people’.
Invest money in you. People think they are smart to not buy a (valid) course but it’s the dumbest decision. The only place where you must spend freely is self-improvement. Because without it, your income won't increase.
Planned purchases. You can buy yourself nice things but the real enemy is impulse purchases. You order it only to find out you don’t need it that much. That’s why when you want something, the more planned the better.
Friends with savings. Don’t throw your money away with people who spend at expensive restaurants or on useless wants. You need to have friends who have the same economic-values as you do.

Kaustav Dey,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"I really don’t remember where I heard this about, but this is truly an awesome hack that I have known and employ.

Life will always have competitions. A life without competitions is actually quite boring. As you all probably know, you cannot always win . Life isn’t that optimistic and fair.

Most of the time, our competitor is one who enjoys our defeat more than the prize at hand . The best way to rob them of this ‘sinister’ joy is to smile at them after losing. Yes, you read it right. I am asking you to show a sign of happiness after you lose. But trust me, this will totaly wreck your opponent's pride and ego after winning, and if you are lucky you might just make a friend out of them.

This is not only a way to make a come back at your opponent, but is also a way to make you self realise that this is not the end. But rather a stepping stone for you to succeed.

Here is an image of two Olympic finalists after the match. The one in the left lost the match, but she doesn’t show any sign of anger and she made a friend out of her Spanish counterpart.

Eric Leow Yu Quan,Updated 5y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"How to cut any queue.

A social experiment conducted by a university showed some unprecedented results.

In this experiment, three men were tasked to cut into a long queue of customers waiting to buy some food. Each of the men were given one line to say -

May I go first?
May I go first, because I have a family emergency?
May I go first, because I need to get some food?

It turned out that the first option led to only about 40% of customers who agreed to let him cut. The second and third options saw a resounding 94% and 89% respectively.

However, if you take a look at the third option, you'll realize that the reason provided is rather nonsensical. After all, everyone is there to buy food right? At least the second option provided a more legitimate reason.

It showed that so long as you provide a reason, any reason, people will tend to let you go first, without asking too much.

I tried this when I wanted to use the lift today after walking my dog - usually, I don't share lifts with others since no one actually likes being in a confined area with a smelly dog.

However this time, I wasn't in a mood to wait. I simply wanted to go home fast and rest, so I told the people waiting, “Sorry, can I go up first, because I'm in a hurry to wash my printer?”

True, it was gibberish, but spoken confidently, vanquished even the slightest doubts. They were probably confused, but let me use the lift nonetheless.

The moment you have the desire to act on a particular goal, count backwards from 5 to 1.

Like this: 5… 4… 3… 2… 1!

And BAM, now start to move physically towards your goal before your brain kills your desire to act.

Abhishek Choudhary,Updated 7y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"If one wants to see (or learn) some such type of hacks, no one is better than Vladimir Putin, a soviet man. His gesture & personality usually affect the world leaders in true sense of psychology.

First: Do not pay attention to any thing around if there is already so much attention. No matter how important the matter or person is!
Second: Rather, make your presence at the most appropriate time.
Third, Be quiet if someone ignores you, deliberately.
Fourth, make a move that no one can ignore! [lady here is Xi Jinping’s wife]
Fifth, Its an advance psychological hack, if you know the contemporary history of your opponent! He has been shaking hands with them since 1999. Soon, Trump will also join the league. Consecutive four in a row. [It is rare for any other world leaders]
Sixth, Do not be predictable & maintain secrecy. Let the people know whats in your mind after making them in wait enough! By this, you will never be cornered out. [UNGA is usually not so much crowded]

[lady here is Xi Jinping’s wife]\nFifth, Its an advance psychological hack, if you know the contemporary history of your opponent! He has been shaking hands with them since 1999. Soon, Trump will also join the league. Consecutive four in a row. [It is rare for any other world leaders]\nSixth, Do not be predictable & maintain secrecy. Let the people know whats in your mind after making them in wait enough! By this, you will never be cornered out. [UNGA is usually not so much crowded]\nLastly, Have your own first layer of security!Its a Putin style. Watch this 35 seconds video revealing his walking style!\n\nNow this is the result: of either ‘being good or bad’\n\nThat’s cool hack!!! He is also sometime called as ‘alpha’ type personality. See: Public image of Vladimir Putin - Wikipedia\n. Vladimir Putin’s alpha male apparel\n.\n\nHe also uses a different kind of hacks to fight with his country’s enemy! Which is not so cool. Also, He is equally being hated & being loved by many people across the world. Call him Dictator, Tsar or even a President.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9999
Asim Qureshi,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"About 15 years ago I’m visiting my mother’s cousin after not seeing him for a long time.

A few hours into our meeting he stares at me and says “Asim son… why do you always smile at me when I look at you?”

Do I? I don’t know. And I tell him that.

I soon realise that I do smile a lot, and several years later I come to the view that it has played a key role in achieving the success I have attained at work and in business.

Smiling breaks down barriers, it makes tense situations into more comfortable ones, it makes you more attractive, it gives a sense of energy, it makes people want to be around you, it makes you more likeable, it makes people feel that you want to be around them, it makes people trust you.

Smiling is very powerful, massively underestimated.

And I semi-consciously knew it all along. Which is why I did it.

It also makes everyone happier, including you.

Now, when you meet/interact with that person next, just read the 'Notes' section before that and subtly refer to a couple of such details/observations while interacting with him/her.

9 out of 10 times the person would feel little special and will be mighty impressed with your 'sharp photographic memory' .

Ahmed Arshad,Updated 5y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"Giving a presentation? Always bring a bottle of water to the stage. When you can’t remember what to say, take a drink. Nobody will know the difference.

Build good relationships: Harvard University studied adults for almost 70 years and concluded that nothing leads to prosperity and healthy life as good relationships.

Stop reacting: You lost your wallet? Had a terrible breakup? Working hard but no appreciation? Lost your job? Stop reacting in such situations. Don’t expect recognition for your efforts. Think twice, act wise!

30-days challenge: Want to kill a habit? Start a 30 days challenge and you will see the change.

Relationship Advice: Be with someone who gives you the same feeling as when you see your food coming at restaurant.

Biggest brain damaging habits:

No breakfast.
Over-reacting.
Smoking.
High sugar consumption.
Air pollution.
Sleep deprivation.
Head covered while sleeping.
Working your brain during illness.
Lacking in stimulating thoughts.
Talking rarely.

Never tell anyone 3 things:

Your Love life.
Income.
Your next big move.

Exercise: 20 push ups, 15 squats, 50 jumping jacks, 30 crunches! repeat 3 times = burn 100 kilo calories.

Mark Wilson,3y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Golden spending rule: If you can’t afford two of it, you can’t afford it.
When you’re thinking about buying something you don’t necessarily need, imagine the item in one hand and the cash in the other. Which one would you take?
If you have trouble choosing, flip a coin. While you're waiting to get the result, your mind automatically starts to wish for what it wants. Then you can choose easily.
Honey does not go bad; if it has gone solid it has just crystallized and can become liquid again with just a little heat.
If you put something down temporarily, say out loud ""I've put the screwdriver by the microwave"" or whatever.
Read the three and four star reviews for the most reliable information on Amazon items.
When moving house, always set up your bedroom/ make the bed first so when you’re exhausted and just had enough you can fall into bed. Nothing worse than being exhausted and having to make the bed before getting into it
If there's a jar or container you can't open, run the lid under hot water for about 30sec. Dry it so you can get a good grip, then open. It really works.
Secretaries, tech support, and janitors are the true power in an office. Make friends with them and you’ll be able to get anything you need!
When a friend is upset, ask him one simple question before saying anything else: “Do you want to talk about it or do you want to distract from it? ”
It is important to know when to stop arguing with people, and simply let them be wrong.
If someone offers you something you want, take it. Don't decline every kind of offer out of politeness.

Mariam Naeem Khan,Updated 7y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"Ten years ago was my first presentation in front of a large audience. I was nervous. Sensing my unease, my boss reassured me that everything will turn out to be just fine.

He said, ‘If at any point you feel nervous, fake your confidence, fake that everything is alright, for the audience doesn’t know what is going on inside your heart and head. Only you know the correct version of things.

Therefore, if you miss a slide or forget a point, just fake that everything is fine and the audience will believe you.’

I skipped two slides accidentally.

I faked that nothing had happened. Everyone believed me.

Afterwards, I was flooded with praises, and not even a single individual could point that I missed two slides!

Lesson learnt: Fake it, until you make it! (My boss, Nabeel Alvi, said it to me)

Rakesh Jilla,6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Back in Jersey, I used to get my food delivered from an Indian restaurant every other day. This restaurant had its own free delivery service and since I ordered so regularly, I know the delivery guys personally (there were 3 different people who delivered the food) and the owner of the restaurant. To the restaurant’s credit they offered good food and I left a good tip every time I ordered.

I used to take a bus ride for work and the restaurant was near my office. I missed my bus one day and decided to walk to my apartment. As I was walking, I passed by this Indian restaurant and I thought to order food to-go. I went in and introduced myself to the restaurant owner. As it has been months that I was ordering food from this restaurant, the owner immediately recognized me and greeted me warmly.

As I was ordering the food, I suddenly remembered a funny little idea that I read somewhere before. I thought why not I apply it here? I felt that I am going to wait for the food anyway, why not experiment? So I stopped my order and went aside. I then called the restaurant and said I wanted to place an order for delivery. The restaurant owner laughed and said why do I want to do that? He mentioned he saw me just now. I laughingly said I changed my mind and decided I want an order for delivery and not a pickup.

He was confused for a minute, but he took my order anyway. I then hang up and waited for about 10 minutes before entering the restaurant again. The owner was surprised to see me and asked what am I doing here. He asked does he need to cancel the delivery and make it a pick-up instead. I said that is not required and requested to let me know when the food was ready. He gave me a weird look and mentioned he would. After some time he said the food is ready and he asked his worker to get the food delivered.

The delivery guy knows me as well. We greeted each other before the owner, while the owner was handing over the delivery bag. Now, I asked them whether it would be okay if I can ride in his car to my apartment?

The owner paused a second, and then laughed. He said “I knew something was up when you didn’t want the pick-up but I wasn’t expecting this. Of course you can take a ride.” I thanked him and got into the car. I got a free ride to my apartment.

I did this a few times when I missed my bus. Since I was a regular, both the delivery guy and the owner never minded giving me a free ride to my apartment. It was fun for sometime.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/shuz8dgqk9ebmlvj', 'title': ""What is the most clever life hack you've learned?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Back in Jersey, I used to get my food delivered from an Indian restaurant every other day.

Dr Jo,4y,Why can't we create a computer system (or device) which cannot be hacked?,"Some good answers, but as nobody has done this so far, let’s trot out the answer:

There is almost always a “side-channel” attack against security. In his much-maligned book on cryptography, Bruce Schneier describes a lot of modern security as driving a stake into the ground and hoping that the attacker will walk into it. This is embarrassingly close to the truth.

‘Experts’ are actually quite bad at seeing the ‘obvious’ attack, because they are so focused on the technical details of their solution. Intruders have the luxury of a more broad perspective—and a criminal mind that gets over little moral issues like crushed fingers.

There is a close parallel between achieving ‘good’ security and the problem of finding ‘truth’ in Science. Good science consists of assertions that we’ve tested to the best of our ability and not yet shown to be wrong. Secure computer systems are just those that have been quite well tested—and not yet hacked.

Shulamit Widawsky,Updated 7y,What are some amazing brain hacks?,"Turns out, your brain cannot really tell the difference between completely imagining something, and actually experiencing it.

That means, that if you don't have time to practice throwing baskets into the hoop one day, but you usually practice, you can imagine throwing basket after basket, and your brain will actually improve your skills when you get back to the court.

It means, that if you can picture yourself doing something that you are afraid of, you will become less afraid, as if you actually did it for real.

It means, that if you keep thinking that you hate doing a certain thing, or that you don't want to do a certain thing, say, washing the windows, you will convince your brain that this is a task to be avoided. But if you imagine wanting to wash the windows, over and over in your mind, by the time you get to those windows, you will actually want to wash them...which actually, you really do, because you are so tired of them being dirty.

What you tell your brain, your brain believes.

Tell it you are great.

Don't tell it you are bad.

Imagine the person you want to become, over and over, and you will become it.

Imagine the person you don't want to become, over and over, and you will become that.

Details make the difference.

This does not work if what you imagine is a final outcome, without imagining what it takes to get there. For example, imagining yourself wealthy, but not imagining yourself investing or working, will not magically create wealth. You have to have a plan, and imagine carrying out the plan. Same for fame. Same for sex. Same for career.

Does your brain distinguish real from imaginary?

Ayan Srivastava,Updated 8mo,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"[NOTE]: If you find this answer behind a paywall, do not pay for it. You can read it directly from my profile ; I haven’t monetized anything!

If you're a nerd like me, chances are you buy lots of pens!

Purchasing them in bulk, it may happen 2 out of 10 just don't work properly later , and you’ll feel duped! :(

But you're at the shop right now! You ain't got time to write essays with each pen.

Here is a simple test to rapidly check if they work or not.

Ask the shopkeeper for a piece of paper & rapidly make an “8″ (eight) on paper(clean the paper of any dust first)

Notice the region the arrow indicates. The pen is not working properly when a stroke at that angle(or tangent) is made. Hence the line isn’t as thick ; in fact if you specifically make a line along that direction(with speed) the pen might not even work!

Note: It may work perfectly fine in other directions. Also, speed is crucial!

For those of you who are interested in why this works, we’ll have jump into circles and tangents. Tangent is just a line you draw at a point on circle.

A circle can be said to made up of infinite tangents. Each tangent is a line.

(I know I know, I am an artist🤣)

Red = Tangent(with arrow, indicating direction)
Black = Circle
Blue dot = points where tangents are made

Concept: Note that drawing this circle makes sure your pen covers the “entire range of motions possible”, because you cover all possible tangents/lines when you draw a circle.

When you draw an “8” (or infinity symbol), you are actually drawing two circles(one anticlockwise and one clockwise). Not only do you cover entire range of motion, you do the same in other direction too(this time tangent direction will be reversed)

(upper anticlockwise ; lower clockwise)

Hence, instead of furiously scribbling on a pad the next time you’re at the stationery shop, try this. Works like a charm!

EDIT: Well, my 1st answer and >250 upvotes. I feel like a star 😂😂(Won’t lie, this will indeed motivated me to write more, this being one of my first proper answers)

Now for another bonus tip:

(WARNING: This may permanently tilt/damage the nib. But don’t worry its very easy. Do it with some practice on a cheap pen first)

If you ever find your pen suddenly stop working(say its very irregular) use this trick. This happens a lot with cheap ball point pens ; gel pens are usually sufficiently fluid so no problem with them.

Light up a match. wait for 1 second .
Take your pen’s tip(and be EXTREMELY PRECISE here) and put the tip over the flame of the matchstick. Make sure the point where the tip and the plastic of the pen meet is sufficiently far away from the flame else that part will melt. It should be neither too close nor too far.
Rotate the pen as the tip is heating tip. FINISH THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WITHIN 1.5 SECOND. This is because as the metal heats up the junction between the tip and plastic may melt and tip will start to droop. But if you keep rotating it will heat uniformly and won’t droop down. Again, don’t bring it too close to the flame.

4. Remove the tip from the flame, let it fully cool down in air. Then write on paper.(Apply “a little” extra force initially). The pen should work fine.

Vaishnavi Kushwaha,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Have you ever faced problem in getting up early..? I'm asking this because getting up early is not my thing. I put my alarm on as..

6 am ~ 6:15 am ~ 6:30 am ~ 6:45 am ~ 7 am ~ 7:15 am till 9'o clock. But this never helped me.

But what if you have Important submissions, seminars, events..??

Unconsciously we stop the alarm and enjoy our sleep. You know if your mind get conscious, you'll find it difficult to sleep again.

So here is a useful app for all those who are in love with their sleep.. ALARMY..!!

You can get this from play store. There are many options to stop the alarm like you have to do some basic mathematics calculation. This will help your mind to get conscious. Or to take a predecided picture.

Peter Hand,6y,Who are the best hackers in history and what programming languages do they use?,"This may not be a popular opinion, but I think the best hackers in history were the people who wrote the common boot sector viruses in the 1990s. Think about it -

It had to replicate itself to every disk ever inserted in the machine;
It had to carry out some sort of payload action;
It had to do its job and still boot the PC;
It had to fit completely into 512 bytes.

I disassembled a couple of these, back in the day. One, the Form
 virus, was as common as the common cold - I found it on dozens of computers, including every single machine (and every single floppy disk) at one place I worked. It didn’t do a lot of harm, it just added a progressively increasing delay in keyboard handling and occasionally revealed itself by making an annoying click at every keypress.

The other one I disassembled was the Michelangelo

Both of these pieces of malware, and many others, fit entirely in the 512 byte boot sector. They were - of course - coded in assembler.

This hack can be used elsewhere. The gay liberation movement made its greatest strides when gays came out of the closet, and people realized that they knew such people. They were no longer abstractions, but people, friends, and it created a phase transition.

John Nofsinger,Updated 1y,What are some psychological tricks that work?,"Starting your day with gratitude can change your life.

Thanking God for what we have, instead of bemoaning and focusing on our failures, losses, and pain is a great spiritual practice. The Bible tells us to thank God daily, to focus on the good in life, and to not let the dark thoughts take preeminence in our mind.

If your day is not going well, take some time to focus on how much Christ loves you. It can turn your day around in just a few seconds, and can greatly improve your outlook on life.

Here are some Bible verses that can turn your bad day around:

Philippians 4:7 “And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”
Isaiah 40:31 “…but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.”
Romans 15:13 “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”

If you wake up every morning, and meditate with God on His goodness, love and peace, I promise your day will start out better than the last.

God Bless.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sc6i73engq5mrt21', 'title': 'What are some psychological tricks that work?', 'score': {'original': 0.0296, 'ai': 0.9704}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Starting your day with gratitude can change your life.\n\nThanking God for what we have, instead of bemoaning and focusing on our failures, losses, and pain is a great spiritual practice.

Jaiden W. Troxel,Updated 1y,Is it theoretically possible to hack nuclear weapons with a laptop?,"Nope.

Nuclear launch systems are designed to be Internet-proof- meaning that they physically cannot connect to the internet. In order to launch a nuclear missile, one must acquire two sets of two command keys, split between two independent command groups. After acquiring all four, they may be turned simultaneously to launch around fifty nuclear missiles.

Oops! All those nukes just landed in the middle of the Pacific ocean. That’s because nukes need to be manually loaded with launch trajectory programs. I kid you not, these programs are stored on 8-inch diskette drives.

So unless your laptop is connected to a four-armed robot in possession of four nuclear command keys and a booklet of launch-trajectory floppy discs, good luck hacking into a launch silo.

Update: I’ve been told the floppy disk system was retired in late 2019 in favor of insertable encrypted solid-state drives. However, the machines still do not connect to the internet.

Sagnik Misra,Updated 3y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Most of the times, I used to stay in hostel before the lockdown. Now, due to everyday morning classes, my daily breakfast used to get skipped.

Besides, I was kind of getting sick due to the unhealthy oily foods of my hostel in the morning. My classes used to take between 8a.m - 2p.m with almost no breaks.

So, instead of eating outside foods and wasting money, I came up with something different.

Most of our older generation is familiar with this healthy flour.

We call it Chatu in Bengali (Sattu). I first noticed my parents to make a juice of it and drink in the morning/ mix with puffed rice and eat. This gave their stomach full boost without any feelings of hunger before 1pm. It also energized them.

So, I thought of adapting this old technique of quenching hunger with healthy diet. I bought a packet of it.

In the morning, I mixed 3/4 spoons of Sattu with water along with sugar and salt of my choice. Then I drink it. It usually takes a minute or so to prepare.

It worked like a magic and provided me enough energies to continue my studies with no intention of distractions towards food before my lunch hours.

Picture Reference : Google

Many of my friends observed it. My roommate laughed at me for using this old technique by staying in 21st century. Some even neglect to touch it as they regarded it as poor man's food. I feel pity on them.

But my friend, old techniques are gold. It saved my money, my stomach, my energy and most importantly my hungry mind.

“Old techniques are gold. No wonder why our old generation is healthier and more functional than us just because of these clever life hacks.”

Hunger is the biggest distracting zone of a student. You also can't avoid your hunger as hungry brain doesn't function well. So, why not trying a healthier diet which will save our time and effort which we can put into some more productive work!

Shivansh Mathur,1y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Don’t change clothes just after you came home till you start the first productive activity

Let’s say you are coming from college and you have to do 10 homework questions,

What will someone typically do;

Come home,
Change clothes, shower,
Do the 10 questions

What you do with this hack

Come home,
Do 2 questions right away, (DON’T CHANGE CLOTHES)
Change clothes, shower,
Do the other 8 questions

The point is when you walk/drive home and when you change clothes after that, you tend to chill and get into the “home” mood and lose time just doing nothing. So this hack saves that precious time.

Rakshith Akira,Updated 5y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Flashback#1

2nd standard:

I was there for a singing competition. They announced,

Now, I call upon Rakshith for singing the Bhavageethe (Emotional Poetry)

I just stepped out of the crowd, people started to applaud. I stood on podium, someone gave a mic. I took with my sweating hand. My legs were shaking.

I started to sing and looked at the crowd of 150 people. I went blank. I forgot the lyrics. I was humiliated and stepped down from the dais.

Stage fear fucked me!

ಎಲ್ಲ ಕೇಳಲಿ ಎಂದು ನಾನು ಹಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಹಾಡುವುದು ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯ ಕರ್ಮ ನನಗೆ!

Translation:

I don’t sing for the sake of others, but singing is my inevitable fate.

Flashback#2

9th standard:

I was there for a public speaking (It was not a competition though). They announced my name.

I started to speak and looked at the crowd of 1,000 people. I went blank. I forgot the content. I was humiliated.

Stage fear fucked me hard again!

My class teacher called me to the staff room and said

Rakshith, I give you another chance and you should perform well next week.

I was like WTF? stage fear is a nightmare for me.

So, Next week in the prayer assembly,

I went and spoke for 5 minutes on the topic “ Health is wealth” without any breaks or pause. I completed with confidence and stepped down with pride.

So, you people are wondering what that one week changed me? Aren’t you? Well my teacher was in the same state.

The trick I played was,

I just took off my spectacles (I am a myopic) before stepping onto the stage. Everything was looking blur around me that day. So, I successfully mastered the art of public speaking.

Thug Life!

Proud to be a myopic!

Kevin S Lin,7y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"There’s a cartoon I watched as a kid where the hero gets thrown in jail high up in a tower. There’s an old man there who has been in the jail all his life. The hero demands to be let out and the gate opens. The hero walks out. The old man looks at the open door and then turns to the audience and mutters: “You mean all I had to do was ask?”

I laughed at this when I was a kid but reflecting on my life, I’ve had countless moments where I was that old man. A crush of three years who I never talked to, questions in meetings that I never voiced and promotions that I never pushed for.

Over the last five years, I’ve experimented with doing what the hero in the tower did and ask for what I want. And in many cases, just like in the cartoon, the door really opened.

And more often than not, they were too short — she’d often get burns on her forearms when reaching inside a hot oven, oven mitts only protect your hands.

However, one day she found a pair of welding gloves lying around, and got the genius idea to use them in the kitchen.

These things are:

Very robust, literally industrial strength. No fear of them falling apart.
Heat-proof up to hundreds of degrees Celsius
Made of rough fabric, and have fingers, making handling of various dishes very simple. No slipping and dropping your lasagne ever again!
Quite long, offering total protection not only for your hands, but your wrists and forearms too. No need to worry about touching the edge of a blazing hot oven when reaching into it.
Are generally quite cheap, $20 bucks or so. Not much difference to “premium” (but still garbage) oven mitts.

I recently received a pair from her as a birthday gift. I tossed my oven mitts immediately. From then on, it’s welding gloves all the way.

Karamvir Sehgal,Updated 4y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Some of the hacks that I knew are :-

1.Soaking a sock in water and then putting a bottle in it, is a great way to keep drinking water cool, especially in dry areas.

2. Packing clothes efficiently.

3. Peeing in the showerprevents/cures athlete's foot.

4.Tying knots on the top of the laces prevents boots from coming untied. Also, tying the knot at the centre of laces prevents them from getting off-centred.

5. If you don't have time to iron your wrinkled clothes, try spraying them with water and then hang them to dry.

6.Syndicate opportunities preserve your night vision when a car approaches you with its high beams lit, try closing one eye. When the car has passed, switch eyes until the eye exposed to the bright light has recovered.

7. If you want your leather shoes to shine like a mirror, try the fire method!

8.Using duct tape on the feet to prevent blisters, hot spots, etc works way better than using moleskin or bandaid on the same area.

9. Runner's tights keep you warmer than most varieties of lower-half thermal wear, and they'll fit under most of your clothes.

10. To prevent the painful blisters and shoe bites, soak your DMS boots in water to make them soft.

11. To avoid your shirt from looking poofy, try tucking it the militaryway.

12.If you think someone is following you, make four consecutive right turns. If they're still there, drive to a police or fire station.

13.Women's maxi pads do wonders in stopping blood flow as they don't stick to wounds, and they soak up a lot.

14.Also, powdered sugar or sugar paste can be used to cover the wound as bacteria can't survive in an environment with a high sugar content.

15.Mixing cotton balls and vaseline together is a feasible way to start afire.

Joel Paul,Updated 5y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Want to learn how to get a FLAWLESS PRONUNCIATION and CRYSTAL CLEAR VOICE.

I have the perfect hack for you.

Take a pencil.

Clean it.

Hold it in your mouth like it is shown in the picture below.( Just don’t make a similar face)

It should not be too in or too out. Just in the middle.

Now start your imaginary conversation.

It can be in whichever language. It doesn’t need to be a dialogue i.e. you can talk to yourself.

Try to speak as clearly as possible and maintain an audible voice.

This exercise improves the coordination of tongue and increases jaw strength.

Do this for 15 min each day and see the magic…!!

Adrián Lamo,8y,Why does hacking work? How can it be blocked most effectively?,"For the purposes of your question I'm going to assume that by ""hacking"" you mean ""network intrusion"". Not all network intrusions are hacks, and not all hacks are network intrusions. But, going forward in the spirit of your question ...

Hacking is the art and science of finding creative solutions to problems or obstacles using resources that may not even be considered useful by a non-hacker. As I've said elsewhere (and h/t Nilan-jan Bhattacharya for pointing this out), the reason I am and have been effective at network intrusion is that I've typically used perfectly legitimate network resources and caused them to behave in concert unexpectedly.


What I do/did went undetected because I tended to use sites and tools intended for employees in such ways that individually my actions were harmless, but by their powers combined they created unexpected results. The effects of this were twofold: First, to Intrusion Detection Systems, my actions appeared perfectly normal, because software cannot (yet) know the hearts and minds of its users.

I didn't use prepackaged exploits, I didn't (generally) use known vulnerabilities, I didn't install Kali Linux or Backtrack and throw the entire toolbox at the problem. I behaved like an authorized user would behave, seeing which resources were available to them, and finding ways to make them more than the sum of their parts in their effect.

By way of example, at one major phone company I was able to see the source code for their admin tools on a development server. This allowed me to see certain assumptions that the tools made at various steps in the process. By reading through, I was able to find a portion of the menus that didn't check for authentication (under the assumption that if you were in the middle of an admin menu, you must already be authorized).

Using this function, I was able to create a ""legitimate"" admin account that gave me superuser access to the rest of their system. Now, numerous employees accessed those same URL's on a daily basis. It was part of their job. And by finding out who this company outsourced some of their support to, I was able to route through a third-party, less secure network belonging to an outsourcing tech agency. The upshot to this was that all my traffic appeared normal, and to originate from legitimate hosts as well.

Really, there was very little that could have been done to prevent this other than severely inconveniencing their users by auditing every administrative request. And I even made sure to document my actions, first browsing the internal helpdesk to see what the internal jargon looked like, then creating believable-sounding justifications for everything I'd done, using enough jargon and acronyms to ensure that the average reader would get bored halfway through.

In some cases watching your network just for unusual behavior will catch would-be intruders in the act. But these tend to be the low-hanging fruit, the ones who download well-known hacking tools and set them loose without a real understanding of how they operate.


The only real way to protect yourself against a savvy intruder is to routinely stage ""Red team
"" exercises and hire independent penetration testers with real-world experience (not to mention designing your network to be failure-tolerant, not failure-proof; the latter is a myth). The bias against hiring folks with a history of real-world hacking (just so long as that experience is behind them, hopefully) shoots companies and agencies in the foot - a Certified Ethical Hacker may sound nice on paper, but they've never been in the trenches, so to speak.

Certainly there are many talented people who have been ""white hats"" their entire careers, and I would never undersell them. But there are many more who have simply taken a slew of certifications and assume that makes them the equal of someone who's learned the ropes by themselves, developing their own techniques.

I wouldn't want a cop working a case who got their badge out of a Cracker Jack box any more than I'd want a ""hacker"" who got their creds from a prefab test that emphasizes rote learning rather than actual thinking.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v8ibfer3qdu657wk', 'title': 'Why does hacking work?

Joe Richardson,4y,Is it theoretically possible to hack nuclear weapons with a laptop?,"Nope.

Nuclear bombs aren’t really digital. I mean, they are, but not in the sense of your laptop.

This is how you’d arm a nuclear bomb.

It requires a special arming device with special software and input controls, it requires a special connector, it requires a special code, and it requires you know how to use the damn thing.

That all means you have to have authorization, training, and physically be with the bomb when you arm it. I.E. the opposite of hacking.

And that’s for dumb bombs that you just drop out of the sky…once we get into missiles, it’s a whole lot worse.

I’m going to assume you want to actually launch this nuclear weapon…any nuclear device in the US has arming mechanisms to prevent the bomb from detonating before reaching certain altitudes, and speeds, and so fourth…so if you want to blow something up, you’d have to launch the weapon through one of the US’ delivery methods.

So with that in mind, let’s look at the United States’ weapons launch and delivery platforms.

A B-52H Stratofortress. It’s literally purpose built to carry nuclear weapons. If you wanted to launch a nuclear bomb, you’d have to get inside either Barksdale or Minot AFB, get inside their highly secured weapons area, arm a nuclear device, load it into the bomber, fire up the BUFF’s engines, taxi, take off, and make it to your target without getting blown out of the sky…oh, and you have to have several people actually manning the separate battle stations on the plane…that’s not going to happen.

B-2 Spirit…do I even have to explain why this would never work? Look at that picture…guess where that is…let me give you a hint, Diego Garcia…a freaking island in the middle of the Indian Ocean inhabited exclusively by US military personnel…and look at how much armed security they have there…the middle of nowhere….you’re not getting in.

An Ohio Class Ballistic Missile Submarine…you’re going to have to somehow get through a couple hundred feet of water at an unknown location, get inside the submarine, and convince the Weapons Officers, Captain, XO, and about 150 pissed off sailors to launch their nuclear weapons…oh, and you need a launch code, somehow.

That leaves this. A Minuteman III ICBM. You’re not getting into that silo…there’s about three feet of reinforced concrete that says no…and even if you somehow could get into the silo (without alerting Air Force Security), you can’t hot wire the missile.

So, instead, you’d have to go to the actual Launch Control Center (LCC), which is buried 90 feet beneath a Missile Alert Facility (MAF).

If you saw this in the middle of nowhere in North Dakota, you’d probably think, “Huh…pretty heavy duty farmer…”

That facility is under constant surveillance. Those garages hold weapons and Humvee that look straight out of Iraq. And that main house looking building on the right? Barracks. For Missile Launch Officers and Security Personnel.

Those Security Personnel live in the middle of nowhere, living out of those crappy houses, in freaking dorms, with nothing to do but monitor sensors at the missile silos all day every day…oh, and they’re trained for combat…they’re not just going to shoot you if you get close to that building…they’re going to get freaking excited to shoot you.

And even if you somehow did make it inside, you’d still have to make it underground.

Somehow, you’d have to make it 90 feet underground, through two nuclear hardened blast doors…then you’d be here…

You’d have to convince two pissed off (probably stoned, drugs have been an issue in recent years) Air Force Officers to magically come up with a launch code, and then you’d have to convince them to use it…all before reinforcements came…oh, and it takes two independent LCCs to launch a nuclear attack, so you’d have to somehow do the impossible…twice…at the same time.

Not likely.

Oh, and your hacking idea…nope.

Obviously, you can’t hack a bomber. You can’t hack a submarine that lacks the ability to communicate with literally anyone…and as for the missile silos?

Each and every one of those circuits are full of sensors. The LCC is constantly sending highly encrypted, highly unique communications back and fourth with the silos…that’s literally the Officer’s job…to monitor everything.

The moment you start trying to dig up one of those com lines, if you aren’t spotted or reported early enough, I can guarantee someone will call bs the moment you actually interfere with the line. Security Police will be dispatched, the system will be locked down, and you’d never be able to launch anything anyways because that system uses highly advanced and encrypted communications for literally everything.

So, in short, no.

John Dennis,Updated 6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Waiting !!!

Waiting at least 24 hours before making a big decision that will likely determine the course of your life:

Got a job offer? Don't make a decision yet. Wait for 24 hours and think over it. Don't be impulsive! This is a big deal choice.

Got fired? Wait for 24 hours and think what happened and what is your next best step. Don't rush to call the next recruiter that pops up on your job search.

Are you upset at your family because of a big disagreement? Don't tell them immediately that they are clueless. Wait for at least 24 hours and think about it: Is it really worth it to deteriorate life’s most important relationship?

Are you almost going to yell at your incompetent coworker? Don't do it yet! Wait for 24 hours before damaging your relationship with your colleague. Think it over and devise a plan on how to discuss things over.

My point is that a lot of times in our lives we are driven by our impulses and that we make decisions driven by a moment’s emotion. Countless regrets follow because of impulsivity, life changes not for the better , relationships are broken, misery and frustration can conquer your psychological well-being.

So please wait for a while before you fight with your family, wait for a while before you yell at your colleague, wait for a while before immediately committing to that job offer.

While thinking things by waiting doesn't necessarily mean that your life choices and outcomes will be the best, at least you tried and considered all of the possibilities. You deeply and genuinely thought about whatever major issues life has thrown at you, and you are sure there will be no regrets over the coming decision. So spare yourself some hardship, regret, tears, and insecurity by waiting. You can do it: you can wait!!

Franklin Veaux,1y,"How do some people on the dark web get caught by the FBI while they're supposed to be veterans in hacking? I mean, couldn't they keep their anonymity?","A2A: Yes, they can.

Contrary to another answer, it’s very, very rare that a technical flaw or fault in Tor is hacked to reveal someone, and when that happens the Tor Project, the foundation that maintains Tor, fixes the problem quickly.

Nearly all people on the dark web aren’t caught by hacking. There’s nobody sitting in front of a keyboard in a darkened room typing furiously whilst muttering “I’ve penetrated the first firewall, but he’s routing packets from the tachyon field emitter through the main deflector dish.”

Nearly all Tor users are caught in meatspace. If you’re selling drugs or illegal guns or something, the transaction on Tor is very difficult to trace, but at some point you need to move the drugs or guns or whatever in the real world—you can’t just download them. And that’s the point of entry.

The owner of the Silk Road was caught after postal inspectors found a mail shipment of ecstasy tablets. They went to the post office where it was sent from, found surveillance footage, discovered that the suspect used that post office over and over again, so they set up surveillance and caught him.

When they interrogated him, he told them about this dark web marketplace called Silk Road. So Federal agents set up accounts on Silk Road posing as buyers. They bought drugs, arrested the sellers when the sellers shipped the drugs, then seized their seller accounts and used them to catch more sellers. Eventually they caught a person who was a trusted, high-level seller, and used that account to get the owner of the site.

Even cases where Tor is hacked don’t work like Hollywood says.

Back in 2014, police arrested a pedophile and found a huge cache of child abuse pictures on his computer. The arrest had nothing to do with hacking or the dark web. When they interrogated him about the pictures, he said he downloaded them from a dark web site called Playpen. So police did the same thing: set up fake accounts posing as buyers, luring sellers into sting operations, seizing their accounts, using the seized accounts to talk to other sellers, setting up sting operations, arresting those sellers,...

Joshua Levy,Updated 10y,What insights do expert hackers have for novice programmers?,"Initially, you should mostly focus on becoming a technically stronger and more productive programmer. There are lots of tips to help with this (and many are in the other answers), but I won't talk about them here. Instead, I'll mention three longer-term, more philosophical points that are a bit counterintuitive but that in my own experience seem to be understood by the very best engineers -- and that may be helpful to think about early (and also later) on in your programming career.

Code is for humans, not for computers.

As you begin programming, the challenge is simply to get a computer to do what you want it to do. You might think of it as communicating with the computer, and it can even be fun to do this in as direct a way as possible, such as in assembly language. As the novelty wears off, most programmers realize this can be difficult and an inefficient use of their time and so whenever possible use higher-level languages and frameworks that are easier to write in.

But there is a more subtle point even some experienced programmers forget: As systems evolve, more time will be spent reading, debugging, and changing the code than writing it. Really, in software engineering, the true goal of writing code is not to give the computer (or more generally, the distributed system) commands, but to communicate to yourself and to other engineers what the whole system should do. As a side effect, you produce code that works (and, if you're good at it, also runs efficiently). Seek and build languages and frameworks that support communication with people. Becoming a better software engineer is as much about finding ways to convey what the code does in a clean, maintainable, and understandable way, as it is about deep hacks.

You never ""don't need to know that.""

On the other hand, don't misconstrue the previous point as saying you should only program at a high level and not worry about lower-level parts of a system. As you begin using complex tools and working on larger teams, you can often do a lot without understanding some details, because the system supports you, or because someone else is handling that other part of the system. If you use an ArrayList in Java, you don't have to do anything to resize or to free the memory. If you use a remote filesystem like NFS, you can treat a file on another server just like a local file. If you use a library from someone, you don't need to read its source code.

This is a convenience. But never forget (or neglect learning) what's really going on. You do need to worry about that stuff. You might be writing in Python, but have you ever looked at the source code for Python's libraries or the interpreter? If you are using an API that has 100ms latency, do you know how much is network, how much is disk, how much is CPU? When Firefox makes an HTTP request, how many sockets does it use, and which headers does it send and why? When you run ""top"" in Linux, do you know what every number on the screen means? In any real engineering situation, this stuff will come up, eventually. Be lazy about how much code you write, but never be lazy about knowing what's going on under the hood. Become a sponge for technical information. Prod yourself into learning new programming languages or working on new kinds of projects on a regular basis. This is one of the most important differences between average and great engineers.

Technologies don't matter.

Programmers like to talk about technology. Is Ruby better than Python? Which RPC layer is faster? Should certain data be stored in Cassandra or MySQL? This is great, and you should know and have opinions about those topics (especially if you've followed the advice in the previous point). But quite surprisingly, if you look at successful and unsuccessful engineering efforts, there is essentially no correlation between success and the exact types of technologies that are used. What matters is who is working on a team, how they use the technologies, and how they work together to build, ship, and improve a product. Good software engineering is done by good software engineers. It's rarely done with the perfect programming language, or using the most hyped new technology. A lot of the hardest challenges in software development concern the way people communicate and manage complex code, systems, and processes, not in raw technology.

There are many important corollaries to this: Pick programming languages you or your team use well, or are aligned with the market, or are popular enough you can hire folks. Be pragmatic, not religious about how you solve problems. Learn by working with great engineers of all types, and seeing how they solve problems. Realize that having a strong team with a good engineering culture is more important than any particular technology.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zriy1f8jxncklt6v', 'title': 'What insights do expert hackers have for novice programmers?', 'score': {'original': 0.1864, 'ai': 0.8136}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Initially, you should mostly focus on becoming a technically stronger and more productive programmer.

You might think of it as communicating with the computer, and it can even be fun to do this in as direct a way as possible, such as in assembly language. As the novelty wears off, most programmers realize this can be difficult and an inefficient use of their time and so whenever possible use higher-level languages and frameworks that are easier to write in.\n\nBut there is a more subtle point even some experienced programmers forget: As systems evolve, more time will be spent reading, debugging, and changing the code than writing it.

Adrián Lamo,8y,What is the most interesting attack made on a website?,"While not specifically a website hack, probably the most impressive Internet-related hack I can think of involved was ""Internet Census 2012"", performed by a security researcher/hacker took over many, many embedded devices in order to create what may have been the most detailed map of the Internet up to that date. The distribution of the affected devices looked like this:


The effort was simple yet breathtaking. Many Internet-enabled devices such as routers, uninterruptible power supplies, printers, and more esoteric gadgets support a remote command shell and are left with default passwords (or no passwords) in their final deployment. The person behind this effort harnessed them into a botnet, but unlike most botnets, which are often used for spamming or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, these were used to send probes that were heard around the world, creating maps of Internet topography, including this one:


All in all, the botnet involved spanned over 420,000 devices, and this wasn't even the upper limit to the number which could have been taken over. When they were done, the researcher quietly deleted his or her code from the affected systems, left them intact with the passwords unchanged, published their work, and went about their business.

They could have just as easily used this resource for any number of malicious and/or self-enriching purposes. Instead, they were satisfied by performing valuable research which might not have been possible any other way. I understand that some people might have ethical problems with the way the research was conducted - it was, after all, unarguably illegal - but I have to have respect for someone who, given a choice, does a productive thing instead of a self-interested or harmful one.

Destiny Olorunfemi,3y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"If you think that someone is giving you a fake phone number, read it back to them with one wrong digit. If they correct you, it is most likely real.
When someone tells something about themselves, ask follow up questions, don't make the conversation about you.
Always be a little kinder than necessary, you never know what someone is going through.
When you try to lose weight, buy a shirt in a size smaller.
When someone has their hand raised for a high-five, always look at their elbow as you reciprocate. You'll never miss.
Don't eat until you're full, eat until you're not hungry.
After finally finding a lost item, place it in the first place you looked.
To be kinder to others, start by being kinder to yourself. When we treat ourselves well, we will more naturally treat others the same.
When you break a glass on a hard floor, shine a flashlight parallel to the floor so you can see the shadows of tiny pieces you would otherwise miss.
Instead of buying one whole bunch of bananas, buy separate ones at different levels of ripeness so they become perfect to eat at a staggered pace.
Write down the serial number for each electronic you own. If stolen, the police will need to have the serial number to recover it.
Wait a minimum of 30 minutes after a meal before brushing your teeth. Especially after food and drinks high in acidity.
When trying to focus on something (writing, revising, reading) listen to music with no words. This allows you to block out unwanted sound and having no lyrics can stop you from being distracted.
Don't tell artists you think their work is good; instead, point out something specific you like about the work.

Sofia Korkala,Updated 6y,What are some amazing brain hacks?,"In 1927, psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik was having dinner at a restaurant.

She started closely observing the waiters taking orders, and noticed an obvious, but important pattern in their work.

The waiters were able to remember the orders to the last, small detail while they were still serving the table, but as soon as the customers had paid and left, they forgot it completely.

Your brain holds on to information and tasks that you have not yet finished. As soon as you are finished, you forget them, since nobody can possibly own the resources to hold on to every single piece of grocery list or finished work task.

The Zeigarnik effect is mostly known as an effective remover of earworms, but it can also be used in a more meaningful way.

If you work on a lengthy project or task, take a break at a point where you would really like to go on, and do something completely different.

Subconsciousness keeps on working and thinking about the task and finding ways to solve it.

Things will fall into place much easier than if you had just kept going without stopping.

Frank Wazeter,Updated 5y,Why are so many genius coders and hackers not giving tips to others to help them?,"This question came into my feed at a very interesting time. I run a development company, and just last night one of a pair of new hires was talking to me on the brink of tears.

First, I’ll start off by saying these new hires are newbies - one taught themselves some basic C and C++ and is looking for a way to somehow pay for their college and is ~14 years old. The other, is their older sister, some 10 years older and looking to transition to coding, with some basic HTML, CSS familiarity.

Now here’s what’s special about these two: the older sister migrated to the States all by herself when she was 17, learned English to the level where native English speakers can’t even tell she’s not American and earned her citizenship through grit, hard work and determination. She’s a total rockstar and a badass in my book.

Her younger brother, still in the home country, is in a ‘no-win’ scenario, where he can barely speak/read any English (making documentation reading very difficult and resources limited), and staring down a future where even coming up with $1,000 a month is pretty difficult (plus that country is experiencing its own version of apartheid, making racism-fueled violence common, and he’s on the wrong ‘side’ so he’s desperately looking for his own way to the West.

They’ve both got the mind for it, the problem solving skills and the drive (they’ve got some pretty big fat reasons for being successful at this).

So why was the older sister nearly in tears?

At the start of the week, I had given them a learning project composed into a couple different parts, with various different “bonus” learning objectives in it.

Duplicate this website in HTML & CSS (both either new or unfamiliar with it). Intentionally picking a site made in Wordpress so no easy copy/paste here.
Do something cool with Javascript to enhance it (bonus).
Take the static website you created, go into Django/Python and make the static site you just created in HTML / CSS render using Django.
Bonus: implement a way to make blog posts for dynamic content.
Bonus: make the forms actually work and save to a database
Bonus: change Django default DB to Postgres.
Sync it with Github.
Deploy it to Digital Ocean.

I then gave them access to resources they could use to find the information, which included all the Django documentation, various popular written Django tutorials and about 14 different 6–12 hour courses on Udemy.

Specifically, at the very beginning, I said “you’ve got one week to complete this, but actually finishing this, is probably going to be very difficult, maybe even impossible for you both, given how much you know right now. Don’t worry about that, that isn’t the point of this. The point is to see how you problem solve and how you find resources to help you, because you aren’t always going to know the answer to what you need to do in development. Often, you aren’t even going to know where to start, and frequently you’re going to have to reference another project to do what you want to do, because memorizing every line of code across multiple languages just simply isn’t going to happen.

This ‘test’ was specifically designed to:

Expose them to the pressures of deadline-oriented work and help them learn how to prioritize.
Put them in a situation where they didn’t know what they needed to know at the start to finish the program.
Teach them how to add “resources” to their tool belt.

After about 4 days, they get through the HTML and CSS, and even add some cool little JavaScript. A few hiccups and back and forths and figuring it out.

Enter Python and Django.

It was so far above and beyond anything they’d really been exposed to that it legit caused panic inducing problems for them. They just couldn’t figure out why their page was just loading one html template, and not the rest with links working.

After 3–4 hours of trying to fix this simple issue, and trying to get me to solve it for them, finally was the break point.

And I said “I’m still not going to give you the answer, and the fact is, you’re simply not equipped right now to be able to figure out why it’s not working: you don’t even know the right question to ask to get the right answer for your problem. And you know what? That’s totally okay, that doesn’t mean you’re dumb or you can’t do this.”

“Nobody expected you to be able to just miraculously know. What’s important now is that you go back and figure out how to learn. I left up on the screen working examples of the code you’re trying to recreate, pulled up the documentation to the exact area of the site you’re working on and opened up three tutorials for how you could create it. But, you didn’t notice because you didn’t think to look there for your answer, or you got in your head and it prevented you from seeing what was in front of you.”

She replied with “but, you just, you know literally everything and it’s so easy for you and we’re trying to figure it out and it’s supposed to be so easy and we shouldn’t be stuck with it, and this instructor keeps bouncing around and I don’t understand what’s going on and it’s just like edit this file and then this, and that, and I don’t even know.”

With a laugh I said “Look, what you’re seeing now is the result of 15 years of banging my head against the wall going through exactly what you’re going through right now trying to figure it all out. Tell you the truth? There’s still so much I don’t even know it’s not even funny. Shoot, I can barely put together a modern day web app without having to have documentation or reference models up in front of me. I’m only doing what I’m doing now to the level I’m doing now because I’ve recognized how to find the information I need.”

So she asks “what do I do?”

And I told her, to go back with her brother, and that she’ll have to translate for him, and restart the project. Go step by step through it with a course and just repeat it over and over until it makes sense. If you find that one instructor is confusing for you? No problem! Switch to a different one, they might explain the same thing in a slightly different way that you understand. Or seeing it from a different standpoint might unlock an “ah ha” moment in you and you’ll get it.”

“What you’re stuck on, is something that in literally 2–3 weeks of doing this, will take you all of five seconds to do. But don’t try to understand the whole program all at once and break it down into small steps that you can achieve small victories on, and you’ll wake up one day with a completed project.”

“But what about deploying it?? That’s going to be so confusing and I don’t even know!” So I replied, “Don’t even worry about that, that doesn’t matter right now. You’re worrying about a problem that isn’t even a problem yet or even a priority for you to even consider. That’s it’s own pain in the ass to deal with later. Just focus on the immediate task.”

We obviously talked a little more than that, but, with a little bit of renewal she went out and her and her brother were able to figure it out and get a little bit less caught up on the small details - sure enough they were able to finish it and turns out their primary problem is they had installed the incorrect version of Django compared to the reference material they were using, which just so happened to make a couple small, critical changes.

Summary of the story is that expert coders and devs and ‘hackers’ do actually teach as much as they can to people who ask - but this stuff is complex, and it’s not something you can just go “learn” in 2–3 weeks, 2–3 months, even 2–3 years.

The people who are the best are there because they never stopped learning, and there’s no shortcut to experience. Experiences can’t be as easily taught as something technical: you just have to go through them. You have to learn how to ask the right questions, how to find the right resources and just encounter head-scratching issues enough times over and over again that you pretty much just know how to approach solving the problem, rather than the actual technical fix.

That’s an art that’s difficult to just give someone in a few “tips and tricks.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/evqd3912yu8isfkm', 'title': 'Why are so many genius coders and hackers not giving tips to others to help them?', 'score': {'original': 0.80306666666667, 'ai': 0.19693333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This question came into my feed at a very interesting time.

So I am a fitness freak. Always on a regulated diet and I tend to avoid fast food as much as possible. It was a new years day, yesterday, and for me, special days mean cheat days. So for the past three days, I am munching on my favorite foods.

For the last 8 months, I didn't have a plate of Pani Puri. I decided to go to my favorite Pani Puri snack center for some pani puri and shev puri.

While I was eating it I felt something strange, like if I got my period, but I had my period last week itself, so I didn't pay attention to the discomfort much. When I came home I surprisingly found, that I got my “Mini Period.”

I had PCOD previously, sometimes even after having periods, my body loses some amount of blood the same month.

So I had bled in the new pair of lavender pants, and the blood had badly stained it, but me being lazy didn't put it for wash immediately.

Why?

Because of this hack.

Girls would understand me, that how notorious and bad period stains are unless you don't know this hack.

So I washed my jeans like approx 12 hours after I got the stain. I always had a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide with me.

(I had to hide the stain because some people are not comfortable seeing blood nor do I want an attack of Quora moderation.)

Hydrogen Peroxide is an oxidizing agent, which breaks down organic matter like blood.

So first I rinsed out the site well under tap water, then I added a few drops of hydrogen peroxide on it. You can see the bubbles, the peroxide reacting with it. Apply the peroxide well both on the side of the stain as well on the back of it.
Rinse it again.
Then take a little amount of detergent powder, rub on the area of the stain and then gently scrub it.
Rinse it again.
Then evaluate if the stain has gone or not, if it hasn't then again apply a few drops of hydrogen peroxide.
This is the same area of the jeans of washing.

You can look, that it looks so fresh and clean as if it had not encountered any stain.

I would advise all the girls to keep a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide with you in your home. It's really efficient with period stains on your clothes. It's not expensive either and is available in the chemist shops too.

It doesn't fade the color of the cloth nor does it harm the cloth.

Hope my answer does help my dear sisters.

John F. Dooley,5y,How fast do hackers type? Can they really hack security systems in minutes like in the movies?,"Someone said that hackers can type up to 250 words/minute. Hogwash. Average typing speed is 30 - 40 wpm. Professional typists can type around 80 - 120 wpm. Nobody types at 250 wpm. You may think you’re flying along, but you’re not really. If you’re typing at 40wpm and the average word length is 4.5 characters, then you’re slipping along at about 180 CHARACTERS per minute, not words.

See Words per minute - Wikipedia

As far as breaking into systems, your typing speed is the least of your worries. Good hackers _can_ break into not-very-well-secured systems in just minutes, but those are not typically the types of systems shown in movies. For example, you’d have to be pretty good and have very good tools in order to break into a bank, and even then it would take way more than a few minutes.

Dmitry Murashenkov,5y,How would a computer hacker think differently from a programmer?,"- Hey, Jim, the power cord is too short!

- Don’t worry, I got it.

- Isn’t this dangerous?

- Trust me - I’m an engineer!

Although these days term “hacker” is usually used to refer to guys who break into systems, empty bank accounts and fight against corrupt governments, it originally meant “a guy with level of expertise high enough to allow him to do hacks - use system in an unexpected way to achieve some goal”.

Actually, hacks are often added to applications by their developers to fix some bug quickly in case proper patch may take weeks to implement. Other reasons often include being too lazy to write architecturally correct solution or speeding things up using some undocumented features or unsafe design assumptions.

Typical hack looks like this:

if (currentUser.getId() < 15) { 
   //All our admin users have ids below 15 so this must be  
   //one of them - let's skip security checks! 
   performOperation(); 
} 
else if (checkAccessRights() == GRANTED) { 
   performOperation(); 
} 

The most notable differences hacky way of thinking has is ignoring typical guidelines, design patterns, safety concerns and society norms. The task at hand is your battlefield, you fight to win at any cost like tomorrow never comes and don’t worry about the consequences.

This allows you to think out of the box and see what else you can do with the system. If you should actually do it and for honorable purpose or not - is whole other thing.

Everyday lifehacks rely on essentially the same technique, here is one more from XKCD:","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4i8leoc1n6ykapub', 'title': 'How would a computer hacker think differently from a programmer?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""- Hey, Jim, the power cord is too short!\n\n- Don’t worry, I got it.\n\n- Isn’t this dangerous?\n\n- Trust me - I’m an engineer!\n\nAlthough these days term “hacker” is usually used to refer to guys who break into systems, empty bank accounts and fight against corrupt governments, it originally meant “a guy with level of expertise high enough to allow him to do hacks - use system in an unexpected way to achieve some goal”.\n\nActually, hacks are often added to applications by their developers to fix some bug quickly in case proper patch may take weeks to implement.

Bill Karwin,7y,Do hackers (or programmers) write code/hack as fast as movies depict?,"I can think of one occasion where I did a Hollywood-like hack in 10 seconds.

I was teaching a training class on SQL, and describing how SQL injection works and how dangerous it is. One of the attendees said, “show me” and he turned his laptop toward me. It was open to the login screen of his web application (actually it was his testing instance, not his production site).

I typed a random name like “jsmith” into the login field. Then I added an SQL injection expression in the password field. I hit return, and I was in (well, at least I was in his web app as an authenticated user; it wasn’t like I had console-level access on his server).

I didn’t know anything about his code or his database. I only guessed that he had probably made one of the common mistakes of coding, allowing form input to be used verbatim in his SQL query for validating a login.

So it’s possible that certain hacks could be done in seconds. But most of the hacks they show in movies are basically brute-force password-cracking or writing a self-propagating “virus” (they mean worm). These techniques take hours or days to do.

Donna Seo,2y,What's the best brain hack you know?,"I am not a neuroscientist, but an ordinary housewife in my mid-40s, and I would like to introduce you to the things I practice every day in my life.

1. Drink your morning coffee.

When I wake up in the morning, I drink my morning coffee. I start my day leisurely while watching BBC news and news about the Corona situation in Korea. I love this time of the day the most.

2. Be sure to walk for an hour a day.

If you walk an hour, that's 10,000 steps. Sometimes I go to the bank or go shopping without getting in the car on purpose. On days when there is no need to go to the bank or buy anything, choose a walking course and walk on flat ground while feeling the weather. As you walk, you can hear the sound of the wind, and hear the chirping of geese flying far south, giving you a sense of the seasons. I am happy to be able to walk on two strong legs.

3. I do not spend unnecessary money.

As a housewife who has been married for 15 years, I always try to reduce unnecessary consumption. If you have a lot of stuff in your house, you always have to put your energy into organizing them. And above all else, the house was cluttered and I couldn't concentrate on my thoughts. So, I buy only the essentials and clean up the garbage right away. If I consume something that does not fit the level, I feel anxious.

4. Make a note of what to do today

When you make an appointment while talking on the phone with a friend, you immediately write a note in your cell phone diary. Dental appointments and special lecture dates for children's art classes are all taken down. And in the morning, I look at my diary, check the promises I have to keep today, and write them down in my notebook. And I have a few things to do today. And each time a mission is completed, it is marked with a single line. I am so proud of myself on the day I completed my mission.

5. I do a team project.

I have the most honorable job as a mother of two. And a side job is teaching meditation in a middle school. I love this job, a meditation teacher. I am so proud to be able to play such a small role because not only the children I give birth to but also the children in the community need to be looked after by someone. I work with meditation teachers like me and have an idea meeting for a good class at least once a week. It is not easy to get together with colleagues to gather opinions and come to a single conclusion. Sometimes we fight. Sometimes we ignore other people's suggestions. That's why we get hurt. But with the heart of building a house, we put our best efforts to provide good classes to children. After I and my fellow teachers' experience of coexisting with, I can approach students confidently. We practice happy coexistence and happy life through team projects.

6. Before going to bed, I meditate to reflect on the day.

We store everything we see, hear, and experience in our brains every single day. Imagine having a lot of these thoughts stored every day. And we put more information and videos into our heads these days. So I meditate for an hour before going to bed and throw away unnecessary thoughts. Meditation helps intuition be awakened. And accurate judgments can be made only when we look back on the countless thoughts we had during the day and throw them away.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/otelmgsj0y57kxa6', 'title': ""What's the best brain hack you know?"", 'score': {'original': 0.0004, 'ai': 0.9996}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am not a neuroscientist, but an ordinary housewife in my mid-40s, and I would like to introduce you to the things I practice every day in my life.\n\n1.

Drink your morning coffee.\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning, I drink my morning coffee. I start my day leisurely while watching BBC news and news about the Corona situation in Korea. I love this time of the day the most.\n\n2. Be sure to walk for an hour a day.\n\nIf you walk an hour, that's 10,000 steps. Sometimes I go to the bank or go shopping without getting in the car on purpose. On days when there is no need to go to the bank or buy anything, choose a walking course and walk on flat ground while feeling the weather. As you walk, you can hear the sound of the wind, and hear the chirping of geese flying far south, giving you a sense of the seasons. I am happy to be able to walk on two strong legs.\n\n3. I do not spend unnecessary money.\n\nAs a housewife who has been married for 15 years, I always try to reduce unnecessary consumption. If you have a lot of stuff in your house, you always have to put your energy into organizing them. And above all else, the house was cluttered and I couldn't concentrate on my thoughts. So, I buy only the essentials and clean up the garbage right away. If I consume something that does not fit the level, I feel anxious.\n\n4. Make a note of what to do today\n\nWhen you make an appointment while talking on the phone with a friend, you immediately write a note in your cell phone diary. Dental appointments and special lecture dates for children's art classes are all taken down. And in the morning, I look at my diary, check the promises I have to keep today, and write them down in my notebook. And I have a few things to do today. And each time a mission is completed, it is marked with a single line. I am so proud of myself on the day I completed my mission.\n\n5. I do a team project.\n\nI have the most honorable job as a mother of two. And a side job is teaching meditation in a middle school. I love this job, a meditation teacher. I am so proud to be able to play such a small role because not only the children I give birth to but also the children in the community need to be looked after by someone. I work with meditation teachers like me and have an idea meeting for a good class at least once a week. It is not easy to get together with colleagues to gather opinions and come to a single conclusion. Sometimes we fight. Sometimes we ignore other people's suggestions. That's why we get hurt. But with the heart of building a house, we put our best efforts to provide good classes to children. After I and my fellow teachers' experience of coexisting with, I can approach students confidently. We practice happy coexistence and happy life through team projects.\n\n6.

Rajju Manju,Updated 3y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"When you gift someone if you say, I am going to give a big surprise gift and all, they will expect more and end up with a sigh . So instead of that if you keep it simple, don't exaggerate and you can say, I got a small gift for you, hope you like it. They don't expect high and when they see the gift they may jump with joy. Keeping a low profile is the hack.
If you are bargaining , Don't use negative words as, Can't you reduce the price? Shopper definitely says No. Instead of that just ask, You can reduce a bit right.. Or I really appreciate if you reduce the price, maintaining a good tone. That adds positive vibes and most of the time it works even to get your work done by others. positive attitude is the hack.
If someone irritates you saying what color dress you wearing, what shoes are these, what's your salary and all. You switch their concentration asking, how beautiful your dress is, your watch is or anything which is little worth. They will forget everything and start bragging about them. Diverting concentration is the hack.
In a group of people, if you want to draw attention, when speaker is not even looking at you, when you are the one who is listening attentively. Start nodding your head slightly on every sentence. Speaker thinks you are on their side and they start to focuss on you. Showing that you really listening is the hack.
If you want to work fast, play fast music by the side. That increases the speed of your work. Similarly listening soft music helps during meditation. Pace is the hack.
To improve communication skills, read everyday and write at least a paragraph of new words and practice in front the mirror, that escalates your communication skills. Building confidence is the hack.
Ignore haters at the beginning itself. If once you start explaining them about yourself , they will make you miserable. So block the entrance. Being proactive is the hack.
Don't seek any validation from outside. Learn to Enjoy your own company because only you can help yourself, no one can. Enjoying your own company is the hack.
Career failure, relationship failures are just a phase, don't overthink. Want to cry, go for it because the hormones helps to reduce the pain and Move on step by step. Never Give up is the hack.
If you want to become like someone or want to buy a big asset something as big car, house etc in future, just stick the pic on the wall of your room. It motivates you everytime when your eyes fell on the picture.
Don't ever depend on followers or likes on social media, that doesn't help you in your difficult time. Train your mind to give little quality time to family. In long run, without your knowledge, it will boost your confidence, your overall mental and physical health. Because family is the only thing who loves you, with all your flaws and supports you in tough times.

Andy Manoske,Updated 8y,How close to reality are the depictions of hacking in Mr. Robot?,"I'm a huge fan of this show, and as a security professional working in threat intelligence / security research I'm floored by how much work has gone into making this show pretty realistic - even so far as mentioning malware that my team has done research on IRL.

The Limitations of TOR:


The privileged nature of being a TOR exit node has made privacy exports who use TOR wary and generally avoid establishing circuits through nodes like this one that are suspiciously close to organizations like NSA

As anon stated well, the vulnerability that Elliot describes exploiting to de-anonymize his target is real, though not so much the result of a flaw in Tor as a limitation of the protocol.

Elliot says he controlled a sufficient number of Tor exit nodes to correlate the traffic back to his target, noting that ""once you had enough exit nodes you could control the traffic.""

Control is a harsh word. As anon well explained, exit nodes are basically the shephards between the Tor network and websites and servers outside on the ""regular"" web. If that traffic was encrypted, as anon rightfully notes, Elliot's role as master of N-number of exit nodes doesn't really matter because he can't see what Ron is sending unless he breaks that encryption.

Vulnerabilities like Heartbleed and the most recent Man in the Middle attack on OpenSSL show that it's more than possible to break HTTPs encryption and get at user's data - even if it's expensive or extremely hard to do

That, as we have seen with OpenSSL's recent patch, isn't impossible to do but does require the exploitation of exotic or even 0-day vulnerabilities to pull off properly. Elliot is presumably one of the top 1% of security researchers in the world, so he could have access to this data and make use of it. But still, this is pretty hard to do.

To add to some critique of the realism of this hack, Elliot maintaining command over a sufficient number of exit nodes to de-anonymize someone is a little ridiculous given he's one man. The only people with the technological resources (as well as the statistical acumen and computing power) to pull off statistical de-anonymization attacks to properly ""guess"" attribution of traffic are folks like the NSA, and even then it's not an easy thing to do given how many exit nodes there are out there.

If you're interested in this topic, I wrote a pretty lengthy blog post in the past on how you hack Tor and pull off attacks like the statistical analysis Elliot mentions in the series here: Hacking Tor
.

The DDoS Attack on Evil Corp

This isn't so much technology as culture/people, but the reaction of EvilCorp and their retained MSSP to F-Society's brutal DDoS is pretty accurate in terms of what major corporations do when they're hit with similar types of attacks.

First, in the episode Elliot's boss Gideon says that they should call up their CDN and try to cut traffic at the provider level. This is pretty common as a response, and there are a host of companies like Cloudflare (who I think was also mentioned in this series) exist to deal with this kind of problem.

That doesn't seem to work though, which is fairly realistic as many modern methods of DDoS are more about exploiting imbalances in the data sent/recieved in protocols than just ramming hundreds of slaved machines' traffic down your throat. A protocol-based DDoS like that could be something outside of the scope of the CDN's control and necessitate manual intervention on the behalf of security staff.

Right before they sprint off to the data center in a private jet - which is so unnecessary given that as their MSSP they already have remote access to Evil Corp's infrastructure but whatever - Gideon mentions that they should call up Prolexic.

Prolexic is a real DDoS mitigation company, and just like Sony dialing up Mandiant after the North Korean attacks this is a frequent step done to get subject matter experts on that style of attack into the room to help with the post mortem of the attack.

The Portrayal of Remote Access Trojans (Evil Corp's attack, hacking Michael's computer)

RAT (or Remote Access Trojans) have been employed in several episodes of the show, and were used both by F-Society to hit ECorp in the pilot as well as to break into Ollie's computer and monitor him and Allison.

In real life, RATs are some of the most common types of malware employed by hackers of all skill levels and means. The attack that hit Ollie and Allison was a little ridiculous as an installation vector (waiting outside their house and getting them to run a CD to listen to your music), but it's a pretty old school way of getting users to install a RAT - having users execute files accidentally or that they believe are legitimate files or executables.

In terms of application, the RAT that the mercenary hacker uses to control Michael's computer bares a lot of resemblance to a RAT called DarkComet.

DarkComet is a controversial remote administration software that can have legitimate purposes, but is frequently used by hackers because of its ability to clandestinely install itself and control/monitor all aspects of a computer. The webcam scene where the mercenary watches Allison shower is unfortunately well precedented in security, and there are scores of groups across the Dark Web that traffic stolen voyeuristic webcam video.

The RAT installed by FSociety was less flashy and was used to exfiltrate data anonymously as well as control Evil Corp's IT infrastructure. This is a frequent technique, seen in most of the major data breaches including the recent attacks on Anthem and OPM, and the software they describe bares a resemblance to software such as the infamous Sakula family of malware.

Tyrrell Hacking an Android Phone

In the third episode Tyrell hacks an Android phone in order to....well we're not really sure what he's doing, Tyrell is kind of crazy.

How he does it makes a lot of sense though. Mr. Robot takes a very in depth approach to showing him running a boot loader off of a chip he inserts into the phone. He then runs an application, which installs malware onto the phone that allows him to presumably monitor his target's activity.

The application that Tyrell uses, Flexispy, is a real smartphone monitoring tool. Again, pretty realistic shout out.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/75k6gzar4hve0pm2', 'title': 'How close to reality are the depictions of hacking in Mr. Robot?', 'score': {'original': 0.44713333333333, 'ai': 0.55286666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I\'m a huge fan of this show, and as a security professional working in threat intelligence / security research I\'m floored by how much work has gone into making this show pretty realistic - even so far as mentioning malware that my team has done research on IRL.\n\nThe Limitations of TOR:\n\n\nThe privileged nature of being a TOR exit node has made privacy exports who use TOR wary and generally avoid establishing circuits through nodes like this one that are suspiciously close to organizations like NSA\n\nAs anon stated well, the vulnerability that Elliot describes exploiting to de-anonymize his target is real, though not so much the result of a flaw in Tor as a limitation of the protocol.\n\nElliot says he controlled a sufficient number of Tor exit nodes to correlate the traffic back to his target, noting that ""once you had enough exit nodes you could control the traffic.""\n\nControl is a harsh word.

Michael Collins,4y,Can 3-7 lines of code hack (glitch) a computer?,"Do not under any circumstances do this!

It’s easy on a mac from the terminal you can do it in one line.

:(){ :|: & };: 

:() This says we’re defining a function called :

{ Is the start of the function.

:|: & This is the function itself. It’s saying to run the function : and to output of the function to the function : in the background &

} this closes the function

; tells us we’ve finished the first command and we’re ready for the next one

: Tells the system to run the : function we defined above

Basically the function creates two copies of itself. Each copy then creates two copies which in turn…

The & means that if you kill off any of the processes it won’t affect any of the child processes.

Franklin Veaux,Updated 6y,Is there an OS that the CIA can’t hack?,"Several, I imagine. They'd probably have difficulty with TOPS-20, not because it's secure but because it's obsolete (the last DECsystem-20 mainframe on earth was probably switched off before the current crop of CIA cybergoons was out of grade school). That one scene in Independence Day aside, a hacker is unlikely to be able to hack an operating system she’s never seen before.

Similarly, massively customized operating systems are likely to be a hard target. IBM’s zOS is based on Linux (edit: runs Linux in a limited container), but the Linux instances running under zOS have been modified to such an extent and are sandboxed to such a degree it's at least possible the Linux penetration tools in the CIA’s toolkit might not work on them.

Operating systems running in a VM are a hard nut, especially if the VM supervisor is running on a different operating system. For instance, I run Windows 10 in a VM on my Mac. The big-standard Windows tools will work, sure, but then you're only compromised a VM that has nothing more interesting than Skyrim, Command & Conquer, and Age of Empires on it. To go any further, you have to jump outside the VM somehow—difficult, but (sometimes) doable—but now you're in a macOS environment, and you suddenly have to contend with the fact that you somehow need to launch a macOS exploit from a Windows environment.

I won't say it can't be done, but man, what a headache. And if you were to learn that macOS environment were itself just running in a nested VM? Ugh. (I did this once, ran OS X 10.6.8 under OS X 10.9 and ran Windows XP inside OS X 10.6.8, just to see if I could. It turns out it does work. Someone should write a Broadway musical about it called “The Dance of the Obsolete Operating Systems.”)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rkq0xefy62831tzj', 'title': 'Is there an OS that the CIA can’t hack?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Several, I imagine.

Adrian J. Zarazua,Updated 3y,Why is the return of the hacker group Anonymous in 2020 such a big deal?,"The return of the Hacker group Anonymous is a huge deal because they're known for hacking governments and exposing them. Now, I'll leave up to you to decide if they're for the common good or not. Here's a brief history of the group.

Anonymous emerged on the site 4chan back in 2003, with the whole purpose of creating a coalition of hackers to form a digital hive, typically distinguished by the Guy Fawkes masks they wear in their videos. So what's all the fuss about them? Well, to start they've successfully hacked public government servers in the United States, Iraq, Uganda, Israel, and even corporations like PayPal, Sony, Microsoft, and Mastercard.

Eventually, after building up their reputation, they were declared one of Time's 100 most influential people in 2012. In essence, everyone was afraid of what they could accomplish, so much so, they were labeled a national security threat in the US. One of their most famous attacks happened in 2008 when they targeted the Church of Scientology with nonstop DDoS attacks, email viruses, and prank calls. Anonymous pretty much put a halt to the movement, even after celebrities like Tom Cruise and John Travolta endorsed it.

Another noteworthy case was that in 2012, where Anonymous exposed businesses accused of homophobia by releasing names, phone numbers, and emails of Westboro Church members. If you don't know what the church stands for, they're known for hate speech against the LGBT+ community, Catholics, Christians, atheists, Muslims, US politicians, Jews, and soldiers.

They've also helped the Arab Spring Movements back in 2011 by creating a script that Tunisians could use to protect their privacy on the internet from government surveillance.

In 2020, the group is back, motivated by the senseless murder of George Floyd with a message for the US government.

Since coming back, they've taken down the Minneapolis Police Department website, and they're likely to do much more in the time coming.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1bkqy69a3x0crpmi', 'title': 'Why is the return of the hacker group Anonymous in 2020 such a big deal?', 'score': {'original': 0.3429, 'ai': 0.6571}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The return of the Hacker group Anonymous is a huge deal because they're known for hacking governments and exposing them.

Sarah Maqsood,5y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"When you are so conscious, or tensed, your shoulders and jaws are stretched, relax them and you will feel comfortable.
Wanna become more wanting? Here's a tip, when leaving a discussion or group, leave with saying something funny or inspirational, so that when you go, THEY CAN FEEL THE CHANGE..! I learned that tip from my teacher.
The one who likes you, will never ignore any topic that's about you.
You can tell how much you like someone by how strong is the urge to check your phone when you are with them.
When you feel like you need something but you can't figure it out, it's ALWAYS water.
Simply touching money can help you reduce physical and emotional pain.
You remember something that is written with blue ink more than with black ink.
People will remember not what you said, but what you made them feel.
If you ask someone a question and they say, wait. Then stay silent and make eye contact with them, they will start talking.
When someone is being angry at you, staying silent will make them feel ashamed later.
The more you share your private stuff with someone, the more they will trust you.
If someone doesn't like you, ask to borrow their pencil, some psychological trick, they'll start to like you.
When you're arguing with someone and start laughing, it'll make them even madder, so it's a good way to win a trivial argument.
Girls listen to you more, if you compliment their appearance.
Silence, isn't gonna help you getting famous, world of 2018 likes funny people.
The more you stay calm, the more smart you think.

Michelle - MAD PIRATE QUEEN,2y,How do I make it seem like I’m a evil hacker?,"If you just want to make it *seem* like you’re an evil hacker (mwah ha ha ha!) then Hackertyper
 is probably the site you want.

As soon as you’re on, you can frantically type nonsense on your keyboard and it automatically starts scrolling hacker type guff on your screen:

In addition to that, it will throw up red boxed “access denied” messages (and similar using specific commands).

If you want to truly sell them on this though, you’ll need to run multiple monitors (because evil hackers always have multiple monitors) and in addition to that, you’ll need to slam douchebag energy drinks and litter the cans all over the floor.

When frantically (and nonsensically) typing, you’ll also need to keep up a running commentary by snarling things at the screen like:

“I SEE you, You think I can’t see you? You think you can hide from me?!”
Your code is WEAK, B!tch!
Get sum! I’m coming for you, you can’t keep me out!

Finally, when one of your other friends knocks on the door, scream “It’s THE FEDS!” and start throwing CD’s in the microwave and stuffing bits of paper in your mouth and chewing frantically.

That’s the sort of stuff that most people (who aren’t hackers or don’t know hackers) are under the impression that hacking is.

Apparently the reality is far more mundane.

David Seidman,Updated 4y,How do hackers know when they have been caught (I'm writing a scene for a novel)?,"Franklin Veaux's answer to How do hackers know when they have been caught (I'm writing a scene for a novel)? is correct as it pertains to criminal hackers. But when considering government attackers like intelligence agencies, the kind my work focuses on, the game is a bit different.

So the defenders have found a breach. Damn, we're compromised, yay, we found it. So let's reformat that computer and reset the user's password, right? Wrong.

Mistake #1: if you start remediating before you know the extent of the breach, the attackers can see some of their “assets"" getting reset and they know you've found them. But you probably haven't found everything, and now they know to make all necessary efforts to hide their tracks.

Okay, so instead of reformatting that computer, you call your whole security team in, brief them and have everyone investigate.

Mistake #2: The attacker may have compromised some members of the security team. Information must be distributed strictly on a need to know basis.

So you carefully investigate without saying too much. You upload a sample to VirusTotal, hoping someone else has seen it.

Mistake #3: Attackers watch VirusTotal too. Instead of uploading data to VirusTotal, you email a few close contacts at other companies asking if they've seen anything like this.

Mistake #4: One of those companies was also compromised and the attacker saw your email.The security team starts reverse engineering the malware.

Mistake #5: one of them uses an improper sandbox and allows the malware to phone home. The attacker notices the malware repeatedly pinging the command server and infers that it's being reverse engineered.

The company's lawyers advise that the breach has triggered legal requirements to notify customers.

Not really a mistake #6: The attackers read about the breach in the news.

Steve Baker,Updated 5y,Can you write a piece of code that is susceptible to be hacked and then demonstrate how a hacker would hack it?,"In order to avoid giving the idiots more ammunition - I’m going to give you an old, outdated example.

It expresses the KINDS of things that can go wrong - but hopefully, few programs would still fall victim to it.

In the C programming language, there was a function called “gets” for reading a line of ASCII text from some input stream:

  char *gets( char *buffer) ; 

So you run this - it reads in data (e.g. stuff typed in at the keyboard) into the buffer until it sees a “return” character.

So maybe we have some incompetent programmer who writes this:

bool checkPassword () 
{ 
  char buffer [ 100 ] ; 
  int hasPermission = 0 ; 
 
  printf ( ""Please enter your password: "" ) ; 
  gets(buffer) ; 
 
  if ( strcmp ( buffer, ""wybbl3"" ) == 0 ) 
    hasPermission = true ; 
  else 
    printf ( ""Incorrect Password!\n"" ) ; 
 
  return hasPermission ; 
} 

(By now, “real” programmers are having chills and flashbacks and a vague nauseous feeling in the pit of their stomach!)

So - “checkPassword()” sets “hasPermission” to 0 (no permission) - then it asks you to type in your password - and if it’s “wybbl3” then it sets “hasPermission” to ‘1’ (permission granted) - or else it says “Incorrect Password!” and returns ‘0’ - which is “false”.

For “normal” password inputs, this works OK. Whoever tests the code probably types in a few incorrect passwords - tries the correct password - maybe tries hitting RETURN without a password - and it seems to work flawlessly - so it gets added into production code.

BUT if the input stream happens to contain more than 100 characters (99, actually) - it’ll need more space than there is in “buffer”.

In C, there is no way for the function to know how much space there is in the array - so if too much data is sent - then…well…what exactly does happen?

Well - in the example above, the “buffer” is a local variable - so it’s stored on the stack…and so is “hasPermission”.

So IF some evil-doer wants to hack into your computer - all (s)he has to do is to type more than 100 completely garbage characters into the computer at the password prompt!

There isn’t enough space in the buffer for (say) 101 characters - so the 101st character is just mindlessly stuffed into the next memory location - which is the first byte of the “hasPermission” variable!

Now, the string compare fails because the bad guy didn’t know the password - but it doesn’t matter beca...

Sai Nikhil Reddy,Updated 5y,What great things have hackers done?,"Do you know this hacking group?

Famous for their hacking without leaving a sign of their identity :)

So, many would end up saying, “They are internet trouble makers”.

Ever heard that they did great things? Majority of them end up saying “No“.

They helped fighting Government Tyranny in Iran.

When Iran’s Leader Mahmud was in State of re-election in the year 2009, His government shut down Opposition’s media channel, Restrcited Internet service and indeed went against Freedoom of speech for Iranian citizen. It was then Anonymous came into the play by uplifting the restrictions of Internet and media services, Thus, restored the faith in fair elections.

Former Iranian president Mahmud.

2. When Anonymous shut down numerous websites linked to child pornography.

Believe it or not, a decade ago, back in 2007, Anonymous did this good deed by posting the accused people’s name on the web openly, nearly 1,500 members were accused of promoting it.

3. When Anonymous took down ISIS via online battle.

Soon after Paris terrorist attacks, Anonymous, declared online hacking war on ISIS. Soon they were able to clear off 2000+ accounts linked with Pro-ISIS activist accounts on Social media. Currently Anonymous cleared down more than 10,000 accounts linked in support to ISIS or any other of it’s allied group.

Other recognised works done by Anonymous:

4. Supported LGBT Bill for people of Uganda.

5. Published the Corruption reports of Nigerian Government after seeing through the condition of the country with lack of development like, illiteracy, poor health care,etc.

6. Back in 2013, Attacked North Korea by shutting down all 3 functioning websites in their country in order to prevent smooth communication. So, that North Korea can stop unwanted missile testing.

Didn’t Anonymous do a few good things? Restored faith in Humanity.

Harsh Agrawal,1y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Scared of Saying no to People?

Instead of Saying no (or worse, saying yes), ask for permission to say no.

“Is it ok if I say no?”

Most People will accept your no, this way.

Last Month, A Girl asked me out for a coffee but i was in hurry to reach somewhere , most people get nervous and hesitate to deny. I just asked her, “Hey, I am Sorry but Is it ok if i say no this time? I have to reach somewhere but I surely owe you a coffee”

She smiled and said “No issues, we will have some other time”

2. Struggle to Invest?

Whenever you spend on anything that is a desire/wish (clothes, phone, eating out etc), transfer an equivalent amount to a separate bank account.

This way you will enjoy your present, while planning for the future.

Apart from my SIPs, whenever i go out for eating i deposit the same amount i spent on eating in my DEMAT account.

3. Feel Under-Confident?

Fake it till you make it! Fake your confidence, Trick your mind with powerful reinforcements. Instead of saying “I think” or “I am not sure” say “I believe” or “I am certain”

Once i was there in a Award Ceremony, i was youngest of all outstanding people present out there. I was very nervous and Under- Confident. What I did? I just went in a small group with Confidence in my walk, started conversing with sentence like “I am very sure” or “I am certain” and voila in no time i was one of them!

4. Want to Master Something?

Start Teaching it. Teach it to anyone. It works even if you teach yourself or even a charger. I am big Fan of Richard Feynman and his work. He once said, “If you want to master something, Teach it”

Thats How We started NEETero with the aim of Changing the Perspective of Education.

I will add more things if i think they are worth adding. Till then apply these in your life and observe the change. Hope this might really save you someday. Share your thoughts in comments.

Thank You!

Mom: Himalayas? You know what you are talking about? It's too dangerous.

Me: I know. It will be a good experience. Darr ke aagey jeet hai (Victory is when you have faced your fear)

Abhishek Nayak,Updated 10y,When have you most successfully hacked a non-computer system to your advantage?,"Not sure if this can be called a hack but I traveled to Europe five times in a period of ten months on fully sponsored trips as a student. I didn't spend a single penny on hotels or flight tickets. That was the most extraordinary year of my life. Long version below.

In early 2009 after my 7th semester at BITS, I had decided to intern for a semester at a small renewable energy financial data research company now owned by Bloomberg and figure life out without the pressures of classes and exams. Sometime during that semester I decided that I just had to travel to Europe before graduating. The problem was that I was a poor student and there was no way my parents would fund an expensive holiday. So I began to figure out the best ways of getting there without having to buy a flight ticket.

Trip 1:
Switzerland
I found out that there was the St Gallen Symposium which would sponsor my entire trip to Switzerland if I got selected in an essay competition whose theme was Revival of Political and Economic Boundaries. The topic was incomprehensible for an undergrad biological sciences student but after 3 months of intense reading and research I understood economic theories and political systems well enough to write an essay which got me selected.

I was shocked and elated when I got the acceptance email and was even more elated when I realized that the free trip was really a free trip and not a sham. Seriously.

I had five incredible days at the life changing conference which had some extraordinary students from 80 countries interested in economics or business. After the conference I spent ten more days couch-surfing my way around in Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Germany.

Trip 2:
Denmark
Just within a few months after my Switzerland trip I was yearning to go back to Europe again and I figured that there had to be more conferences which would sponsor me. I found one which selected individuals who could blog regularly about environment and energy problems. This was a cake walk because I was obsessed with environmental problems and my internship was in renewable energy financial research. After a short interesting conference at Copenhagen, I spent a few days traveling around with my sister and a friend who had also been selected.

Trip 3:
Denmark again and Sweden
This trip was as a part of a youth delegation to the much hyped UN climate change conference in 2009 called COP-15. When I got selected for this, I felt like I was living in a dream because I couldn't believe that I could really have pulled off a third fully funded trip.

Extraordinary conference with citizens from all the UN member countries. Hung out and partied with passionate activists and hippies. Spent a week at the conference and another week after that traveling in Sweden.

Trip 4:
Belgium
This was for a conference on impending challenges of clean water. By this time it was no longer a challenge to go through the process of applying for a sponsorship to attend a conference.

Trip 5:
Italy
The last fully sponsored trip was for a conference for youth leaders in a tiny Italian town. I couldn't travel too much because I was back in college with limited holidays.

End result:
I traveled in seven countries for forty five days in a period of ten months and spent ~USD 1000 in total from my own pocket while benefiting from sponsorship worth about USD 6000. I met the most extraordinary and interesting people from over 100+ countries. I am a facebook message away from finding a roof in 35-40 countries. My perspective about the world, its problems and its people expanded beyond what I had read before. Suddenly Africa wasn't just Africa but a continent with distinctly different countries, cultures and languages.

The above conferences tended to be attended by passionate people with causes bigger than themselves, so most individuals I met had a rich and interesting life which was mind expanding for a twenty year old introvert who had lived his entire life in just one city. Every single night was an international party night, what else would you expect when you get young folks in a new city. :) These people also tended to be a lot more fun, open minded and happier in general than my regular friends. I was surprised that couchsurfers would open their homes and kitchens to people they've only exchanged emails with.

This adventure changed me and my elusive life goals were suddenly clear as day. If you are a student, strongly suggest you try this hack at home. :)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/evysn0x3odq94ihk', 'title': 'When have you most successfully hacked a non-computer system to your advantage?', 'score': {'original': 0.4914, 'ai': 0.5086}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Not sure if this can be called a hack but I traveled to Europe five times in a period of ten months on fully sponsored trips as a student.

Joel Kaplan,6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Going to a coffee shop to get some work done?

Leave your charger at home.

Why?

Because after 2–3 hours at the coffee shop, your computer will die.

That means that if you don’t complete your task or project in that time frame, you will have to drive all the way back home to get your charger…

This little hack will increase your productivity and help you overcome procrastination like never before.

Why does it work so well?

Because the hardest part in overcoming procrastination and increasing productivity is starting. And this little hack creates a huge sense of urgency that lights a fire in you and gets you going. It also makes it really annoying if you go all the way to the coffee shop for nothing… so it will motivate you to at least get started and take action.

Go and try this hack for yourself…

And watch your productivity soar.

Just don’t bring your charger with you : )

When closing Chrome, don’t close use using the X in the top right corner. Instead, click the 3 dots right below the X and click Exit(Press Ctrl+Shift+Q for quicker action). It’ll save you more RAM and CPU usage.
Don't ask your girl where she wants to eat. Instead, tell her to guess where you're taking her to eat. Then take her to the first guess.
When an interviewer asks how you are, it’s better to say “a little nervous” rather than “good/fine”

(It’s personable, memorable, and not to mention it gives you the benefit of the doubt. Just make sure your attitude is upbeat when you say it!).

If you're having trouble sleeping, try blinking 100-200 times. It will get your eyes heavy and lazy and make your brain tired from counting.
Put your phone into ""Do Not Disturb"" mode when showing someone something on your phone. It will keep any private information from popping up and can save embarrassment.
If a friend / family member asks you a seemingly simple question, consider that they may just want to spend more time with you.
Do not store your sunglasses in your car's ""sunglasses box,"" because the heat inside the car warps the frame as well as the lenses.
If you have to cancel plans with someone, immediately ask them when they are free again in the future and make replacement plans. it makes people feel like you do really care about seeing them and you appear less flaky.

Clifford Hilton,3y,Is there anyone that has done a credit hack?,"“When I started university I had always worked – I’ve worked since I was 15 – but once I started my course I couldn’t hold down my job the same as I could before.

“I soon found that my student loan was just enough to cover my rent, so I had absolutely nothing left which was a struggle.i persevered by working part-time, however, still found myself strapped for cash. Then, one day, i came across a payday loan advert.

“One day I was browsing on the laptop at uni and saw a pop up advert saying $2000 cash in 10 minutes’ and all I could think was ‘wow, what do I do?’”

The loan offered quick relief for me at the time, but as my student years continues i found myself falling further and further into debt at the mercy of payday loans.

I didn’t read any of the terms and conditions whatsoever. The money, the $2000 was in my bank – that was fine – but then it got to payday and I was $1800 down.

“It spiraled out of control, and it wasn’t necessarily the amount of money I’d borrowed, it was the interest that I couldn’t keep up with. That’s what really just started snowing me under.”

Living with debt began to take its toll on my mental health and when i finally reached breaking point, i knew i had to take action.

It literally felt like I had a dark cloud hanging over me – constantly panicking and shaky to the point where I’d just cry for no reason and I just thought this isn’t normal.

“So I sat down, and for the first time in like a year and a half, wrote everything down -what I owed, who I owed, what I had coming in, what was going out – and I just cried for about two hours.”

Realizing i needed help, I wasn’t sure where to turn. That’s when Donald Stinson came in.

“I freaked out, and I thought ‘I don’t know what to do like I’m so scared’. After that, an email came up on my phone, and straight away I knew I had to do something.

“I just clicked on that and that’s when I thought ‘yeah, I’m going to have to do something’.” i reviewed my accounts in my emails and tried to make sense of everything

After contacting Donald Stinson , i was able to know and understand what my options were. Now, I can live my life without that dark cloud hanging over me, allowing me to see the light at the end of the tunnel.I know what I’ve got coming in, what I’ve got going out and I don’t have to worry any more. I don’t have to worry about that interest building up, and I know that at this certain time frame, I’m going to be debt free and I’m going to be fine.”Getting help with my debts has turned my life around, but it’s not just my finances i feel better about.The biggest change for me, was me. I’m happier, I’m talking to my mum and dad all the time and I don’t feel sick all the time. I think it was making me poorly, I genuinely was ill from it, and now I don’t feel any of that. It was literally the best decision of my life, and it has actually changed my life, cheesy as that sounds, it has changed my life.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ld4brc0hzyie9a3s', 'title': 'Is there anyone that has done a credit hack?', 'score': {'original': 0.50165, 'ai': 0.49835}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“When I started university I had always worked – I’ve worked since I was 15 – but once I started my course I couldn’t hold down my job the same as I could before.\n\n“I soon found that my student loan was just enough to cover my rent, so I had absolutely nothing left which was a struggle.i persevered by working part-time, however, still found myself strapped for cash.

Abhishek Bera,6y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"So I tried this yesterday for a legit reason.

Background Story:

There was a guy who was continuously calling my friend(female) and asking her name and address. Now one call is enough to know that it is a wrong number, two calls might be by mistake but not 20+ calls. She blocked him yet he called her at least 8 times a day. Her name is available on Truecaller and the caller got her name and started asking her for address. Her friends, she and I wanted to know who that guy is. We were getting more and more desperate with every call she received. After a few days, the calls stopped and he started calling from new numbers. Obviously none of the numbers they used was on truecaller with any legit name.

The Eureka Moment!:

One fine morning I woke up with an idea which had a very less probability of working. I remembered Paytm shows the name of the registered receiver upon sending money. So I sent the guy Re. 1/- and boom!.

We are planning to take this to the police and bring such people, who think they will get away with stalking and harassment just because they are online, to justice. Will keep you guys posted on the matter.

Teach your children to respect everybody.

Technology is power, use it wisely.

Priyanka Sinha,7y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"Refer to people you’ve just met by their name. People loving being referred to by their name, and it will establish a sense of trust and friendship right away…
People have a certain image of themselves and will fight tooth and nail to cling to it. Use this information wisely. You can make people dislike you by attacking their self-image.
False attribution of arousal. When you take somebody out on a first date, take them somewhere exciting that will get their heart beating. e.g. roller coaster or horror film. This gets their adrenaline up. It makes them think they enjoy spending time with you rather than the activity.
Use a silly code word or phrase to defuse an argument.Typically someone will calm down enough to remember to say the words then the other person will laugh and the argument will stop. Sounds a bit crazy but it works really well. I guess it helps to make you realise that most arguments are over silly things.

Spot people’s sympathies when they laugh: Out of all the psychological life hacks, this one can turn out to be really valuable. Whenever you’re standing in a group and laughter breaks out, it’s a golden chance for you to see who likes you the most. Typically, each one in the group will instinctively glance at that particular individual that they like/trust the most in the group. This little psychological hack is not only helpful to spot people whom you are sympathetic, but also a nice way of figuring out who is secretly in a relationship or having a deep affection for each other.
Use the power of silence: One psychological hack to accomplish this is to simply make use of the power of silence. If you’re not satisfied with an answer somebody gave you, remain silent and keep looking at them. Usually, the combination of awkward silence and firm eye contact will pressure your counterpart to bridge the silence by revealing more.

Franklin Veaux,Updated 4y,Why do some programmers create and spread viruses?,"Money.

The days when viruses were written by bored college students are long gone. Today, the overwhelming majority of computer viruses are written by organized crime for money.

They make money in a lot of ways:

Credential stealers sit on your computer doing nothing until you visit a bank or PayPal or something like that. Then they record your password and send it back to the authors.
Botnet malware places your computer under the control of the authors. They infect thousands or tens of thousands of computers, which they then use to attack other Web sites all at once, knocking them offline. They do this as part of extortion schemes: they tell web site owners “pay us protection money or we’ll knock you off the web.” Gambling sites are often targeted this way.
Remote server malware puts hidden Web or file server software on your computer. The criminals then sell access to your computer to people who want to serve illegal content like child porn.
Remote email malware sets up a hidden email server on your computer. The criminals then sell access to your computer to spammers, who use your computer to send spam emails.
Click fraud malware sets up a hidden program on your computer that silently and invisibly loads web pages over and over, then sends fake clicks on banner ads placed on those pages. The criminals get paid for each phony click,
Ransomware encrypts the files on your computer, then tells you to send money to the criminals to get your files back.

The few viruses that aren’t written by organized crime are often written by governments. China, Turkey, Russia, the US, and North Korea all write malware for various purposes, most often surveillance or sabotage.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v7e3y8q0zxt1m6pf', 'title': 'Why do some programmers create and spread viruses?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Money.\n\nThe days when viruses were written by bored college students are long gone.

Ayesha K,6y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"Avoid getting roasted.

If you think that someone is going to talk badly about you in a professional setting, sit next to that person. It is much harder to speak poorly of someone who's in close proximity to you, so they'll probably take it easy.

Use tiredness.

When someone is tired they are more susceptible to everything you say, whether it is a statement or a request. The reason is when people are tired their mental energy levels drop as well.

So when you ask a request of someone who is tired they’ll probably say “I’ll do it tomorrow,” because they don’t want to deal with decisions at the moment. The next day, they are likely to follow through because people tend to keep their word.

Get a song out of your mind.

If Dhinchak Pooja’s Selfie maine leli aaj is still stuck in your head, you are gonna thank me for this hack!

When you can’t get a song out of your mind, the best way to get rid of it is to think of the end of the track. As dictated by the Zeigarnik Effect, your mind will continue to think of things that have been left unfinished, so if you think of the end of the song, you'll be able to get it out of your system!

It worked for me. Thank goodness I am not murmuring it anymore.

Door in the face approach.

You start by throwing a really difficult request at someone—a request they will most likely reject. You then come back shortly thereafter and ask for something much less ridiculous—the thing you actually wanted in the first place.

The person is likely to do it this time for you because they already turned down your request the first time and also this time you are asking for something more reasonable.

Inception.

This one’s my favourite. If you want to start a thought in someone’s mind, ask them to not think of that idea at all. For example I tell you NOT to think about DIAMONDS.

What are you thinking of? :D

Thanks for reading :)

Kyle Dennett,6y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"An easy trick to make friends, really fast. Allow me to digress.

I look at these answers, and they’re all redundant. They are useless because everybody knows them. Things like, Eye contact, smile, and nod your head while they are talking. That’s bullshit, but it does work.

My method is incredibly fast. And here is how you do it.

When you see someone you want to connect with, you don’t need to do all of that weak shit. The only thing you need to worry about, and brace yourself, is matching their level of energy.

Kinda sounds complicated, right? Well it isn’t, really. Learn how to read someone. If they’re bored, you be bored too. If they’re super excited or hyper, you be super duper excited and ecstatically hyper as well. If they are being serious, you be serious too.

It’s the exact same principle as reading the room. You don’t go to a funeral and act all happy and excited, everyone will hate your enthusiastic ass. Same as going to a party and being depressed, nobody wants that lame stuff.

I picked this up really quickly after watching something amazing happen.

A man wanted a roommate and was taking applicants, this one dude walked in with an exuberant energy to him. He was excited and looking forward to it, the man matched his applicants energy and instantly connected with him. They started jumping on the couch, running around the apartment, just doing dumb things. After that, they became best friends and have been ever since.

MATCH THEIR ENERGY, IT’S SO STUPIDLY SIMPLE.

A bonus tip is to learn what they like, bring it up in conversation and listen to them rant about it for an hour. People love talking about themselves.

These tips will definitely help you out, my friend, because you are so damn likeable.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/grfmxh9zpuk6v3aq', 'title': 'What are some cool psychological hacks?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'An easy trick to make friends, really fast.

Amritesh Mukherjee,Updated 6y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"THE BEST WAY TO EXTRACT INFORMATION OUT OF SOMEONE

There is a general human trait which is termed as “the tendency to correct.”

This tendency is widely known and exploited:

In French, there is a saying prêcher le faux pour savoir le vrai (Translation- preach the falsehood to know the truth).

The FBI lists it as a human predisposition that an elicitor can take advantage of.

For spurring people into action, misinformation seems to do a better job than no information at all.

How to use it in real life, you may ask?

When asking a question, online or offline, reframe it so that it already contains a wrong answer or some misinformation:

“The planet nearest to sun is Mars, right?”

“My new phone from X can’t shoot video, should I change to the latest model by Y?”

In no time at all, you will have someone advising you how to shoot video with your phone.

When you want to know what your friend (or a criminal suspect, for that matter) did last weekend, bake a false statement into the question:

“So you went clubbing last weekend?”

“No, I was at my parent’s place!”

Here’s a trick using the same strategy for all parents:

“What did you do at school today, son?”

“Nothing.”

Happens a lot, isn’t it??

Instead of this, ask:

“Did you piggyback the principal across the hallways?”

“No, we had a math exam!”

When stuck in creative work, just throw something out there. Make a quick, even shitty first sketch of something and show it to your coworkers or clients and ask for feedback.

Often this will storm them into action, get them to offer their own ideas, and to refine your initial sketch. Sooner then you know it, you will have improved on the first shitty sketch and got past the creative block.

I know, it takes courage to show something that you know to be imperfect, but the faster you get through the block, the better the finished thing will turn out.

Don't ask a question, provide a misinformation and within no time, you will have your answer!!

Thanks for reading.

David Seidman,5y,How did David Seidman start with his hacking career?,"I was the stereotypical kid who took the clock apart (and the radio, and the telephone…). I taught myself to code around age 10 in an Apple IIe with a green monotone screen. Around age 13, having upgraded to a Mac, I learned how to install a system debugger and use it to reverse engineer programs from assembly. Mostly I just wanted to understand how programs worked, but I also fixed a few bugs and cracked a few shareware programs. Still feel a bit bad about that.

At school I got into trouble for hacking a couple times (and for fighting a bunch more times, but that's another story). One time, I was using HyperCard
 to make programs. The school has some lockdown software that allowed Hypercard to create files in locations I didn't have access to, but with some “work”, I got Hypercard to delete them too. Then another student took my disk and messed up half the computer lab, and somehow this was my fault.

Our school also had this “explore the body” software, which had a password on the sex organs. Too bad for them, the password (“guts”) was stored in plain text in the config file. The sex organ section also had a “say it” button, and on these older Macs if you clicked the button repeatedly the audio couldn't be interrupted. So we set up a chorus of machines around the lab saying “penis, penis, penis, penis…” The teacher was not amused and knew it was my fault, but they couldn't pin it on me.

In high school I got into other things, mostly sports. In college I did well at the CS curriculum, spent most of my time partying, and also got into cognitive science for a while. I didn't have any special coursework in security, although I did read some extra material when security came up in my classes.

I joined Microsoft out of college as a cog in the machine. My first project was managing Office 2003 SP3, which was a big security push similar to Windows XP SP2. Every bug that got fixed crossed my plate at least briefly. I learned a lot about security in the process, and every time I saw something I didn't understand I read about until I did. The team that managed Office security updates was another branch of my team, and they needed help so I signed up to join them. I spent 2 years fixing every externally reported vulnerability in Office, including 0-days - and there were a lot of them. That was when Office was the preferred way to deliver exploits.

After a brief stint at a non-security job I hated, I joined Microsoft's central security team, the Microsoft Security Response Center, as an incident responder. They had worked with me when I was with Office and offered me the job. One of my first incidents there was Stuxnet
, quite an intro. For 3 years I managed 0 day vulnerabilities, threatened 0 days, architectural security problems, any network breach that may or may not have happened, and all sorts of fun things I can't tell you about. After 3 years I became a manager, though I kept working some incidents until I left for Google 3 years later, and that's where I am today.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/i5k6d4hvqtbpl1rw', 'title': 'How did David Seidman start with his hacking career?', 'score': {'original': 0.1966, 'ai': 0.8034}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I was the stereotypical kid who took the clock apart (and the radio, and the telephone…).

Akhil Raj,Updated 6y,What are some cool psychological hacks?,"What make things cute.

Humans have evolved to subconsciously like and take care of babies. Due to the conditioning that we have gone through in thousands of years in taking care of babies, we find animals and even non living things with baby’s features cute.

Prerequisites to be cute.

A disproportionate head compared to the body.

Large disproportionate eyes compared to the face.

Human babies are born with fully developed eyes which looks disproportionate to their faces and needless to say makes them look adorable.

Round, soft or furry body. (Without sharp edges)

Non threatening: yes, this is a very critical criteria for us humans to brand anything as cute.

Just think about it for a while.

Most of us would find this pitbull puppy cute and might wanna play with it for a while.However……..

Jeez….this is definitely not where I parked my car.

One more example.

Wanna give him a “bear” hug?

What about now? Every camper’s worst nightmare eh?

So…..What's worth noting here is safety comes first!

Now let us look at some non living things which fits in the criteria of being cute.

You might not find this hammer cute.

How about this one?Cute eh?

We can even make saws look cute.

See,how the round edges made the saw and the hammer cute.

So basically our idea of cuteness is based on our love for baby’s features.

No wonder this car became so popular with its cute round shape and big head lights.

So the next time you wanna make something cute, you know what to do.

Somnath Mishra,7y,What is the most clever life hack you've learned?,"If you are streaming anything which is on a 15 min free trial just change the system time to an hour back after starting the stream. Also use incognito mode(Google Chrome).
People easily believe what they want to believe, use it to your advantage.
The best way to gain respect is firstly to give it.
If you don’t know what to say in a situation, just smile. It’s better than saying something stupid, it’s also better than complete silence.
If you are angry and want to say something, chances are you will say something stupid. Keep quiet in such situations, it only takes 5 minutes to calm down, those 5 minutes might make you regret your whole life.
Free Samples always work in a business, 90 percent of the people feel obliged to buy something after they tried the free sample.
Make more friends, you might come across quotes like having 5 good friends is better than having 50 time pass friends but guess what, both are not mutually exclusive. The more people you know the more you will benefit.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4nerdwuxsoztjb8q', 'title': ""What is the most clever life hack you've learned?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'If you are streaming anything which is on a 15 min free trial just change the system time to an hour back after starting the stream.
