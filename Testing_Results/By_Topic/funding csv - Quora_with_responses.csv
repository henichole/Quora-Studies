Roland Bartetzko,Updated 11mo,"Is Ukraine corrupt? If so, why is the USA protecting and funding a corrupt county?","It would be dishonest to state that there is no corruption in Ukraine or that corruption isn’t a problem here.

There is corruption. It was there before the war and it hasn’t disappeared.

You just need to check one of the English-language Ukrainian news sites such as the Kyiv Post or the Kyiv Independent: there isn't a week the Ukrainian prosecutor's office doesn’t open new proceedings against corrupted members of the local or central administration.

As I’m here helping to supply our friends in the Armed Forces of Ukraine with equipment, I’m especially concerned about cases where the military is involved. There were incidents where equipment (thankfully, not ours) ended up on the black market, where doctors have been paid to issue waivers that free people from military service, or where people collected funds or material and then just disappeared.

Fortunately (if you can tell it that), I come from a country where corruption was always rampant (Kosovo) and therefore, I have been prepared. I think it’s naive from us Westerners to think that everyone in Ukraine is a choir boy and we just have to send them our equipment and it will end up at the right place. Instead, we need to be careful and always keep an eye on our donations.

The United States and their Western allies are conducting checks and controls and as a result, most military aid goes where it should go. In addition, fighting corruption is also a precondition for Ukraine's government to receive more financial and military aid in the future.

Another problem that goes hand in hand with corruption is the bureaucracy, not only here but also in Poland. If you need a freaking paper with a stamp and a signature for every item you deliver to the Ukrainian people, you’re tempted to circumvent or shortcut the whole procedure (i.e. pay a bribe). Of course, this is the whole idea behind this bloated bureaucratic system, make people lose their patience and pay extra.

When you see the long rows of trucks waiting for several days on the Polish side of the border to deliver goods to Ukraine, it can make you furious.

Thankfully, there are signs of improvement. Some idiotic customs rules have been dropped and the Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) is now aggressively hunting down not only spies and saboteurs but also people who are damaging the war effort through corruption. Arrests are made daily and they even go after people in the higher echelons of power.

Ukraine has realized that corruption is its No.1 internal enemy now and I believe that the government’s attempts to fight this phenomenon are serious and honest.

If you want to help me support Ukrainian volunteers (civilian and military, foreigners and locals), please use the contact email in my profile description.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rhw382eykz9jxbqs', 'title': 'Is Ukraine corrupt?

Franklin Veaux,3y,"Should publicly funded science projects be required to have a ""practical"" purpose?","Oh goodness no. In fact, doing that is shortsighted and wasteful.

Every time you buy a spinning-rust hard drive, some of your money goes to the German government. Want to know why? Because they fund science with no clear practical purpose.

In the 1980s, Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg did research on how magnetism works over quantum distances. This led to the discovery of a weird quantum physics effect called “giant magnetoresistance,” for which they shared the 2007 Nobel Prize in physics.

The research was funded in part by the German government. In the mid-2000s, hard drives suddenly got a lot bigger in terms of capacity than they were, and laptop hard drives suddenly got a lot physically smaller. You know why? Because engineers figured out a way to exploit giant magnetoresistance to read very small magnetic domains on a magnetic surface.

They patented hard drive read/write heads that used giant magnetoresistance. Since the German government funded the research, it gets a share of patent royalties.

It’s really important to understand that when this research was done in the 1980s, there was absolutely no practical purpose in mind. Nobody was thinking about hard drives. Nobody was thinking anything but “pure research in quantum physics.”

That’s the way science works. First, we learn how the universe operates. Then later—sometimes decades later—someone figures out how to apply what we’ve learned.

Any nation that stops doing pure research with no practical benefit in mind soon loses out to nations that understand this.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0lodcpr6t87njg4u', 'title': 'Should publicly funded science projects be required to have a ""practical"" purpose?', 'score': {'original': 0.9945, 'ai': 0.0055}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Oh goodness no.

Stan Hanks,2y,Why is Reddit still relying on venture capital?,"Have a look at Jason M. Lemkin's answer to Why is Reddit still relying on venture capital? and let’s talk a bit about what’s under that.

Investors in any company are looking for a way not just to get their money back but to make really big returns on the money that they invested. The longer their investment “cooks”, the more that they need to get back in order to make it worth the risk.

Reddit has been around for a long time - 15 years. That’s… approximately forever in VC terms. Their Series A1 was in 2013, after the great reversion in limited partner hold time terms, and here 8 years later, those guys are dying - they wanted to have cashed out a couple years ago. So it’s time.

The question is… how. And how to make that at as big as possible a valuation.

Enter the art of the “mezzanine finance round”.

Back in the day, a mezzanine round did two things - first, it was a market signal, to set the floor value for an IPO; in this case, given that they raised $250M at a $6B valuation… you can expect that an IPO done reasonably rapidly, the next year, would be at a serious premium to that pricing. Second, it’s a way for the lead investment banks to bring in customers from their private bank business so that they can “get into the company” directly before the IPO. A lot of time when you see a venture capital group that you’ve never seen before showing up in a late-stage deal, that’s actually a syndicate of high net worth individuals and family office customers of the major investment banks jockeying for just such opportunity. Sure, can use some pull to buy at the open of the IPO… but if you play your cards right, you can be last money in before the IPO, at a steep, steep discount to the open.

So when you see a raise in a late stage company that doesn’t make sense? That’s likely what it is. You sometimes see that in early stage companies that are being prepped for acquisition - I saw a lot of those when I was working in PE..

There’s a decent chance that some variation on this is what’s going on with Reddit.

On the other hand… these guys are still spending money ahead of revenue. My guess is that they really needed the cash, for at least another year maybe two. Why? Well, while Reddit Is on Pace to More Than Double Its Ad Revenues By 2021
 that’s still not a lot of money. Currently they’re running about $100M-$150M in ad revenue. And I’m guessing that their infra and staff costs are over $220M a year.

Second, they’re swamped. Growth takes people to make it happen and based on this raise, Reddit to double employees after raising $250 million
. That’s like 700 people. If those are engineer-class people… that’s taking on an additional $250M per year in burn all by itself. Less, of course, if they’re tech support or marketing or business development, but the floor is probably $150M. Which is a pile of cash. That, oh hey! this just happens to pay for…

Lastly, while Reddit has been growing… and it says Reddit plots a path to $1B in ad sales, but first it needs to convince brands
 - the hard part is that last bit of “convincing brands”. There are a whole ton of ads focused on geeky techy stuff, but can you pull over toilet paper? kid’s shoes? dog food??

Remains to be seen. And while they’re figuring that out, it’s an expensive platform to run and they’ve hired even more people…

So the raise makes sense, from a couple of directions.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fmbz8kduv7cheowg', 'title': 'Why is Reddit still relying on venture capital?', 'score': {'original': 0.8255, 'ai': 0.1745}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Have a look at Jason M.

Raspenberry,Jan 12,Why should Canada continue to fund the CBC?,"My question is, how is defunding the CBC going to benefit me? I figure that with the CBC I get good, local, national and international, immaculately fact checked news coverage, anywhere in Canada in several different languages for a better price than I would with the privately owned media.

The argument has been made many times that Canada doesn’t need the CBC anymore to report the news as now their are great many private news sources that do that. Hence defund the CBC.

It just happens that I am fond of Conrad Black with whom, I do not agree on many subjects, but his posts in the National Post are always well thought out. The thing is that if I want to read his posts, I have to either go out a physical copy of the national Post or subscribe to the web site. I am always interested in reading what Althea Raj has to say about politics. To do that, I have to go and buy a print copy of the the Toronto Star, or pay for a subscription to the website. Ditto for Andrew Coyne over at the Globe and mail. The Toronto sun won’t let you read much on their website with out a subscription either.

Now consider this notion, in recent years, the Government has either given the News papers above a subsidy to help them stay afloat and passed the online News Act, which has led to Google kicking in $100 million dollars every year to help keep Canadian journalists employed by the above media.

It occurs to me, that not only am I paying taxes to support the CBC who provides all their news coverage to me for no extra charge, I am also paying taxes to support various other news media, who are only providing me their full news coverage if I pay extra for it.

Some how, I doubt that defunding the CBC is going to cause the rest of the media, to suddenly give me total access to their website. I doubt that if the CBC is defunded, those other news media are going to stop demanding for government support to stay afloat and subscription prices are going to go up anyway.

The Toronto sun won’t let you read much on their website with out a subscription either.\n\nNow consider this notion, in recent years, the Government has either given the News papers above a subsidy to help them stay afloat and passed the online News Act, which has led to Google kicking in $100 million dollars every year to help keep Canadian journalists employed by the above media.\n\nIt occurs to me, that not only am I paying taxes to support the CBC who provides all their news coverage to me for no extra charge, I am also paying taxes to support various other news media, who are only providing me their full news coverage if I pay extra for it.\n\nSome how, I doubt that defunding the CBC is going to cause the rest of the media, to suddenly give me total access to their website. I doubt that if the CBC is defunded, those other news media are going to stop demanding for government support to stay afloat and subscription prices are going to go up anyway.\n\nI figure that I am probably paying less for the CBC than I would be for subscriptions to private news services who provide less coverage.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9999
Chris Koerner,Updated 6y,How did Snapchat handle server costs before it got funded?,"Coming from wealth really helps.

Evan Spiegel’s parents were both Ivy League educated and he lived in a mansion close to the ocean in Southern California.

Snapchat didn't take off as quickly as Instagram did - 25k downloads on it’s first day. But when it did start getting traction it ramped up quickly.

Evan ultimately borrowed cash from his grandparents to pay the server bills, and then his partner put in a few grand.

When Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Partners noticed that his daughter used Snapchat nonstop, they decided to invest.

TLDR: When you come from money, you know even more people with even more money. Server bills are relatively small at the stage they were in, especially when the success of the app seemed to be in hand already.

4/19/17 Edit/Clarification: I'm not saying that Evan having rich parents caused Snapchat to be successful, or that wealth is bad. I'm just saying it's a fact of life that generally speaking, a startup has a greater chance of success when there's more cash at one’s disposal.

Thanks for reading,

Rajnish Prajapat,3y,Is it possible to build a billion dollar company without funding from a VC?,"Yes!

This guy sold his company to Pepsi for $4 Billion and He owned 100% of the company.

Russ Weiner is the founder of Rockstar Energy which he started with $50k. After testing 700 flavour varieties, Weiner drove around San Francisco in an old car painted with the Rockstar logo to promote his new energy drink.

Rockstar, founded in 2001, makes 30 variations of 16-ounce drinks that are sold in convenience stores and grocers in more than 30 countries.

The beverages are popular among athletes and performers.

Rockstar has had a distribution agreement with PepsiCo in North America since 2009, is currently sold in 30 countries around the world.

and the best thing is Russ owned 85% of the company and his mother, who was the CFO owned 15% of the company.

Before finding Rockstar Energy, Russ worked in a Vodka making company where he presented his idea to make an energy drink to the founder. But Founder of the vodka company rejected the idea, unimpressed with the name “Rockstar”.

Weiner quit to launch his energy drink company Rockstar.

Joshua Gross,3y,Why do professors take graduate international students? I mean in many cases they need to provide more funding to those domestic students and language could be a potential communication problem. Why are they doing it?,"I have a slightly different reading of the question than Jeff Erickson. I think you’re asserting that domestic PhD students are more deserving of money that is currently going to international students.

Let’s start with a few things that everyone should know:

US STEM PhD programs (especially engineering and computing) tend to have large numbers of international students because there aren’t enough qualified Americans applying
American students definitely have an advantage over international students when applying, due to language and an understanding of US higher education and applications (among other things)
Students in a department are typically paid the same (or similarly)
Not funding international students would not raise the amount paid to American students

Now, as to fairness: we owe an immense debt of gratitude to international PhD students, especially those who remain and take faculty positions. Most of my grad school profs were not born in the US. In my department, there are only two American-born tenure-track CS faculty. We have quite a number of adjuncts, all of whom could get tenure-line jobs here or elsewhere if they had PhDs in CS, but none of them do. Any of them could get a PhD in CS, but they’ve done the cost-benefit analysis and said, “nah.”

The US would not have a large tech industry if it weren’t for foreign nationals coming to the US to learn, teach, research, and work. We all benefit from their presence, whether or not we’re in the tech industry, because it is such a powerful economic engine.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/w19dbti823e7zjql', 'title': 'Why do professors take graduate international students?

Urooj Kazi,Updated 9y,How is it to work with JustUnfollow considering they haven't received funding?,"I turned one-JustUnfollow-year-old a few weeks back. I was hired for content, but in true startup style I do a bit of this and a bit of that and have a whale of a time doing what I do.

I write this answer not because I've been asked to, but because I want to, because I am surprised by the number of applicants we get whenever we post a new job (a lot, but not a lot lot), because there are others out there who echo your question but ask it not, and because working at JustUnfollow is so awesome you cannot not talk about it when asked.

To answer your question:

We work out of a proper office, like with chairs and desks and stuff...


...and pet plants...

...a conference room with bar stools...





We do crazy things

Like this (Don't ask me, I don't know what's happening either)...


and this...



and this...





We work hard, just like at any other startup, funded or otherwise.

This was during Diwali. Some of us love office so much, we turned up to work.



Candid shot (trust me)



With our desks customized the way we want...





We have fun. A little too much.









And, we have food...



more food...



Some more nomnom...


Bonus: We get our salaries on time, every time.

Personally, I have never felt the lack of funding has had any impact on my experience at JustUnfollow so far. It has been the best workplaces I've worked at so far and the last one year has been one of the most memorable of my life.

Blair Korchinski,Jan 13,Why should Canada continue to fund the CBC?,"Well, because I start my weekdays with the local morning crew on CBC Radio 1, listen to The Current, Tom Power, and The Commotion in the morning. Listen to the local noon show, including a lot of agricultural news and interviews that the private guys don’t cover, then listen to the afternoon shows.

In the evenings I watch the National, listen to As it Happens, and so on.

If there’s a particular story I am following, the CBC website is generally easy to access and has good coverage, whether it’s local, provincial, or federal. I can also easily access the local news in Saskatchewan, where I’m from.

Like most Canadians my age, I grew up with Mr. Dress-Up and The Friendly Giant. I’ve watched the Beachcombers and The King of Kensington. I watched This Hour Has 22 Minutes, Rick Mercer and so on. Canadian shows for Canadian people.

We get a lot of bang for the buck when it comes to the CBC, but you yahoos continue to attack it. I assume your motivations are political, childish, and greed-based.

So I don’t know why you guys hate the CBC so much. Pretty much every country worth mentioning has a national broadcaster. Ours is kept arms-length from the government, ensuring its news coverage remains independent.

I mean, I understand that you worship the shit-show of American Right-wing Nutbagism, but Canadians really don’t want that shit up here. Neither do the Americans…that’s why they started PBS and NPR, but those are nothing compared to what the CBC does for Canadians.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9939
James Altucher,Updated 9y,How does venture funding work? How much money can one get through VCs?,"I'm going to explain how venture funding works in detail but it may or may not answer your question. If you have further questions, you can ask me in the comments.  First, I'm going to address technically how it works. The first question you ask which is ""What is Venture funding?""  Then I'm going to answer the second question you ask which is , ""how much can you get from venture funding?""  These are two completely separate questions but I will try and answer them both..  WHAT IS VENTURE FUNDING?  I will take a simple example and from this you will be able to figure out all the ins and outs of venture funding.  Imagine you want to set up a lemonade stand. Your company is going to attempt to sell lemonade to all the people who pass by.  Your fixed costs are:   Your table: $30  A sign and some paint: $40 Your variable costs are the amount of lemonade you will need because it will depend on demand. But you figure you will be profitable from the first week.  You figure you will need $10 worth of lemonade and that will generate 10 cups of $2 each so you will make $20 in revenues.  Which means gross profit will be $10, which you may choose to reinvest in more lemonade (if demand is high) or more signs (to create more demand).  So how much money do you need. You need at least your fixed costs ($70) plus some money for lemonade. Since you think you will be profitable in your first week you will need $10 more to buy the lemonade.  So you need $80.  You don't have it.  So you make a business plan. - You need $80 for all of the reasons above. - you have vast experience helping your cousin last year run a successful lemonade stand- 100 people a weekend will walk by your lemonade stand (you counted last weekend) and at least 10% will buy (according to how your cousin's stand worked last year) so you will make $10 a week in gross profit (see above) That means you will make $500 a year in gross profit (you live in Florida so it's hot all year round).  In other words: if you can implement your business plan, there's $500 in profits that can be shared or reinvested (perhaps you will open up other lemonade stands and hire other kids to run them).  All is good except for the fact that you need $80.  You approach your daddy and ask for ""venture funding"". It's ""venture"" because you are a venture. It's like an adventure that needs money.  It's ""funding"" because he will provide the money.  Your daddy drives a hard bargain.  He says, ""I will give you $80 but I need 50% of the company"".  This means one of two things initially:   - if you have profits in the company and want to take them out of the company then you have give him 50% of all the profits.   - if you sell the lemonade stand to your neighbor (because he would rather buy your lemonade stand than build one himself) then 50% of the proceeds go to you and 50% go to your father.  But now your father throws in some other terms.  Up until now your company has just had ""common stock"". You had 100% of the common stock. Don't worry about how many shares that means. Just know that you had 100% until this moment.  Your daddy says, ""if you sell the company for less than it takes for me to make my money back, then I am the first money out.""  This means his stock is now ""preferred"" and yours is ""common"".  This means if you sell your company for $160 he gets $80 and you get $80.  But if you sell your company for $150, then he gets $80 (the first money out) and you get $70.  If you sell your company for $60, he gets all $60 and you get $0 and probably feel bad.  He also says, ""if you raise any more money then I can keep my 50% of the company by putting in more money also."" This is called anti-dilution rights.  He also says, ""if you leave the company, then I get all my money back first."" Meaning, if you let your neighbor take over the lemonade stand, your daddy doesn't necessarily trust your neighbor so you have to figure out how to get him his money back.  This is roughly a ""change of control provision"".  He also says ""if you insult the customers, then I get to fire you."" This is a gross negligence provision.  He may also say that no major decision involving more than $50 can made without both of you approving.  ""Ok,"" you say, and you agree to everything and take in the $80. You just got venture funding and now there are two ""classes"" of stock: common (your stock) and ""Preferred A"" (your daddy's stock).  Let's say a week goes by and only 5 people bought lemonade for $2 a cup. So you ran out of lemonade and have no profits.  You need to raise another $10. You go to Daddy and he says ""NO!""  Now you go to Mommy. She does more distressed venture funding.  She agrees to the $10 but she says two things.   - ""I am the first $10 out if you sell the lemonade stand"". So now she is making her stock ""Preferred B"" which has more rights than ""Preferred A"" or Common stock.  In other words, if you sell the lemonade stand for $15, she gets her full $10 back. Your daddy only gets $5 back of the $80 he put in. And you get $0.  She also says she wants 50% of the company for her $10. She's what's called a ""vulture capitalist"" behind her back.  This means that if the company is sold, she gets 50% of the company, your daddy gets 25% and you get 25%. Same as if you distribute profits: 50% / 25% / 25%.  So, even in this simple example you have to make sure of several things:   - you measure demand correctly (not so easy) - you measure what your fixed costs are correctly - you measure what your variable costs are correctly - you determine what your selling points are about yourself - you try to foresee how much of the company you are willing to give up so that it's still worth it to you.   - you understand everything a venture capitalist might ask for that maybe you can negotiate.  For instance, maybe you could've have said to Daddy that since you were going to make $500 a year in profits maybe it would be unfair to give him 50% of the company for $80. He could say ""Screw you"" but then you can go to your best friend's dad and show him the same business plan and get more than one venture funder to consider funding your lemonade stand.  Always good to diversify the people go to for venture funding.  Now, I will answer your second question. I hope the above was helpful.  HOW MUCH VENTURE FUNDING CAN YOU GET?  I indirectly answered this above but I will add a little more color here.  Having just an idea will get you nothing. Chances are you need to have a sense of demand. If you are in an old-fashioned business (lemonade stand, laundromat, McDonalds franchise, etc) then this is easier.  If you are in a business that has never been done before then answer these questions:  - Urgency: how urgent is the need for the product you would like to create- Unique: is anyone else doing it and why is yours better- Useful: Does this solve a real problem- Ultra-specific: How does your solution work- User-Friendly: What does the venture capitalist get for his money. You want to make it easy for him or her to say yes. - Unquestionable Proof: proof that your product is as good as you say it is.  If you haven't created the product yet and have no customers then that final ""U"" is going to be very difficult. Then you aren't being very ""user-friendly"", i.e. you are making it difficult for the venture funder to say ""yes"". And without a product, in a brand-new industry, you will have a hard time measuring the urgency (demand) of that product.  And if you haven't created the product you might have a hard time understanding what the fixed and variable costs are. Making it difficult to make a business plan, making it even more difficult for a venture capitalist to say yes.  This answers half of your question. If you can do the above then you are starting to be in a position where you can ask for money.  But how much?  This is more art than science. If it were science, everyone would be filthy rich.  But most people go broke investing in ventures.  Once you have a sense of all of the above you can use the same math as in the lemonade stand example to determine what your company is worth.  Ultimately a company is worth ONLY the amount of cash it will generate from now until the end of time.  But it's hard to predict the future.  Typically, a company will attempt to predict three or four years in the future how much profit it could generate and then discount that by anywhere from 50% to 75% or more in order to give the venture capitalist a reasonable deal, given that you can't really predict the future.  Often, though, companies are not profitable in the first three years.  So even though the only way to value a company is on the basis of its future (but unpredictable) cash flows, there is another way you can try to convince venture capitalists to invest.  You look at similar companies and how much money they raised when they were at your similar state.  For instance, your cousin's lemonade stand might've gotten $200 for 30% of the company.  And your daddy can say, ""but his corner was twice as busy"".  And you can say, ""but I have higher quality lemonade"".  And so on. That's a negotiation. Which is another topic.  I think this answers both of your questions so now I will give advice.  ADVICE: - build a product. Even if you have to do it over years while at a full time job so you are only working on the side. - get customers- get feedback on your product. - try to scale and get more customers.  This gets you a sense of demand, gives you experience on the costs, and lets you build a product people can see instead of just imagine.  Now go out and raise a whole lot of money and get really rich.

Sharada,1y,"Why has Byju’s raised 6,000 crore funding?","Yes- Byju Raveendran, co-founder and CEO of the edtech behemoth Byju's, had invested $400 million in the firm.

Michael Holden,15h,Who provides funding for antifa?,"Oh come on, everybody knows that the dreaded, freedom-hating terrorists known as ANTIFA are funded by George Soros. George Soros pays the salaries of almost all protestors, and, in doing so, he is one of the largest employers in the country. Between the ""sticks"" (sign-waving protestors), the ""block heads"" (the black-clad insurgents that scare you on TV) and ""starfleet"" (the bus drivers, caterers, and groupies of all affectational orientations) we are talking hundreds of thousands of people.

How do I know this? Because I was a Sr Anti Fascist (ii) in the Soros Armageddon Army. I was recruited by a classified ad in a communist newspaper in Seattle, called The Stranger. The ad offered immediate placement for sign carrying protestors, and for ""kitty"" hat fabricators. Since I don't know how to crochet my choice was easy. Full benefits, vegan options every meal, comprehensive legal aid for all on-the-job incurred arrests, citations, in-house medical for all tear gas exposure and all forms of blunt force trauma at the hands of law enforcement, a decent per diem if you were a stick, and premium lodging for the block heads. I think they had some sort of deal working that angle. And, home every two weeks, at minimum, and what I can say is an exceptionally generous recreational pharmacological benefit. It was like a Hunter Thompson novel, but with more marxists and almost no attorneys or journalists. We all doubled up as voters, if you receive my meaning on this matter.

I quit after four years because I found it was more profitable to sell ready-made instant american identities to newly landed hopeful residents of this fair land, complete with social security number, voter ID card, food stamp card and drivers license. The best part is all we have to do is guess the password to a known white boomer's gmail account, they have little sense of operational security in regards to computers so they use that password everywhere else, and the email address is their user ID. They don't even deserve to keep their identity if they treat it like that.

Anyway, I think that being part of antifa is a great way to start your career for any budding marxist, maoist, liberal or trot. PM me and I'll send you a referral code that gets you to the head of the line in this busy election season.

Neel Nitin Shah,Updated 5y,What are the best ways to generate good business ideas?,"One of the best thing I learned in Business is-

“Sometimes PACKAGING is more IMPORTANT than the PRODUCT itself”

While importing this product from China in Gross, the landing cost of the product stands out to be 80 Paisa (INR)/ Packet of Rubber Band.

Someone with a creative mind tried changing the Packaging of the same product into something more attractive.

She packed those rubber bands into Mini infant Milk Bottles.

Now, that each bottle is sold at 5 Rs/per piece (INR).

Which leaves us with the question -

Are we paying 4.20 Rs more for the packaging of a 0.80Rs product?
The answer is a complete “YES”.

Also the sale has doubled since the wrap is lucrative.

Johnny Reinsch,5y,What should all entrepreneurs know about getting funded?,"That it’s not the end goal.

But only the beginning.

All those plans you had for your startup and the places you believed you could go?

Getting funded is like having your tank filled with gas. You can certainly get going, but only time will say whether you make it to your destination.

The other thing entrepreneurs need to know about getting funded is that you’re selling a piece of your company. It should bring your startup’s value up and allow you to scale and make more money. Don’t sell yourself short.

And finally, bringing an investor on board is like hiring someone you can never fire. So be picky if possible.

Roughly speaking, I’ve come across 5 investor types:

The X-Founder

They’ve been there. They know what it’s like to shoot for the near-impossible.

Along the way, they’ve developed the network, experience, and expertise to help you out when the going gets tough.

Get them on board.

The “Professional”

They’ve never run a company. They want reports and will hold you accountable to their fancy spreadsheets.

Be careful. They won’t understand what you’re going through.

The Gilded Ghost

They’ve got millions. Billions. They’ll dump money on your company and then you’ll never hear from them again unless either your car breaks down or you’ve finally made it.

Your call.

The Fanboy

They don’t know what blockchain is but they’ve seen it in the news and want a piece of the pie.

They want to know if there are other celebrity VCs on board. They want their names in TechCrunch. Your mission and business model mean nothing to them.

Their money’s going to cost you.

Big time.

The Mountain Mover

The founder of a bank. A close friend of government top brass. An inventor of disruptive tech.

You’re lucky if you get a single half-hour meeting with them in a year, so you better come prepared.

Because they have the power to open up million-customer markets or change regulations.

With a single email.

You. Want. Them.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q95pkz71uy0n6ew3', 'title': 'What should all entrepreneurs know about getting funded?', 'score': {'original': 0.9973, 'ai': 0.0027}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'That it’s not the end goal.\n\nBut only the beginning.\n\nAll those plans you had for your startup and the places you believed you could go?\n\nGetting funded is like having your tank filled with gas.

John Cate,2y,Would it be a good idea for HM Government to crowdsource funding to restore HMS Victory?,"If it needs restoration, I don’t know why the British government wouldn’t want to just pay to have it done. The HMS Victory is an iconic part of British history that deserves to be preserved for posterity.

I wouldn’t think the British would care, since Nelson’s flagship at Trafalgar is still more historically significant. This isn’t some sort of contest; they’re both symbols of national pride for the two greatest navies the world has ever seen.

Victory has been through a lot. It nearly got broken up in the 1830s, almost sank due to its poor condition in 1887, went through lengthy restoration work in the 1920s, and then got bombed by the f’ing Nazis in 1941. Boney couldn’t sink her and neither could Dolph.

Barry Rountree,Updated 6y,Why do ridiculous research study topics get funded?,"That’s called “clickbait” and it’s preying on your lack of scientific education.

Let’s take the first one.

“Study shows beneficial effect of electric fans in extreme heat and humidity”

Part of my research for my MS degree involved studying heat-related mortality. If you get a hot summer in Tucson or Tallahassee there are usually few fatalities: people are familiar with the weather, they know what to do, and the architecture is adapted to those temperature.

The same weather can be a disaster for cities like St. Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia. You’ve got lots of brick buildings that hold heat for longer and are often not equipped with adequate air conditioning. Particularly in the 1980s there would be a warm spell and older, poorer people would literally die in their apartments because of the heat.

So you’ve got a pretty serious public health problem on your hands. When you see that kind of weather system heading to your city, what do you tell people to do? Obviously, if you can get them into a mall or gymnasium with adequate cooling, that’s a win. But you can’t reach everybody and not everybody will have access to transportation. So now what?

Well, do fans work? The received wisdom held that you’re just circulating hot air, so over a certain temperature a fan doesn’t do any good at all. So now you need to tell people “Just because you have a fan doesn’t make you safe.”

I expect this article tried to determine empirically the effectiveness of fans in just these kinds of circumstances. Of course, I don’t know that for sure because there’s no link the the article, nor is the article title given.

Why? Well, if you could read the justification of the research given in the article, it might make a lot of sense. And then the clickbait writer would look like an idiot.

Here’s the article.

Body Responses to Extreme Heat and Humidity

And here’s a paragraph from the discussion section.

Our preliminary study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that electric fans prevent heat-related elevations in HR and core temperature in healthy young men up to approximately 80% RH at 36°C and 50% RH at 42°C. Thus, contrary to existing guidance [3,4] fans may be effective cooling devices for those without air conditioning during hot and humid periods.

And what is “existing guidance”?

Public health advice on preventing health effects of heat. Published by the World Health Organization, and Excessive heat events guidebook published by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

So maybe, just maybe, the next time there’s a heat emergency we can save a few taxpayer dollars by having healthier people remain in their apartments if they have adequate fans.

So what’s the takeaway?

The clickbait writer is an idiot. And you were taken in by that clickbait writer.

When you see articles poking fun at research, go read the paper yourself. Chances are it’s perfectly sound science that made it through rigorous peer review because of its high quality. And you can wonder why the clickbait writer couldn’t be arsed to do the same thing.

Now go read the takedown of #2 written by Michael Lush.

Alon Amit,5y,"A common argument for funding pure math research is, ""you never know what will be useful."" But don't we have the data and tools to quantify the risks and rewards of funding one branch of mathematics over another?","Of course we quantify the risks and rewards. Do you imagine that government funding is handed out at random? We don’t recite “you never know what will be useful” and go on to fund pure math at the same level we fund high energy physics. I mean, seriously.

Now, do we “have the data and tools” to quantify the risks and rewards? Well, whatever we have, we use. We’ve always had some means of assessing those risks and rewards, because human beings assess risks and rewards all the time – with more data, with less data, poorly, excellently, whatever. They have to, and they do.

When Peter the Great established the Russian Academy of Sciences
 in 1724, he did so not because he was excited to see e-commerce technologies emerge from research into prime numbers. He did so because he wanted to catch up and exceed the scientific knowledge of Western Europe, for very pragmatic reasons. One of the people who greatly benefited from the Academy was Leonhard Euler, who was supported generously throughout most of his career, particularly by the far-seeing empress Catherine the Great
. She, too, had to gauge the value of having Euler in her back yard – and humanity was propelled forward as a result.

So how about nowadays? Let’s see some data. In the US, by far the largest government body supporting basic research, including math, is the NSF
. For the 2017 fiscal year, the NSF organized federal obligations to the tune of around $66B for various fields, and you can see the overall breakdown here
:

(I reformatted the data to make it slightly more legible, but it’s copied verbatim from the NSF site).

Of the $66.5B, around $4B (6%) went to math and CS combined. Physical Sciences got $6B, Engineering got $12B, and Life Sciences got $32B, almost half of the total. Keep in mind that this is basic life-science research only: the vast majority of funding for medical research comes from a completely separate body, the NIH.

Now let’s look inside
 that “Math+CS” thing.

CS gets 73% and math gets 27% of the $4B. In other words, mathematics – all of mathematics, pure and applied – is portioned 1.75% of the NSF’s total grants.

I couldn’t easily find numbers corresponding to “pure” vs “applied” math, but the trend is clear, natural and obvious: when researchers apply for grants, they emphasize applications, and funding is handed out based on the best assessments the administrators can come up with regarding the risks and rewards. Pure math research receives a very, very small fraction of basic scientific funding, let alone total R&D scientific funding including medical.

Part of the reason, of course, is that pure math research is dirt cheap. Mathematicians don’t need particle accelerators or biology labs costing billions and employing armies of staff. Math professors seek funding for books, one or two laptops, travel to conferences, and to support their handful of Ph.D and post-doc students – and let me tell you, these folks aren’t paid Silicon Valley or Wall Street salaries.

This simply means that the “risk” part of math research funding is fairly negligible. As a result, the amount of energy we should put into assessing the “rewards” is tiny. We do care, and we ask researchers to explain potential future benefits of their work, but we would be foolish to dedicate huge resources to carefully assessing the chances of success.

Just like Peter, Catherine I and Catherine the Great understood that funding Euler and a couple
 of Bernoullis
 is peanuts compared with shipbulding or maintaining an army, so the rewards – however vague and unknown – will likely far outweigh the expense. 300 years later, it’s much the same.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0pkrxvhq96tlgnuj', 'title': 'A common argument for funding pure math research is, ""you never know what will be useful.""

Hector Quintanilla,4y,What's the most creative financing option you sought for bootstrapping your business?,"“I just got a huge order from Walmart!” my friend Peter said.

“Congratulations!” I said giving him a high five.

“But I have a problem,” he continued. “I don’t have the money to fulfill the order. They’re asking for 90-day payment terms. How can I ever finance so much inventory sitting on Walmart’s shelves?”

“That’s the cash-flow battle, Pete,” I said while taking a seat for dinner.

“I’ve talked to my banker, my lines of credit are maxed out,” he said.

“Pete, there are good problems and bad problems — this is a good problem. I’m sure you’ll figure it out.”

“What do you mean?” Pete asked.

“A bad problem is not having sales. Your problem is based on growth. You’ve proven you have a successful product. Your problem is now financing success. That’s a different headache,” I said.

“Any examples?”

“A creative way to finance a business is negotiating similar terms with your suppliers. Why don’t you share with them this good news and ask them to support you with the same terms that Walmart is demanding from you.”

“Could that be free financing?”

“It may be. It’s definitely a win-win deal. Everybody wins. Your suppliers win as you increase your sales. I’m always willing to support growth,” I said.

“I’ve always had a good relationship with all of them. This could definitely work,” Pete said.

“If that doesn’t work, there are another options, like factoring. This term factoring loans is a financing solution that helps companies unlock the cash sitting in your Walmart unpaid receivables.”

“How does that work?” Pete asked.

“There are some financing people or companies who will be glad to wait for Walmart’s 90-day payment and will take your invoices as collateral. You receive the cash in advance for a percentage of the invoice as a fee.”

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 5y,What are the best ways to generate good business ideas?,"I walked into the Emergency Room with my baby girl on my arms.

“Emergency! I need a doctor! I need help! NOW!”

“What’s wrong?” a nurse asked.

“My baby girl is crying, she wont stop crying! She’s been crying all night long, and I can clearly see she’s in extreme pain!”

“I think she’s having a headache, so let’s give her some aspirin and go home.”

“What? No! That’s not the problem!” I angrily shouted!

Read again what the doctor said:

“I think she’s having a headache, so let’s give her some aspirin and go home.”

“I think?!?!”

Have you ever been misdiagnosed by a doctor?

Would you trust a doctor’s diagnosis without testing? NO!

Then why do we trust our ideas without testing them?

How can we differentiate stupid “business ideas” from GOOD business ideas?

Let me tell you how.

I’m extremely creative — as a result, I have hundreds of ideas. As I have painfully discovered over the years, most of my ideas are worthless because I didn't understand the root of the problem.

We are emotional beings; as a result we act based on how we “feel,” not based on the “facts” to attack the root of the problem.

Let me share a very simple example:

Problem: The baby feels sick.
Action: Let’s give her some aspirin.
Result: The baby is still sick and not feeling better.
Real Problem: The real root of the problem is a bacteria that needs to be treated with antibiotics.

Second simple example:

Problem: My car won’t start.
Action: Let’s use jumper cables to power the battery.
Result: The car won’t start.
Real Problem: The real root of the problem is a clogged fuel filter.

Obviously these examples above are very simple, but I want us to understand that our ideas are usually similar to the “immediate actions” based on feelings as shown above!

Our business ideas are similar to the “aspirin” — yet, they are terrible ideas because they wont solve the problem!

How do I know this?

I have lived through this mistake several times in my entrepreneurial life.[1]

Result? Failure!

Fun? Not really!

To answer your question:

The best way to generate GOOD business ideas is by becoming a “doctor.”

The best doctors have a deep understanding of the problem!

The best doctors have a deep understanding of the sickness!

The best doctors diagnose the patient based on testing and facts, not by “feelings!”

Want to generate GOOD business ideas?

Forget about trying to come up with ideas!
Yes, you read correctly…
STOP trying to think about ideas! You are losing time!
Instead try this:
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM!
FOCUS 100% ON THE PROBLEM!
Once you DEEPLY understand the problem, I can guarantee you that you will come up with extraordinary business ideas!

Feline Fascination,Nov 21,Is there funding for people that treat feral cats?,"Title: Decoding the Red Spot: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Your Rescue Cat's Chin Mark

Introduction:

Uncovering a red spot on your rescue cat's chin can evoke concern, prompting a closer inspection to decipher its potential origins and determine the need for a vet visit. This comprehensive response aims to explore the various factors that might contribute to the appearance of a red spot, offering guidance on home care assessments, potential remedies, and when to involve a veterinary professional, all while considering the unique challenge of handling a feisty feline.

1. Potential Causes of the Red Spot:

- Scenarios: The red spot could emerge from diverse factors such as feline acne, allergies, an insect bite, or a burgeoning skin infection.

- Evaluation: Careful observation is key. Note the spot's characteristics, changes over time, and any signs of discomfort exhibited by your furry friend.

2. Navigating Home Care Assessment:

- Feisty Behavior: Handling a cat with a feisty disposition can be challenging. Employ gentle techniques, like using a towel for a closer examination or calming pheromone sprays.

- Examination Details: A closer inspection should include an analysis of the red spot's size, texture, and any additional symptoms like itching or hair loss.

3. Determining When to Consult a Vet:

- Persistent Issues: If the red spot persists or shows signs of worsening, especially if accompanied by distress signals from your cat, seeking professional advice is prudent.

- Feasible Options: Some veterinary clinics offer alternative solutions, such as home visits or sedatives, to minimize stress for a feisty feline during travel.

4. Exploring Potential At-Home Remedies:

- Topical Solutions: Following veterinary guidance, applying a mild antiseptic or vet-recommended topical solution may aid in soothing the spot.

- Hygiene Practices: Maintaining cleanliness in the chin area is essential to prevent further irritation.

Conclusion:

The discovery of a red spot on your rescue cat's chin necessitates a multifaceted approach. Vigilance, a detailed understanding of your cat's behaviour, and judicious home care practices are pivotal. If the red spot persists or worsens, proactive consultation with a vet, even if it entails creative strategies to handle a feisty feline, ensures the best possible care. This holistic approach contributes to the overall well-being of your rescue cat.

Pawsitively Yours,

So the investor seeks 51% ownership and control for putting in about USD8,000, right?

There's a phrase we used to use while growing up in Hyderabad decades ago, that seems to be an apt response.

It was abbreviated ""PKD"" and when expanded, stood for ""Please Kindly Dengeyi"".

Ross Cohen,Updated 4y,What did President Barack Obama do to get money for projects he couldn’t get funded through Congress?,"Nothing, that would be unconstitutional. The Constitution requires all funding be appropriated by Congress. I’m trying to think of a time President Obama even considered doing otherwise but can’t come up with anything. There were quite a few projects, programs, and actions he wanted Congress to fund but when he was unable to secure their assent, he accepted it was their prerogative.

For example, he wanted a larger stimulus deal than Congress approved. He also proposed the American Jobs Act
 during a joint session of Congress and argued for it strenuously. The Republicans in Congress refused and he moved on without it. He did not try to declare an emergency or use some other means of reallocating funds from their approved purpose.

A stronger case could be made for a national emergency on the economic crisis when he entered office than we have right now on the border. Job losses from the Great Recession were the worst in 70 years while apprehensions at the border are at a nearly 50 year low.

Ashok Dhamija,4y,What is your opinion on crowd funding of elections?,"Crowdfunding for elections is possible and some persons have tried it successfully. Recently, Kanhaiya Kumar, who is candidate from Begusarai constituency, successfully raised ₹ 70 lakh by way of crowdfunding for meeting his election expenses.

Previously, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had also successfully raised money through crowdfunding after its formation.

So, if there is a candidate who has good reputation and a good following among people, crowdfunding can be a good option for raising money for meeting election expenses.

However, care should be taken to ensure that each individual should pay only up to a limited amount, say up to ₹ 500 or ₹ 1000. Otherwise, it may create future (moral) obligations and someone funding you with big funds can try to take undue advantage of the good will after you win.

In the case of Kanhaiya Kumar, it is seen from online details that a single individual paid ₹ 5 lakh and three individuals paid ₹ 1 lakh each. In my personal opinion, such heavy contributions from single individuals should be avoided.

Kanhaiya Kumar’s crowdfunding shows that the total amount of ₹ 70 lakh was raised from a total of 5326 person, which means that the average contribution was ₹ 1314 per individual.

Someone may try to claim that national level parties too use crowdfunding to collect funds for the party, but these claims are generally hollow, because in the case of national parties, most of the corruption money is diverted towards party funds by way of small anonymous / cash donations. Recently introduced electoral bonds are also not transparent, and at present, the Supreme Court is hearing petitions challenging their validity.

At the same time, of course, some individual candidates (and, in the beginning, AAP too as a party) have successfully used the crowdfunding to raise funds for contesting elections.

I believe that if crowdfunding can be used in a transparent manner (only through bank / online transactions with verifiable audit trails) and through small donations from each verifiable person, then this can bring some good changes in our democratic system. It may remove at least some corruption from our electoral system and at the same time, some good and honest persons can think of joining politics. But, at this stage, crowdfunding cannot be a panacea for the ills of the election system, since most candidates still spend most of election expenses in cash (while crowdfunding is supposed to be through bank / online transactions) and that too in crores.

Yet, even a small change is welcome if it is good. Over time, it can bring more changes in the system.

Shern Ren Tee,6y,Why do ridiculous research study topics get funded?,"Right! #3 is mine then. But let me comment on the question in general before tackling the specific item.

Some research studies are legitimately ridiculous. Among the world’s treasure trove of published academic papers are Trajectory of a falling Batman
 and The Tao of bao: a randomised controlled trial examining the effect of steamed bun consumption on night-call inpatient course and mortality
 (in many Chinese dialects “bao”, steamed bun, sounds like and is etymologically related to “bao” a body bag). These are, legitimately, stupid uses of smart brains. But they also need very little funding: the former requires a few hours on the computer and a copy of Batman Begins (cheaper if bootlegged); the latter six weeks of steamed buns. I’d pay out of my pocket just for the prestige of publishing something so ridiculous, and it wouldn’t cost me any.

And some research studies seem ridiculous. But they turn out not to be. “Depressed people lack happiness” may seem trivially obvious, but as I will explain below, this is actually an intelligent and helpful study in the treatment of mental disease.

But it’s true that some ridiculous research gets funded. They’re just not what you think. I’ll give you one example: Theranos
. “What?” you say. “What’s so ridiculous about funding technology that could conduct blood tests on the tiniest drops of blood?” Nothing, inherently, but it is ridiculous to expect such a long-shot technology to be successfully developed by an entrepreneur with hardly any training in biomedical sciences and zero peer-reviewed research along the way.

Like Theranos (though not as extreme), there are many other research groups around the world pursuing supposedly world-changing research without the technical capabilities or the theoretical justification to back up their claims. As a non-specialist in science, you won’t know which they are: if they were really researching something as obviously stupid as “Depressed people lack happiness”, do you think they would really be getting grant money? Unfortunately, it takes experts to detect that species of ridiculous, which is why truly ridiculous research won't be appearing in snarky Time articles any time soon.

I know “Smart people are secretly stupid” is an enjoyable genre of non-fiction, especially in a virulently anti-intellectual America, but in this case it’s fiction.

Let me repeat claim #3 here, so as to starve this aggressively stupid article of undeserved clicks.

Holding on to the blues: Depressed individuals may fail to decrease sadness: This one apparently came as news to the folks at the Association for Psychological Science and they've got the body of work to stand behind their findings. They're surely the same scientists who discovered that short people often fail to increase inches, grouchy people don't have enough niceness and folks who wear dentures have done a terrible job of hanging onto their teeth. The depression findings in particular are good news, pointing to exciting new treatments based on the venerable ""Turn that frown upside down"" method.

Even before assessing the science, this is a remarkably harmful and insensitive paragraph to write. No, you do not tell a depressed person to “turn that frown upside down”, you heartless bastard. You think depressed people don't want to be happy?

Well, actually. Let's see what the research says.

Holding on to the Blues: Depressed Individuals May Fail to Decrease Sadness
:

Given that depression is characterized by intense and frequent negative feelings, like sadness, it might seem logical to develop interventions that target those negative feelings. But new research
 suggests that even when depressed people have the opportunity to decrease their sadness, they don’t necessarily try to do so. The findings
 are published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science
.

“Our findings show that, contrary to what we might expect, depressed people sometimes choose to behave in a manner that increases rather than decreases their sadness,” says the study’s first author Yael Millgram of The Hebrew University. “This is important because it suggests that depressed individuals may sometimes be unsuccessful in decreasing their sadness in daily life because, in some sense, they hold on to it.”

This is actually a really profound, evidence-based examination of a key dynamic in depression. Essentially, the researchers allowed depressed people to choose between different emotional stimuli (be they images, music, or cognitive emotion-controlling techniques) and found that depressed people consistently chose saddening stimuli, even while consciously agreeing with the researchers that these stimuli were saddening.

This affects our understanding of depression firstly on a deeply philosophical level. Depression is a terrible disease - or is it? If depressed people actually want to be sad - evidentially so! - do we have a right to diagnose and medicalize and poke and prod at them? Is our discomfort at their predicament really about their welfare, or is it about ours - are we simply being intolerant of a different modality of emotional life, one which we may just shun partly under the socialization of a late capitalism which preys on our (supposedly normative) desire to be happy?

Of course, desiring to be sad instead of happy is quite different from desiring a doughnut instead of ice cream. Depression is associated statistically with some amount of dysfunction in daily life, with poorer general health, sometimes even with harm to others and self. Knowing that depression can include volitional desire to actually want to be sad, then, can also help in theoretical aspects of classifying and diagnosing depression. After all, this isn't a blanket statement - some depressed people do in fact want to be happy, and can't despite emotional stimuli for happiness that they seek out. What this study then contributes is that sometimes depression includes a volition against happiness, and sometimes it does not.

Or is that so? Perhaps depressed people say they want to be happy, and say that they seek out happy stimuli, but in fact seek out stimuli that make them sad in actuality. Maybe they “do what they do not want to do”, in the immortal lament of St Paul. Maybe depression is in fact a kind of addiction to sadness. Consider the smoker: they want a smoke, in bodily terms and often in mental assent, but at the same time a large part of them doesn't want to want to smoke. What if depression were similar?

If it were, then this study would affect our therapeutic approaches to depression as well. How many of us - therapists even - assume that depressed people need to be taught how to be happy? If we have any awareness of mental health we know that it is not as simple as that. But it is tempting - and makes us feel helpful - to tell someone depressed to eat some ice cream, watch a funny movie, go out for a walk with them. We assume the problem is that they don't have stimuli for positive emotions. But what if they don't want those stimuli? Therapy may have to go beyond teaching coping strategies to kindling desire for coping strategies, doing the hard work of assuming (and diagnosing) a desire for sadness that has to be unpacked and explored and mitigated before the tools of happiness are introduced. And we friends to those depressed may have to learn what it means to love someone who not only isn't happy, but doesn't want to be happy - to take care of someone not so that they will be happy but in and despite them resolutely not wanting it.

Not so ridiculous, now is it?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/idorhfjlcuyexv37', 'title': 'Why do ridiculous research study topics get funded?', 'score': {'original': 0.70746666666667, 'ai': 0.2925}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Right! #3 is mine then.

Aviral Bhatnagar,5y,Where does Swiggy use $100m huge funding?,"Growing faster, and faster.

But you may think “why are investors funding losses at present?”. That’s because there is an expectation that Swiggy will be profitable in the future.

In early stage investing, especially for consumer businesses, we look at two things to determine the long term profitability of the business. The first is customer (unit) economics i.e. is servicing a customer profitable in the long run? The second is customer acquisition i.e. how much do I have to spend to acquire a customer?

Companies that are unprofitable at a customer level i.e. whose lifetime revenue from the customer is lesser than the cost are unsustainable. Swiggy is profitable on customer economics, the revenue from its customers is more than the costs. It can hence spend on acquiring customers.

Businesses use their profits to acquire more customers, who give them more profit in the future (virtuous cycle). In case the business needs to grow faster than its profits allow, it raises external capital. The capital is used to acquire customers, and grow faster. After Swiggy has a certain number of customers, the hope is that it will be profitable enough to sustain itself. This belief is strong because if Swiggy reduces spending on customer acquisition, it is profitable (point 1).

(Good) VC money is almost always used to grow faster.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2i8km05nrbaoh6ut', 'title': 'Where does Swiggy use $100m huge funding?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Growing faster, and faster.\n\nBut you may think “why are investors funding losses at present?”.

Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,Jan 14,From where will the funds come to build the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya?,"The entire expenditure has come from donations in cash to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. Even donations in gold and other valuables were received and they were monetized by the Trust.

The secular government of India or the state of Uttar Pradesh has not spent more than a rupee. That rupee was a donation.

So anti BJP, and anti Modi and anti-temple readers who would like to question the expenditure have no leg to stand on.

I also heard that a major portion of the construction cost if not the entire cost has been met from the interest from the donated money!

The trust that manages the temple is rich and will remain rich.

Just a word from them about any shortage of money will result in a flood of donations that will drown the Trust and leave them gasping.

That is how dear and important the temple is for the millions of Indians in this country who have struggled for 500 years to make this a reality.

I hope this does not increase the blood pressure of the Anti BJP, Anti Temple Indians who ask why no hospital or university is built instead of a Temple.

Brendan Baker,Updated 11y,"What should be the answer to ""What if Google builds the same product as yours tomorrow""? What do investors expect when they ask this question?","I have a more dismissive answer to this question than most people. I feel that most of the time, investors who ask these types of questions either:

a) don't know what they're talking about, or
b) know there's a good answer and just want to hear you say it.

First, I would acknowledge that there are a small number of product areas where this is a real risk. I'd have a few examples ready (certain types of ads/ad networks, indexing content, analytics, etc)

Then I'd dive into a few reasons why big companies can't always beat smaller, quicker companies in the same product area:

1) We're hyper focused on building this solution, whereas Google's got X products on their plate (I'd bet X>50, though I haven't counted). This also means we can move faster.

2) Google has to extend or protect existing, successful products. This affects their ability to build new products in ways that might threaten current business. We can be more challenging or extreme.

3) Google doesn't have it in their DNA or culture to build this product properly. This is my favorite. Companies have specific worldviews, baked into culture and processes, that allow or prevent them from building products in certain areas.

Let's take an extreme example. Apple will never build a successful social network because they work with high structure, secrecy, very careful planning, and defined, public launches. No viable social network can be built under those conditions. As strong as they are, they're just not a threat here.

Finally, I'd have a list ready of all of the Google products that haven't dominated in the market. Wave, Video Player, Health, Web Accelerator, Answers, Coupons, Voice Search, Buzz, X, Catalogue, Audio Ads, Page Creator, Notebook...


So my argument would go like this:

""Yes, it's true Google threatens a few areas like A, B and C. They can do this because they're great at D. But they won't be able to create a dominant product in our space because of E and F. And this isn't the only space Google can't claim, they've failed at example, example, example and example in the past. That's why we respect, but aren't worried about Google.""

She packed those rubber bands into Mini infant Milk Bottles.

Are we paying 4.20 Rs more for the packaging of a 0.80Rs product?

Chris O'Leary,Updated 2y,Does the infrastructure bill possibly create jobs without continuous funding throughout the years?,"Funding for the infrastructure bill is built into the bill, so it is funded for the full 10 years it covers, an average of $120 Billion per year.

The Bipartisan bill covers the cost of a wide array of infrastructure projects across all 50 states:

$110B for Roads and Bridges
$73B for the Power Grids
$66B for Railways
$65B for Broadband Internet, much of it to expand broadband’s reach to rural areas,
$55B for Drinking Water
$50B for Cybersecurity resistance and CLimate Change countermeasures, including money to protect against droughts and floods
$42B for Airports and Waterways
$39B for Public Transit
$21B for Environmental Spending and pollution remediation
$11B for Transportation Safety
$7.5B to improve electric vehicle support infrastructure (mostly EV Power stations)
$7.5B for Electric Buses

Only $550 Billion of the $1.2T ($55B per year) is actually new spending, so the question isn’t where does the $1.2T come from, it’s “where does the extra $55B Per year come from?”

As required, the bill’s funding for any new spending is included in the bill. Most of It will come from the following sources:

$205B from unspent Pandmic relief funds appropriated in earlier legislation

$56B from additional tax revenue from economic growth generated from increased infrastructure projects (One of the reasons infrastructure spending enjoys widespread bipartisan support is that there is almost always a solid expected Return on Investment.)

$50B from recouped unemployment benefits claimed by fraudsters

$49B from delaying the Trump era Medicare Rebate Rule

$53B from unspent unemployment benefits from states that ended enhanced payments early

$28B from increased tax reporting rules for cryptocurrency investors

$21B from fees on government-sponsored enterprise

$20B from wireless spectrum auction sales

$13B from Superfund fees charged to corporate polluters

When Biden was selling the Infrastructure bill, a lot of Republicans Pretended that when he said the bill wouldn’t add any debt, that he was saying it wouldn’t cost anything. Biden never said the bill wouldn’t cost anything, he repeatedly, and correctly said that it wouldn’t add to the debt, because all the new spending in the bill was being appropriated from repurposed or new sources of funding, which as you can see from the list, the new spending is accounted for.

So in answer to your question, the infrastructure bill was passed in the Senate by a LARGE bipartisan majority in large part because the Biden administration was able to work out a plan that did not include any new taxes, or new debt.

The fact that so few Republicans in the House voted for the bill should raise some eyebrows in the home districts of those Congressmen who were afraid to vote for it because of politics, districts that will directly benefit from the infrastructure projects coming to their neck of the woods.

I live in such a district. I will vote accordingly next year.

Jennifer Collins,10mo,What happens when a startup loses all the funding received from venture capitalists? What are the clauses in the contract to be aware of?,"When a startup loses all their venture capital funding, it can be a devastating experience.

Depending on the terms of the agreement between the startup and the venture capitalists, the venture capitalists may be entitled to reclaim the funds they’ve invested in the company, or they may even take ownership of the company’s assets.

Additionally, if the venture capitalists have a seat on the board or are significant shareholders, they may also be able to influence decisions about the company’s future.

It’s important for startups to understand the exact terms of their contract with venture capitalists before the funding is provided.

Clauses to be aware of include those that cover the venture capitalists’ rights in the event of a loss of funds or change in the company’s management.

A good contract will also cover the venture capitalists’ liabilities should the startup fail.

Finally, it’s important for startups to understand the exact conditions for the return of invested capital in case of a success or failure.

Knowing what to expect in the event of a disastrous loss of funding can save a startup from a financial disaster.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lsydzh0mxitbap48', 'title': 'What happens when a startup loses all the funding received from venture capitalists?

Mind you, we don’t need a lot of funding. We don’t need radio spectrometers or any other type of fancy equipment. I guess once in a blue moon, I wouldn’t mind having access to a supercomputer, although I could do without.

Moisey Uretsky,7y,"What is it like to be funded by Andreessen-Horowitz? How did they scout you to become a portfolio company, bring you in, and then add value after the fact? Which general partners do you interact with at which stages?","Everything you read about how amazing it is to work with a16z is true, so let's go through the full process here.

Intro to a16z

A16Z is great at meeting companies because their team is so large. Getting a meeting with a partner is always best by getting a warm intro to them through another founder or through one of your other investors, but they also have many analysts that are helping to source deals and reaching out to one of them directly to provide them some materials is a great starting step if you can't arrange for a warm intro.

Process

They're great on running a smooth and efficient process. Again thanks to the number of deals they do and how large the firm is everything was very orderly and timely and we were engaged the entire way through the process. There was no feet dragging, next steps and decision points happened very quickly, and overall it was a great process where we felt engaged the entire time.

Terms

Because the mission of a16z was to build a VC firm that put the founder first, and worked for the founder, rather than the other way around, the terms were very founder friendly and didn't require a lot of back and forth between legal. This made again for a great experience and also made the process very quick moving from terms to closing.

a16z On-boarding

Once you get the funds you are invited into their on-boarding. Because there are so many different teams and services that they provide, you basically spend a day meeting every single one of the teams, the point person, what functions they perform. Some of the teams fill an immediate need for you, others have you wonder why you aren't doing it yet, and the third set are good to know as your business continues to grow. For the teams that you need immediately you basically setup a call right in the on-boarding to follow up and start working together.

Some of the teams that we took immediate advantage of:

IC Recruiting
Exec Recruiting
Internship Recruiting
Financing (Whether it is debt or raising future rounds)
Sales Mentorship
Cofounder Mentorship
Introductions

Because their portfolio is so large you can always find a company that they've invested in that isn't competitive but is doing something you want to learn about and they have been great at facilitating introductions to key members of those teams. This has been extremely helpful because it allows you to learn directly from others that are doing something similar and can provide feedback on what they did that worked, what didn't, and what big mistakes to potentially avoid.

Overall

It's kind of like Ferris says in Ferris Bueller's day off about the Ferrari he borrowed, ""If you have the means I highly recommend getting one."" Same for a16z. If you are lucky enough to get a term sheet from them, I highly recommend them. As we've now been working together for close to two years my opinion hasn't changed. They continue to add value, they continue to be founder friendly, and they continue to provide introductions to key people around the issues that you are experiencing. They are also hands-off, meaning if you want to take advantage of the services they offer then you can, if you don't, then you don't have to.

Basically, can't say enough good things about them. =]","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8dpgvtlaek4jn3zq', 'title': 'What is it like to be funded by Andreessen-Horowitz?

Getting a meeting with a partner is always best by getting a warm intro to them through another founder or through one of your other investors, but they also have many analysts that are helping to source deals and reaching out to one of them directly to provide them some materials is a great starting step if you can\'t arrange for a warm intro.\n\nProcess\n\nThey\'re great on running a smooth and efficient process. Again thanks to the number of deals they do and how large the firm is everything was very orderly and timely and we were engaged the entire way through the process. There was no feet dragging, next steps and decision points happened very quickly, and overall it was a great process where we felt engaged the entire time.\n\nTerms\n\nBecause the mission of a16z was to build a VC firm that put the founder first, and worked for the founder, rather than the other way around, the terms were very founder friendly and didn\'t require a lot of back and forth between legal. This made again for a great experience and also made the process very quick moving from terms to closing.\n\na16z On-boarding\n\nOnce you get the funds you are invited into their on-boarding. Because there are so many different teams and services that they provide, you basically spend a day meeting every single one of the teams, the point person, what functions they perform. Some of the teams fill an immediate need for you, others have you wonder why you aren\'t doing it yet, and the third set are good to know as your business continues to grow. For the teams that you need immediately you basically setup a call right in the on-boarding to follow up and start working together.\n\nSome of the teams that we took immediate advantage of:\n\nIC Recruiting\nExec Recruiting\nInternship Recruiting\nFinancing (Whether it is debt or raising future rounds)\nSales Mentorship\nCofounder Mentorship\nIntroductions\n\nBecause their portfolio is so large you can always find a company that they\'ve invested in that isn\'t competitive but is doing something you want to learn about and they have been great at facilitating introductions to key members of those teams. This has been extremely helpful because it allows you to learn directly from others that are doing something similar and can provide feedback on what they did that worked, what didn\'t, and what big mistakes to potentially avoid.\n\nOverall\n\nIt\'s kind of like Ferris says in Ferris Bueller\'s day off about the Ferrari he borrowed, ""If you have the means I highly recommend getting one."" Same for a16z. If you are lucky enough to get a term sheet from them, I highly recommend them. As we\'ve now been working together for close to two years my opinion hasn\'t changed. They continue to add value, they continue to be founder friendly, and they continue to provide introductions to key people around the issues that you are experiencing. They are also hands-off, meaning if you want to take advantage of the services they offer then you can, if you don\'t, then you don\'t have to.\n\nBasically, can\'t say enough good things about them. =]', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.7156
Colin Riegels,3y,Why is the UK government allowing construction companies to continue working? Is it related to their contribution to Tory funds?,"Construction isn’t like gardening. You can’t just walk away halfway through a job and assume nothing will change in your absence. If you have a structure where a certain part of it has been put in place just downing tools and walking away can have a number of effects. In a worst case scenario, you leave things in an unsafe state - particularly if gas or electrical work is involved. But even if it is not actually unsafe - in many situations walking away causes disproportionate damage and harm.

To take a simple example, if the builders have just taken the wall down in your living room, and then they say “well, we’re off - we’ll maybe come back in 3 weeks depending on what the government says” is unhelpful. Same is probably true if you plumber is halfway through replacing your boiler. They simply can’t walk away and leave things in that state - not least because not being able to wash your hands for 3 weeks isn’t going to help the fight against Covid-19.

Our response to the pandemic has to be proportionate. If we can eliminate 95% of social contact, then that is enormously helpful. We accept that a certain amount of “on site” work has to carry on: hospitals, prisons, police, etc. I don’t have a serious problem adding building work to that.

Kendra Morgan,9mo,"If venture capitalists are able to provide such huge funding for founders of a company, why don’t they instead use the money to set up their own companies, where they’ll have much higher equity?","Venture capitalists are able to invest in a company with much lower equity by buying a small stake for a much higher amount of money.

This allows them to take on less risk, as the founder has more at stake than the venture capitalist.

Plus, VCs are able to bring their expertise and experience to the table, and be involved in the fruition of the company's growth.

That being said, there are many reasons why a venture capitalist wouldn't want to start their own companies.

Firstly, it can be incredibly time-consuming and requires expertise, resources and capital.

Secondly, VCs are more likely to receive a higher return on a successful investment than they would have on setting up their own companies.

Pravin Gupta,Oct 9,What was your startup's seed funding round like?,"He offered to chip in 20 lakhs for 30% equity in my company. A Delhi-based investor he was, who had assisted a startup secure funding from the Shark Tank.

I accepted. Not because of his legit background. Most importantly, because, I needed money.

My startup required a strong launch, only a good amount of funding could ensure the same.

20 lakhs were enough as seed fund to convert my MVP into a market-ready product. I was happy and preparing for a party until —

He called me and revised his proposal:

He would replace me as CEO.
Appoint CTO and CFO of his choice.
Strengthen equity from 30% to 53% in his share.
Increase funding from 20 to 25 lakhs.

He reasoned this astounding move that I am handling everything, from backend to database to marketing, all alone. And on top of it, the company is generating no revenue.

Obviously, his points were valid but the demands were way too exaggerated.

I immediately dialled another Founder of a well-established startup.

“No, Pravin. Back off instantly. He will eat up your startup. Your idea is unique and has a lot of potential. Just for mere money, don't let it go into a wrong hand.”

He imitated exactly like my gut feeling. Finally, I sensed the investor's original intention.

We call such people ‘HOUNDS' in entrepreneurial world, who try to digest the company at lower investment.

I was well aware of this practice. That's why, before I could receive the term sheet, I cancelled the deal, ending a dramatic dilemma.

Had I accepted his offer, I would have to work in my own company like an employee.

Neither did I won, nor did I lose. But if my decision would have been in his favour, I would have surely failed as an entrepreneur.

We may fall. We may pivot. But we will never GIVE UP! Because that's what Founders do; they fight…until the very end!

Hannah Scott,Oct 6,"Is it possible to raise venture capital funding without traction, especially if you have a hardware product that will require millions to develop and validate? What do VC’s look for in this case?","Well, well, well, my dear Quora user, it seems you've stumbled upon a rather intriguing question.

Is it possible to raise venture capital funding without traction for a hardware product that requires millions to develop and validate?

Ah, the eternal struggle of entrepreneurs seeking funding for their ambitious ventures.

Now, let me give it to you straight.

In the world of venture capital, traction is like the holy grail.

It's what gets those VCs all hot and bothered.

They want to see evidence that your product is gaining traction in the market, that customers are flocking to it like seagulls to a bag of fries at the beach.

But here's the catch: if you have a hardware product that requires millions to develop and validate, well, my friend, you're in for a bumpy ride.

You see, VCs are a cautious bunch.

They like to play it safe and invest in businesses that have some semblance of proof that they'll be successful.

So, if you come knocking on their door with just an idea and no traction to show for it, they might look at you like you're a unicorn trying to sell them rainbow-colored dreams.

It's not impossible, mind you, but it's a tough sell.

VCs want to see that you've done your homework, that you've got a solid plan, and that you're not just blowing hot air.

So, my advice to you, my eager entrepreneur, is to buckle up, gather some traction, and show those VCs what you're made of.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/72309nk54cwrjszy', 'title': 'Is it possible to raise venture capital funding without traction, especially if you have a hardware product that will require millions to develop and validate?

These scams ranges from crude and clumsy to highly polished and sophisticated. These schemes recruit people through ad and e-mails that promise everything from turning $10 to $2000 or making your money work for you.

Don’t fall victim to an investment scam. It is easier than you think for crooks to con you out of your hard-earned money if you let your guard down. Don’t be dumb and ignorant about any form of investment opportunity, do your research properly unless you don’t value your money.

Kendra Morgan,Feb 2,How are DeFi projects funded?,"DeFi projects, or decentralized finance projects, are typically funded through a process known as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or Initial Exchange Offering (IEO).

Essentially, the project team creates a new cryptocurrency or token, which is sold to investors in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

The funds raised from these sales are then used to finance the development and operation of the DeFi platform.

It's important to note that this funding model is not unique to DeFi projects - it's similar to how many tech startups have been funded for years.

However, the decentralized and unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market can make ICOs and IEOs particularly risky for investors.

There's often little oversight or accountability, and the lack of regulatory clarity can make it difficult to determine which projects are legitimate and which are scams.

That being said, I'm a firm believer that risk and reward go hand in hand.

If you're willing to do your due diligence and invest in a project that you believe in, the potential rewards can be significant.

Just be prepared for a wild ride - the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and there are no guarantees when it comes to investing in DeFi projects.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1zgm5i4a6ywt97ue', 'title': 'How are DeFi projects funded?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""DeFi projects, or decentralized finance projects, are typically funded through a process known as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or Initial Exchange Offering (IEO).\n\nEssentially, the project team creates a new cryptocurrency or token, which is sold to investors in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nThe funds raised from these sales are then used to finance the development and operation of the DeFi platform.\n\nIt's important to note that this funding model is not unique to DeFi projects - it's similar to how many tech startups have been funded for years.\n\nHowever, the decentralized and unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market can make ICOs and IEOs particularly risky for investors.\n\nThere's often little oversight or accountability, and the lack of regulatory clarity can make it difficult to determine which projects are legitimate and which are scams.\n\nThat being said, I'm a firm believer that risk and reward go hand in hand.\n\nIf you're willing to do your due diligence and invest in a project that you believe in, the potential rewards can be significant.\n\nJust be prepared for a wild ride - the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and there are no guarantees when it comes to investing in DeFi projects."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1989602, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""DeFi projects, or decentralized finance projects, are typically funded through a process known as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or Initial Exchange Offering (IEO).\n\nEssentially, the project team creates a new cryptocurrency or token, which is sold to investors in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nThe funds raised from these sales are then used to finance the development and operation of the DeFi platform.\n\nIt's important to note that this funding model is not unique to DeFi projects - it's similar to how many tech startups have been funded for years.\n\nHowever, the decentralized and unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market can make ICOs and IEOs particularly risky for investors.\n\nThere's often little oversight or accountability, and the lack of regulatory clarity can make it difficult to determine which projects are legitimate and which are scams.\n\nThat being said, I'm a firm believer that risk and reward go hand in hand.\n\nIf you're willing to do your due diligence and invest in a project that you believe in, the potential rewards can be significant.\n\nJust be prepared for a wild ride - the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and there are no guarantees when it comes to investing in DeFi projects."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Kendra Morgan,Nov 14,Where do you find similar to venture capital funding for smaller projects?,"Finding funding for smaller projects can be a real pain, especially if you're not part of the Silicon Valley elite or have a trust fund to rely on.

But fear not, my friend, because there are options out there for us mere mortals who dare to dream beyond the realms of unicorn startups.

One avenue you could explore is angel investors.

These are wealthy individuals who are willing to take a gamble on promising projects and provide the capital needed to get them off the ground.

Now, finding these elusive creatures might require a bit of networking and schmoozing, but hey, that's the price you pay for potentially striking gold.

Another option is crowdfunding.

It's like begging for money, but in a more socially acceptable way.

Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow you to pitch your project to the masses and convince them to open their wallets in support of your grand vision.

Just make sure your idea is compelling enough to stand out in the sea of help me make a potato salad campaigns.

Lastly, don't underestimate the power of good old-fashioned bootstrapping.

It may not be glamorous, but if you're willing to tighten your belt, cut back on frivolous expenses (yes, that means fewer avocado toasts), and channel your inner MacGyver, you might be able to fund your project yourself.

It's a tough road, but hey, who needs venture capitalists anyway?

So, my aspiring entrepreneur, venture beyond the traditional paths, embrace the hustle, and remember that the journey to funding greatness is paved with rejection emails and sleepless nights.

But hey, what's a little sarcasm and opinionated advice between dreamers?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zjbygu8o4xm31cfn', 'title': 'Where do you find similar to venture capital funding for smaller projects?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Finding funding for smaller projects can be a real pain, especially if you're not part of the Silicon Valley elite or have a trust fund to rely on.\n\nBut fear not, my friend, because there are options out there for us mere mortals who dare to dream beyond the realms of unicorn startups.\n\nOne avenue you could explore is angel investors.\n\nThese are wealthy individuals who are willing to take a gamble on promising projects and provide the capital needed to get them off the ground.\n\nNow, finding these elusive creatures might require a bit of networking and schmoozing, but hey, that's the price you pay for potentially striking gold.\n\nAnother option is crowdfunding.\n\nIt's like begging for money, but in a more socially acceptable way.\n\nPlatforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow you to pitch your project to the masses and convince them to open their wallets in support of your grand vision.\n\nJust make sure your idea is compelling enough to stand out in the sea of help me make a potato salad campaigns.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of good old-fashioned bootstrapping.\n\nIt may not be glamorous, but if you're willing to tighten your belt, cut back on frivolous expenses (yes, that means fewer avocado toasts), and channel your inner MacGyver, you might be able to fund your project yourself.\n\nIt's a tough road, but hey, who needs venture capitalists anyway?\n\nSo, my aspiring entrepreneur, venture beyond the traditional paths, embrace the hustle, and remember that the journey to funding greatness is paved with rejection emails and sleepless nights.\n\nBut hey, what's a little sarcasm and opinionated advice between dreamers?"", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1989595, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Finding funding for smaller projects can be a real pain, especially if you're not part of the Silicon Valley elite or have a trust fund to rely on.\n\nBut fear not, my friend, because there are options out there for us mere mortals who dare to dream beyond the realms of unicorn startups.\n\nOne avenue you could explore is angel investors.\n\nThese are wealthy individuals who are willing to take a gamble on promising projects and provide the capital needed to get them off the ground.\n\nNow, finding these elusive creatures might require a bit of networking and schmoozing, but hey, that's the price you pay for potentially striking gold.\n\nAnother option is crowdfunding.\n\nIt's like begging for money, but in a more socially acceptable way.\n\nPlatforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow you to pitch your project to the masses and convince them to open their wallets in support of your grand vision.\n\nJust make sure your idea is compelling enough to stand out in the sea of help me make a potato salad campaigns.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of good old-fashioned bootstrapping.\n\nIt may not be glamorous, but if you're willing to tighten your belt, cut back on frivolous expenses (yes, that means fewer avocado toasts), and channel your inner MacGyver, you might be able to fund your project yourself.\n\nIt's a tough road, but hey, who needs venture capitalists anyway?\n\nSo, my aspiring entrepreneur, venture beyond the traditional paths, embrace the hustle, and remember that the journey to funding greatness is paved with rejection emails and sleepless nights.\n\nBut hey, what's a little sarcasm and opinionated advice between dreamers?"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Rachel Ryan,Dec 6,"Let’s say I have an idea and a venture capitalist agrees to give me funding, can this funding be used to research and experiment before making it a final product?","Of course, my dear friend, if a venture capitalist is kind enough to grace you with their funding, you are free to use it as you please!

Who needs a pesky final product when you can embark on a whimsical journey of research and experimentation?

In fact, I highly recommend it.

Why bother with the hassle of creating something tangible when you can indulge in endless theoretical ponderings and intellectual musings?

But let me offer you a word of caution, my naive friend.

While frolicking in the realm of research and experimentation may be intellectually stimulating, it is unlikely to impress your venture capitalist for long.

They tend to have this peculiar fondness for returns on their investments, you see.

So, while you're busy exploring the far reaches of your idea, remember to keep an eye on the clock and eventually channel your brilliant insights into creating a tangible product that can actually generate revenue.

After all, venture capitalists aren't known for their limitless patience or their willingness to fund never-ending intellectual pursuits.

Good luck, my daring dreamer!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/avyw1l7hgdriuqbm', 'title': 'Let’s say I have an idea and a venture capitalist agrees to give me funding, can this funding be used to research and experiment before making it a final product?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Of course, my dear friend, if a venture capitalist is kind enough to grace you with their funding, you are free to use it as you please!\n\nWho needs a pesky final product when you can embark on a whimsical journey of research and experimentation?\n\nIn fact, I highly recommend it.\n\nWhy bother with the hassle of creating something tangible when you can indulge in endless theoretical ponderings and intellectual musings?\n\nBut let me offer you a word of caution, my naive friend.\n\nWhile frolicking in the realm of research and experimentation may be intellectually stimulating, it is unlikely to impress your venture capitalist for long.\n\nThey tend to have this peculiar fondness for returns on their investments, you see.\n\nSo, while you're busy exploring the far reaches of your idea, remember to keep an eye on the clock and eventually channel your brilliant insights into creating a tangible product that can actually generate revenue.\n\nAfter all, venture capitalists aren't known for their limitless patience or their willingness to fund never-ending intellectual pursuits.\n\nGood luck, my daring dreamer!"", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1989593, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Of course, my dear friend, if a venture capitalist is kind enough to grace you with their funding, you are free to use it as you please!\n\nWho needs a pesky final product when you can embark on a whimsical journey of research and experimentation?\n\nIn fact, I highly recommend it.\n\nWhy bother with the hassle of creating something tangible when you can indulge in endless theoretical ponderings and intellectual musings?\n\nBut let me offer you a word of caution, my naive friend.\n\nWhile frolicking in the realm of research and experimentation may be intellectually stimulating, it is unlikely to impress your venture capitalist for long.\n\nThey tend to have this peculiar fondness for returns on their investments, you see.\n\nSo, while you're busy exploring the far reaches of your idea, remember to keep an eye on the clock and eventually channel your brilliant insights into creating a tangible product that can actually generate revenue.\n\nAfter all, venture capitalists aren't known for their limitless patience or their willingness to fund never-ending intellectual pursuits.\n\nGood luck, my daring dreamer!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Anand Sinha,8y,How did the CEO of Pressplay get funding? He is just a B.com degree holder with 5 years of experience.,"Hi  Great question and completely true - Like many of us in India I am a simple commerce graduate. Post my degree I landed a job in a company called D.E.Shaw & Co. It was a great 2 years, made many good friends. Post Shaw I was lucky to be at the right place at the right time. Someone introduced Zomato to me and I joined them in early 2011. Zomato was a still a very small team at that time and I got to work with closely with the founders and some great folks. I learnt doing/building/scaling a business first hand while keeping focus on revenue, company culture, user experience and employees. I got a chance to travel, launch and manage multiple cities and verticals. My ~3 years in Zomato was the best (crash!) course on starting up that anyone could have ever got.  I can also proudly say that I always worked hard and learnt as much as I could. I understood very early that a start up takes over your life you have to be ok with it. You give up on many things like people, travel, night outs but you become richer in experience.  These experiences helped me start PressPlay along with my friend and co-founder,George, who had a similar learning trajectory in D.E Shaw and Zomato.  Both of us and the entire team at PressPlay has worked really hard to get where we are today (and we know the hustle is just starting) which helped us raise a good seed round from top global investors. Of course you need some luck at your side as well for everything to come together.  Degrees don't really matter. Hard work, attitude, experiences and having some great people around you does.  Hope this helps. Cheers!

Jennifer Collins,Dec 5,How do venture capitalists raise new funds?,"Venture capital, my dear friend, is like a magical money-making machine, but without the actual magic or the guarantee of making money.

You see, venture capitalists are these mystical beings who believe they have the Midas touch when it comes to investing in startups.

They throw their money at these fledgling companies, hoping that one of them will turn into the next Facebook or Uber and make them filthy rich.

But let me tell you, the reality is far from glamorous.

Venture capitalists make money through a process called exits.

Basically, they invest in a bunch of startups, and then they wait and pray for one of them to either go public or get acquired by a bigger company.

If that happens, they cash in their chips and hopefully make a handsome profit.

But here's the catch - most startups fail.

Yes, my friend, the harsh truth is that the majority of these ventures crash and burn, leaving the venture capitalists with nothing but shattered dreams and empty pockets.

So, in essence, venture capital is a risky business.

It's like gambling, except you're not sitting at a poker table, you're sitting at the edge of your seat, hoping that your investment will turn into a unicorn.

And if it does, well, then you can bask in the glory of your success and pretend that venture capital is the most lucrative thing in the world.

But if it doesn't, you'll be left wondering why you ever thought this was a good idea in the first place.

So, my friend, venture capital is not for the faint of heart.

It's a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs, and only the bravest and luckiest souls come out on top.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/i5nlag3oc2bw49hd', 'title': 'How do venture capitalists raise new funds?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Venture capital, my dear friend, is like a magical money-making machine, but without the actual magic or the guarantee of making money.\n\nYou see, venture capitalists are these mystical beings who believe they have the Midas touch when it comes to investing in startups.\n\nThey throw their money at these fledgling companies, hoping that one of them will turn into the next Facebook or Uber and make them filthy rich.\n\nBut let me tell you, the reality is far from glamorous.\n\nVenture capitalists make money through a process called exits.\n\nBasically, they invest in a bunch of startups, and then they wait and pray for one of them to either go public or get acquired by a bigger company.\n\nIf that happens, they cash in their chips and hopefully make a handsome profit.\n\nBut here's the catch - most startups fail.\n\nYes, my friend, the harsh truth is that the majority of these ventures crash and burn, leaving the venture capitalists with nothing but shattered dreams and empty pockets.\n\nSo, in essence, venture capital is a risky business.\n\nIt's like gambling, except you're not sitting at a poker table, you're sitting at the edge of your seat, hoping that your investment will turn into a unicorn.\n\nAnd if it does, well, then you can bask in the glory of your success and pretend that venture capital is the most lucrative thing in the world.\n\nBut if it doesn't, you'll be left wondering why you ever thought this was a good idea in the first place.\n\nSo, my friend, venture capital is not for the faint of heart.\n\nIt's a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs, and only the bravest and luckiest souls come out on top."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1989587, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Venture capital, my dear friend, is like a magical money-making machine, but without the actual magic or the guarantee of making money.\n\nYou see, venture capitalists are these mystical beings who believe they have the Midas touch when it comes to investing in startups.\n\nThey throw their money at these fledgling companies, hoping that one of them will turn into the next Facebook or Uber and make them filthy rich.\n\nBut let me tell you, the reality is far from glamorous.\n\nVenture capitalists make money through a process called exits.\n\nBasically, they invest in a bunch of startups, and then they wait and pray for one of them to either go public or get acquired by a bigger company.\n\nIf that happens, they cash in their chips and hopefully make a handsome profit.\n\nBut here's the catch - most startups fail.\n\nYes, my friend, the harsh truth is that the majority of these ventures crash and burn, leaving the venture capitalists with nothing but shattered dreams and empty pockets.\n\nSo, in essence, venture capital is a risky business.\n\nIt's like gambling, except you're not sitting at a poker table, you're sitting at the edge of your seat, hoping that your investment will turn into a unicorn.\n\nAnd if it does, well, then you can bask in the glory of your success and pretend that venture capital is the most lucrative thing in the world.\n\nBut if it doesn't, you'll be left wondering why you ever thought this was a good idea in the first place.\n\nSo, my friend, venture capital is not for the faint of heart.\n\nIt's a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs, and only the bravest and luckiest souls come out on top."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Amanda Kevin,Oct 16,Will the future of space travel be predominantly publicly or privately funded?,"Well, let me tell you something, my friend.

The future of space travel will be neither predominantly publicly nor privately funded.

It will be fueled by the sheer force of imagination and the unyielding determination of dreamers who refuse to be bound by the limitations of conventional thinking.

Who needs funding when you have a rocket made out of pure willpower and a spacesuit stitched together with dreams?

But if you insist on choosing between public and private funding, let me burst your bubble.

Publicly funded space travel?

Please!

We'll be lucky if we can get a government to agree on what to have for lunch, let alone invest billions in interstellar escapades.

Anil Ellwood,2y,What are the best ways to generate good business ideas?,"I have actually operated a business for 7 years, but even before that, I misused around 2 years of contemplating what business enterprise I ought to set up. I've consistently known I wish to have my personal company-the tip of being my very own manager and also having no cap on my revenue assured me that it's a great path to involve.

Putting together the business enterprise is actually perhaps the hardest activity I've faced. I didn't intend to launch a business that could fail within a month or two. And so, I investigated hard-which, in retrospection, is a misguided thing to execute. In the web time, there's this thing called information overload. I failed to find out what business organization I really want, only that I want to have a business.

There is actually a lot of websites online that respond to the query, ""What business kind pays?"" I have actually read through replies like partner marketing, dropshipping, Amazon FBA, web courses, writing, freelancing, Instagram influencer, etc. The common mystery of choice. There are simply lots of choices that I ended up not prolonging my decision for many years.

Hence, my guidance for picking your business you ought to start is actually straightforward: restrain your selections to a few. That sounds easier said than done, however, there is actually an approach I've acquired. To help me determine, I restricted my options based upon the observing standards:

1. Matches my persona (incredibly vital).

2. Goes with my everyday life.

3. Success (certainly not that significant).

Accommodates my style.

One of the most crucial elements, possibly, is actually selecting a business enterprise that meets you specifically. You can easily bring in tons of income along with almost any kind of business model, however, only if it suits you. For example, Youtubers and Instagram influencers get a bunch of money, although you might certainly not succeed in this pathway if you are actually a private professional. I am actually certainly not saying that there are business enterprises without attempt and reparation. Each one all of them will certainly take up a significant part of your life, and also it is actually only a matter of opting for which one is worth your moment.

A prosperous close friend of mine presented me with the insight that led me to where I am right now. He provided me a quick quiz that exposed my persona, objectives in life as well as offered me a list of businesses that are going to really suit me, particularly. It's just a 2-minute quiz
 that will definitely provide you an understanding of what business enterprise you really should establish. This enables you to restrict your selections based upon what meets your style.

Accommodates my way of life.

I strongly believe that your way of life should not hinge on your business. Rather, your business enterprise should perfectly blend along with your life.

This is actually an important variable for me. I want to own a business where I have plenty of spare time to spend along with my friends and also loved ones, and even myself. Admittedly, during the course of the 1st years of my business organization, I was actually doing everything. And yet given that I selected a business enterprise mode that I adore, it came to be much easier to handle the time stipulations.

For some individuals, the opportunity is certainly not a vital aspect. They may care much more about the ability to take a trip even with operating a business. An example of a business organization that is going to certainly not suit these types of individuals is actually a physical business organization. Travelers would gain extra in having an online business that they can easily control anywhere they are actually, just as long as there's web connectivity.

Profitability.

A lot of folks are thinking about earnings when starting off a business. That is actually the 1st miscalculation. As I discussed above, practically any sort of business organization kind pays. Nonetheless, if you do certainly not like the business you are actually carrying out, there is actually a higher likelihood that you will wind up stopping in the 1st month or 2.

Profitability is important, however, certainly not as high as choosing a business organization that suits you. Never ever select entirely for profitability. Blogging sites throughout the web will definitely offer you a checklist of successful business forms. Nonetheless, they fell short to mention that business model doesn't dictate profits although the managers' daily selections and also their perseverance to drive through with their business organization.

Don't get guided by success tales you see online. Develop your very own excellent story and also certainly never pattern your life based on people.

What's Next?

After restraining your options to a couple of (keep in mind, the 2-minute quiz will aid you a great deal), your subsequent action is actually only to launch the business. Concentrate on that type of business enterprise type as well as refrain from comparing the one you decided on to anything else. Trust me; when you've decided on the business you want based upon your style as well as lifestyle, the many other decisions will come simpler.

Kendra Morgan,Feb 1,What is the app that has raised the most venture capital funding worldwide?,"The app that has raised the most venture capital funding worldwide is, without a doubt, a certain social media platform that has become a household name.

I'm sure you can guess which one I'm talking about - it's the one that seems to have a monopoly on our attention these days.

Now, I'm not going to name names, but let's just say that this app has raised billions of dollars in funding, and it's not hard to see why.

They've got a captive audience of millions (if not billions) of users, and they're able to collect massive amounts of data on those users, which they can then use to sell targeted advertising.

It's a formula that has proven to be incredibly lucrative, and it's no wonder that investors are clamoring to get a piece of the action.

But here's the thing - just because an app has raised a lot of money doesn't necessarily mean it's a good app, or even a necessary one.

In fact, I would argue that many of the most successful apps are the ones that fill a real need or solve a genuine problem.

Jennifer Collins,Nov 12,Do all entrepreneurs need venture capitalists to fund their startups? What are the benefits and drawbacks of not getting VC funding?,"Ah, the age-old debate about venture capitalists and startups.

Let me tell you, my dear Quora user, not all entrepreneurs need venture capitalists to fund their startups.

In fact, I would argue that relying on VCs can sometimes be more trouble than it's worth.

Sure, there are benefits to securing VC funding.

It can provide a significant injection of capital, open doors to valuable connections, and give your startup a stamp of approval in the eyes of investors.

But let me ask you this: at what cost?

VCs are not your friendly neighborhood philanthropists.

They want a return on their investment, and they want it big.

Say goodbye to your autonomy and decision-making power because once you take their money, you're dancing to their tune.

And let's not forget the pressure.

VCs expect rapid growth and exponential returns.

They'll be breathing down your neck, scrutinizing every move you make, and demanding results.

It's like having a helicopter parent on steroids.

Not to mention the equity you'll have to give up, diluting your ownership and potentially limiting your future options.

Now, I'm not saying VC funding is inherently evil.

It can be a viable option for certain startups with ambitious growth plans.

But don't fall into the trap of thinking it's the only path to success.

There are plenty of successful entrepreneurs who have bootstrapped their way to greatness, maintaining full control over their vision and enjoying the freedom to make decisions without answering to anyone else.

So, my advice to you, aspiring entrepreneur, is to carefully consider your options.

Think long and hard about what you truly need and what you're willing to sacrifice.

VC funding may be tempting, but remember that there's more than one road to success, and sometimes going it alone can lead to the most fulfilling journey.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/f4kcqjtn2vbhxa8p', 'title': 'Do all entrepreneurs need venture capitalists to fund their startups?

C Stuart Hardwick,4y,Why are we still funding NASA if we are paying other companies to give them a ride or paying other companies to do what NASA is already paid to do?,"Because you don’t understand what it is that NASA is “already paid to do.”

NASA exists to

Provide research and public investment to promote and advance the American aerospace industry.
Conduct research into aerospace related endeavors for the benefit of the American taxpayer and all mankind. This includes things like sending space probes to the planets and building and operating the IIS (essentially a federal science lab in space), neither of which is meant to produce a direct payback, but to advance human understanding of the world we live in.
To utilize the facilities and expertise at its disposal to address other issues for the benefit of the American people and all mankind—which among other things include the development of aerodynamic truck fairings, sonic-boom minimizing airliner models, low noise jet engine chevrons, and aerodynamic intake ducts used in everything from airliners to sports cars.

Space-X, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada, and numerous other private companies only exist because of NASA competitive development programs. If Space-X had stopped with the development of the Falcon-9 booster (as part of such a NASA program) this would be a huge win for the taxpayer, as that alone has slashed space launch costs across the industry and reinfused the industry with competitive pressure.

If Space-X succeeds with its current plans, NASA will be happy to book passed on the resulting booster—just as they plan to on Falcon, just as they routinely do on airliners to carry their staff around the world on business. They will free up large sums of money that NASA can spend on its real job—basic research.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9aw4sj3zqumf0lnp', 'title': 'Why are we still funding NASA if we are paying other companies to give them a ride or paying other companies to do what NASA is already paid to do?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Because you don’t understand what it is that NASA is “already paid to do.”\n\nNASA exists to\n\nProvide research and public investment to promote and advance the American aerospace industry.\nConduct research into aerospace related endeavors for the benefit of the American taxpayer and all mankind.

Amanda Kevin,Dec 7,How do I get funded for my travel startup?,"Well, well, well, another aspiring entrepreneur looking for a magical solution to get funded for their travel startup.

Let me burst your bubble, my friend.

There's no secret formula or shortcut to funding.

It takes hard work, dedication, and a solid business plan to attract investors.

First things first, focus on building a compelling pitch deck that clearly outlines your unique value proposition and demonstrates how you're going to disrupt the travel industry.

Show them why your startup is worth their hard-earned money.

And please, spare us the cliché buzzwords like game-changer and disruptive innovation.Next, start networking like your life depends on it.

Attend industry events, join startup communities, and reach out to potential investors.

But remember, they're not going to hand over their cash just because you have a fancy idea.

You need to prove that you have what it takes to execute your vision successfully.

Lastly, be prepared for rejection.

Investors will say no more times than you can count, but that's part of the game.

Learn from each setback, refine your pitch, and keep pushing forward.

So, put on your big boy/girl pants, roll up your sleeves, and get ready to hustle.

Good luck, you're gonna need it!

Stan Hanks,4y,How does an angel investor not get diluted after additional rounds of funding?,"There’s only one way to avoid getting diluted at any stage of the investing cycle: you have to have participation rights written into your investment agreement, and you have to have the cash to keep playing.

Let’s say you make an angel investment, say $100k for 20% of a company. They do well, and keep rocking along and after a year, your $100k and a ridiculous pile of work on the part of the founders and their extended team and an insane amount of luck, and they’re able to raise a $1M seed round… where the investors also want 20% of the company.

If you have participation rights, you can either horn in on the deal (crowding out part of the rest of the new money) or invest an additional amount, depending on how your terms are written. But you have to write a new check. In this case, you’d need to pony up again. Since the “old money” has 80% of the company post-close, and you have 20% of that, you’d have 16% post-close, and would need to buy your way into another 4% - $200k (plus/minus, I’m going to assume you’re in the new money, not on the side).

So now, you’re in for your original $100k, plus the new $200k, and you still have 20% of the company. Yay you.

Now, it happens again - there’s a Series A raise, but this time they’ve raised $6M for 25%. The old money has 75%, you have 20% of that, so you if you don’t do anything, post-close you’d have 15%. To top up to 20%, you’d need to write a check for $1.2M - a fifth of the $6M that got 25%.

You see how this works, right?

Post-close on the A, you’d still have 20% - but you’d now be in for $1.5M. That’s relatively speaking a bargain, as the most recent money just paid $4.8M for 20%, but it’s real money.

But absent a deal like that? And the ability to keep writing checks? Everytime someone else shows up with a checkbook, you get diluted. Period.

They do well, and keep rocking along and after a year, your $100k and a ridiculous pile of work on the part of the founders and their extended team and an insane amount of luck, and they’re able to raise a $1M seed round… where the investors also want 20% of the company.\n\nIf you have participation rights, you can either horn in on the deal (crowding out part of the rest of the new money) or invest an additional amount, depending on how your terms are written. But you have to write a new check. In this case, you’d need to pony up again. Since the “old money” has 80% of the company post-close, and you have 20% of that, you’d have 16% post-close, and would need to buy your way into another 4% - $200k (plus/minus, I’m going to assume you’re in the new money, not on the side).\n\nSo now, you’re in for your original $100k, plus the new $200k, and you still have 20% of the company.

The old money has 75%, you have 20% of that, so you if you don’t do anything, post-close you’d have 15%. To top up to 20%, you’d need to write a check for $1.2M - a fifth of the $6M that got 25%.\n\nYou see how this works, right?\n\nPost-close on the A, you’d still have 20% - but you’d now be in for $1.5M.

Jennifer Collins,Feb 6,How does seed funding to start a hedge fund work?,"Seed funding for a hedge fund typically involves finding high net worth individuals or family offices who are willing to provide the initial capital to get the fund up and running.

These investors are often called seed investors and in exchange for their early stage funding, they typically receive favorable terms such as a lower management fee or a larger share of the profits.

The process of securing seed funding can be quite challenging, as you need to convince these investors that your hedge fund has a unique and compelling investment strategy that will generate attractive returns.

This often requires a well-crafted pitch deck, a track record of success (if you have one), and a strong network of contacts in the financial industry.

It's also worth noting that seed funding for a hedge fund is not a handout.

Seed investors are expecting to see a significant return on their investment, and they will be closely monitoring the fund's performance to ensure that it is meeting their expectations.

So, if you're thinking about starting a hedge fund, be prepared to work hard, stay disciplined, and deliver results.

After all, that's what being a successful hedge fund manager is all about.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5xzc8qbaj07vimh1', 'title': 'How does seed funding to start a hedge fund work?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Seed funding for a hedge fund typically involves finding high net worth individuals or family offices who are willing to provide the initial capital to get the fund up and running.\n\nThese investors are often called seed investors and in exchange for their early stage funding, they typically receive favorable terms such as a lower management fee or a larger share of the profits.\n\nThe process of securing seed funding can be quite challenging, as you need to convince these investors that your hedge fund has a unique and compelling investment strategy that will generate attractive returns.\n\nThis often requires a well-crafted pitch deck, a track record of success (if you have one), and a strong network of contacts in the financial industry.\n\nIt's also worth noting that seed funding for a hedge fund is not a handout.\n\nSeed investors are expecting to see a significant return on their investment, and they will be closely monitoring the fund's performance to ensure that it is meeting their expectations.\n\nSo, if you're thinking about starting a hedge fund, be prepared to work hard, stay disciplined, and deliver results.\n\nAfter all, that's what being a successful hedge fund manager is all about."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1989542, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Seed funding for a hedge fund typically involves finding high net worth individuals or family offices who are willing to provide the initial capital to get the fund up and running.\n\nThese investors are often called seed investors and in exchange for their early stage funding, they typically receive favorable terms such as a lower management fee or a larger share of the profits.\n\nThe process of securing seed funding can be quite challenging, as you need to convince these investors that your hedge fund has a unique and compelling investment strategy that will generate attractive returns.\n\nThis often requires a well-crafted pitch deck, a track record of success (if you have one), and a strong network of contacts in the financial industry.\n\nIt's also worth noting that seed funding for a hedge fund is not a handout.\n\nSeed investors are expecting to see a significant return on their investment, and they will be closely monitoring the fund's performance to ensure that it is meeting their expectations.\n\nSo, if you're thinking about starting a hedge fund, be prepared to work hard, stay disciplined, and deliver results.\n\nAfter all, that's what being a successful hedge fund manager is all about."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

It's not always easy, especially for companies that are still in their early stages.

However, there are a few steps you can take to narrow down the list and find out which companies have received venture capital funding.

First, contact venture capital firms and ask them for information about the companies they have funded.

Venture capital firms usually list their portfolio companies on their website or in annual reports, which should give you an indication of who is receiving venture capital.

Second, investigate companies through online resources such as Crunchbase, Pitchbook, and Angellist.

These sites provide detailed information about companies and their investors.

Finally, attend industry events, network with people in the venture capital world, and read industry publications to stay up-to-date on the latest investments.

Kendra Morgan,Sep 15,What do venture capitalists look for in startups to grant them seed funding?,"Venture capitalists, oh dear, where do I begin?

These investors, with their deep pockets and inflated egos, have a knack for sniffing out the next big thing in startups.

So, what do these VCs look for when deciding to throw their precious seed funding at a fledgling company?

Well, let me enlighten you.

First and foremost, venture capitalists want to see potential for astronomical returns.

They're not interested in little projects that will make a modest profit; they want unicorns that will make them filthy rich.

And if you don't promise them exponential growth and world domination within the first five years of existence, you might as well pack up your PowerPoint presentation and head home.

But it doesn't stop there.

VCs also want a stellar team, or at least what they perceive as a stellar team.

They'll scrutinize every member of your startup, from the CEO down to the intern fetching coffee.

So, if you have any skeletons in your closet or a hint of incompetence, you'd better hide it well.

They want charismatic leaders who can sell ice to Eskimos and engineers who can code like wizards.

And if you're lacking in either department, good luck getting that precious seed funding.

In conclusion, venture capitalists are like mythical creatures that roam the startup landscape, seeking untapped potential and outrageous profits.

If you can convince them that your startup is the next big thing and you have the dream team to execute it, then maybe, just maybe, they'll grace you with their seed funding.
