Paramartha Sengupta,4y,What are some great advertisements?,"Do you know him?

Rahul Bose is an Indian film actor, director, screenwriter and social activist. Bose has appeared in multiple Bengali films such as Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, Kalpurush, Anuranan, Antaheen, Laptop and The Japanese Wife.

Now recently he was staying at JW Marriott Chandigarh, where after taking his gym sessions, he had ordered two bananas.

Now when he asked for the bill, he was presented this…

₹442.50 for two bananas!

He posted about it on twitter!

And even twitter had a roll of laughter about it!!!

But… A famous brand made business out of it!

I had the OYO app installed in my phone. I usually ignore the notifications, but suddenly this one caught my attention!

They took this surprising incident, and made it an advertisement strategy! Bulls eye!

And I call this a great advertisement!

Alcatraz Dey,6y,What is the worst ad you have ever seen?,"Manushi Chhillar[1] wins the Miss World 2017 title.

Guess who decided to cash in on that fact.

Aakash Institute decided to promote themselves using the fact that she had studied with them.[2]

How can an institute which coaches students for IIT-JEE & Medicals take credit for her winning the beauty pageant?

Atharva Joshi,4y,What are some great advertisements?,"Let's look at a recent McDonald's advertisement.

It is made on keeping people aware to vote on the ongoing elections in India.

What they did was simple. But, effective.

So it's a regular day at McDonald's Hyderabad.

Counter is open. Anyone can come and order their Choices.

Here comes Order no. 1.

2nd one.

To the customer's suprise, the staff didn't deliver what was ordered. They delivered some other food stuff.

(*REACTIONS*)

After angry customers turn up on them, they said-

CLIMAX

*Enter a responsible citizen thought*

The customers who didn't vote didn't have a choice and had to be satisfied in what they we're offered.

So what happens to the people who did vote?

*Insert ‘thug life' action*

So what happens next?

Yes. The main motive.

To cast a vote.

So true.

So go, cast a vote. Be a responsible citizen of India and take the pride. Make a choice and take a decision.

Credits - YouTube, McDonald's India.

No intent to advertise McDonald's, just their motive.

Ajith Tolroy,6y,What are some great advertisements?,"I think this one………..

Lunch break is given and everyone starts taking out their lunch boxes and starts eating…..

But there is a kid who seems to be sad……..

Because he does not have food to eat………

Then he starts to go out as everyone over there was eating and he feels little bit awkward to act like he wants to eat something………

Then he goes to drink water to cover up the lunch time………

When he came back and about to close his box , he feels something fishy in the box which is actually empty.

He opens it and finds out some food, he is kind of in dilemma that how did he get the food ?

Children around him starts smiling by seeing him…….

He starts to look all over the class and everyone acts like they don’t know anything………

But at last he understands that kids around him share some food from theirs.

Then he eats.

And there comes “solutions are often closer than you think”

Language does not do anything to understand emotions.

I found it amazing and it made me cry.

Viswa Vik,5y,What are some of the most creative advertisements/commercials ever made?,"I’ll have to go with the adverts that resulted from the brand war between Pepsi and Coca-cola.

Now, I was unable to find a clear video of this age-old savage commercial by Pepsi.

But bear with the low quality images, its worth the twist.

A boy walks up to a vending machine.

Inserts his coin

Pushes the coca-cola button

Collects the can

and proceeds to place it on the ground.

Repeats the same and places the second can of coke slightly further from the first one.

Now comes the twist of the century.

He steps up on those cans

to reach another button on the machine.

And that is…

collects his can

and walks away happily.

Joy of Pepsi

Pretty brutal and savage, I should say.

But it doesn't stop there…

This scary Halloween costume of Pepsi.

Look at the date at the bottom and this will make sense.

Kate Madenwell,Updated 6y,"What is the smartest street billboard ad you have ever seen, or looked at and liked a lot?","""Sometimes child abuse is only visible to the child suffering it.""

That's what an adult would read on this billboard.

A child would however see a slightly different message. A second sentence appears:

""If somebody hurts you, call us and we'll help you.""

Along with the foundation's phone number.

Bruises and injuries appear on the boy’s face.

How?

This billboard used lenticular printing to show two different images depending on the height of the person reading it.

A great example of extremely powerful and clever advertising.

It makes us literally see from a child’s perspective that “""Sometimes child abuse is only visible to the child suffering it”.

It doubles as both an ad for the help line and an awareness campaign for us adults.

Because child abuse does happen, but we adults don't notice it as much as we could.

It got people talking that child abuse is a very real thing that happens behind closed doors more often than we'd like to think.

It helped children understand what they could do to protect themselves.

The message reached a massive audience.

Newspapers picked up the story. Schools showed this ad to kids. People shared it on Facebook. It went viral and has been seen millions and millions of times.

It made people aware. And acknowledging that a problem exists is the first step to solving a problem.

Dukpa Lotus,Updated Nov 26,What are some examples of great marketing?,"It's probably none other than 2-min instant noodles which is popularly known as “MAGGI” worldwide.

————————-Image from google 3.5 oz ( 100 gm)———————-

Maggi noodles were sold at Rs 10 for 100 gm.

With the ascending demand for it,

Nestle changed it’s price from Rs 10 to Rs 11 for 100 gm Maggi noodles, Suddenly its demand slope went downward very rapidly!

The Reason could be that the customer needed to bring another spare Rs 1 coin every single time, so it could piss off many people and quickly move to another instant noodles for lesser price like Ramen, Wai wai.

Nestle noticed this quickly and could not afford to lose their customers and profit, so they came up with some great marketing skills. They brought maggi back to Rs 10 and while lowering it’s quantity from 100 gm to 95 gm.

Did customer notice this change?

Nope!

So They kept lowering its quantity each time.

95gm

90gm

85gm

80gm

75gm

and now it’s Just 70gm

So within a span of few years Nestle managed to reduce Maggi noodles quantity to 70 % of its original size.

Julian Frank,4y,What are some examples of great marketing?,"A few months ago, in January of this year, the Burger King Twitter account started liking people’s tweets from almost 10 years ago.

All of a sudden, people started to get notifications that Burger King had liked some of their tweets from 2010.

This mostly happened to people with millions of followers.

Many of them made posts about the incident, confused and wanting to know why Burger King was doing this.

This story went viral.

Several news websites wrote articles about it.

Many YouTube creators made videos about it.

Thousands of people on Twitter were tweeting about it.

Everybody wanted to know just why Burger King was liking everybody’s old Tweets.

Well, eventually, Burger King gave everyone the answer they were looking for:

That’s right.

Burger King liked everyone’s old Tweets to confuse people and create buzz online about the weird things they were doing on Twitter.

They knew that people would be confused about why Burger King was liking these tweets, and that many of them would probably make their own Tweets about it.

Then, when enough people were talking about it, Burger King revealed that they were liking Tweets from 2010 to advertise that they were bringing back funnel cake fries.

Which were first introduced in—you guessed it—2010.

Burger King tricked the internet into advertising them to millions of people.

And it didn’t cost them anything.

If that’s not one of the most brilliant marketing campaigns of all time, I don’t know what is.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fr1cvgt2pjz9ol8w', 'title': 'What are some examples of great marketing?', 'score': {'original': 0.9945, 'ai': 0.0055}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'A few months ago, in January of this year, the Burger King Twitter account started liking people’s tweets from almost 10 years ago.\n\nAll of a sudden, people started to get notifications that Burger King had liked some of their tweets from 2010.\n\nThis mostly happened to people with millions of followers.\n\nMany of them made posts about the incident, confused and wanting to know why Burger King was doing this.\n\nThis story went viral.\n\nSeveral news websites wrote articles about it.\n\nMany YouTube creators made videos about it.\n\nThousands of people on Twitter were tweeting about it.\n\nEverybody wanted to know just why Burger King was liking everybody’s old Tweets.\n\nWell, eventually, Burger King gave everyone the answer they were looking for:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nBurger King liked everyone’s old Tweets to confuse people and create buzz online about the weird things they were doing on Twitter.\n\nThey knew that people would be confused about why Burger King was liking these tweets, and that many of them would probably make their own Tweets about it.\n\nThen, when enough people were talking about it, Burger King revealed that they were liking Tweets from 2010 to advertise that they were bringing back funnel cake fries.\n\nWhich were first introduced in—you guessed it—2010.\n\nBurger King tricked the internet into advertising them to millions of people.\n\nAnd it didn’t cost them anything.\n\nIf that’s not one of the most brilliant marketing campaigns of all time, I don’t know what is.', 'result': {'fake': 0.0055, 'real': 0.9945}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1988008, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'A few months ago, in January of this year, the Burger King Twitter account started liking people’s tweets from almost 10 years ago.\n\nAll of a sudden, people started to get notifications that Burger King had liked some of their tweets from 2010.\n\nThis mostly happened to people with millions of followers.\n\nMany of them made posts about the incident, confused and wanting to know why Burger King was doing this.\n\nThis story went viral.\n\nSeveral news websites wrote articles about it.\n\nMany YouTube creators made videos about it.\n\nThousands of people on Twitter were tweeting about it.\n\nEverybody wanted to know just why Burger King was liking everybody’s old Tweets.\n\nWell, eventually, Burger King gave everyone the answer they were looking for:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nBurger King liked everyone’s old Tweets to confuse people and create buzz online about the weird things they were doing on Twitter.\n\nThey knew that people would be confused about why Burger King was liking these tweets, and that many of them would probably make their own Tweets about it.\n\nThen, when enough people were talking about it, Burger King revealed that they were liking Tweets from 2010 to advertise that they were bringing back funnel cake fries.\n\nWhich were first introduced in—you guessed it—2010.\n\nBurger King tricked the internet into advertising them to millions of people.\n\nAnd it didn’t cost them anything.\n\nIf that’s not one of the most brilliant marketing campaigns of all time, I don’t know what is.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9945

Wouldn't that be a shrewdest, smartest manoeuver?

Every year in the month of vaishakh (March-April) Hindu marriage season begins, it comes with a lot of promise to cloth-shopkeepers. We would be stocking our ware-house with 200% capacity just to sell non-stop in marriage season.

But all is not well in vaishakh. Dad and I meet various kind of customers in this wedding season. This story is about a special kind of customer we famously call them “Ladke ka Baap”(Father of the groom).

You might have guessed by now - We are taking about marriage shopping led by none other than father of the groom.
There is something special about this kind which you will find soon enough.

So lets begin with a shopping session.

“Ladke ka baap” would be abbreviated as LAB not LKB, because LKB stands for a slang in my area.

Ladke ka Baap(LAB) : We are here to purchase cloths for marriage purpose, would you be able to provide for it?

Dad: Yeah sure, we have our stocks filled with latest collections.

LAB: Show us best suits. Raymond’s best collections, Don’t waste our time with anything less than 10k.

*Dad smiled, gave me a signal. I went and collected the most mediocre ones from Raymond's*

Dad : See this, this is the latest fad among youth.

*LAB checked, looking confused, discussed it with other relatives*

LAB : What is the range?

Dad : 7000

LAB : NO, NO, NO… we are looking for the best, it’s my son marriage you know?

*So we kept showing suits for next two hours, range kept increasing with quality and at one point we had to come with the best we had.*

Dad : See these, range is from 15k and above.

LAB : Seth jee, look we need to purchase a hell lot of things, if this is the best you got then we will have to go to other shops.

Dad - No, no, please wait I just remembered we have one exclusive range which we only show to privileged customers, give us 5 mins I will be showing you that one personally.

*Dad & I went inside. Dad, what do we do? that’s the highest we got? Dad - just repeat the same range from beginning and see the dance.*

[After 10 mins. I came with the ditto same piece which I showed at the beginning.]

Dad - See this one at 20k.

LAB : *looking confused trying to remember something * isn’t this what we saw before?

Dad: How is that possible? We are showing you range wise, you see the fabric, this fabric is the all together different.

LAB: Ok we select this, show us the best cotton dhoti now.

And same cycle kept repeating and we kept cheating the customer. You might wonder why ? Your answer is here.

Dad : So the total bill is Rs. 150k

Ladke ka baap smilingly said to other fellow : Samdhi- ji, kindly pay the bills we need to buy a lot of stuff this is just clothes.

In this whole shopping session one person was literally crying and hasn’t spoken a single word so far, he had no interest in whatever is being purchased.

And my dad knew by his experience of 40 years, he is father of the bride who will have to pay the bills.

After the father of the bride cleared the bills, my dad whispered him in his ears “Aap aake bad me miliye* ( come visit us later).

The same evening we returned him Rs. 80k which we looted during this whole deal.

We could see the tears rolling through his cheeks, he thanked us million times but no, we didn't do it for charity or out of good-will. It was just a business move to win a customer for our lifetime.

Would you believe I have customers who haven't seen any other shop but mine from their 3 generations?

How do you generate such loyalty? you generate it with compassion which you won't find in “Amazon” or “FlipKart”.

**Try traditional shopping and save our culture, not everyone of us is trying to loot you, some of us know only one thing, that is trade in one line specialised caste wise, we don’t just sell stuff we win hearts as well**

Attaching a picture of the shopkeeper below, and that suit what he is wearing costs around 4k , stitching in my area takes 3k. But if you buy the same thing from Malls it costs around 15k after 30% discount. So you know.

Sean Kernan,4y,What is something that is supposedly a 'luxury' but is actually worse than the regular alternative?,"I went into one of these fancy schmancy European furniture stores recently.

Everything costs one trillion dollars.

Everything is smaller than it looks. You’ll break your shins on all of their furniture.

Everything we sit in is super uncomfortable. When I said, “Hmm. It’s not that comfortable. Do you have anything that is comfortable?”

The sales agent looked at me like I’d just asked her if they sold pet giraffes.

They had outdoor furniture they sold that required regular baths and sprays to take care of every time it rains.

“Well Mr. Kernan, how about this chair?”

Or this?

Literally - nothing was normal. Nothing was comfortable.

I mean, I guess on some level, it is prob...

Lindsay Elizabeth,5y,What is the most innovative advertisement you have seen?,"The launch of Palessi, a new luxury shoe brand, seemed brimming with promise.

Even the storefront was stunning, a former Giorgio Armani store located in an upscale Santa Monica mall.

An interior designer had meticulously set out the room. Embellished with gold accents and a towering angel statue in the center, it seemed to ooze class, or at the very least, money.

The launch party drew in influencers, all of whom raved about the shoes.

“It’s just stunning. Elegant, sophisticated and versatile,” gushed one woman.

“Palessi is just such high quality, high fashion, taking your shoe game up to the next level,” said one man wearing spiked necklaces, holding a high-heeled, knee-high boot. “It looks really well made.”

The good reviews go on and on.

Attendees splurged, many buying shoes costing upwards of $600.

And then, as the night came to a close, they were let in on a secret.

Palessi never existed.

The entire event had been a campaign run by Payless, a budget shoe store.

And all the shoes they had been raving about just minutes earlier were normally sold for less than $40.

If you do the math, some of them had been marked up 1800%, a price which the fashion influencers were more than happy to pay.

The elaborate advertising scheme did exactly what it set out to do: prove how little difference there is between brands.

Those who purchased the shoes walked away with a refund and a blow to their egos.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ucx0op58sh1gmilt', 'title': 'What is the most innovative advertisement you have seen?', 'score': {'original': 0.9828, 'ai': 0.0172}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The launch of Palessi, a new luxury shoe brand, seemed brimming with promise.\n\nEven the storefront was stunning, a former Giorgio Armani store located in an upscale Santa Monica mall.\n\nAn interior designer had meticulously set out the room.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,Updated 8y,"What's the shrewdest, smartest maneuver you've ever seen in business?","In January 1914, Henry Ford announced a radical decision. He increased the worker wages from $2.34/day to $5/day and reduced the working time from 9 hours to 8 hours per day. Although the myth goes that he did this so that his employees could buy a car of their own, it doesn't pass the basic sniff test. An average Ford worker was producing 20 cars a year. Even if every one of them bough 1 car in their first year, they still had to figure out all the rest 19 cars for year and all the cars throughout. The motivation was not as much of enabling the worker to buy a car, but to make them very productive.

Other businessmen derided Ford as a socialist, while common public heralded him as a hero. People even prodded him to run for a President. Even today, Ford's 5 dollar workday is widely remembered in the US.

Newspapers had a field day. Ford's PR also worked the press to make this move as an egalitarian one (to make the workers rich enough to buy Ford's cars).



Business move, not just an egalitarian one

While this was probably the most generous pay hike in corporate history, Henry Ford was no fool. By the end of 1914, Ford's 13000 workers made 260,000 cars annually while the entire rest of the industry with 66000 workers produced only 280,000 cars. Ford's workers were 5 times more productive! (Although a part of it is owed to the assembly line innovation introduced a few years before this).

Within 2 years of this radical pay rise, Ford's profit jumped 200% to $60 million/year. In another 5 years, Ford was rolling out Model - T's every 24 seconds (in the initial years it took 12 hours)!! Henry Ford's $5-a-Day Revolution
 and Henry Ford and the Model T: A Case Study in Productivity (Part 2)

How?


Until that time, factory workers were meant to be squeezed and thrown out. Labor was not seen as an asset back then. In a single move, he created a new corporate workforce and heralded the creation of the American middle class. Concepts such as 8-hour days and HR departments owe their existence partly to the ideas generated from this.

Employee turnover: Until 1914 Ford hired 300 men a year for every 100 jobs. There were a massive worker turnover as the tired and bored workers kept shifting jobs. Now, Ford provided an offer that was too good for the workers. The best of the workers were both motivated to stay and work.
Absenteeism dropped. Until then, factory workers randomly dropped out of work in the middle. They had little to lose, since they were so poorly paid. This absenteeism severely affected the assembly lines. No amount of force/threats worked. But, now they had golden handcuffs.

Massive movement of smart labor to Detroit. Soon word got around and there was a gold rush in Detroit. Within 24 hours, 10000 men queued up outside Ford's factories. Ford could now be very picky and hire from the best who would dramatically improve efficiencies in the automobile industry.

Skyrocketing productivity: The workers got into a rhythm as they were not shifting jobs any more and that meant they were moving up the learning curve. Ford could now introduce advanced processes without worrying too much about training expenses.


The industry was changed and a new era of workers with a low turnover appeared in US corporations. There is so much present corporations can learn (especially in countries like India, where we are still in the pre-Ford era when it comes to our manufacturing mindset).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2ndhmfqi7kpltxa3', 'title': ""What's the shrewdest, smartest maneuver you've ever seen in business?"", 'score': {'original': 0.34405, 'ai': 0.65595}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""In January 1914, Henry Ford announced a radical decision.

In another 5 years, Ford was rolling out Model - T's every 24 seconds (in the initial years it took 12 hours)!! Henry Ford's $5-a-Day Revolution\n and Henry Ford and the Model T: A Case Study in Productivity (Part 2)\n\nHow?\n\n\nUntil that time, factory workers were meant to be squeezed and thrown out. Labor was not seen as an asset back then. In a single move, he created a new corporate workforce and heralded the creation of the American middle class. Concepts such as 8-hour days and HR departments owe their existence partly to the ideas generated from this.\n\nEmployee turnover: Until 1914 Ford hired 300 men a year for every 100 jobs. There were a massive worker turnover as the tired and bored workers kept shifting jobs. Now, Ford provided an offer that was too good for the workers. The best of the workers were both motivated to stay and work.\nAbsenteeism dropped. Until then, factory workers randomly dropped out of work in the middle. They had little to lose, since they were so poorly paid. This absenteeism severely affected the assembly lines. No amount of force/threats worked. But, now they had golden handcuffs.\n\nMassive movement of smart labor to Detroit. Soon word got around and there was a gold rush in Detroit. Within 24 hours, 10000 men queued up outside Ford's factories. Ford could now be very picky and hire from the best who would dramatically improve efficiencies in the automobile industry.\n\nSkyrocketing productivity: The workers got into a rhythm as they were not shifting jobs any more and that meant they were moving up the learning curve. Ford could now introduce advanced processes without worrying too much about training expenses.\n\n\nThe industry was changed and a new era of workers with a low turnover appeared in US corporations. There is so much present corporations can learn (especially in countries like India, where we are still in the pre-Ford era when it comes to our manufacturing mindset)."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.34405
Colin Zhou,Updated 4y,What are some examples of customers using products for the wrong reasons?,"Everyone knows about the iconic Rubik’s Cube.

Not many know that the very first handbook to solving the cube, published in 1981, was the result of its author Patrick Bossert taking apart the cube piece by piece and analyzing its structure from the inside.

David Henderson,Updated 2y,Why did they stop promoting going to see movies with 3D glasses in the cinema? Was it a bad idea or was it a fad?,"It was a good idea that was ruined through greed and over-saturation.

Despite now being 13 years old, James Cameron’s ‘Avatar’ remains the one and only time 3D was actually implemented to its full potential. Avatar was so incredible that despite a pretty meh overall story which was copied and pasted from Pocahontas, the overall experience of seeing the movie was so great that it quickly became the biggest film of all time, even managing to retain that crown through the entire era of mega-blockbuster MCU films.

Avatar was such a great film to see in the cinema that people who weren’t habitual cinema goers went to see it 2–3 times and support groups even formed to help people reportedly suffering from depression because they couldn’t visit Pandora in real life.

It was a big deal, is what I’m saying.

Movie studios learned two lessons from this:

People like 3D, and much more importantly…
They could charge people more money to see 3D films.

Now, there are two ways to make a 3D film, you can do what Avatar did and design a 3D experience from the ground up and film the whole thing using 3D cameras and software, or you can slap a cheap 3D filter on a conventionally produced film. The second way is massively easier and cheaper, but leads to a far less immersive 3D experience. 3D lite.

Hollywood decided that for a short period almost every big film had to be 3D so they could push the more expensive 3D tickets. Unfortunately by doing this they ended up producing a lot of sub-par ‘3D lite’ movies. Viewers quickly caught on that they were being sold an inferior product and lost interest in paying to see 3D films. Cameron had been highly critical of this practice, and it has essentially killed the 3D movie industry:

“""My personal philosophy is that post conversion should be used for one thing and one thing only - which is to take library titles that are favorites that are proven, and convert them into 3D - whether it's Jaws or ET or Indiana Jones, Close Encounters... or Titanic. Unless you have a time machine to go back and shoot it in 3D, you have no other choice. The best alternative is if you want to release a movie in 3D - make it in 3D.""

It’s also the case that not every film benefits from being 3D. Certain action or horror films might warrant it, but does anyone really benefit from seeing The Bridges of Madison County or Legally Blonde in 3D?

Had they kept the quality up, only used 3D for certain suitable movies and done those ones properly, it wouldn’t have been seen as such a ‘fad’. The long awaited ‘Avatar’ sequel is coming out this year with Cameron promising it will deliver the best 3D experience ever. Hopefully this might restart the 3D industry once more, and we are more careful with it this time around.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/x29ou6a57se8lfwk', 'title': 'Why did they stop promoting going to see movies with 3D glasses in the cinema?

Rakesh Jilla,Updated 6y,What are some examples of dirty marketing tricks?,"Ray-ban and Oakley.

Couple of years ago, when I first entered the US, I wanted to buy sunglasses. Previously, I owned sunglasses, but they were unbranded. So, this time I want to both invest my money and time to buy the best sunglasses.

I stumbled upon these two brand’s wayfarers.

I looked into couple of websites, and understood that there was an untold rivalry between these two, both in comments and reviews posted by these sunglasses owners. At least, I was in an assumption of so. One brand customers always bashed the other brand’s customers and vice-versa.

So, after doing my research, I got a good pair of one of these and was happy with them. Although, after learning so many reviews, I always wondered if I chose a wrong pair and whether the other brand sunglasses are much more comfortable since there are lot of good reviews. Although my brand sunglasses have the same amount of good reviews, I was always on the edge.

Couple of months later, out of curiosity, I bought the other brand sunglasses as well, which were around the same price line. I could see no difference, both were very good, has its own pro’s and con’s.

I, now owned both brand’s sunglasses and was in tranquility. Out of curiosity again, I looked into the sales of each of the brands to see who is the winner.

When I first researched a bit, I was surprised to see that, both these brands are owned by a same owner! This is the one.

How could I missed this when I was researching on the glasses in the first place? Later I discovered that this brand keeps the secrecy so. It doesn’t let you to know that these two brands are under the same company, unless you want to know so. Not only this, around 70% of high-end sunglasses manufactured are owned by Luxottica. If you own a pair of a good brand sunglasses, chances likely are that they are manufactured by Luxottica.

What’s Dirty Marketing in this?

Eric Kelly,Updated 6y,What are some examples of dirty marketing tricks?,"I think the most famous modern day “dirty” marketing trick is the Pepsi Challenge from the 1970’s.

For those of you who may not be familiar with the campaign, in 1975 Pepsi began setting up public blind taste tests between their product and their biggest rival, CocaCola. Participants were given unmarked (no labels or identification) servings of each product and then asked to identify which sample they preferred based on a single sip.

The result was that Pepsi — who had been a distant second place in sales to CocaCola for decades — was preferred by over 50% of the participants. This was a huge coup for Pepsi and they based a massive TV Advertising campaign around showing footage from these taste tests and and touting the stat that Pepsi was hands down the preferred selection.

These results sent rival CocaCola into a panic and they in turn responded by creating a new formula for their product which they brilliantly named (sarcasm) “New Coke”. Without going into too much detail New Coke was a resounding failure; there was a huge public backlash and CocaCola quickly re-released their previous formula brilliantly titled (sarcasm) “CocaCola Classic”. With the re-release of their classic product CocaCola saw a huge up-tick in sales and has remained the number one Cola brand on the planet ever since.

So while this is an interesting story I’m sure you are wondering how any of this is a particularly “dirty” marketing tactic. The key comes down to how the taste test was administered.

See - CocaCola and Pepsi — while both drinks in the “Cola” category — have some specific variations in taste, the key one being that while Pepsi has an initial sweet smooth flavor, CocaCola has a bit of a dry taste that the brand calls the “bite”.

When asked to taste test products in small doses humans (Americans particularly) will almost always prefer the object that is sweeter. We simply have an an affinity towards sweets. That said, if asked to consume large quantities of an object the majority of people will tend to get sick of overly sweet foods/beverages and start to prefer foods/beverages that have a more varied flavor palette.

The reason the Pepsi Challenge was able to get a result where the subjects who participated overwhelmingly selected Pepsi over CocaCola, was that size of the taste test sample being consumed was very small (only 1 sip). This test would always favor a product that had an initial light and sweet flavor over one that was drier and had a “bite”.

If you took this test however and asked the participants to consume a full can of each product the results would switch. The people involved would gravitate towards the product that had a more complex flavor vs the one that tasted sweeter.

So the Dirty Marketing was in the fact that the Pepsi Challenge was done in a way that would get the majority of participants to select the Pepsi sample over CocaCola by having them only taste test 1 sip. This, despite the fact that in real life usage nobody ever simply drinks 1 sip of a Cola when they are thirsty, they have a entire can or a glass. If the test was done with a full can, Coca Cola wins hands down.

If you found this example interesting I highly recommend checking out the book “Blink” by Malcolm Gladwell. He does an amazing job digging into this and other marketing tricks in that book that are incredibly eye-opening (pun was just a happy accident).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/g2bkh0yu8fwoe6i4', 'title': 'What are some examples of dirty marketing tricks?', 'score': {'original': 0.5693, 'ai': 0.4307}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think the most famous modern day “dirty” marketing trick is the Pepsi Challenge from the 1970’s.\n\nFor those of you who may not be familiar with the campaign, in 1975 Pepsi began setting up public blind taste tests between their product and their biggest rival, CocaCola.

Participants were given unmarked (no labels or identification) servings of each product and then asked to identify which sample they preferred based on a single sip.\n\nThe result was that Pepsi — who had been a distant second place in sales to CocaCola for decades — was preferred by over 50% of the participants. This was a huge coup for Pepsi and they based a massive TV Advertising campaign around showing footage from these taste tests and and touting the stat that Pepsi was hands down the preferred selection.\n\nThese results sent rival CocaCola into a panic and they in turn responded by creating a new formula for their product which they brilliantly named (sarcasm) “New Coke”. Without going into too much detail New Coke was a resounding failure; there was a huge public backlash and CocaCola quickly re-released their previous formula brilliantly titled (sarcasm) “CocaCola Classic”. With the re-release of their classic product CocaCola saw a huge up-tick in sales and has remained the number one Cola brand on the planet ever since.\n\nSo while this is an interesting story I’m sure you are wondering how any of this is a particularly “dirty” marketing tactic. The key comes down to how the taste test was administered.\n\nSee - CocaCola and Pepsi — while both drinks in the “Cola” category — have some specific variations in taste, the key one being that while Pepsi has an initial sweet smooth flavor, CocaCola has a bit of a dry taste that the brand calls the “bite”.\n\nWhen asked to taste test products in small doses humans (Americans particularly) will almost always prefer the object that is sweeter. We simply have an an affinity towards sweets. That said, if asked to consume large quantities of an object the majority of people will tend to get sick of overly sweet foods/beverages and start to prefer foods/beverages that have a more varied flavor palette.\n\nThe reason the Pepsi Challenge was able to get a result where the subjects who participated overwhelmingly selected Pepsi over CocaCola, was that size of the taste test sample being consumed was very small (only 1 sip). This test would always favor a product that had an initial light and sweet flavor over one that was drier and had a “bite”.\n\nIf you took this test however and asked the participants to consume a full can of each product the results would switch. The people involved would gravitate towards the product that had a more complex flavor vs the one that tasted sweeter.\n\nSo the Dirty Marketing was in the fact that the Pepsi Challenge was done in a way that would get the majority of participants to select the Pepsi sample over CocaCola by having them only taste test 1 sip. This, despite the fact that in real life usage nobody ever simply drinks 1 sip of a Cola when they are thirsty, they have a entire can or a glass. If the test was done with a full can, Coca Cola wins hands down.\n\nIf you found this example interesting I highly recommend checking out the book “Blink” by Malcolm Gladwell. He does an amazing job digging into this and other marketing tricks in that book that are incredibly eye-opening (pun was just a happy accident).', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.5693
Ankur Warikoo,Updated 10y,Why is Groupon India selling onions at Rs 9/Kg when the market price is Rs 50?,"Setting aside modesty (which I would endorse any other day), this was indeed a brilliant move for us.

Context:
Groupon India launched on Sep3rd a crazy deal - selling Onions at Rs.9/kg - when the market rate is between Rs.60-70/kg.
Onions are a staple food item in India and the rising price is a hot topic of discussion for the past 3-4 months. In the past, rising onion prices have been the reason for even governments toppling in elections.

Mechanics:
Our objective was to shock and awe our customers. And in the process generate some PR around the brand.
Rs.9/kg was chosen because of the shock value (this price was last seen in India in 1999)
Onions were home-delivered across 78 cities in India (free of cost)
Only 1kg per delivery address was allowed
We released 3000kgs of onions everyday for 7 days - with the intent of selling 21,000 kgs in all

Consider this:
We sold 22,500+ Kgs of onions over 7days.

And we chose, as beautifully explained in the other answer, a product that was mass and was being spoken of.

In these 7days,


Our site crashed on the 2nd day, because of the traffic we had never witnessed before - Demand for discounted onions crashes Groupon's Indian website
We got over 16,500 new buyers on the site over 7 days, at a never before cost
We activated over 3000 buyers that had not bought anything in the past 90 days
It increased our brand search on google by over 400%
Business went up by 60% and is now stabalized (10 days post the campaign) at 12% higher than the base before
This deal generated unprecented press coverage - all national press carried it (in a positive light) and it even reached international (WSJ, AFP, Huffington Post, Verge, Medium, Gulf times

John Roberson,Updated 6y,What do the best salespeople know that the rest of us don't?,"I spent thirty years trying to understand what makes a great salesperson, but all it really took was three hours and a massage.

As a professional stock trader, I have a weird financial situation — my income fluctuates a lot, I don’t have access to normal employee benefits, etc. — so when a friend introduced me to a “personal finance wizard” I was pretty excited.

We sit down for coffee at 10:30 in the morning.

“Hi, I’m John. Matt tells me you’ve got a great toolkit to help people in non-standard financial situations.”

At this point, The Wizard starts off on a sales pitch. He talks about how great he is, how great his clients are. He talks about far-ranging financial tools — arcane even! — and where he thinks the stock market is headed next.

After a good bit of this I cut him off.

“I want to make tax-advantaged retirement investments, but because of my employment structure a 401k is not available. What can we do there?”

He provides three options. He starts with the first, gives every detail of how it works, and answers each objection I might conceivably give. But then he tells me why it won’t work for my situation. He moves on to the second and does exactly the same thing: how it works, objections, and why it won’t work.

Obviously, he’s really selling the third.

It turns out that he’s selling a standard retail life insurance product from Northwestern Mutual. But I already have a life insurance agent, and he and I have already discussed why this product would only provide incremental benefits for me, not make a big change.

Goodbye!

I felt like we had talked about a million things but only a couple of sentences addressed anything I actually cared about — and even then he couldn’t do much to solve my problem.

A bad salesperson:

Talks rather than listens.
Focuses on his own knowledge and the product’s stats, rather than the few things that matter to the customer.
Doesn’t offer a product that really makes a difference.
Gets bogged down in complexity, so you’re not clear on how to move forward successfully.

Thankfully, it gets better.

You see, to follow this coffee I have a massage scheduled. After the onslaught of the life insurance salesman I’m really looking forward to an hour in darkness and silence.

I’ve spent a lot of time getting massages because I have chronic pain, but this is a therapist I’ve not seen before. I walk in the door and say hello.

“Hi Mr. Roberson, what brought you in to see us today?”

“My back really hurts. Like, constantly, and really badly.”

“Could I ask you to stand up straight?”

I stand up straight.

“This spot I’m touching on your back, is th—”

“Wow, wow… How did you know?”

“From your posture I can tell that your spine is fighting your muscles right there.”

We spend the next hour with him working on that one spot on my back while I ask all about my posture, spine, and muscles. He suspects I had an injury when I was younger and my body learned bad habits from overcompensating. Sounds exactly right: I was hit there pretty bad in a fight as a kid.

On the drive home, I noticed that something was different. After a few minutes I identified it: this was the first time I could remember in my entire adult life that I was not experiencing constant pain. I felt free in a brand new way.

The next time I booked him for two hours.

A good salesperson:

Asks questions that get to the heart of the matter.
Provides insight that allows you to finally understand a problem.
Offers the opportunity to change something you really care about in a positive way.
Leaves you feeling clear about what to do and what to focus on — and optimistic about the future, to boot.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8g2nf9vhjk6qewxd', 'title': ""What do the best salespeople know that the rest of us don't?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9731, 'ai': 0.0269}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I spent thirty years trying to understand what makes a great salesperson, but all it really took was three hours and a massage.\n\nAs a professional stock trader, I have a weird financial situation — my income fluctuates a lot, I don’t have access to normal employee benefits, etc. — so when a friend introduced me to a “personal finance wizard” I was pretty excited.\n\nWe sit down for coffee at 10:30 in the morning.\n\n“Hi, I’m John.

Ian Mathews,Updated 4y,What do the best salespeople know that the rest of us don't?,"Two years ago, I was planning a trip to Florida with my son to watch baseball during Spring Training.

We had tickets to two games, both near Disney themes parks in Orlando.

After talking with some parents in the office, I decided to squeeze in time at a park. Every person said some version of the same thing.

“Your son will love it but be careful; Disney gets expensive quickly.”

I did some research online, attempting to figure out the best park for my son, who was six years old at the time. He loves Star Wars, and the Hollywood Studios park had attractions right up his alley.

Looking online, I saw that two one-day passes would cost $251. I told my boss that I was planning to call for tickets and he laughed.

“Yeah. That’s where you’re starting but no way you get off that phone paying for just one-day passes.”

Determined to prove him wrong, I put up my shield and made the call.

Don’t Sell, Listen

Disney sales associates are well trained. They know their properties well and have an excellent feel for what is critical to parents. More importantly, they know what children want.

I called because I had some questions and didn’t want to spend $251 online without knowing what that price entailed.

I made the call with one hand covering my wallet, determined to pay no more than $251. As a career sales leader, I knew their Jedi tricks and wasn’t about to fall for any.

“This is Kelly, thanks for calling Disney. How can I help you today?”

“Hi, uh, I’m looking to purchase two one-day passes to Hollywood Studios.”

“Sure, I can help you with that. When are you going to be in town?”

“March 15th to March 18th. I’m taking my son to see the Tigers play in Spring Training. We’re going to squeeze in a quick trip to the park.”

“How fun! My son plays baseball, and we go to as many Spring Training games as we can. You are going to love it.”

Not bad. Kelly found something in common with me quickly. We’re both parents, our boys love baseball, and she has experience with Spring Training.

“What games are you planning to see?”

“We have tickets for a 1 PM game in Lakeland on Wednesday and a 4 PM game in Orlando on Friday.”

“Great. Are you planning to go to Hollywood Studios on Thursday?”

“Yep. Just two one-day passes please.”

“Why did you choose Hollywood Studios?”

“He loves Star Wars, and it looks like most of the attractions work for a six-year-old.”

“Oh, he will love Hollywood Studios if he is a Star Wars fan! Who is his favorite character?”

“Darth Vader, of course. He likes the bad guys more than the heroes.”

“My son is the same way. He was Darth Vader for Halloween two years in a row. We have one of those helmets where his voice changes when he talks.”

“We do too! Those are hilarious, but Chewbacca is funnier.”

Wait a second. I see what’s happening here! I put my guard down. She is building rapport with me by getting me to talk about someone important. Nice try Kelly. My guard is back up.

“Anyway, that’s the park and date. Can I give you my credit card?”

“Of course. First, how patient is your son?”

“Not patient, he’s six. Why do you ask?”

She has piqued my interest with a loaded, closed-ended question. What six-year-old is patient?

“Well, you are visiting us during Spring Break. Have you ever been to one of our parks during Spring Break?”

“No, I haven’t been to Disney since I was a kid.”

“Aside from Christmas break, it is our busiest period of the year. Lines are going to be long for the main attractions and especially Star Wars, as those are all new.”

After asking for permission, she presents new information to consider. She is an expert on Disney theme parks, and I know very little. Alright, I’ll bite.

“How long are the lines that time of year?”

“We went to Hollywood Studios last March, and the wait was 90 minutes for Star Tours. Most of the big attractions were 60 to 90 minutes. We had the Fast Pass, so we didn’t wait in most of those lines.”

Before I can even ponder this new problem, she casually brings up a solution. This is not just any solution. She offers one that she has used personally. I know what you’re up to Kelly, but I’m in too deep.

“Tell me . . . about the Fast Pass.”

She explains the ease of scheduling, the app that allows me to schedule times ahead of time, the ability to jump to the front of the line, and waiting 15 minutes versus 90 minutes.

Without talking price, she jumps into another question.

“You said the game is at 4 PM on Friday. What are you two going to do all day?”

“Not sure. We’ll get to the stadium early for some autographs, and maybe we’ll go check out Disney Springs in the morning.”

“Disney Springs is great if you’re into shopping. It also has great restaurants.”

“Kelly, does your son like going there?”

“For a meal, yes. Other than that, it’s not his favorite.”

“What is his favorite?”

“He loves the Disney water parks. The lines are shorter and he is tall enough to get on all of the rides.”

“My son loves water parks too.”

She is adding value and earning my trust. I no longer care that she is selling. I picture riding water slides with my son before the game on Friday, in the Florida sunshine.

“We have a Park Hopper Pass that allows you to visit multiple parks as much as you like during a two-day timeframe.”

Another solution to a problem I just realized that I had (nothing to do on Friday before the game.)

“That sounds good. We’ll do that.”

I don’t ask how much the hopper pass is before agreeing to it. I’m still skeptical that the Fast Pass will work as she claims. I ask a few more questions.

“If you Google Fast Pass while we’re on the phone, you can see reviews from people online. It is one of Disney’s best values.”

Her confidence is compelling. I didn’t bother Googling because she knows what I will find. She uses social proof expertly to convince me that her product is worthy.

“Fast Pass sounds like the way to go. Anything else I’m not thinking about?”

Kelly has educated me so much on this call that I no longer have confidence that I know what I want. I am prompting her to sell me more.

“How early do the two of you wake up?”

“Early.”

“We offer an opportunity to get to the parks an hour before everyone else where lines fly by. My family does this from time to time, and you can hit several of the biggest attractions before there are any lines. We call this the “Magic Morning” package.”

I weigh this latest offering against a big pancake breakfast, a favorite pastime for the two of us. I also think through the logic in rushing a young boy out the door in the morning against the busy schedule for the rest of the day.

“I think we’ll pass.”

Finally, I resisted an upsell attempt!

“Okay. I have two, multi-day park hopper passes and two Fast Passes.”

My initial attempt at $251 for two one-day passes more than doubled. The Park Hopper passes were an extra $100, two-day passes were an additional $100, and two Fast Pass tickets were extra $120.

“Can I ask where you’re staying?”

This line of questioning led me to change my hotel from a non-Disney property to staying at the Animal Kingdom, another strong upsell by Kelly.

All told, that call added at least $500 to what I was budgeting.

Being Sold Or Being Served?

The trip was amazing.

We flew through lines over those two days. The Fast Pass was precisely what she said it was and I felt the value every time we walked past a long line, directly into an attraction.

The weather was perfect for a water park on Friday, and we spent four hours at “Blizzard Beach” riding water slides with no lines before heading straight to the baseball game.

My son loved Animal Kingdom. We woke up every morning and looked off the porch to see giraffes, zebras, and other zoo animals. Staying at a Disney hotel also gave us access to the bus system, which we used at night to go to Disney Springs for dinner.

With limited time to check out what Disney had to offer and massive crowds, the extra cost was worth it. We got value out of every upsell.

Had I just purchased two passes online, I would have saved money. But, how much fun would we have missed out on?

What The Best Salespeople Know

Elite salespeople understand that you get what you pay for.

They are expert in the value that their offering brings and help you see that value before making a mistake in the purchase process.

Was Kelly trying to sell me more? Of course.

Did she sell me anything she didn’t believe in? Nope.

Her process was textbook, so much that I wanted to call back later and find her. I would have hired her in a second. What did she do that was effective?

Found common interests
Built rapport and earned my trust
Asked great questions
Helped me see potential problems I wasn’t thinking about
Created tension to make me seek a solution
Demonstrated how her solution fixed my problem

She acted like a consultant, who was 100% focused on the experience I would have with her company and product.

I never felt like I was being “sold.”

I got on the phone thinking of her as an opponent and got off thinking of her as an ally.

The best salespeople make you feel good about buying.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nklebz28mv095xs1', 'title': ""What do the best salespeople know that the rest of us don't?"", 'score': {'original': 0.65835, 'ai': 0.34165}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Two years ago, I was planning a trip to Florida with my son to watch baseball during Spring Training.\n\nWe had tickets to two games, both near Disney themes parks in Orlando.\n\nAfter talking with some parents in the office, I decided to squeeze in time at a park.

How can I help you today?”\n\n“Hi, uh, I’m looking to purchase two one-day passes to Hollywood Studios.”\n\n“Sure, I can help you with that.

My son plays baseball, and we go to as many Spring Training games as we can. You are going to love it.”\n\nNot bad. Kelly found something in common with me quickly. We’re both parents, our boys love baseball, and she has experience with Spring Training.\n\n“What games are you planning to see?”\n\n“We have tickets for a 1 PM game in Lakeland on Wednesday and a 4 PM game in Orlando on Friday.”\n\n“Great. Are you planning to go to Hollywood Studios on Thursday?”\n\n“Yep. Just two one-day passes please.”\n\n“Why did you choose Hollywood Studios?”\n\n“He loves Star Wars, and it looks like most of the attractions work for a six-year-old.”\n\n“Oh, he will love Hollywood Studios if he is a Star Wars fan! Who is his favorite character?”\n\n“Darth Vader, of course. He likes the bad guys more than the heroes.”\n\n“My son is the same way. He was Darth Vader for Halloween two years in a row.

What six-year-old is patient?\n\n“Well, you are visiting us during Spring Break. Have you ever been to one of our parks during Spring Break?”\n\n“No, I haven’t been to Disney since I was a kid.”\n\n“Aside from Christmas break, it is our busiest period of the year. Lines are going to be long for the main attractions and especially Star Wars, as those are all new.”\n\nAfter asking for permission, she presents new information to consider. She is an expert on Disney theme parks, and I know very little. Alright, I’ll bite.\n\n“How long are the lines that time of year?”\n\n“We went to Hollywood Studios last March, and the wait was 90 minutes for Star Tours. Most of the big attractions were 60 to 90 minutes. We had the Fast Pass, so we didn’t wait in most of those lines.”\n\nBefore I can even ponder this new problem, she casually brings up a solution. This is not just any solution. She offers one that she has used personally. I know what you’re up to Kelly, but I’m in too deep.\n\n“Tell me . . . about the Fast Pass.”\n\nShe explains the ease of scheduling, the app that allows me to schedule times ahead of time, the ability to jump to the front of the line, and waiting 15 minutes versus 90 minutes.\n\nWithout talking price, she jumps into another question.\n\n“You said the game is at 4 PM on Friday. What are you two going to do all day?”\n\n“Not sure. We’ll get to the stadium early for some autographs, and maybe we’ll go check out Disney Springs in the morning.”\n\n“Disney Springs is great if you’re into shopping. It also has great restaurants.”\n\n“Kelly, does your son like going there?”\n\n“For a meal, yes. Other than that, it’s not his favorite.”\n\n“What is his favorite?”\n\n“He loves the Disney water parks. The lines are shorter and he is tall enough to get on all of the rides.”\n\n“My son loves water parks too.”\n\nShe is adding value and earning my trust. I no longer care that she is selling. I picture riding water slides with my son before the game on Friday, in the Florida sunshine.\n\n“We have a Park Hopper Pass that allows you to visit multiple parks as much as you like during a two-day timeframe.”\n\nAnother solution to a problem I just realized that I had (nothing to do on Friday before the game.)\n\n“That sounds good. We’ll do that.”\n\nI don’t ask how much the hopper pass is before agreeing to it. I’m still skeptical that the Fast Pass will work as she claims. I ask a few more questions.\n\n“If you Google Fast Pass while we’re on the phone, you can see reviews from people online. It is one of Disney’s best values.”\n\nHer confidence is compelling. I didn’t bother Googling because she knows what I will find.

My family does this from time to time, and you can hit several of the biggest attractions before there are any lines. We call this the “Magic Morning” package.”\n\nI weigh this latest offering against a big pancake breakfast, a favorite pastime for the two of us. I also think through the logic in rushing a young boy out the door in the morning against the busy schedule for the rest of the day.\n\n“I think we’ll pass.”\n\nFinally, I resisted an upsell attempt!\n\n“Okay. I have two, multi-day park hopper passes and two Fast Passes.”\n\nMy initial attempt at $251 for two one-day passes more than doubled. The Park Hopper passes were an extra $100, two-day passes were an additional $100, and two Fast Pass tickets were extra $120.\n\n“Can I ask where you’re staying?”\n\nThis line of questioning led me to change my hotel from a non-Disney property to staying at the Animal Kingdom, another strong upsell by Kelly.\n\nAll told, that call added at least $500 to what I was budgeting.\n\nBeing Sold Or Being Served?\n\nThe trip was amazing.\n\nWe flew through lines over those two days.

All of the clocks are set at either the 10:10. Or roughly the same shape.

They discovered that this position promotes symmetry and is pleasing to the mind.

It’s a fun party fact to rattle off to people.

If you google watches almost all will have the 10:10 shape.

You’ll never look at watch ads the same again :)

At its core - advertising is about psychology. You are crafting a message with an understanding of the human mind, and what makes it tick.

Color is massively important. People sit in board rooms and debate minor color changes to logos. There are at least a hundred people arguing about it as you read this right now.

Red is usually tied to hunger, urgency, importance.

Sometimes - food brands break from the pack, using different colors to set themselves apart. (Taco bell - although it leans towards red with its bell.)

Subway - chooses to differentiate itself as “the healthy fast food”.

Blue is related to trust, professionalism, security, cleanliness. It is also often used when targetting men too.

One more color. Let’s do green to complete the RGB color trifecta.

Green is associated with health, growth, nature, peace, earthiness.

I snorted a little bit at BP.

They should add an earthy green BP Logo to this.

Steve Melnick,4y,What is something that is supposedly a 'luxury' but is actually worse than the regular alternative?,"Valet parking.

It’s supposed to be so luxurious to just step out of the car, toss the guy in the red vest your keys, and walk away. But:

1. It takes more time.

When you’re trying to get your car, it takes forrrrever. Recently I stayed at a hotel with valet parking. They said to call 15 minutes before you need a car. Which is annoying in itself, but fine, I’ll plan my day ahead. So I call, dutifully wait my 15 minutes, go down to the valet desk – and wait. And wait. And wait and wait and wait. 30 minutes, my car finally pulls up. And now I’m late getting where I needed to go.

It may be a time-saver at the front-end – you don’t have to drive around looking for a spot or park blocks away – but sometimes even then you have to wait for the valet.

2. You can’t easily get things into or out of the car. Forgot your reading glasses? Want to drop off a heavy shopping bag? Sorry, your car is … somewhere else.

3. You’re relinquishing control of your keys. My car key is big and clunky and doesn’t come off the chain very easily, so I have to give all the keys to the valet. For me, walking around without my keys in my front pocket is like walking around without pants – weird to do in public.

4. Valets move the car seat, fiddle with the radio, etc. I set these things up precisely – leave it alone! And there’s the risk that the valet is going to smash your ride into a wall or another car or whatever.

5. Often costs more than self-parking. Also, you have to tip the valet, and I rarely have small bills on me.

Give me self parking any day.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tnm0l6ei1s7yuhqo', 'title': ""What is something that is supposedly a 'luxury' but is actually worse than the regular alternative?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Valet parking.\n\nIt’s supposed to be so luxurious to just step out of the car, toss the guy in the red vest your keys, and walk away.

S M,Updated 6y,"What's the shrewdest, smartest maneuver you've ever seen in business?","Harvesting the brain power of 750 million internet users to digitize books.

If you haven’t been living under a Dwayne Johnson for the last decade, you’ve probably seen this:

It’s called a Captcha and it was used to make sure that a website user is actually human, because computers had (and to an extent, are still having) a tough time reading text like that. It literally stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart.”

And when thousands of websites started using it in the mid 2000s to ensure bots don’t screw them over, roughly 200 million captchas were typed every single day. And assuming each one takes about 10–12 seconds, that’s approximately a gazillion minutes of essentially wasted human effort.

Luis Von Ahn, one of the founders of Captcha, explains in this
 amazing TEDx talk that he then realized that that massive human effort could be put to use to digitize all books, to make them searchable and easily accessible.

So, they built reCaptcha. You may have noticed that at some point, you had to type two words instead of just one:

Here, one word is used to genuinely check if you’re human. And the other word is from a scanned copy of an old book and is showed to you to basically ask you to digitize it.

Google then acquired it in 2009. And guess what? ReCaptcha was used
 (mainly on pages that couldn’t be scanned properly) to digitize all books on Google Books, to make them searchable. We all did it together. And we did it for free!

And Google has moved on to image recognition using reCaptcha to get labeled data sets for its AI research:

And we are still doing it for free.

Gordon Moar,6y,What are some examples of cheap products that were 'unintentionally well engineered'?,"The IBM Model M keyboard
 would seem to fit this description.

Mass produced in the mid 80s to early 90s and, in the days before PC-compatible clones dominated the market, it was fairly ubiquitous in offices. Not the cheapest keyboard ever made, but they were enough of a commodity part that they would be routinely be discarded with their associated PC when it had reached end of life.

However the Model M offered nothing less than tank-like build quality - these things are HEAVY! - and an engineered-in durability that means the many that avoided the skip/dumpster are still perfectly serviceable today.

You can strip the Model M down and rebuild with nothing more than a couple of screwdrivers.
You can wash the keys and casing in the dishwasher and they often come out looking like new, even after 30 years (tar stains the only thing that persist, but that's hardly IBM’s fault).
They survive having drinks spilled on them thanks to their thoughtful splashproof design.
The switches and keycaps can all be replaced and tweaked/upgraded to suit the user’s preferences.
And most importantly of all they are GREAT to type on. Noisy, sure (unless you swap the switches for quieter ones), but the buckling spring design is robust and gives great tactile and audible feedback to the user.

Sarthak Raj Baral,4y,What are some great advertisements?,"You’re familiar with Count Dracula right?

The creation of Bram Stoker, the archetypal vampire is one of the most iconic fictional characters of all time.

The character was immortalised on the big screen by the inimitable Sir Christopher Lee.

Being a vampire, the Machiavellian Count has an understandable aversion to sunlight – it can kill him after all. Dracula does his bidding when the lights go out.

The sun goes down, the Count comes out. M̶y̶ ̶u̶n̶i̶v̶e̶r̶s̶e̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶n̶e̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶a̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶I̶'̶m̶ ̶g̶l̶a̶d̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶c̶a̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶

BBC’s new Dracula series, starring Claes Bang as the titular character, played with that idea in a truly brilliant way for a billboard.

Not to go off on a tangent here, but how cool of a name is ‘Claes Bang’? Some actors have straight-up cool names.

You know, like Rip Torn, Benedryl Cabbagepatch, Armie Hammer, Bandersnatch Cucumberjack, Powers Boothe, Bournvita Cumbersnack, Steve McQueen, Billabong Curdlesack, Lee Pace, and Bosferatu Cricketmatch.

Wait, where were we? Dracula, right. To promote the show, the BBC used this billboard.

Now, that’s pretty cool. Wooden stakes and blood. Classic Dracula imagery.

Buddy, you ain’t seen nothing yet.

Remember, Vampires can't go out in the day. The Count comes out when the sun goes down.

I don’t use the word ‘genius’ lightly.

And so I won’t.

But this is truly a feat of creativity because it weaves in the lore of the character and the story. Also, it’s bloody cool.

Whoever came up with the idea deserves something meaningful and significant. Maybe a thank you note from Brandybuck Custardsack.

I’m sorry.

Icha Bucha,Updated 4y,What are some products that were discontinued because they were too good?,"If you are an Indian and attained your childhood/adulthood/old age by 2000, you would have seen this car and probably, most of you would have traveled in it at least wished to travel in it.

Picture Source - Google.

Yes, the miraculous Toyota Qualis, when the likes of Sumos, Ambassadors, Marutis were ruling the Indian roads. A complete 7 seater was introduced by Toyota. It was an instantaneous hit. With the smooth engine, genuine suspension and superior ride quality Qualis lasted for more than 300,000KM without any major repairs. This is at least 3X times the normal Indian diesel engines on the Indian roads. Qualis might seem a sub-standard car today, but it was a good machine back in 2000. While Qualis peaked in 2004, Toyota said it would discontinue its flagship Qualis for a new entrant.

People went crazy, everyone criticized Toyota for their move especially after checking out the new entrant. People wanted to buy the last remaining Qualis at any cost. Qualis was pleasing, the new entrant was not even close enough. It was like a pregnant swine.

Source: google.com, Innova when it was launched in India in 2005

Toyota believed in itself and the hard work it put on the new entrant. Toyota understood the Indian space better than anyone would, they gave huge space in the cabin, they gave a smooth ride, they concentrated on ride quality, and of course, the foolproof Toyota engines were a plus. The all-new Innova. Fast Forward 15 years, the Toyota Innova is the best selling MPV in India for its price and segment. If Qualis was miraculous, Innova is super miraculous. Toyota justified its decision. Who would believe Innova is better than Qualis if they both were in production. Toyota boldly killed Qualis and released its very own extension called Innova and succeeded.

So, yes companies kill good products to promote an even better product or the next version/ extension of the product and eventually sum up more in profits.

See the sales pattern of Innova, it is the most priced car in the segment and in spite of that, it has consistent sales. It is only in recent times cars from its segments and other segments like the Cretas, Harriers, Ertigas, and others have taken more numbers on sales. Though the other segments are not direct competitors for Innova, I still remember back in the late 2000s people either considered sedans or Innova, the SUV and Compact SUV market was not so good (barring Scorpio). Today, people have a choice in different segments and hence it indirectly affects sales of Innova. Toyota Innova ruled its segment and probably, ruled a segment above and below of its own for more than a decade and still performing decently in spite of all its rivals from the same segment and different segments.

Edit 1: Comments Pointed out Cretas and Harriers are not of Innova's segment, Agree, but they still are indirect rivals to Innova.

Edit2: Many pointed out, Qualis was a failure model in Africa, and branded as Isuzu Panther and there is nothing good about Qualis. Qualis could be a failure in Africa but it is a success in India. Plus, do not look at Qualis with 2020 lens, go back in time 20 years and Qualis was better than many other Indian cars.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2vzei8mynxg1rblq', 'title': 'What are some products that were discontinued because they were too good?', 'score': {'original': 0.4417, 'ai': 0.5583}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""If you are an Indian and attained your childhood/adulthood/old age by 2000, you would have seen this car and probably, most of you would have traveled in it at least wished to travel in it.\n\nPicture Source - Google.\n\nYes, the miraculous Toyota Qualis, when the likes of Sumos, Ambassadors, Marutis were ruling the Indian roads.

Michael Wells,Updated 2y,"What's the shrewdest, smartest maneuver you've ever seen in business?","My college town had a lovely small pizza restaurant named Papa John’s.

My God it was good. Delicious real mozzarella, fantastic toppings, a side of juicy-tangy-sweet pepperoncini peppers, and a special cup of garlic butter dipping sauce for the crust, so you could eat it just like breadsticks. It was heaven.

Everyone loved it. Except Domino’s pizza.

Domino’s, the chief competitor on campus, just couldn’t compete against the flavor and quality of Papa John’s pizzas.

Every weekend, all of the local pizzerias would do a Friday advertising push to win as much of the student weekend pizza dollar as possible. That meant a LOT of coupons, and every student got to pick their favorite weekend study treat.

One Thursday, the Domino’s marketing team was in a nasty funk, and decided to play dirty. In the local university newspaper, they booked this ad for the Friday edition…

“Bring us 30 competitors’ coupons, and get a FREE PIZZA!”

Oooooh…. nasty, eh? Dominoes was going to suck up all of the competitor coupons on the market, and burn them. By their math, they’d get most of the pizza dollar because they’d be the only pizzeria offering a weekend special- all of their competitors would be couponless, and therefore cost more.

And this coup would cost them very little... for “stealing” 30 pizza sales from their competition, it would cost them 1 free pizza, at roughly $4 in ingredients & labor.

Poor Papa John’s was getting no business this weekend…

Except that, one of the students at the school newspaper happened to love Papa John’s, and mentioned the Domino’s ad booking to a friend who worked there.

The team at Papa John’s thought for a minute, and then placed their own weekly ad.

That Friday’s edition saw two massive ads, running side-by-side.

The Domino’s ad…

Bring us 30 competitors’ coupons, and get a FREE PIZZA!

And the Papa John’s ad…

Thank you to all of our wonderful customers!
Here are 30 Papa John’s coupons for you to enjoy.
Because everyone deserves a pizza.

Students flooded the Domino’s, newspaper in hand, demanding their FREE pizzas. Domino’s had to close its doors for the weekend after completely running out of product.

Drishti Dasgupta,7y,What are some great advertisements?,"A Thai ad based on a true story of - A mother, a daughter, and a pineapple.

The little girl struggles to find the right way to cut a pineapple. Her mother notices the struggle but as she never went to school, she is unsure of how to teach her daughter the right approach.

Then the mother picks up a pineapple and begins to cut it with the intent of showing the right approach to her daughter.

The daughter follows.

In the next scene, the daughter is looking at the ice cream cart with wanting eyes. She is looking at the children enjoying their ice cream, while having the urge to have one herself.

The mother understands her daughter's want and feels helpless for she has no money to buy her an ice cream.

The same night while the daughter is asleep, the mother is wide awake preparing a pineapple ice cream for her daughter.

The next morning, the girl is happily devouring the frozen pineapple and when asked by her mother if it tastes better than ice cream, she says yes it does and suggests that they should probably sell it.

And that's when an idea is formed. The mother makes some pineapple ice cream and the daughter goes to the market to sell them. But to the little girl's dismay, no one is ready to buy her ice creams.

She comes to her mother and asks why no one wants to buy ice creams from her.

Her mother calmly responds that she should go to the market and see how other vendors sell their stuffs.

The girl then wanders off to the market and closely notices how the vendors are selling their goods.

She learns that she has to present her ice creams well in order for them to be sold. Next morning, she is out in the market with an attractive approach.

Soon, her ice creams are bought and loved by other children.

The mother is happy to see her daughter learn from experience.

But—as the coffee stirrer continued to be used, it began to get a reputation, with a dose of cocaine being referred to as a “mcspoon”. (Source: How One Woman Won the Fight Against McDonald’s Coffee Stirrers. Glass, Jeremy)

Alisha Talks,2y,What are the most successful ideas for marketing?,"I love bananas, but it's pretty frustrating when you buy a bunch, and 2 out of the 7 decay by the end of the week! I was shocked to find out that some shops in South Korea have implemented a strategy where bananas aren't wasted.

This is the genius concept —

South Korean supermarket, E-Mart, has been selling bananas in different stages of ripeness in packets, to allow consumers to eat one fruit each day. By the time they reach the green banana, it'd have turned a beautiful yellow.

As we know, bananas begin to change their colour and texture once they are picked. The hormones inside the bananas convert amino acids into ethylene gas, which produces enzymes. Ethylene is known as the 'ripening hormone’.

When the bananas turns yellow, it's texture becomes softer because of the ethylene. High amounts of ethylene causes the banana to produce brown spots, and eventually decay.[1]

Cool science aside, ordering the bananas in ripeness is a great marketing strategy! As a banana lover, it definitely screams, “take my money!”

Mark Thomase,4y,Why is Target seen as a “step up” from Walmart?,"When I worked at Target, the word I heard constantly was “brand,” which meant that the stores were to be kept sparkling clean, everything was in perfect order, and no messes of any kind were tolerated. The floors were always polished to a shine, the aisles are wide, the lights bright, the displays lined up ruler-straight. I am not joking when I say that we “team members” (employees) spent up to 90% of our day keeping things “brand.”

Target knows its “guests” (shoppers) can buy Tide anywhere, so it used its “softlines” (clothing) department to stand out. Target partnered with designers to market inexpensive, limited-time clothing lines, which was a step up from just going to Walmart and buying a pair of khaki shorts.

Target was obsessive about customer service. A few times a day we actually had to walk around the store asking “guests,” “Can I Help You Find Something?” This phrase was used constantly in Target “huddles” (meetings) and abbreviated to “CIHYFS.” If we saw a guest who looked lost or puzzled we were expected to approach the guest and CIHYFS him or her.

If lines at guest check-out got too long — more than two or three guests in line — the guest service team leader would issue a call for back-up, and unless we were doing something absolutely critical like stocking frozen food or actually interacting with a guest, we were expected to drop what we were doing and rush to the front to help ring register. Many team members hated this and would simply ignore the back-up calls, though, because spending too much time on the register would mean that our departments would not look as “brand” as they should and we would get chewed out for it.

Again, if a guest wanted service and didn’t see anyone in the department, there were call buttons they could push, which immediately sent a message to each of the team members. Furthermore, pushing a button started a countdown and we were required — not encouraged, but required — to get to the guest and turn off the call button within 30 seconds. If we failed, we got warned and then written up. So when someone hits that call button, it was common to see team members literally drop anything, sometimes leave other guests in mid-sentence, and knock people out of the way at a dead run to get that button turned off.

Once a group of teenagers thought it would be great fun to spray one of the aisles in hardware with WD-40 and hit the call button. I came running, hit the slick spot and went flying. I was lucky I didn’t break something — either on my body or on the shelf I crashed into. I jumped up, turned off the button and told the kids in no uncertain terms that they were to leave the store, calling security to have them escorted out. My store manager backed me up because, after all, I had hit the button within 30 seconds.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/aregbwoqnpx8t4ku', 'title': 'Why is Target seen as a “step up” from Walmart?', 'score': {'original': 0.9986, 'ai': 0.0014}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'When I worked at Target, the word I heard constantly was “brand,” which meant that the stores were to be kept sparkling clean, everything was in perfect order, and no messes of any kind were tolerated.

The floors were always polished to a shine, the aisles are wide, the lights bright, the displays lined up ruler-straight. I am not joking when I say that we “team members” (employees) spent up to 90% of our day keeping things “brand.”\n\nTarget knows its “guests” (shoppers) can buy Tide anywhere, so it used its “softlines” (clothing) department to stand out. Target partnered with designers to market inexpensive, limited-time clothing lines, which was a step up from just going to Walmart and buying a pair of khaki shorts.\n\nTarget was obsessive about customer service. A few times a day we actually had to walk around the store asking “guests,” “Can I Help You Find Something?” This phrase was used constantly in Target “huddles” (meetings) and abbreviated to “CIHYFS.” If we saw a guest who looked lost or puzzled we were expected to approach the guest and CIHYFS him or her.\n\nIf lines at guest check-out got too long — more than two or three guests in line — the guest service team leader would issue a call for back-up, and unless we were doing something absolutely critical like stocking frozen food or actually interacting with a guest, we were expected to drop what we were doing and rush to the front to help ring register. Many team members hated this and would simply ignore the back-up calls, though, because spending too much time on the register would mean that our departments would not look as “brand” as they should and we would get chewed out for it.\n\nAgain, if a guest wanted service and didn’t see anyone in the department, there were call buttons they could push, which immediately sent a message to each of the team members. Furthermore, pushing a button started a countdown and we were required — not encouraged, but required — to get to the guest and turn off the call button within 30 seconds. If we failed, we got warned and then written up. So when someone hits that call button, it was common to see team members literally drop anything, sometimes leave other guests in mid-sentence, and knock people out of the way at a dead run to get that button turned off.\n\nOnce a group of teenagers thought it would be great fun to spray one of the aisles in hardware with WD-40 and hit the call button. I came running, hit the slick spot and went flying. I was lucky I didn’t break something — either on my body or on the shelf I crashed into.

So now what's it all about.

Look back

In the first picture the man misses one ear.
In the second picture there is a phantom hand out of nowhere
In the third picture the woman’s hand has too many fingers.

Colgate now tells its consumers that the teeth of a person is the eye catcher. If your teeth is shining white most other faults may go unnoticed.

The amount of thinking and the careful assessment of Human psychology used is commendable.

Thanks for reading.

Pooja Subhramanyam,9mo,Which is the best digital marketing course in India?,"With a solid digital marketing strategy and effective execution, digital marketing can become an active marketing channel to attract and engage new customers.

Digital marketing, or online marketing, refers to marketing activities targeting consumers using digital channels. It includes all online marketing tactics implemented through digital channels to achieve business and marketing goals.

One big advantage of online marketing over traditional marketing is the ability to gather and analyze data in real time. This ensures digital marketing teams can make data-driven decisions to achieve their business and marketing goals.

Digital marketing should be an integral part of any business marketing strategy for many reasons. The benefits include:

It scales easily
It is cost effective
It provides a direct line to engage with your customers
Results can be quickly and transparently measured and analyzed
It provides an avenue for you to learn from your customers, market, and other industry players

Scope of Digital Marketing in India

It is impossible to undermine the importance of digital marketing in 2021 and beyond. As per Statista, the number of internet users worldwide stands at 4.13 billion in 2019. With internet proliferation, inexpensive smartphones, a more literate population, and ease of access to everything online, the potential for digital marketing jobs in India is humungous.

The internet and digital technologies continue to transform the way we connect, share information, and manage businesses. You can either get involved or get left behind. In a world with the motto of survival of the fittest, adapting, learning, and rising above the tide is the way to move forward.

Irrespective of the product/service/industry, digital marketing is here to stay. Whether it is the food industry, retail sector, health, training and education, automobile, entertainment, fashion, or real estate, every industry is incorporating and benefitting from digital marketing.

A drastic shift in traditional marketing, the low cost associated with digital marketing, and its ability to transcend geographical boundaries, and reach global markets, are all factors enabling a transformation of the global village into a digitally empowered society.

With tech-savvy consumers, digital marketing keeps evolving and changing. The dominant trends to watch out for currently are AI technology (chatbots), videos, voice search, and highly interactive content such as polls, quizzes, and augmented reality.

The future of digital marketing is bright in the world. Scaling new heights with every passing year digitally forward is the way to go.

Avinash Hiremath,Updated 6y,Which is the most clever advertisement in India?,"Zomato (product) has been extremely successful with its marketing campaigns. One reason is that they aptly connected their message to the hip youth audience, which is their target group.

Zomato launched multiple campaigns related to the most trending concepts on internet and they directly resulted in drawing the Internet Literate audience to their website.

Edit: Here’s my explanation for why this advertising campaign was clever and successful:

Zomato’s campaign focused heavily upon internet literate audience. They focused on people familiar with English TV shows, Internet Memes, Popular global blogs/sites and people who are active on social media like FB, Twitter, Instagram and Quora.

The reason they focused on this audience is to attract them to Zomato. Zomato is a review cum blogging website and this is the exact audience they need on the website to gain popularity.

Also, this audience is the early adopter who would try out new products.

Here’s their famous campaign on TV Shows

Breaking Bad

Game of Thrones

Desperate Housewives

Family Guy

House of Cards

How I Met Your Mother

South Park

Pretty Little Liars

The Simpsons

The Big Bang Theory

Pity they didn’t do anything of Friends!

Then their infamous Adult Joke campaigns

Sean Kernan,1y,What was the biggest marketing mistake a major brand made?,"It was a good run.

Coca-Cola’s decades of dominance was on death’s door.

Through the 1940s and 50s, coke held more than 60% of the market. Pepsi was around but they’d floundered and gone bankrupt several times while trying to sink their teeth into the market.

However, by the 1970s, Pepsi had found its stride after several hit marketing campaigns.

Coke’s primary demographic was older adults, and Pepsi was winning over an expanding, younger demographic.

By 1980, Pepsi trailed Coke by a mere 3%.

Executives at Coke squirmed at this shrinking race for dominance and did what one should never do: overreact.

They did the unthinkable and changed the most famous recipe in the world.

They didn’t make this decision in the absence of data. What went wrong?

There was a crack in the Process

Months earlier, Coca-Cola began “Project Kansas.”

It it sounds like a nuclear experiment because of how secretive the brand is about its ingredients. Project Kansas was really just a testing project for the new flavor.

In surveys, they’d found that more than 75% of respondents loved the new flavor, 15% were indifferent, and 10% had a strong aversion to the taste to the point that they were angry.

When researchers did surveys in group settings, they noticed another strange trend in their results. The angry 10% exerted subtle peer pressure effects on the group, altering the opinions of those who were indifferent or even favorable towards the flavor.

It was also called Coke II. via Biz Insider

When New Coke was released, that 10% manifested in an enormous way.

They became quite vocal about their displeasure with the new recipe.

News outlets began picking up on their anger — amplifying their voices and causing things to snowball.

A soda super pac forms

A consumer group, Old Cola Drinkers of America, formed and began to collectively protest the new recipe (some people clearly have a lot of time on their hands).

Additionally, Coke made a big cultural mistake. Coke is headquartered in the Deep South (Atlanta).

The US has a cultural variation of 11 nations

Many patrons from the region saw the flavor change as another concession to the north, to the liberal and insufferable minds that liked Pepsi.

At the time, Coca-Cola had a customer hotline. It was flooded with more than a thousand phone calls per day with people airing their grievances at this change in flavor.

The backlash was so severe that it even confused Coke executives. They hired a psychiatrist to listen. He later said, “Some people sounded like they were discussing the death of a family member.”

Pepsi pounced — running their own ads making fun of Coke’s mistake. In turn, Pepsi and Coke’s market shares drew even.

Major media publications, smelling blood, pounced as well.

Invariably, Coke saw a decline in sales and, far more importantly, major damage to its golden brand perception.

The Bizarre Switch

It’s interesting that so much of the data had been favorable beforehand.

Where surveys had shown more than 70% preference for New Coke, surveys afterward showed less than 13%.

Where professional critics had said good things in prior surveys, they now became more negative, with Mimi Sheraton saying, “New Coke seems to retain the essential character of the original version: It tastes a little like classic Coca-Cola that has been diluted by melting ice.”

The trend factor proved to be massive in the perception of the new flavor. It was so bad that fans booed Coke commercials in sports arenas.

Just three months after the release of New Coke, the president of Coca-Cola aired a commercial announcing that the original coke flavor would return and took the unprecedented step of announcing they’d made a mistake.

And hence, today, you will notice that all Coca-Cola either says “classic” on the can or “original” on the container holding the cans.

Coke lost $30M in the unsold New Coke inventory and $4M on research it spent. This is approximately $82 million in 2020 dollars.

Today, the story of New Coke is a poster child for marketing disasters. It is taught in nearly every marketing program in the United States.

So where is the nuance in all this? Why did Coke catch so much crap just for changing a recipe? Three reasons:

They ignored the unrelenting power of peer pressure. Many users in public found themselves avoiding New Coke for fear of judgment.
They learned the importance of honoring your biggest brand advocates. The heaviest consumers of your products will have exponentially louder voices. This is why filmmakers tasked with doing remakes and sequels have such a treacherous job.
They forgot the cultural value of Coke. Coke has a long history and brings feelings of nostalgia to its drinkers.

Not all products are like cars and electronics. They can’t just be tweaked and changed like a new version of an iPhone.

With the New Coke disaster, it seems there has never been a more applicable use of the phrase,

“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0ew7lj6mqx1skao3', 'title': 'What was the biggest marketing mistake a major brand made?', 'score': {'original': 0.5548, 'ai': 0.4452}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It was a good run.\n\nCoca-Cola’s decades of dominance was on death’s door.\n\nThrough the 1940s and 50s, coke held more than 60% of the market.

Rajini Garg,Sep 24,Which is the best digital marketing course in India?,"“According to Cisco’s Visual Networking Index (VNI) report, by 2021, 829 million Indians (59 per cent of the population) are expected to use the internet daily. Out of above 829 million, 79% will access the internet through mobile”. In this situation, every brand needs a digital marketing professional. This opened a great career opportunity for digital marketers.

Secondly, more people prefer Internet companies over traditional retailers, 90% of Indian brands spend more than 15% of their marketing budget on Digital Marketing. We hope this data is enough for you to understand the immense opportunity in choosing Digital Marketing as a career in India.

The internet penetration in India is the highest, leaving behind countries like the US & UK. Hence, I believe in the demand & supply business model. If there is an increase in demand then there should be enough supply also for fulfilling the demand. So, there is a huge demand for skilled digital marketers but the supply is not enough at this time in India.

Hector Quintanilla,Sep 21,Why is knowing your customer important?,"Here’s the story behind the Mustang Phenomenon…

On April 17, 1964, the Ford Mustang was unveiled.

While many at Ford hadn't expected the Mustang to be a success, Lee Iacocca stood strong with a clear vision for the car.

Lee wasn't building another car; he was focused on giving America a new way to drive. At the time, most cars were seen as transportation tools. Meanwhile, he envisioned a car that was about the joy of driving.

The Mustang became an instant phenomenon, influencing a whole generation.

Ford initially hoped to sell 100,000 units in the first year. Astonishingly, they surpassed that by selling one million cars in just 18 months!

Lee Iacocca's vision for the Mustang reminds me of the importance of being customer-centric and avoiding the dangers of being too product-centric.

Iacocca didn't assume he knew what people wanted. He listened to consumers and delivered on their desires.

The Mustang revolutionized transportation, giving the driver a sense of freedom, lifestyle, and personal expression. A solid reminder that we don't buy products — we buy experiences, emotions, and solutions to problems.

To answer your question, why is knowing your customer important?

The Mustang story is a perfect example of the profound impact of understanding your customer's deepest desires.

Start with the customer in mind.

That's the first step towards crafting your own 'Mustang moment.'

Sean Kernan,Updated 1y,What's the most clever thing someone did with a points promotion?,"The greatest civil engineers are systems thinkers. They weigh variables against resource constraints.

They are methodical and patient. They listen. They possess a sharp, creative mind and a great eye for detail.

When they are younger, they might have let you cheat on their math test. When they are older, they build awesome bridges and buildings. More than a millennia ago, they built the Temple of Hera, the Parthenon, and the Roman Colosseum.

Today, they buy pudding.

Sometimes.

A hustle that began as a grocery run

David Phillips is the VP of Engineering at the University of California. His research is focused around sustainability and green energy.

On this day he was a grocery mule for his wife, stocking up on food on a busy Sunday. As he turned down a frozen food section, he came upon the Healthy Choice meals.

As he weighed his options, a promotion caught his eye. Healthy Choice was offering 500 free air miles for every 10 bar codes you mailed in. The promotion would go from December 31st to May of the following year.

The math instantly jumped out. Doing a quick calculation, a $2 frozen meal provided $1 in air miles.

Then he spotted an added promotion. He could get double miles for everything he sent in by the end of that month.

Phillips is the sole breadwinner of a family of four and was hoping to do a family vacation the following year.

He stumbles across an even better hack

He got home with a particularly large set of groceries and explained his plan to his wife.

The double points deadline ended in three weeks. They spent the first week eating an unhealthy amount of Healthy Choice. Their freezer and fridge were completely stuffed.

They realized that strategy could only go so far.

Then, Phillips discovered a gold mine.

He was in the grocery store and arrived at the dry foods selection. Healthy Choice sold an eight-pack of pudding. It translated to .25c per pudding and he’d get a bar code for each. He borrowed a van from his mother-in-law and cleaned out the pudding from ten grocery stores.

While pushing his cart, filled to the brim with pudding, he got long stares from customers. When asked by strangers and cashiers, he said, “I’m just preparing for Y2K.” (It was 1999).

Seeing his current pudding stock wasn’t enough, he asked the local store manager to order him two huge crates of pudding. He arrived and loaded his truck up. Then he brought them back to the apartment, which was starting to resemble a pudding factory stockroom.

In all, he’d bought 12,150 puddings — but he still had another challenge to contend with.

Logistics:

A time crunch hit

The Phillips family needed to get the pudding mailed by the 31st of May and, as the above pic showed, it was May 28th. They needed help getting all the bar codes removed to mail in or they wouldn’t arrive in time and it would all be for nothing.

He and his wife made a deal with a local Salvation Army. If their volunteers helped them get the UPC codes off, the pudding would be donated to feed the poor.

Additionally, this could later become a tax deduction for Phillips. There was no way they’d eat that much pudding anyway. After two days of removing the UPC codes and getting them in the mail, their part was done.

The best part of this story

Usually, when you hear about gotchya stories, there is a part near the end where the company says, “Woah woah holdup — we didn’t actually mean it that way.”

They look for a technicality to weasel out. Or they summon their army of lawyers.

To the credit of Healthy Choice, there was no noise. Not even a phone call, let alone a lawyer sending some overly dramatic letter.

The certificates for air miles began arriving one after another in the mail. A total of 2506 certificates, bringing him 1,253,000 airline miles.

How he used the miles

He had to register his air miles to different accounts.

He divided 216,000 miles up between Delta, United, and Northwest. The remaining 1,037,000 went to his American Airlines— which earned him a lifetime gold member status (earning double points on travel).

The math checked out.

His pudding cost him a total of $3,140. His donation became an $875 tax write-off.

The 1.25 million miles was the equivalent of 50 round trips to anywhere in the United States. In the end, it was a win-win for everyone.

This became less a story about the little guy screwing over the corporation, as we often love — and more about a clever engineer, and a company that was willing to honor its promise without kicking a screaming.

News outlets discovered the Phillips story and dubbed him “pudding man”. The story also brought positive coverage to Healthy Choice, which boosted their sales.

Meanwhile, Phillips used his miles to travel to Nicaragua, Austria, Italy, Aruba, the Netherlands, Korea, and more.

He also happened to love pudding. So he kept 100 of the puddings for himself — which were promptly eaten.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/w9n4x3ia5dyqbher', 'title': ""What's the most clever thing someone did with a points promotion?"", 'score': {'original': 0.7224, 'ai': 0.2776}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The greatest civil engineers are systems thinkers.

Chirag Brahmbhatt,Updated 4y,What are some examples of great marketing?,"Why does Apple always come up with three versions of iPhone?

Let's understand this by an example.

Let's say you are an ice-cream lover. You find great value in eating ice-cream.

One fine day, you are out to treat yourself. Shopkeeper provides you below options:

One Scoop Ice Cream: 13 bucks

Two Scoop Ice Cream: 19 bucks

Three Scoop Ice Cream: 19.5 bucks

The negligible difference between the prices of 2nd and 3rd options gets your attention.

This is called Decoy Effect.

A 2nd option is just a Decoy option. Companies provide decoy option so that customer can compare Decoy option with an expensive option (and select the expensive one).

In the absence of a decoy option, the customer will compare: 13 bucks vs 19.5 bucks - and may probably go with a cheaper option.

But with decoy option, the customer now compares 19 bucks vs 19.5 bucks - and most likely selects the expensive option.

Can you see a similar pattern in the pricing of iphone11 by Apple?

iPhone: $ 699

iPhone Pro: $ 999

iPhone Pro max: $ 1099

Yes, Apple does use Decoy effect to drive consumer to buy the expensive version of their product. Not only they are making quality products, but also they are not leaving any stone unturned when it comes to marketing and selling their products.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dnp9ceyxvfg0t6h3', 'title': 'What are some examples of great marketing?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Why does Apple always come up with three versions of iPhone?\n\nLet's understand this by an example.\n\nLet's say you are an ice-cream lover.

Prakshi Sharma,10mo,Which is the best digital marketing course in India?,"This image has been removed for violating Quora's policy.

The promotion and advertising of a company, person, good, or service through the use of digital technology, electronic devices, and online platforms is known as digital marketing. Social media, email, pay-per-click (PPC), search engine optimization (SEO), and more are a few instances of digital marketing.

Digital marketing is incredibly economical when compared to traditional marketing. You select your budget and bid for ad space when you advertise online, whether on social media, websites, or search engines. When compared to purchasing a billboard, you have total control over your budget.

A key characteristic of digital marketing is flexibility. Campaigns and budgets might be scheduled to last for years or just a few seconds. Businesses benefit from agility that is frequently lacking in traditional marketing when precision targeting is combined with it. You can choose to suspend a PPC campaign if you start it and discover it is underperforming, for example. In contrast, if you purchase a billboard, you own it for the whole contract term, regardless of whether it is effective or not.

Although digital marketing has been around for a long, it has evolved more quickly than any other area of marketing due to the continuously changing technology. Several notables publish a fresh list of trends each year based on changing user behaviour after a thorough study. Businesses that monitor these patterns and adjust their strategy as necessary might draw in more clients and experience long-term exponential growth.

Modern marketers have a responsibility to channel digital developments and develop integrated strategies that keep up with these trends because technology nowadays has a huge impact on customer behaviour and the purchase experience. It is crucial for these marketers to understand what trends are currently dominating the market and what trends are here to stay.
