Viral Suchak,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I was scrolling through my facebook feed and I saw a post by Mr.Randeep Hooda. He is a well known Bollywood actor.

Here's his facebook post:

If you are Muslim and suddenly start feeling unsafe in country where you lived for more than thousand years..

If you are Dalit and start feeling insulted on every moment of life..

If you are Hindu and suddenly start feeling that cows are being slaughtered everywhere...

If you are a Jain and suddenly start feeling that your religious piety is being compromised...

If you are punjabi and think all the youth are on drugs.

Just do one thing...

- Stay away from social media...

- Don't watch news...

- Stay away from debates on

religion...

Just look around you at your friends who belong to different castes , communities and religions...

And you will find that you are living in one of the best countries in the world!!

This is the best thing I read today…

Satendra Singh,Updated 5y,What interesting thing did you read today?,"When China refused to share technology with India-

Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh is dealing with severe water crisis. It receives lowest rainfall and underground water levels are at all time low with Mahoba being the most parched district. So Uttar Pradesh government decided to moisten the ground by inducing rain artificially.

But India doesn't have such technology so they contacted pioneer of this technology, their neighbour cum rival, China. According to Dharampal Singh, State irrigation minister, “China had offered to share the process with us for about Rs 10.5 crore but for reasons best known to them, they backed out in February this year. We even asked them to participate in a global tender but they didn’t.”

After China turned their back IIT Kanpur was asked to undertake the project. The process, known as cloud seeding, involves spraying a mixture in atmosphere around which water vapours condense and when these water droplets become too heavy to stay in air they fall down as rain. Development of this mixture was the most difficult part of the project but IIT Kanpur in collaboration with department of aerospace engineering, civil engineering and bio engineering developed it in just five months. In IIT Kanpur’s deputy director Manindra Agarwal’s words “The mixture is most critical part and we have perfected it. The rest of the technology is quite standard.”

Also the estimated cost of inducing artificial rain over 1000 square kilometre using the IIT Kanpur technique would come to around Rs 5 crore.

Once America and now China…never underestimate the power of Indian scientists.

Vignesh Atm,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I'm pretty sure most of you here know Nicki Minaj. She's an American singer/rapper.

And I'm pretty sure most of you hate her as well. She's not exactly known for all the good reasons. I used to hate her too but then she did something that just forced me to change.

I think this deserves respect. A LOT of respect.

So it all started when a fan replied to her tweet and asked if she wanted to pay his tuition fees.

And then Nicki Minaj replied. (I’m pretty sure he didn't expect it)

And then she actually did setup a contest, helping over 50 of her fans. Sure, she probably has a lot of money, but it takes some massive generosity to help her fans like this.

Here's something she posted on Instagram after:

She spent over $50,000 dollars on that day. She has actually started a student charity that's constantly helping students around the world for the past one month or so.

I'm actually astonished by how a social image can be deceptive. She's known for twerking among other things and her songs all portray her in some sort of bad light.

But to see this was truly astounding.

And today, Nicki Minaj, you've earned my respect.

Edit: Ketan Pande, down in the comments, has just informed me that Nicki Minaj has been secretly helping a Village in India! Thanks Ketan!

On Phil’s first day of sixth grade on August 1, more than 50 bikers from Fort Wayne and Columbia City gathered at Richards Restaurant in Auburn to escort the harried kid to school. The bikers prayed for Phil before hitting the road to reach the school.

The motorcycles’ roar was difficult to miss as they arrived at the school. Fellow students rushed out to see as sound of the mean machines reverberated off the brick walls of the school. It was a sight to behold as young Phil stepped out in full grandeur, his confidence touching sky-high.

Young Phil later said that he is not afraid any more.

Lindsay Elizabeth,5y,What bothers you about the Harry Potter books?,"Sirius never knew how the Dursleys treated Harry, how they acted as if he was hardly human.

Even in their earliest conversations, Sirius assumes Harry would rather go back to his relatives.

Harry never tells him.

When Harry comes to Grimmauld Place at the start of the fifth book, he is frustrated. His friends, the closest thing he has to family, have been here the whole time without him. He has been kept in the dark and he has been kept with his relatives who many consider abusive. He is exhausted, drained.

Sirius only knows parts of this, but what he does know is how Harry defended his cousin, something that might give the illusion of closeness.

And the heartbreaking part isn’t that Sirius would have saved him if he knew. But he would have. He would have done whatever it took to get Harry out of that home, because it is heavily implied he grew up in an abusive family and he wouldn’t let his godson suffer the same thing.

The heartbreaking part is that Harry probably knew this and chose not to tell him. He chose not to tell him because he knew Sirius would take extreme measures if necessary and Harry cared more about his godfather’s safety than his own.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0m6pjuxgnrsz87dc', 'title': 'What bothers you about the Harry Potter books?', 'score': {'original': 0.9936, 'ai': 0.0064}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Sirius never knew how the Dursleys treated Harry, how they acted as if he was hardly human.\n\nEven in their earliest conversations, Sirius assumes Harry would rather go back to his relatives.\n\nHarry never tells him.\n\nWhen Harry comes to Grimmauld Place at the start of the fifth book, he is frustrated.

Harry got his first Hogwarts letter before his birthday, but the Dursleys didn’t allow him to read it. The letters then continued to arrive for a few days, until Hagrid showed up (that happened on his birthday).
Harry was not a muggleborn, so he was expected to know about magic and Hogwarts already.

Andy K,Updated 1y,How come Dumbledore was feared by Voldemort?,"I think all the people talking about how powerful Dumbledore is have missed something important. Whilst it's clear that both Dumbledore and Voldemort are extremely powerful wizards, it's also clear there are other powerful wizards in the Harry Potter world who Voldemort doesn't fixate on. More importantly, Dumbledore, regardless of power, can't actually kill Voldemort because his soul is spread out among the horcruxes. Dumbledore is an inconvenience to Voldemort, not a genuine threat.

But Voldemort is still scared of him.

Voldemort's real source of power isn't just magic, it's terror. Voldemort is terrifying. He doesn't just have power, he has the will to use it for the most awful things imaginable. He'll torture you to madness, he'll kill everybody close to you, he'll even murder a newborn child. He's so terrifying that even a decade after he disappeared, everybody is too frightened to even say his name. This fear giving Voldemort power is a theme throughout the books, and it’s cleverly explored by how people address him.

Most of the wizarding world don't address him at all. He is ‘he who must not be named’ or ‘you know who’. He has power over them, because they live in terror of even the thought of him. Only the braver characters (Hermione, Harry, Lupin) call him Voldemort. They see him as a frightening creature, terrible as he is, but they refuse to let that fear have power over them. Until the very end of the last book there's only one character who calls him anything else: Dumbledore.

Dumbledore calls him ‘Tom.’

Not only does Dumbledore not give in to the fear of Voldemort, he doesn't even acknowledge he exists. He refuses to accept the monstrous persona Voldemort has built around himself and talks to him as an ordinary human being. And that's what really frightens Voldemort. People seeing what he really is. An ordinary, vulnerable human being so frightened that he tore his own soul apart to avoid having to confront his own mortality. A little boy afraid to face death. Voldemort is terrified that people will realise he's a fraud. And Dumbledore knows what he is.

In the end, there is one of other person who does this. It is, of course, Harry, who during their final confrontation calls him ‘Riddle'. He directly says he won't call him a Lord because he isn't one. He openly mocks Voldemort for putting his trust in Snape, letting him know that Dumbledore beat him yet again, without using any magic at all. That he's lost, and he isn't frightening at all, and murder is all he's got left and it doesn't even matter. He isn't scared of cowardly little Tom Riddle.

Voldemort is terrified of Dumbledore because from the very beginning Dumbledore is the one character who knows how small he is, how weak and alone he is, how afraid he is. Dumbledore knows Voldemort is just Tom Riddle, and that's what scares Voldemort most.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rn5i1vy063efbdsj', 'title': 'How come Dumbledore was feared by Voldemort?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I think all the people talking about how powerful Dumbledore is have missed something important.

AnandBhushan Singh,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"A man married a beautiful girl. He loved her very much.

One day she developed a skin disease. Slowly she started to lose her beauty. It so happened that one day her husband left for a tour.

While returning he met with an accident and lost his eyesight. However their married life continued as usual. But as days passed she lost her beauty gradually.

Blind husband did not know this and there was not any difference in their married life.

He continued to love her and she also loved him very much. One day she died. Her death brought him great sorrow.

He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town. A man from behind called and said, now how will you be able to walk all alone? All these days your wife used to help you. He replied, I am not blind.

I was acting, because if she knew l could see her ugliness it would have pained her more than her disease. So I pretended to be blind.

She was a very good wife. I only wanted to keep her happy.

Moral: Some times it is good for us to act blind and ignore one another's short comings, in order to be happy. No matter how many times the teeth bite the tongue, they still stay together in one mouth. That's the spirit of FORGIVENESS.

Srinath Nalluri,Updated 4y,What are the biggest lies that society tells us?,"I think you are NOT happy.

Let’s see these two scenarios

The office shift ends at 6 PM on a Friday.

Nithyanand logs out of the system and runs out of the office building. He catches up with his college friends for dinner at a fine persian restaurant that night. They laugh a lot as they revisit their old memories. Meeting friends actually uplifts the soul, he posts online. Then they go to bar and drink all the way into the night, chatting and dancing to the hard rock music on the stage.

While at the same time,

Satyanand couldn’t leave work at 6PM as his code showed errors. He kept debugging and trying other alternatives. Finally, it was 9:30 PM, when it showed the desired result. He logged out of the system and went back to his room, reading his favourite nonfiction on the way. He made bindi fry and had it with rotis. Then he watched an episode on Netflix and dozed off on the sofa.

Now—

Which of these two people do you think are having an unhappy life?

.

.

.

Well—it might look surprising —but the answer is,

Neither of them.

Or to put it in the context of the famous movie 3 Idiots,

Chathur is as happy as Rancho.

This is one common myth about happiness.

The society expects happiness to always be a visible thing and that it should be expressed in specific patterns.

However,

There is a lot of difference between

Being happy

and

Showing the world that you are happy.

The latter is only a minor subset of the former one.

And it hugely depends on the societal perception of ‘happiness’ which may or may not be your definition.

For example,

a person sitting with a group of friends, laughing and sharing food with them in a crowded restaurant is considered happy and enthusiastic while a person sitting alone and eating is considered to be lonely and sad.
But it can be that he had avoided his friends and came there purposely alone to enjoy his favourite meal without any distraction. His happiness came from relishing it bite by bite.
a person with a long beard spending the whole weekend inside a room smoking and reading some huge books is considered as depressed and boring.
His happiness is coming from decoding the deep philosophical poems and he is as happy as the person posting a selfie with his friends at a Oktoberfest.

The problem here is not happiness, but that their behaviour doesn’t fit into how society defines happiness.

Films, media, social network often showcase this—People who slog day and night and do nothing but work are depicted as unhappy people who don’t value life. They had to be stopped and lectured ‘C’mon you should get a life! You should be happy.’ And then they realise the celebration of life by drinking, partying, surfing, parasailing and skydiving.

What makes you conclude that they are not happy?

How can you decide that this is the recipe of happiness for others?

I’ve seen lot of people—like researchers, scientists, developers, entrepreneurs—who yearn to work everyday and are not tired even after eighteen hours of work. They enjoy work like a glass of wine. They all find the same happiness in work which someone else finds in skydiving.

But because of such perceptions, they are conditioned to believe that they are not happy, something is wrong with them etc.

For example, now—say—after the weekend, Satyanand goes to office and Nithyanand tells him ‘You should enjoy. You should celebrate life, be happy every minute…’ This is the nth time he is listening to this. So, next time, he goes with him uninterested.

He is not a fan of persian food. He hates loud music. He doesn’t like beer. But he just sits with them so as to not disappoint them. He secretly starts feeling irritated that he is wasting time at a place he has no interest in…thus, his unhappiness curve begins.

You want to be happy because society has convinced you that so-called people are happy all the time. You want to be happy because you want to fit in.

But why should you fit into the parameters of some made-up definition of normalcy? You’re exhausted because you’re always pretending to be something you are not. You are constantly trying to reach this non-existent, ideal state if emotional well-being.

It’s not real. You are being set up to fail.

Kushal Tamang,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"A popular fake Quora user was exposed today.

I found this post on Reddit
 and searched her name on Quora. She was pretty popular but was fake and was finally exposed.

So, this girl called Oakley Maverick who was using fake credentials and fake profile picture was exposed and it's the best thing I’ve read today and I felt good.

Why?

Because Quora doesn't stand for this. And, I and thousands of other quorans didn't sign up here to see a fake person using fake credentials and writing about their fake experiences, sharing their “knowledge”, just for the sake of popularity.

I wonder how many people were misinformed due to her, and how many people had read her content and had believed her.

PS: I just searched her again and she has become a Quora User now.

Lavina Tandon,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I had read this on whatsapp-

A few years ago in-front of his eyes his girlfriend was brutally raped by six bastards in a running bus of Delhi.

He fought till the time he was beaten blue with an iron rod.

They broke his leg, robbed him, snatched his mobile & left him almost naked..

He fought till the time he could. Then on that chilling cold night he was thrown from the running bus along with his girl friend.

They were naked, drained, exhausted & both were bleeding for different reasons.

He tried to stop passing cars & kept on begging for a piece of shawl to wrap his naked girl friend & finally he got it after 40 minutes.

Then he took her to the hospital, admitted her, called the police,called her parents & did every possible co-operation that a true friend should do in the hour of need.

He could have fled from the bus - he did not.

He could have left her on the road - he did not.

He could have claimed fame & money ( as the father of Nirbhaya got Rs 25 lakhs from UP CM,his son got a job & many more ) - but he did not.

He could have claimed his treatment money from Govt - he did not.

He could have become the most frequently seen face in the electronic media in exchange of money - he did not.

*If this is not friendship then what is friendship??*

When the entire country roared for the girl no one thought what this boy had gone through that night.

He is not a film star or a cricketer.

He is *Awindra Pratap Pandey,* a boy from Gorakhpur in UP, the boy who loved his girl friend from the core of his heart.

When this boy is there somewhere in anonymity, why we Indians should celebrate Friendship Day on 3rd August to copy the Americans?

We should celebrate Friendship Day in India on *16th December* to salute the spirit of Awindra who proved what friendship means.

Let *16th December* be the official Friendship Day in India.

Am I talking sense??

If *yes* then please share & forward this to as many as you can…

Priyambad Singh,1y,What are the behaviors of a confident person?,"I am sure you must have have seen his interviews and speeches.

This is Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, an Indian diplomat and politician serving as the Minister of External Affairs of the government of India since May 2019.

Whenever I see his interviews, I see confidence, fearlessness and love for his country.

I will quote here an excerpt from one of his interviews which I saw recently.

The Interviewer : Mr Jaishankar there will always be two axis. At this point I think it's an understood fact that we have the US led west and the China led next potential axis. So where do you think India fits into?

Dr Jaishankar : This is exactly where I disagree with you. This is the construct you are trying to impose on me and I don't accept it. It's not important for me to join this axis and if i am not a part of this axis I need to join the other. We are 1/5 th of world population, 5th largest economy. I am entitled have my own side, I am entitled to have my own choices and my choices won't be cynical and transactional, but there will be a balance of my values and my interest. There is no country in this world that disregard it's interests.

To be honest I am a big fan of Dr S Jaishankar, maybe congress leader Rahul Gandhi calls it as an arrogant indian foreign policy but when I see him delivering speeches I can only see a confident man having immense love for his country.

Thanks for your valuable time 🙂

This is Rakesh, he runs a used books stall in Andheri, Mumbai where you can rent a book for ₹10.

When asked if he earns enough doing this, he responded in a way that qualifies him to be what we call an avid reader.

His response was -”People earn so they can spend money on something they want. I am already surrounded by the one thing I always wanted to have”.

For me, he is one of the finest avid readers as he is far from distractions of life and doing the one thing that satisfies him the most. ❤😘

Sarhad Choudhary,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"This one I read on WhatsApp. But strangely I found it worth sharing. It's really good. I hope we can share something that we read on WA.

A wise man asked, why do you have brakes in cars?

There were some logical replies,

To avoid accidents.
To reduce speed.
Basically, for safe driving.

That's not how the wise man perceived the importance of a brake. His answer was:

We have brakes, so that we can drive faster.

Now that was unexpected. People didn't agree at first. It didn't make much sense. But listen to the logic behind it…

If there are no brakes, any person would try to avoid accident by driving slow. Infact he won't drive at all. It's the security of working brakes that allows him to pick up speed, accelerate and reach his destination.

We can apply the same for life.

It's necessary to have a fallback option. It's necessary to have a source of mental support. Without their help, no man can rise. Who're they? Friends, family and colleagues.

They often question your actions, which may cause us to get irritated. But it's their constant nagging which involuntarily helps us stay right on track.

Without those brakes, we can skid, lose direction, and meet with an unfortunate accident.

Now I won't mind if my mom scolds me. I'll give her a kind smile and comply with whatever she asks.

Ok, no… I'll retaliate at times.

It's a beautiful message I found worth sharing. Thanks for reading.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a2ueq4db10fztvcl', 'title': 'What is the best thing you read today?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This one I read on WhatsApp. But strangely I found it worth sharing.

Niaz Maksud,Updated 5y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Have you heard about this man?

Yes, This is Afroz Shah, a Mumbai based lawyer who, a year back, was conferred with Champion of the Earth award, UN’s top reward recognising outstanding leaders who have striven to lead a positive impact on environment.

What did he do?

Look at the pictures..

He initiated the world's largest beach cleanup project at Versova Beach.

How did it begin?

Shah and his 84 year old neighbor Harbansh Mathur, were fed up of the debris and waste accumulated on Versova beach. They were determined to do something and took the colossal task of cleaning the beach into their own hands!

The pair started cleaning up the beach themselves, one piece of rubbish at a time. But they wanted others to join in this movement and spread awareness. Hence, they inspired youth and their neighbors and locals to get involved in the cleaning drive. His call was responded also by slum dwellers, journalists and celebrities. They came every weekend for their date with the ocean and contributed to Shah's effort. They did this continuously every weekend for almost 2 years in a knee deep rotting pile of garbages and the scorching Indian sun!

What was the result?

A clean beautiful beach!

The volunteers collected over 4,500 tons of trash from the 2.5 kilometre beach.

Hats off to Shah and Team. Take a bow!!

And what I read today made me super duper happy!!

“Olive ridley turtles hatch in Mumbai after two decades at Versova Beach""[1]

The ecosystem is returning to a place that was buried under tons and tons of garbage and waste for 20 long years!

Afroz Shah’s effort has been paid off! Respect you sir!!

You have set an example for the youth and for the public with your efforts and good work!

This is something surreal!

Our country needs people more like you.

You have really inspired us!

Neha Batra,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Police comes to Russian guy's rescue who was seen begging near a temple.

“Atithi devo bhavah”... This is not only something we Indians take pride in saying, this is the motto we live by.

The below example truly shows this spirit.

A tourist from Russia was seen begging outside the Kumarakottam Murugan temple in Kanchipuram. People there inquired about him and informed police to look into the matter as he seemed lost. A team of police from Siva Kanchi police station arrived and found out that he was a 32 year old research student from Russia, who has simply exhausted all his money.

The guy's name was “Evangelin Burngowe”. He had arrived in India on 8th September on tourist visa.

After touring places in North India, Burngowe had reached Kancheepuram by bus from Bangalore. He exhausted all his money on mobile phone and the main problem arrived when he forgot the pin of his debit card. He said he had no other options so he decided to beg for money.

The police verified his documents and found that his documents were all valid and the story was indeed true.

Then he was given Rs. 500 and the police authorities put him on a train to Chennai. They asked him to get down at Egmore and take an autorickshaw to the Russian embassy in the City.

Given the image of police in today's scenario, this was a worth mentioning effort by them. Also salute to the local people for their spirit.

Amidst all the negative issues that media portrays, this was indeed a breath of fresh air.

Humanity is still alive.

Hail humanity.

Saurabh Suman,Updated 5y,What is the best thing you read today?,"I was going through my feed in LinkedIn and found this beautiful and heart warming poem dedicated to all the soldiers:

“We both left home at 18,

You cleared JEE, I got recommended.

You got IIT, I got NDA.

You pursued your degree, I had the toughest training.

Your day started at 7 and ended at 5, mine started at 4 till 9 and some nights also included.

You had your convocation ceremony, I had my POP (Passing Out Parade).

Best company took you and best package was awarded, I was ordered to join my Paltan with 2 stars piped on my shoulders.

You got a job,I got a way of life.

Every eve you got to see your family, I just wished I got to see my parents soon.

You celebrated festivals with lights and music, I celebrated with my comrade in bunkers.

We both married and your wife got to see you everyday, My wife just wished I was alive.

You were sent to business trips, I was sent on line of control.

We both returned, Both wives couldn't control their tears, you wiped hers but, I couldn't...

You hugged her but, I couldn't. Because I was lying in the coffin, with medals on my chest and coffin wrapped with tricolor.

My way of life ended... Your continued.

We both left home at 18.”

Salute to all the Indian soldiers!!!

Jai Hind!!!

Vikas Vasantkumar,Updated 5y,Can you share a picture of your book collection?,"That's me in euphoria when I finally designed myself a book shelf and had it built. It brought together the elements I love to do. Read and Design.

I've been buying books for years now and reached a point where I had more books in my closet than clothes.

So I decided to renovate the space in my room and create a book shelf, the idea was to utilize the maximum space but also something that gives me accessibility and allows me to easily find the books I need.

I couldn’t wait until the shelf was completed, so used to arrange the books at the end of each day the minute carpenter left.

Vyshakh R,Updated 3y,What is something that is really dark in the Harry Potter series that is really just kind of ignored?,"Hermione's parents.

At the beginning of the Deathly Hallows, Hermione casually mentions to Ron and Harry that she altered her parents' memories and gave them new identities as Wendell and Monica Wilkins who wish to move to Australia, to protect them from the Death Eaters.

Imagine for a second, doing that to your parents, whom you have known all your life, who you know loves you more than anyone else in the entire world. If something goes wrong, then Hermione is left parentless.

Hermione made the biggest sacrifice of them all, but no one even bothered to check how she was doing with it throughout the entire period. She left her parents in such a state to fight along with Ron and Harry.

That takes guts and a huge amount of bravery. For a child to do that to their own parents for whatever reason, is extraordinary I think.

Abhijay Bahati,Updated 4y,What is the greatest monster/creature in all of fiction?,"Nothing really beats the super massive beast playing galactic marbles at the end of credit scene for Men In Black 1.

Do you know whats the ball in this hand? Almost an entire Galaxy which in itself is several million light years across.

That would make the hand and the creature itself measuring several trillion light years in size. This beast is so soo massive that even Solar system would be smaller than one atom is to us.

Now the kicker. The beast picks up a million light years huge galaxy and within one second throws it across and then in a large bag with many galaxies.

Parinda Gandevikar,Updated 7y,"Why do people who love reading, love it so much?","(Spoiler alert: Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy)

Do you know where I am right now?
In the general ladies coach of train from Surat to Baroda ( Gujarat, India). I am surrounded by sweating fat ladies on all four sides. There's no place to sit, I am standing in the aisle. Someone again left the toilet door open, it's stinking. Two women are fighting for a seat, calling each other names. A baby is crying somewhere due to the commotion, the stink and the heat.

Before I opened Quora on my phone, I was reading Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. For about an hour, I forgot that I was in the hot, stinking, crowded train in India.

I was hunting with Levin in the fields of Yasyana Polyana, Russia. I could feel the cold morning air and the dew under my feet.
I was worrying about my farm and cattle, and the kopecks (old Russian currency) I owed to various people.

I was having an affair with Vronsky, feeling the passion and regret. Waiting for my lover to come back from a party, worrying whether he was with some other woman. I looked at myself in the mirror to see whether my beauty was intact.

I just committed suicide by jumping in front of a train due to my insecurity.

Maybe I will never visit fields of russia, never have an extra marital affair, never commit suicide. But for an hour, I felt all of it. I was there. Not with them. I was them.

Mercedes R. Lackey,3y,Who agrees with Elliott Hulse when he says it's okay to judge a book by its cover because the cover of the book is going to tell you what's inside of it guaranteed?,"Absolutely, positively, not.

What do you think this is about?

Looks like a book about a circus horse (that’s a circus stunt rig she’s wearing) that’s somehow able to levitate tires, doesn’t it? Well it’s one of my “Arrows of the Queen” books, Arrow’s Flight, I think.

How about this one?

OK, looks like an adventure in a desert in which some species of cat is the main character right? Nope. It’s Storm Breaking, there’s not a desert or a cat in sight, and neither of the horses on that cover are Companions.

And here’s another cover of the same book.

Well this is a little better. At least there’s a hint of the remains of Urtho’s Tower. But if that’s the Dhorisha Plains I’ll eat my hat, and I don’t think I’ll be dining on felt any time soon.

This isn’t a bad cover, it just is absolutely not informative.

But I am saving the “best” for last.

WTF is going on here??????? I can’t even. What about any of this cover says Arrows of the Queen besides the title? Sweet Baby Jesus, what drugs was that artist taking? I want to know so I can avoid them.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lcivpkd9t7eobf16', 'title': ""Who agrees with Elliott Hulse when he says it's okay to judge a book by its cover because the cover of the book is going to tell you what's inside of it guaranteed?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Absolutely, positively, not.\n\nWhat do you think this is about?\n\nLooks like a book about a circus horse (that’s a circus stunt rig she’s wearing) that’s somehow able to levitate tires, doesn’t it?

Charline Thom,3y,How do Harry Potter movie series characters look in the books?,"Oh, this is my chance! I recently came across this artist named Giblimort (go check her out on tumblr or Ao3) who uses some program to do some amazing real life like portraits of the Harry Potter characters, I have contacted her and asked if I could share her work around with obvious credit which she kindly agreed upon, mind you though some of the characters she depicted through the ages and with some such as with Harry she sadly only depicted all grown up.

Harry Potter (grown up)

“Do you remember me telling you we are practicing non-verbal spells, Potter?”

“Yes,” said Harry stiffly.

“Yes, sir.”

“There’s no need to call me “sir” Professor.”

The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying.

― Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Ron Weasley (grown up)

“And from now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell die, Ron, die — I’m just chucking them in the bin where they belong.”

― Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Hermione Granger (through the ages)

“Books! And cleverness! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!”

— Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone

Tom Riddle (transformation to Voldemort)

Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years before; they were not as snake-like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face yet not manlike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features has been burned and blurred, they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of his eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become.

— Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Severus Snape

“Look...at...me...” he whispered.

The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more.

― Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

Sirius Black (before and after Azkaban)

“Come on, you can do better than that!” he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room.

— Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

James Potter

“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off —”

— Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

Remus Lupin

“Did you like question ten, Moony?” asked Sirius as they emerged into the entrance hall.

""Loved it,"" said Lupin briskly. “Give five signs that identify the werewolf. Excellent question.”

“D'you think you managed to get all the signs?” said James in tones of mock concern.

“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds.

“One: He's sitting on my chair. Two: He's wearing my clothes. Three: His name's Remus Lupin...”

— Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Lily Potter

Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at him enough.

“You’ve been so brave.”

He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough.

— Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

Ginny Weasley (through the ages)

“Anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.”

— Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Molly Weasley

Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her.

— Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

Arthur Weasley

“Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night!'”

“Did you really?” said Mr Weasley eagerly. “Did it go all right? I-I mean,” he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs Weasley's eyes, “that-that was very wrong, boys – very wrong indeed ...”

— Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

Draco Malfoy (grown up)

“Signed photos? You’re giving out signed photos, Potter?”

― Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

Lucius Malfoy

“Lucius my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him. “I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face.”

— Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

Narcissa Malfoy

""There is nothing I wouldn't do anymore!""

— Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Bellatrix Lestrange (motion)

""Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy? You need to mean them Potter! You need to really want to cause pain -- to enjoy it -- righteous anger won't hurt me for long -- I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson.""

— Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Andromeda Tonks

“We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood .”

— Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

Fred Weasley

And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred's eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.

― Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

George Weasley

“What do we want to be prefects for?” said George, looking revolted at the very idea. “It’d take all the fun out of life.”

― Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Luna Lovegood

""I believe He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him and escaped from him.""

— Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Percy Weasley

“I was a fool!"" Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph.

""I was a pompous prat, I was a- a-""

""Ministry loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,"" said Fred.

Percy swallowed.

""Yes, I was!""

— Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

Bill Weasley

“Bill was — there was no other word for it — cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill’s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.”

― Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

Fleur Delacour

“Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?""

It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore's speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.

— Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

Cedric Diggory

“Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right, and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”

― Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

Nymphadora Tonks (motion)

“And this is Nymphadora-”

“Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus”, said the young witch with a shudder. “It’s Tonks.”

“Nymphadora Tonks”, who prefers to be known by her surname only,” finished Lupin.

“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you ‘Nymphadora,” muttered Tonks.

― Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Cho Chang

The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn’t help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn’t think had anything to do with nerves.

— Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Charlie Weasley

""Charlie's in the Order, too, but he's still in Romania. Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie's trying to make contacts on his days off.""

— Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Pansy Parkinson

“But, he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!”

— Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

Regulus Black

To the Dark Lord,

I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.

R.A.B

— Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Parvati & Padma Patil

“I still can’t get how the two of you got the best looking girls in our year” Dean said to Ron and Harry.

— Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

Walburga Black

""My mother didn't have a heart, Kreacher,"" snapped Sirius. ""She kept herself alive out of pure spite.""

— Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Tomaž Vargazon,1y,Why is it taking so long for George RR Martin to finish Winds of Winter?,"He has the same problem as Tolstoy had with The Decembrists.

Tolstoy. His surname can be translated as “Fatso”

Tolstoy wanted to write a book about the Decembrist, a less known unsuccessful coup in Russia that occured in December of 1825. Tolstoy wanted to write about their leaders, their goals, causes for their failure and so on. Yet he found he couldn’t properly explore that if he didn’t write about an earlier even that set the things in motion, the Napoleonic invasion of Russia. He determined the only way to properly approach the issue of The Decembrists was to write a prequel first.

He did the logical thing and wrote a book that wasn’t a novel, much less a poem, you now know it as War and Peace. This book was so successful, so different and took up so much of his time he never finished The Decembrists. Three unfinished chapters exist, but for better or worse, he devoted his time to other projects instead.

This is rather similar to the issues GRRM has with A Song of Ice and Fire. The key takeaway of the series is the relevation of Danny as the villain, whom we all (well, almost all) worshiped as the hero, there are others yes, many of them, but this arc is the key to the whole thing. However he couldn’t write about the villain you thought was hero, without making her the hero to begin with. Plus he absolutely had to write about a whole host of other things that also happen in the realm, to set the tone and deconstruct the idea of the hero a hundred and one more times.

Eventually all became too much and he was distracted by other projects. I do hope he still finishes someday, though the outlook seems bleak at this point.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9hrsb5j173emgk40', 'title': 'Why is it taking so long for George RR Martin to finish Winds of Winter?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'He has the same problem as Tolstoy had with The Decembrists.\n\nTolstoy.

Bob Hans,Updated 3y,What movie or book has an alternative or changed ending that significantly changes the whole story?,"I Am Legend.

Shashwat,6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"A 9 Year Old Boy Wrote A Letter To NASA Asking For a Job-

He wrote this-

“Dear NASA,

My name is Jack Davis and I would like to apply for the planetary protection officer job. I may be nine but I think I would be fit for the job. One of the reasons is my sister says I am an alien. Also, I have seen almost all the space movies and alien movies I can see. I have also seen the show Marvel Agents of Shield and hope to see the movie Men in Black. I am great at vidieo [sic] games. I am young, so I can learn to think like an alien.

Sincerely,
Jack Davis
Guardian of the Galaxy
Fourth Grade”

He too got a reply from the Director of the Planetary science-

“Dear Jack,

I hear you are a ‘Guardian of the Galaxy’ and that you’re interested in being a NASA Plantary Protection Officer. That’s great!

Our Plantary Protection Officer position is really cool and is very important work. It’s about protecting Earth from tiny microbes when we bring back samples from the Moon, asteroids and Mars. It’s also about protecting other planets and moons from our germs as we responsibly explore the Solar System.

We are always looking for bright future scientists and engineers to help us, so I hope you will study hard and do well in school. We hope to see you here at NASA one of these days!

Sincerely,
Dr. James L. Green
Director, Planetary Science Division”

Vans Grimiere,Updated 5y,"Is it possible for an entire book to be written so that at the very last phrase, the meaning of the rest of the novel changes entirely?","Would you mind if it did by the “last chapter” rather than the “last sentence”? Here it is:

“Si” by Bob Ong

It’s published last 2014. A short read with only 185 pages and large font size. Sadly, this book is only available in our language (Filipino). (There's no official nor fan translation available anywhere, my bros and sis). What made this book interesting is that the story is in reverse order.

The book starts with chapter “72” and ends with chapter “0”. Each chapter tells the most significant event in EVERY YEAR of the MC’s life, from when he’s 72 years old up to when he’s still inside his mom’s womb (0 yrs old). And you’re supposed to read it that way.

[Spoiler-Alert]
So what’s special about the ending?

The book is all about a man’s life. I mean, everything. It is a story about love, family, friendship, life during WW 2 and every other things that everyone may have once or wished to experience. The story developed with a magical feels to it because of the reverse order that would make you feel nostalgic in every chapter.

It’s as if you’re looking through the eyes of an old man recalling his past before he leaves this world peacefully.

But once you reach chapter “0” where he’s still not born, you’ll realize how wrong you were. Here’s an excerpt from that chapter:

“Ngunit tulad ng dati ay binulungan ako ni Ina. At sa dulo ng bawat luha ay muling nakiusap na patawarin ko siya. Nagsumamo ako. Sa huling pagkakataon . At ipinagmakaawa ang karapatan ng aking buhay”

Translation: “But just like before, my Mom whispered to me. And in every drop of tears, she’d ask me to forgive her. I plead. For the last time. I begged for my right to live.”

And the last few sentences of the book described how he slowly lost his senses. From how it’s getting quieter, how it’s getting colder, how it’s getting darker.

It squeezed my heart to pulp as it only implies that: He was aborted.

The book was NEVER about how a man struggled and lived his life BUT about a life that someone would have had if he was given the chance to live.

It also made me facepalm ‘cause I never saw that coming despite all the clues like:

Snow. Philippines is a tropical country meaning there’s no snow here. The snowflakes on the book cover and the scenes were there’s snow symbolizes imagination in our context.

The Title. Which is “Si”. Si is a Filipino article (like a, an, the) that ALWAYS comes before a name. (Ex. Si Vans, Si Elon) So why only “Si ____”? Because the MC never had a name. Why no name? Because it was our parents who give us a name when we are born. He never had a name because he was never born.

MC’s name was never mentioned. Because he didn’t have one. Also, lack of name symbolizes his lack of identity or place in the real world.

The Overview. It’s comprised of a dialogue that goes like…

MC: “When will I meet you?”

Victoria (love interest): “Once you’re born”

-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

We all knew how annoying was the trope “It never happened” but this book’s message saved it from that.

It’s true that our life depends on the choices we’ll make. That our destiny is in our own hands. But none of that would have mattered if our parents never let us live in the first place.

Shubham KP,1y,What book are you reading now?,"My sister was struggling to get a job.

According to me, every girl should be independent. Every girl needs to earn their own money.

Girls don’t need to bear any domestic abuse just because she’s not earning. Girls should have a job so that they don’t become a burden to anyone at any point in life.

I told my father, strictly, that didi is not getting married unless she gets a job. Thankfully, this year she cleared a government exam and now she’s a Rural Agriculture Extention Officer. This is just the beginning for her, I hope, and she gets more in her life.

At that time, I came across a beautiful strong woman from Quora. I messaged her, personally, and thanked her as she was brave enough to share her story to motivate others.

I kept pushing my sister because of her. I wanted her to become as strong as that Quoran.

The moment didi’s results were out, I was so thankful to that Quoran. Because, like didi, she’s also like my elder sister. I wanted to dedicate an answer to her for a long time. But, I guess, this is the right time. She’s a published author now and I can’t be happier for her.

Roland Bartetzko,2y,How well-known is Roland Bartetzko's book in Kosovo? Does it barely sell or is it a hit?,"I can't complain.

When I published the Albanian language edition of my book in Kosovo, I called the biggest bookstore in the country and asked them if they wanted a few copies.

They said “okay, bring us some copies” and I went there with a big box containing sixty-five books. When they saw me they said, “oh, no! This is far too much, we've been thinking about two or three copies!”

My book was on a TV show last week which helped me to sell a lot of copies. (Photo: screenshot from a Facebook video)

Fortunately, the manager wasn’t there and I could lie to them that their boss had told me to deliver all these books. They shrugged and took the box.

This was on a Friday. The next Monday, they called me and said they needed more books.

Since then, the book[1]is constantly selling well. There were dozens of newspaper articles about it and I also had the privilege to present it on several TV shows.

Probably yes.

But this little detail from New Moon never fails to impress me.

Remember how Bella spirals into around four months of depression after Edward leaves her?

The movie shows how the months pass, as Bella keeps sitting in the same position in a stillness like death.

Days, seasons, and people pass by.

But Bella just keeps staring out of the window, lonesome and lifeless.

Hmm, but did you notice something?

See how there are fewer and fewer pictures of her friends hung up on the wall, as each month passes by?

It symbolises her loneliness; how she gets detached from her friends, her family, how disconnected she is from her life now.

How her pain made her almost lifeless, and she just sits there, month after month, without a purpose, just drifting by.

The haunting track “Possibility” playing in the background just makes the scene all the rawer.

I don’t know about you, but for me, this scene has a special place in my heart, because of how perfectly it captures the intrinsic essence of depression and detachment in a hauntingly beautiful way.

Murphy Barrett,4y,Where does Robert Heinlein belong in the pantheon of science fiction writers?,"God sits at the right hand of Robert Anson Heinlein, and Spider Robinson is his prophet.

Heinlein did something that was rather new in sci-fi at the time. He wrote “contemporary” science fiction. That is, apart from the notable example of Starship Troopers, Heinlein for the most part did not bother to explain how everything worked. He assumed his readers were smart enough to either figure it out, or realize that the how didn’t matter so much as the what.

In Beyond this Horizon, Heinlein wrote “the door dilated” without ever explaining just what that meant. It didn’t matter. The door was closed, now it’s open, and clearly it opens by a different mechanism that we are accustomed to, but that doesn’t matter so much because the status of the door is more important than how it works.

This is because Heinlein was more interested in how new technologies or gadgets affected people, rather than how the gee-wiz gizmos worked themselves. Certainly he didn’t ignore technical details, he was an engineer. But he didn’t wag on about them for their sake alone. It always came back to how it affected the characters and plot. For example, in Starship Troopers he didn’t explain how radar, radio, or infrared snoopers worked, or even exactly how the “musculature” of the Maurauder suits worked, but he did describe the command and control systems of the Marauder suits. But even then, while he was clearly excited about how such a machine was controlled, the reason to explain the functioning was so that you could appreciate how easy it made for the person to operate the suit and maintain battlefield awareness. It wasn’t techno-detail for its sake alone.

Most other sci-fi of the era focused on various technological developments, and the characters served to showcase the doo-dad. As much as I love Asimov’s robot stories, the humans exist mostly to explain and show off his robots. In his Foundation series, people exist mainly to showcase Hari Seldon’s psychohistory. And they’re genuinely fascinating ideas!

But Heinlein focused on how those ideas affected people.

Furthermore, his “juveniles” were not like kids stories of the era either. They featured juvenile protagonists, sure, but they dealt with adult problems. Heinlein treated children like adults-in-training, and didn’t talk down to them in his works intended for them. The only real difference I can find between his adult works and his juveniles is the protagonists age and no sex.

Of course, it should be fairly obvious at this point that Heinlein is my favorite author.

Ojas Patil,Updated 10y,"Why do people who love reading, love it so much?","Let me take two lines from a very famous book that we have all probably heard of – Harry Potter

Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds.

Let us assume for the sake of this argument that I haven’t come across these lines ever in my life. When I begin to read this paragraph, the following things take place in my head almost simultaneously:
First, I envision a huge castle. Something along the lines of this –

This seems sufficiently large in my head without being overwhelmingly huge or something so minuscule it would resemble a hut rather than a castle. It is of a form and shape factor I like and this is the image I would sketch in my mind.

BOOM, my mind darts inside the castle. I am looking out from inside the castle window, my nose pressed against the glass. All I see is droplets of water. All I hear is the sound of thunder cutting through the silence like a knife. I dart outside to see the castle, but now with rain all over -

The lakes swelled and the flower beds turned into muddy streams. So the castle seems to be at the side of a lake. Add some stormy skies to the picture et voila!



Cue to the inside of the castle once again, where I see a muddy garden in front of me -


Filled with huge pumpkins!




The dog gives some perspective and merit to the enormity of my poorly photo-shopped pumpkins.

The point I am trying to make from my poorly shopped work is that a mere two sentences is capable of generating such vivid imagery in my mind. Television and movies are bound by various limitations; the primary of which is constraint of time. When you read books, you are truly transported to another world, and the only constraint is the constraint of your imagination. A book can be compared to a blank coloring book, which your mind fills in! You construct the world the way YOU want it. The scene will have a thunderstorm, a castle and a lake. But my thunderstorm, castle and lake will likely be infinitely different from yours. This is one of the reasons I hate watching TV/movie adaptations of books before reading them. When you watch a movie or a TV show every single thing ranging broadly from the characters and the locations to the small little things like the walking style of a certain character is imprinted in your mind. So when you read the book, the movie will play in your mind. If you do the opposite though, you first form your own universe when you read a book, and then compare it to the universe thought up by the producers. Isn't that so much better?

By reading books you can be Superman rescuing Lois Lane from danger, Sherlock Holmes solving a crime on a cold winter night, or Gatsby throwing an elaborate dinner party in his mansion! Like I said, the only constraint is the constraint of your imagination (and the contents of the book of-course You could not possibly put Romeo and Juliet in the picturesque setting of Mordor. Well you COULD, but it would be highly counterproductive. )

Sharmila Thaj,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"He Scored only an average mark of 750 in his 12th Board Exam. But he was awarded as a ‘Young Scientist’ by NASA! (These Headings in the News paper attracts me towards the best read today)

World’s lightest and smallest Satellite.

Mohammed Rifath Sharukh, a 17 year old young scientist made the World’s Lightest and Smallest Satellite!
Pallapatti born, Karur district; Tamilnadu.
NASA organised a competition. Over 8000 students from 57 countries participated. He was the only Indian who was selected among the 80 final selections.

About his Satellite:

He named the Satellite ‘ KALAM SAT’ in memory of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul kalam.
It weighs only 64 grams.(0.1 kg and 3.8 cm in size)
“Space Kidz India” supported him.
It was a complete Indian made Satellite.
Uses:
It will be used to detect the radiation in Space, and the changes in the atmosphere.
It will stay only 240 minutes in space, then it will automatically fall in to the specified ocean. Finally, it will be taken out for research.
Launch:
On June 22nd, 2017 it will be launched through the SRK Rocket.
If they launch successfully, then it will be used for Agriculture and Weather Monitoring.
I wondered when I saw Mohammed Sharukh’s 12th Board Exam Mark Details:
In Mathematics: 92/200.
In Physics: 89/200(Practical Mark: 50)

(For the rest, he wrote only for 39 marks in theory! (Less than my marks!))

He is one of the inspirations to the Students, who scored average marks in their Board Exams.
For Parents: Marks don’t determine your Children, who they are. Every Child is born with talents.

This will be the first time Indian student’s experiment will be flown by NASA.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,4y,What is the most life changing book you've ever read?,"I don’t write in “self improvement” topic, but there is a first for everything. Two of my favorite books that I read together are: “How to get whatever you want” and “Think and Grow Rich”. I read these as a 17 year old and they were phenomenal. I tried to apply a lot of it during that time and had quite a bit of fortune implementing them. How to Get Whatever You Want
 and Think and Grow Rich
.

The key concepts like “just show up” and “just ask” —are so simple and yet so powerful.

I will give you examples of how I used it.

I was in my second year of college when we had the annual programming contest to select the top team to go to the prestigious ACM ICPC. I was preparing for the contest since the time I joined college. I led a team that was short of 1 person [he had to leave another contest in the last minute] and we tied up for the top slot. The other team were one year senior to us and the college gave them the slot to go to the Asia regionals in IIT Kanpur. I didn’t like the idea of seniority just used to break the tie.

I would have given up if not for that crazy book above. I just explored for sometime the other alternatives in the days before social media and found an Asia regionals happened in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I just found out the organiser’s number and called him out of the blue [when it cost over $1/min for the international call from a public booth and I had very little money]. I convinced him to take our team from India. I went through all the rules and he could not find any hole in my argument. He was more amused by the strange request from a teenager from abroad and okayed my proposal.

And then came the task of convincing my teammates that Bangladesh was a safe country to go to. We had a trip of our lifetimes taking a 3.5 day travel one way from the southern part of India to Bangladesh over 2 trains and a bus. It was an amazing experience interacting with everyone there and although we could not make it to the world finals we got home with a honorable mention for being in the top 10%. I should have tried the following 2 years too, but somehow never participated [and of course I regret that now for not showing up].

From sitting in a small town in the middle of nowhere in a day without all the information revolution to getting there was a big win for me.

Two months later I did an even crazier thing. I was in New Delhi attending a college competition. I got a strange idea to walk up to the Rashtrapati Bhavan [President’s palace] to get a meeting with the President of the largest democracy. In an another time I would not have done that, but I was crazy in the power of asking. It could not harm, right?

I just showed up and asked. The secretary thought it was funny that a teenager was walking up to get an appointment with the President of India. She still passed up my request to President’s PA. A day later my relative got the call that the President wanted to talk to me. He was genuinely curious about a teenager who came all the way from the southern part of India and had gumption to write to him.

That led to the greatest day in my life: Why is Abdul Kalam widely loved and respected by everyone? — where I got a 40 minute one-on-one with the President and got another such meeting just 6 months later.

A year later I was applying for grad school. I got an admission, but without a scholarship. I called up a professor and explained the situation. He not only gave the scholarship that enabled me to go to gradschool, but someone who is still in touch with me after so many year.

I applied the same principles to a lot of smaller successes too — from getting airline seats upgraded to getting into contests. Once I was in Linuxcon where there was a Linux quiz & raffle. I answered the quiz and they asked us to come for a raffle in the afternoon. I usually don’t go for this and thought there will be a big crowd. When I showed up there was just 1 other guy and I had a 50% chance of winning. And winning I did of a good laptop that I immediately sold on eBay. All I had to do was just show up. Another time I saw a startup competition going on. I was in for an another event and asked if I could pitch. The qualifiers were already over a long time ago, but they still let me pitch in the finals. I strangely won the pitch prize for someone who knew about the contest only 30 min before.

After I graduated from college, I failed to use many of the principles as I grew to think that “self improvement” stuff is just icky. That means that I also went back to my old ways of being too shy to ask for stuff and thus went on a period of plateau with no major success in life. Now putting those principles back to motion. If you aim for the right thing, be reasonable, persistent and show up everytime you could very likely get that thing.

We often think of success as a cut throat race where you race against thousands. Often what I found was success was a race where only a handful even show up — others are either lazy, unaware or too shy to even ask to get in. Winning often happen in contests that most don’t even know exists.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/iyago2w6j9mtxq7f', 'title': ""What is the most life changing book you've ever read?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9011, 'ai': 0.0989}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I don’t write in “self improvement” topic, but there is a first for everything.

Mayur Tasre,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Do you know who the man is in the photo below?

By his appearance, you must be thinking that he might be a boy from lower middle class family, working in a bakery to earn money and support his family.

But no, that's not the truth.

He is Dhravya Dholakia[1], son of a billionaire Savji Dholakia.[2]

Surat diamond magnate Savji Dholakia caught the world’s attention two years ago when he rewarded 1200 employees with apartments and cars as Diwali bonus.[3]

For teaching his son how challenging life is, he decided to ask his son Dhravya Dholakia to go to an unfamiliar place and earn livelihood through odd work.

Dhravya Dholakia(21) who is studying Business management in US, came to India on summer holidays to enjoy with family.

Dhravya Dholakia accepted his father's challenge and left for Kochi with Rs 7000, a pair of clothes and nothing else.

Condition of his challenge

First Dharvya needed to find some work but wherever he joins, he should not stay there for more than a week.
He should not use his father’s identity
He should not use those Rs 7000 until an emergency.

Dhravya accepted the challenge and went to Kochi where Hindi would not help him.

Difficulties he faced

For 5 days, Dhravya did not have any proper place to stay nor did he have any job. He was rejected from 60 places, he lied that he was from a very poor family and wanted to earn money to help his family. At last he got a job in a bakery. He kept switching jobs. Do you know how much he earned? He earned Rs 4000.

Dhravya Dholakia said

I never worried about money and here I was struggling to get a one time meal worth Rs 40 and I needed another Rs 250 per day to stay in a lodge.

What do you think? Isn't that great? Isn't it a good lesson for life?

Every father (whether from rich or middle class family) should do this experiment with his son/daughter to teach them true values of life.

Thanks

Veronica Anzaldua,4y,Why are Judy Blume books so controversial?,"Judy Blume has written many good books over the years, but I’ll highlight just a few of them and the reasons for their being challenged or banned:

Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret

Blume’s 1970 classic centers on Margaret Simon and the ups and downs she deals with as she approaches adolescence. Among other things, she crushes on a cute boy in her class, begins wearing a bra, and, more than anything, longs to get her first period. What’s more, she has a close relationship with God (hence, the title), though she doesn’t have any religious affiliation due to her parents’ interfaith marriage and the problems they had with Margaret’s grandparents because of it. This book has been popular with girls since its publication, but it has run into problems with censorship due its focus on Margaret’s preoccupation with menstruation and sexual development, not to mention her lack of religious affiliation
. I’ve read the book myself—and own a copy—but some people just can’t handle characters who actually think about their own reproductive development and/or don’t belong to any organized religion. Oh, well.

Forever

Judy’s book focusing on the sexual relationship between its protagonists, Katherine and Michael, has drawn heat for the frank depictions of sex.
 And of course, the characters have sex more than once. The book, actually, can teach us something valuable about relationships. For me, it told me something about relationships and love—and the relationship between the two. But, like the aforementioned Margaret, some people just can’t handle sex. Sigh. . .

Blubber

Probably more than the other two books, this book hits very close to home (especially for me) due to its subject: bullying. This work from 1974 centers on the bullying of a fifth grade girl. Nicknamed Blubber because of a report she gives on whales and her weight, Linda becomes the target of a select group of girls, as well as others in her class. Told from the viewpoint of one of the bullies, Jill Brenner, Blubber shows the painful abuse Linda is subjected to. Like Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret and Forever. . ., Blubber also has been challenged because of the abuse Linda’s classmates inflict on her and the profanity of some of the characters
. Having been subjected to bullying as a youngster, I can understand some of the reasons for not liking this book. For that reason, I would not read it again—just too painful. But that’s no excuse for banning it. It needs to be read and in fact, it could play a role in helping to address real-life bullying.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3tyepj0vhubw8rag', 'title': 'Why are Judy Blume books so controversial?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Judy Blume has written many good books over the years, but I’ll highlight just a few of them and the reasons for their being challenged or banned:\n\nAre You There, God?

Alex Johnston,Oct 27,"What is the densest short book you have come across? For example, I think Machiavelli's The Prince contains more in 100 pages than many do at a thousand.","That would be a very short book of poetry by the French poet, novelist, editor and general man of letters and numbers, Raymond Queneau.

Raymond Queneau at his usual slight angle to the rest of the universe.

Queneau (1903–1976) was perhaps best known for his 1959 novel Zazie in the Metro, which was made into a 1960 movie by Louis Malle.

The central irony of the novel is that the titular character, Zazie, spends the entire book on her first journey to Paris, in which the only thing she wants to do is travel on the Metro, but she never actually manages to—except at the end of the book, by which time she’s fallen asleep and doesn’t notice. Queneau’s original novel is a good deal more original and more strange than Malle’s irritatingly wacky movie.

Queneau wrote quite a few novels, as well as the unclassifiable 1947 Exercises in Style in which he exhaustively recounted the same trivial anecdote in 99 different ways, but I think his real genius is in his poetry. He liked popular culture, and some of his poems, such as ‘Si tu t’imagines’, became cabaret songs. He was a wonderful poet about city life: Courir les rues, available in English as Hitting the Streets, is a great, warm, life-affirming book. Not a lot of the rest of his poetry has been translated into English, unfortunately.

In 1961, he published the subject of this answer: a collection of ten sonnets entitled One Hundred Thousand Billion Poems.

If it’s only got ten poems in it, why the title?

Well, Queneau deliberately wrote it so that after reading the first line of one of the poems, you could read the second line of one of the other ones, followed by the third line of another one, etc., and it would make just as much sense, and would still rhyme.

This means that, because each poem has 14 lines, there are 
10
14
1014
 or 100,000,000,000,000 ways of reading the book. Queneau calculated that if you spent 45 seconds reading each possible sonnet and allowed 15 seconds for page turning, and you didn’t do anything else with your time but read 24 hours a day, it would take you 190,258,751 years to read every possible sonnet and, therefore, ‘finish’ the book.

Here’s the first poem laid out on the page in such a way that you can keep track of what line you’re on (photo deliberately fuzzy so as to ward off copyright issues):

Queneau thought that the reader could slit the pages so that they could form their own poems, like those kids’ books where you can assemble imaginary animals out of parts of other animals.

He was also a founding member of the great literary collective/project OuLiPo
, and is the dedicatee of one of the greatest 20th century novels, Life A User’s Manual, by his friend and fan Georges Perec.

Jean-Marie Valheur,2y,Who is your favorite historical “mad lad”?,"That would be Russia’s Peter the Great. Picture, if you will, a man. He is a strapping fellow. Head full of wavy dark hair, a curly moustache like Dali or Poirot. Sharply dressed, immensely powerful and tall to the point of hitting his head repeatedly on door frames and ceilings — the Tsar stood at 6′8″ which was absolutely magnificent and quite unusual in his day and age.

Now Peter, in spite of his incredibly striking appearance, had a tendency for going undercover. He did this even before he officially assumed full power — he’d put on the clothes of a peasant, have a shave, cut or hide his glorious locks and make himself look rather filthy. He’d then mingle with the common folk in remote corners of his empire where they had never laid eyes on their ruler, and pretend to be one of them. It seems like a foolish thing to do, but apparantly it the man actually, by some miracle, pulled it off.

At some point, Peter wants to know how ships are built. He wants the very finest designs for his Russian fleet. So he looks around, asks his advisors… where do they build the finest ships? In his day and age, it was the Dutch who built the finest ships, they tell the young prince. So what does this absolute madlad do? He ditches his entourage, travels undercover to the Low Countries and… applies for a ship wharf!

Peter is shaven. His hair dyed, his clothes those of a poor man. Many immigrant workers are employed by the Dutch companies, and when they see the massive lad applying for a job, they only need to look at his 6′8″ frame once to see this fellow has ‘what it takes’. So they hire Peter. And he does the work of five men, easily. As he carries heavy pieces of wood, hammers to his heart’s content and works his fingers to the bone, he takes mental notes of everything. Where does this piece go, how is the hull shaped, where does the mast go and how thick is it? He wants to know it all. And he has an amazing, almost photogenic memory.

Young Peter works as a part of the building crew on a Dutch vessel for months. Amazingly, the huge Russian immigrant goes undetected. He slips away as easily as he slipped in, hurries home and gives his builders instructions on how to build the fine fleet he had envisioned… Like a boss!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/i01kwoet72dzan4s', 'title': 'Who is your favorite historical “mad lad”?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'That would be Russia’s Peter the Great.

Allen Lobo,5y,What are the biggest lies that society tells us?,"“Don’t settle for anything less. Stick to your standards and you will finally meet that person who you deserve! You deserve nothing less than the best!”

Yeah well, I’d like to give some folks a red pill of cold reality. Because I’ve seen this story play out more times than I could care to count in the many big U.S. cities where I’ve lived.

As I like to say to both men and women when they tell me of the fantastic expectations they have of potential partners -

“Look at what you have to offer first, before you draw up your long list of expectations, let alone demands.”

You’ll see this play out time and again in large cities where you have what I like to call the “illusion of access”.

What I mean by that term is that in a city like New York, you have incredibly rich men and very beautiful women. So an inordinate number of other men and women think “Why should I settle for any less, huh?”

I’ve met women who say that “all they want” in a partner is a handsome guy who makes at least $250–300k a year, is highly educated, super smart, has a great sense of humor, can cook decently and is a great dancer.

That’s all? Wow, you REALLY need to elevate your standards lady! You left out some basic must-haves in any romantic partner like “must be a fire-eater”, “can kill a tiger while eating a sandwich with one hand” and “can sing like Pavarotti”.

Note, these aren’t women who are drop dead gorgeous neurosurgeons or theoretical physicists or something. Regular plain Janes looking high and low for that elusive Mr. Universe.

Likewise I’ve known regular guys who have beautiful loving girlfriends who will ask me “I sometimes wonder whether I could have done better?

“No you COULD NOT HAVE, you effing moron! In cold terms she is more desirable than you. By far. And she loves you. Rule #1 - When you got a good thing going, don't fuck with it.” (yeah I've actually had to say that in the past).

They’ll wait and wait for that perfect person because well I mean, look at sitcoms like Sex and the City. Shit worked out there, no? And of course we all know that TV sitcoms superbly simulate the way real life works!

Then they get to an age when they start to panic wholesale. Oh what will I do now!

Well kid, you kept waiting endlessly for that perfect person to come along and guess what? S/he did, and walked right past you.

Set your expectations realistically.

This does not mean for a moment that you jump into a relationship or marriage with the first Joe or Jane who comes around the block.

But please have a clear-headed assessment of yourself and what YOU bring to the table.

Sorry, I sound hard and cold here but it had to be said.

Because your friends in all good intention will keep telling you to stick to your guns, not lower your standards, you “deserve the best and nothing less.” Note once again that by “best” here I mean in cold objective terms like income, looks, education level etc…… not in such things as that person sincerely loving you (that one is a basic must-have).

Well no, the best things are so valued precisely because they are scarce.

You don’t go looking for a job and say

“Must not be more than 20 hours a week, ten weeks annual vacation, must pay at least five million dollars!…. I mean look at all those multi-millionaires… why should I settle for less??”

Set sensible and realistic standards, find someone who meets them and who wants to spend their life with you, and you’ll stand a much better chance of finding happiness both in love and in life.

Otherwise stick to your guns for long enough and they’re all you will have left in the end.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/efzw1rcmivo07xuy', 'title': 'What are the biggest lies that society tells us?', 'score': {'original': 0.92465, 'ai': 0.07535}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""“Don’t settle for anything less.

I mean look at all those multi-millionaires… why should I settle for less??”\n\nSet sensible and realistic standards, find someone who meets them and who wants to spend their life with you, and you’ll stand a much better chance of finding happiness both in love and in life.\n\nOtherwise stick to your guns for long enough and they’re all you will have left in the end."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.92465
Abhishek Dutt,3y,What tweets are worth reading?,"Read this:-

26.11.2008 is one of the darkest days in the Indian history. Ten terrorists from the terror group Laskar-e-Taiba carried out a series of shooting and bombing attacks for four days killing 164 people and injuring over 300.

In my opinion, I believe there are more people/parties were involved in 26/11 attack .

They planned for Hindu terrorism and then a book of 26/11 RSS ki Sazish and all.
Congress started the term Hindu terrorism a while ago from 26/11 attack.
I feel India’s people/party were involved in attack.

One can't thank Tukaram Omble enough for

• laying down his life

• catching Kasab alive

• fighting AK 47 with a lathi.

Thank you brave man, Tukaram Omble ji.

We Indians can't thank you enough for catching Ajmal Kasab alive

Had it not been for him, the fake 'Hindu Atankwad' theory would have been an international reality now. Diggy was all ready with books n press conference.

He changed all the script written by Lutyens and their pet news channels in a few minutes.

May his Soul attain Moksha.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1uhi2lyz3t6vs9cw', 'title': 'What tweets are worth reading?', 'score': {'original': 0.9981, 'ai': 0.0019}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Read this:-\n\n26.11.2008 is one of the darkest days in the Indian history.

Abhigyan Biswas,Updated 6y,What is the best thing you read today?,"Do you know this girl?

She is Ummul Kher, AIR 420 , UPSC exams.

She has been suffering from fragile bone disorder from her birth which has made her disabled.

Being a good student she always wanted to study despite her odds. For this she needed a constant support system. And for such person who it can be better than her parents.

But unfortunately she wasn't lucky. Her parents who lived in the slums of Old Delhi didn't want to spend on her education after class 8, but she was determined to study further.

She was given two options .. Either listen to her parents or leave the house at the age of 12.

She chose the 2nd option .

Leaving everything behind, she had to leave her home and start a new life in a jhopparpatti (slum type house) without any support. To fund her school fees she used to take tuitions from 3 pm to 11 pm and earn around 50–100 rupees from the slum children. She passed her 12th with an excellent 91%.

After that she joined Gargi college and continued to fund her education through tuitions and the prize money she won through college debates.

In 2012, she met a small accident and was confined to a wheelchair for a year due to her bone disorder.

After graduation , she cracked the entrance exams of JNU for Masters of International studies. She was getting a scholarship of Rs 25000 which meant she didn't have to take tuitions. And after so much hardwork she cleared her UPSC exams under disability quota.

Despite all these sufferings she didn't have any complaint against her parents and she believed that it was the situation which forced them to take this decision..

While many of us who aren't disabled get exhausted after some hardwork and there is this girl who defied all odds and made us believe in determination and hardwork.

Where there is a will there is a way…

Respects to you ma'am...

Cheers!!!

John Sierra,Nov 16,How does the 1978 animated version of Lord Of The Rings by Ralph Bakshi hold up compared to the books and was it well liked or hated?,"I just watched it again not long ago, along with some friends, so I’ll give my thoughts.

A friend of mine hosts screenings of films quite often, including regular Friday Night Movies that I regularly attend as we are both cinephiles. When she mentioned to me that she was planning on doing The Lord of the Rings, I was quite excited, especially as there would be people present that had never seen it, and as this is an online virtual watch-party with a chatroom, I could prattle on to my heart’s content without disturbing anyone’s enjoyment of the films.

We watched the extended versions of the Peter Jackson film over a period of 3 weeks, and then for the fourth Friday of “Rings Month” we watched the Ralph Bakshi film. I can tell you that it is a very enjoyalbe film on a few levels - it is in some ways closer to the book than Peter Jackson’s film in some very specific ways, the animation is captivating and it is clearly a labor of love. It is also a gigantic mess.

Everything after Frodo leaves the shire is a hurried mess - even before that there were issues, such as Gandalf asking Frodo if he sees any writing on the ring, and then never showing the writing from the fire. Aragorn shows his broken sword in Bree, and it’s in one piece after Rivendell, but the reforging of the blade is completely skipped. Saruman’s name was considered too close to Sauron so they changed it to Aruman, but at several points they slip up and call him Saruman. Some scenes are not animated, but life action with a filter over it to make it look animated.

All of these issues were to squeeze everything from Frodo starting his quest to the victory at Helm’s Deep into a single 138 minute film. Some of the character designs are strange, especially Boromir as a Viking-esque man, Gimli being bald and whatever the hell is up with Sam’s face. And it’s unfinished with no sequel other than the TV special made out of The Return ...

Sahil Juneja,Updated 8y,Should I read the Harry Potter series considering the fact that I have already seen the movies numerous times?,"Let's see.

Do you know what color Harry's eyes really are and why they are important?
Do you know all the Weasley kids?
Do you know who Peeves is?
Do you really know and understand why Snape mistreated Neville so much? Did you even notice that Snape mistreated Neville more than others?
Do you know what an animagus is?
Do you know and understand Voldemort's history?
Do you know what happens to Peter Pettigrew in the end and why?
Do you know who are all the Marauder's?
Do you know who was the Half-Blood Prince and why he was called so?
Do you know who Squibs are?
Do you know why Rita Skeeter's character is important and where it was important?

Do you know the history behind Lupin and Tonks? How they ended up getting married? Do you know who Teddy is?

Do you know who Barty Crouch Jr. is and what his backstory is? Do you know who Winky is?
Do you know what happens to Harry's wand in the end?
Do you know why the following scene is the complete opposite of the entire series storyline?





It's quite simple.
Do you care to know about the above? I have not even skimmed half of the things you have missed out because of not reading the books.

If you have seen the movies numerous times, I would assume you liked them.

If you really did like them then I would assume you were fascinated by the story and the entire wizarding world as well.

If you were fascinated by the story and that world then I would assume you have questions regarding few things like some of the questions above.

This is the point which makes it ""simple"" for you.

Do not judge a book by its movie!


If you really have questions, then yes, you should read the books. You won't appreciate the story otherwise and you surely wouldn't think the movies are good enough. It's a rule of thumb for almost any scenario - The original books are better than the movie adaptations. Those questions are answered in the books. You would understand and appreciate the characters much much better than the movies.

If you don't have any questions, then you don't really care about the story, the fantasy world, the magic behind it all. You don't have to bother reading the books. But remember the following -


The above represents how much you will lose out on by not reading the books.
