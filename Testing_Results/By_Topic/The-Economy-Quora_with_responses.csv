Subith,Updated 4y,What should Kerala do to improve its economy?,"The Chinese once said “If you want to get rich, build roads first”
. To present to you the abysmal condition of roads in Kerala, I am sharing the screenshot of the time taken to travel between two major cities of Kerala on the left hand side and on the right hand side the time taken to cover the same distance in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu.

It’s a whopping extra 6 hours taken to travel 460 kms on Kerala roads. That’s almost double the time taken to drive the same distance in Tamil Nadu, or Karnataka or most other states in India. The worst part is, such a pathetic route has tolls. Some parts of the highway don’t have a divider and is highly unsafe. Processions by political parties or religious ones are quite a common sight on these highways and so are traffic jams.

If Kerala needs to improve its economy, it needs to build world class roads first. Or at least we should match the high standards set by Tamil Nadu roads. The 200 kms drive between the two biggest cities Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram should be possible in 2.5 hours instead of 5 hours.

Only if such road infrastructure exists, manufacturing can flourish. At present Kerala depends solely on agriculture, services, tourism and foreign remittances. But to become a major economic power, you need manufacturing and such industries need top class roads for reducing the logistic cost and time. The port of Kochi or the upcoming Vizhinjam port cannot run at its maximum capacity without good roads connecting to it.

I have always envisioned a North-South expressway for my state. Kerala’s geography is in such a way that it simply needs a 500-600 km long non-stop expressway to connect majority of the tier 1, 2 and 3 cities. The expressway needs to be 3 lanes minimum in one direction. The speed limit should be no less than 100–120 kmph. There shouldn’t be any traffic signals. Rather there should be entry and exit lanes from/to the cities on the way so that ongoing vehicles are not slowed down by entering or exiting traffic.

The expressway should ideally run closer to the west coast of Kerala since that region is fairly flat and majority of the cities, airports, sea ports and population exist in the western half of Kerala. There should be perpendicular extensions from this expressway to the eastern regions like Sabarimala, Idukki, Wayanad and Palakkad.

The Government in fact had a similar plan
 in the 2003. But there were several protests 
(as usual with any projects in Kerala). Some of the arguments against the project were silly and stupid. For example, the expressway would turn out to be a “great wall” and divide the state into two halves. These people clearly don’t have any idea what an expressway would look like and how people (and vehicles) go from one side of the expressway to the other. Such politicians and activists were always a curse to the state by stalling some excellent ideas and projects in the state. Had this project materialized at that time, Kerala wouldn’t be facing the terrible transportation woes in 2019 which worsens every year due to the increase in the number of vehicles and deteriorating roads.

I recently came to know that an utterly stupid project is in fact approved - Kerala Hill Highway
 along the eastern half of the state. Firstly, the eastern Kerala is sparsely populated compared to west. Secondly, the fragile Western Ghats will have a huge impact due to this. This region is also prone to landslides and it’s risky business to disturb the ghats. Thirdly, however great the construction is going to be, you cannot drive at 100km/h on the hilly terrain which makes the purpose of a highway useless. If the idea is to connect the residents of east Kerala, then as I illustrated above, a west coast highway with extension to eastern towns is a better approach.

None of the governments that come and go in Kerala has ever shown the political will to make a manufacturing base in Kerala and improve the highways. Worst part is the citizens of the state are happy with the present condition. We know what the problem is. We use the best of our analytical skills, judgmental abilities, do extensive research to prove that no development can work out in our state since ours is unique compared to other states in India. But I have hardly come across someone who proactively spent time researching and finding out a solution to our problems rather than showcasing how things don’t work in the “unique” state of Kerala. The state has already done good strides in the field of education and healthcare. More number of people have come out of poverty. Living standards are better. Now is the time to shift gears rather and being complacent with the present glory.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/04erdwiz2c1ab73x', 'title': 'What should Kerala do to improve its economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.87165, 'ai': 0.12835}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The Chinese once said “If you want to get rich, build roads first”\n.

Kunal Rahar,Updated 6y,What can we learn from Raghuram Rajan?,"It was during his initial days of joining RBI as the Governor. He was being interviewed by press , when one of the reporters asked him a question in Hindi. Now Governor Rajan, as a Tamilian having spent most of his life abroad, was not well conversant with Hindi. So, all he could say to the reporter then was that, he could understand the question but was unable to answer in Hindi. So, for the moment he would answer it in English but he promised that he would learn Hindi soon.

The very next day he asked an officer from the Rajbhasha division to teach him Hindi for at least an hour every week. Well, the rest as they say is history. Today the Governor gives interviews at length in pure Hindi, except for a word or two in economic jargon which he finds tough to recall at that very moment.

What can we learn from him ? It's the perpetual zeal to learn something new, no matter what your age is.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kgvmr8lbao6zun37', 'title': 'What can we learn from Raghuram Rajan?', 'score': {'original': 0.9986, 'ai': 0.0014}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""It was during his initial days of joining RBI as the Governor.

Jean-Marie Valheur,Feb 15,What are some of the best hoaxes of all time?,"This is a hoax I, myself, fell for. Everyone did, at the time. See there’s this lady, Sacheen Littlefeather. She died in 2022. Her biggest claim to fame was being a Native American rights activist. In 1974, she refused an Oscar for Best Actor, on behalf of Marlon Brando.

She did this to “raise awareness for the plight of Native Americans”. It caused a huge uproar, and it was enormously controversial at the time. Incredibly effective activism, too. Anyway the lady died and her sisters — last name Cruz — came out and said she had been lying, misrepresenting her heritage.[1] Born Maria Louise Cruz, “Littlefeather” was the daughter of a Mexican immigrant and a white mother of French, German and Dutch heritage.

Sacheen Littlefeather has ZERO association with any Native American tribes. Her whole identity was as fake as the name she adopted for herself. She was, for all intents and purposes, the Rachel Dolezal of Native American activism. And for over fifty years… most bought it. Hell, in 2022 the Oscars even came out with an “official apology”.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,4y,Is the rule of the BJP good for the Indian economy?,"In terms of economy BJP has increasingly turned socialist and has thus become an average — like the previous governments, rather than hitting the ball out of the park. The first budget of Modi 2.0 has been quite disappointing. While their social schemes have been quite good, these welfare schemes have to be paid by the large businesses. And the government has not been paying attention to them.

I get that we need to build toilets and give out LPG cylinders. But, is that an excuse for not speeding up the economic reforms and unlock key investments? When are we going to bring key major foreign investments in retail, aviation, agriculture and other key sectors?

With the opposition decimated, this is the best time to bring bold new reforms. I expected the victorious Modi in second term to bring out the long awaited reforms that unshackled China in the 1980s. It is one thing to engage in welfare politics before the elections, but now that it is won and no major state elections are near, what is the excuse for going slow?

There has not been big bang reforms and economic reforms are getting as bad as past Congress governments. Even basic things like selling Air India and BSNL is taking far too long.

The NPA mess that UPA 1 created are yet to be cleaned off. There is no nationwide urgency to clean the banks and no public recognition of the dire crisis.

There are no big reforms in land and labour — two chains that shackle Indian businesses. There is no big push for exports — although we make in India, we have never seen any benefit to that. There are no new cities built — the smart cities have neither been smart nor been cities.

We expected the former Gujarat CM to replicate his magic at the centre. Rather it is increasingly looking like Congress [just more efficient & less corrupt] — more on welfare politics and less on capitalism.

Let Amit Shah keep working on his realpolitik, but Modi needs to come out and go big bang on issues of real substance. That is the only way to make history.

If you are hitting singles when the asking rate needs boundaries, public is going to be angered. Both in cricket and politics, our idols are not going to be spared. If you don’t take right kind of risks at the right time, you risk losing everything. Just as Dhoni [who cleared the team of old timers when he took over] found out, BJP has to realise that the same forces that sent them up, can also bring them down. Ultimately most of us BJP supporters are more loyal to the country than to the party and will have to make hard choices if things don’t improve soon.

It is not a sin being a suit boot sarkar and unleash the pent up market forces.

Misha Firer,8mo,What made the Soviet Union's economy become unsuccessful?,"I will use Soviet animated cartoon series “Three from Prostokvashino “(1978), “Vacation in Prostokvashnio (1980), and “Winter in Prostokvashino” (1984) - then no more sequels because country kaput and bankrupt - in order to illustrate what was wrong with Soviet economy and why unsuccessful.

In classic story, boy meets anthropomorphic pets and they argue all the time, is Uncle Feyodor and his sidekicks, Cat and Dog.

Such nicknamed for he’s an independent Moscow boy, you turn around and Bob’s your uncle, he’s gone. Extra kudos for his support of Ukraine. Boy comes downstairs from his apartment to make friends with Cat dressed in prison stripy pajamas.

Cat is miserable and down from hard knocks life in the Soviet Union. From window, you see it’s at least the 5th floor but there’s no elevator.

Boy chomps down snack rich in carbohydrates. Throughout cartoons it’s pretty much the only food characters eat.

The Boy’s parents return to apartment after shopping. Mom’s eyewear, Dad’s smart beard, and intelligent faces mean they’re highly educated and do white-collar work in the capital. And yet they can’t afford to buy lots of items at the store or perhaps because there aren’t many available - just look at the pathetic size of their bags.

Dad empties the contents of skinny shopping bag on the oval-shaped table. He super proud that he can just pop into Magazin and buy bottled full-fat dairy product and swill it with a loaf of bread. He also got canned meat. And that’s it. Yay, that’s what you studied five years in university for!

Meanwhile in decadent America, in the same year of lord 1978, Elvis Costello stands by the shelves filled with a wide variety of food items at Americansky supermarket. If Uncle Feodor’s Mom and Dad visited this supermarket with Elvis Costello I guarantee you they would ask for political asylum.

Mom came from work and did not change her clothes the first thing she does she put on an apron and goes directly to the kitchen to cook for the family. No microwave to make quick dishes or pizza takeouts.

Next Boy and Cat decide to spend summer in the countryside.

See what communists did here - villages with no modern amenities like sewerage and central heating were abandoned, and condo apartments with modern amenities for workers were built.

In America, white collar population is lured from urban centers to suburbs by offerings of family houses connected to modern amenities. More development like roads, more nicer to live for people and immigrants come from all over world and work hard.

Who want come to Soviet Union to live in apartment without elevator, and eat bread with milk?

Boy and Cat meet Dog. Dog is a good-natured peasant. Together they move into an abandoned house residents have deserted to live in a condo apartment, and effectively become squatters. And yet, look at their gleaming faces and how hard they work sweeping floors when they know it’s their private property! Even Cat smile.

They got a place to live but being make belief organic creatures they gotta eat. What do Soviets eat? You know the answer already - bread and milk. Bread they got but no milk.

Here’s a conversation they have to figure out how to solve the food problem within the framework of the centrally planned economy.

CAT (worldly): I want milk. And to have milk you need a cow. And we don’t have money to buy a cow.

DOG (naively): We borrow money from the neighbors.

CAT: And how do we pay them back?

DOG (speaking about barter): With milk.

CAT: If we pay with milk what do we need a cow for?

DOG: We can get money if we sell something that nobody needs.

BOY: To sell something nobody needs, first you need to buy something that nobody needs. And we don’t have the money.

CAT (to DOG): Let’s sell you, Sharik.

BOY: We won’t sell anyone. We’ll go look for treasure!

Notice that there’s no bank to take a loan from to buy a cow. They also have no idea that they can raise money to buy the cow, and then sell milk to pay back the debt and then supply their milk demands.

The two viable solutions they managed to come up with are anthropomorphic pet trafficking and stealing - to take money from someone and never give any of it back because once they spend it on a cow, the cow becomes a liability, and never an asset!

This is why Putin’s system is entirely based on THEFT and CORRUPTION. Putin and his cronies were raised and grew up in this zero-sum game commie system where there were no banks, no investment, no credit, and no private property (unless you be a squatter).

They were and still are freaking communists!! You either stole from the state or like in the case of Yevgeny Prigozhin from private citizens and that’s how you became richer, and they just kept doing it when got into power.

Westerners have scratched their heads failing to figure out what Z, the symbol of Putin’s special military operation, actually means. It is not a letter! Z is the conventional shape of the planks that support board door frame.

It took Mom two years to rebel against everyday cooking duties. “I feel like a serf!”

Memories of my mother are exactly the same - she worked two jobs, as an engineer (she sucked at engineering) and sewed clothes for private clients (she did good), and cooked for me.

This is totally me and her boyfriend - reading books while she’s executing three dishes on the burners and oven at the same time.

Men were tasked with fixing broken appliances - there was no money to buy new. Here is dad fixing a TV set with a screwdriver. A Soviet man needed only three tools he could fix anything with - a screwdriver, a hammer, and an axe.

“Oh my goodness, which dress do I choose to go on vacation? I have the whole four!”

It’s 1984 and yet the city professionals travel from Moscow to Sochi for their beach vacation in a sleeper train (30 hours each way).

They don’t fly because all the civic pilots and aircraft are held up in Vietnam and Angola helping out communist brothers and sisters to live well so they don’t fall for Americanky supermarkets .

Transport is even more primitivsky in the countryside. Mailman delivers packages and mail in a horse-drawn cart.

Parents decide to forgo Sochi vacation and spend time making farm furrows. They’d do better with a horse but it delivers mail.

Soviets manufactured Americansky and Italiansky passenger car knockoffs but there were no auto body shops to fix them.

Every Soviet car owner was an amateur mechanic and had to fix his car on his own! He also needed to have spare parts not readily available, and nicking them from other car owners was fair game.

Soviet passenger cars were always a tiny step away from breaking down and had to be pushed to somewhere where they could be revived for another day or two.

Russians have been accustomed to strapping themselves into a harness to pull noblemen or cargo for the lack of more technologically advanced transportation. Check out famous oil paintings: Repin’s “Barge Haulers on the Volga” and Vasily Perov’s “Troika.”

All well that ends well. Mom’s not cooking today and Dog is making bread to go along with cow milk. In another post I’ll walk you through the Three in Prostokvashino cartoon series remake for Putin’s era.

There are over a dozen wars happening in places ranging from Ukraine to Yemen and Ethiopia. Nearly 8000 people died due to Mexican drug cartels last year alone. In the past 4 months alone there were 7 major bombings in Pakistan’s cities. Sri Lanka went bankrupt and its PM’s house in set on fire. There are huge cases of terrorism & mass shooting in places ranging from New Zealand to Europe, while these would be a daily thing in the US.

In a nation of 1.4 billion people, 2 guys getting injured from a random violence in a corner is nothing comparable. Is this the standard of “disturbance”?

Terror attacks at the historical lowest in India at this point and so are major riots. From northeast to naxal attacks to Kashmir stone throwings and bombings, everything is close to the lowest point in the past 2 decades.

Here is data from South Asia terror portal.

By every metric of social disturbance — wars, riots, terror attacks, shootings, protests — India is experiencing a remarkable level of peace both relative to other parts of the world and our own past.

Now, coming to the economy, it is on a very strong footing now. With major reforms in finance, transportation, energy and retail that is happening, it is hard not to recognise India as the fastest growing major economy now. Even a stridently anti-Indian magazine like Economist had to bite the bullet and say this in their today’s magazine.

There are big changes that impact the long term:

India’s the world’s 3rd biggest in solar power now. We will have the cheapest power and an energy independence we never had before.
There is a big drop in fertility rates 
among all communities in India and this point to a population that will stabilize soon and even drop slightly — a good thing. With fewer kids now, we can educate them better and provide them with better health so that they can become great citizens in 20 years.
India is adding 50km of national highways every day
! This is a world record. All these roads would lead to better movement of goods as well as spread growth from a few cities. People can now stay far from the cities and still benefit — this is a massive change.
There is a massive electrification happening. The largest transportation system — railways — will be completely electric soon. Most autorickshaws and bikes are converting to EV. Despite the hiccups with battery fires, these will bring lasting changes to Indian transportation system. From solar power to electric vehicles, India will attain a level of energy independence besides causing a major economic growth in the sectors.
India has one of the most sophisticated fintech systems now enabling movement of money from one person to another in the lowest friction. 40% of the world’s
 digital payments happened in India.
There is a big rewiring of welfare distribution
 happening. Last year nearly $100 billion was directly wired to the bank accounts of the poorest Indians, leading many to cope up with the pandemic.
There is a massive expansion of Internet connectivity to the point that rural Internet users outnumber the urban internet users
. There are more than 646 million active Internet users — more than Europe’s and thrice as much as the US. When combined with the digital payments, direct benefits transfer, virtual education etc this is causing a major change in the rural economy.
India is now the world’s 3rd largest startup ecosystem — many of them are digitizing the economy to make use of the massively rising rural Internet users.

Short term — these are things happening (May 2022):

Despite all the oil price rises, India’s inflation is lower than that of the US (7.7% vs 8.3%) and comparable to EU now. This is a massive change. There was never a time when India had a lower inflation than the developed nations.
Manufacturing is in expanding with PMI showing healthy level.
Bank non-performing assets (bad loans) are dropping substantially. It is about the half the levels of where it was 4 years ago. This has enabled them to grow their loans
 substantially — essential for industries to borrow and expand.
Monsoon is expected to come earlier
 than expected, boosting farm production.
The drop in GDP due to COVID is now over. By end of 2022, GDP in dollar terms is expected to be 25% higher than that in 2019. Not perfect, but the 2 years have been brutal for every economy.

Tax collection of all types is at a record high and much higher than budgeted despite not increasing any tax rates.

Tax collections soar to record Rs 27.07 lakh crore in FY22
Gross tax collection of Rs 27.07 lakh crore during April 2021 to March 2022 compares with budget estimate of Rs 22.17 lakh crore, he told reporters here. Direct taxes, which comprise income tax paid by individuals and corporate tax, came in at Rs 14.10 lakh crore -- Rs 3.02 lakh crore higher than the budget estimate.

The case for India becoming an economic superpower:

Over the past few decades India has improved its security and avoided wars & other major disturbance. When you think of Europe, you worry about Russia and its expansion, bringing a NATO-Russia war as a possibility. You think of US and worry about its tensions with the other 2 superpowers. Europe is also facing the big uncertainty of immigration and their assimilation. East Asia is rapidly ageing. Latin America is still caught up in huge gang wars — as cartel violence in Mexico and other countries have increased. India has no such fundamental challenge.

We are just short distance from having Internet connectivity for every Indian. A massive startup ecosystem is ensuring that rural India benefits from this connectivity that is going impact every part of their life — how they study, work, get entertainment and get healthcare. With rapidly expanding roadways, railways, subsidized housing, toilets etc and other infrastructure they are going to see fundamental things change about their life.

As the clean energy — solar and wind — expand big there energy gaps get sorted out. India has now reached a point where nearly every Indian home has power and cooking gas. Soon every Indian home will have an electric vehicle (bike) that they will charge with this new solar output and run on this new road. People are going to move like never before. There is welfare that is directly reaching the bank accounts of the poorest and now nearly ever Indian home has a bank account. This cuts a huge level of corruption.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4l5kyqtofs21m8xi', 'title': 'Given the current social disturbance in India, how well is it positioned in the future to be an economic superpower?', 'score': {'original': 0.48876666666667, 'ai': 0.51123333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'What “social disturbance” are we talking here?

Elena Gold,7mo,What is the real condition of the Russian economy now?,"Yesterday, Vladimir Putin summoned his ministers to a virtual meeting, dedicated to “overcoming difficulties that some countries have created for Russia”.

In his opening remarks, Putin said that the countries that wanted to create difficulties for Russia didn’t succeed, so, obviously, he ordered the ministers to attend the conference purely for fun.

""Some countries are trying to create difficulties for Russia, but they are not succeeding and will not succeed,"" stated Putin, who is killing the Russian population and replacing them with migrants.

Meanwhile, the Russian government intends to cut all articles of the budget by 10%, after the collapse of commodity incomes – except for spending on the war.

All spending can go under the knife, except for budgets of the army and law enforcement agencies, as well as social obligations.

“Tell me, ministers, how much we don’t suffer at all from any difficulties?”

According to the results of January-May 2023, a “hole” of 3.4 trillion rubles ruptures the budget. To understand the scale of it, 28% of the money spent by the Russian government isn’t covered by the tax revenue received.

Oil and gas revenues have halved due to discounts that oil companies have to give to buyers, as well as cutting the supply of gas to European countries, which left Gazprom without the main export market.

Aggregate tax collections in Russia sank by 18%.

Almost 30% of the budget (about 4 trillion rubles) the government spent on the army and the production of weapons, of which about 80% is classified.

The total volume of classified expenses in 2023 jumped almost 10 times and amounted to 3.5 trillion rubles.

According to the forecast of Deutsche Bank analysts, Russia’s budget deficit for 2023 may amount to 5 trillion rubles, while the plan was 2.9 trillion. (I think that Deutsche Bank analysts are optimists, and 2023 budget deficit is going to exceed 7 trillion rubles.)

Export of Russian gas to Europe collapsed to a minimum in almost 50 years. Russia lost the markets created back in the times of the USSR.

Vladimir Putin insists that these countries who tried to create difficulties for Russia, didn’t succeed. But he obviously did – all by himself.

In the first half of the year, ""Gazprom"" pumped the minimum volume to European countries since the second half of the 1970s. Budget revenues from gas exports collapsed by 80%.

The value of premium Russian real estate dropped. In pre-Crimea 2013, the average price of 1 square meter of housing in Moscow exceeded $6,000. Now it is around $3,000.

Russia, 2013: $1 = 32 rub. Russian TV presenter dressed in colors of the Ukrainian flag – in 2023, you can be imprisoned for an outfit like that.

The ruble continued to fall again yesterday: the euro exchange rate exceeded 101 rubles, and the dollar reached almost 94 rubles, before the government threw some money in, trading closed at 92.

Hours before that, the Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said that they were “ready to intervene in the foreign exchange market with interventions in case of financial stability risks, now there are no such risks.”

Obviously, the rapidly descending ruble started to pose such immediate risks, so the central bank couldn’t avoid stepping in.

Russia’s Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina about the collapse of the ruble: we plan to adopt the ostrich pose.

In the past 6 months, ruble lost a third of its value.

By the way, in May 2022, the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia expected that the average annual dollar exchange rate would be:

2022: 76.7 rub.
2023: 77 rub.
2024: 78.7 rub.
2025 - 81 rub.

Now it’s obvious that long-term forecasts of Russia’s economists no longer work.

Because of the rapid rise of the dollar, prices for tours abroad jumped immediately by 10-12% in just the last week.
Over the past year, the cost of tours to the most popular tourist destinations among Russians — Turkey and Egypt, jumped by an average of 50%.
Following Prigozhin’s coup, over the past 2 weeks, the outflow of cash from the Russian banking system exceeded the figure for the whole of May (150 billion rubles) by 1.6 times, said Yury Kravchenko, head of the banking and money market analysis department at Veles Capital investment company,

At the same time, 30 billion rubles a day are spent from the budget on the war.

Harmeet Singh Hunjan (ਹਰਮੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਹੰਜਨ),3y,"Yogi Adityanath’s UP eyes becoming $1 trillion economy, is it possible in future?","Yogi Adityanath has time and again shared his vision of making Uttar Pradesh a $1 trillion economy, In the current scenario, it is almost impossible to tell if the vision can be achieved in the next few years to come, the vision is aspirational and revolutionary in itself.

First of all, I’d like to share a few points that are a hurdle in UP’s aspiration of becoming a trillion-dollar economy, Yogi faces a serious regional disparity.

Regional Challenge

The state has sharp regional variations, from the industrial & service hubs of the Noida, Ghaziabad & other cities of the western Uttar Pradesh, to the agrarian belts of eastern Uttar Pradesh.

From the poverty-stricken Bundelkhand to the socio-economic disasters of the Terai belt. Worse is that even the condition of the once-prosperous Awadh region has deteriorated over the past two decades with poverty actually increasing in the region.

Necessary steps for achieving a trillion-dollar economy

Currently, Uttar Pradesh has a GDP of about $250 billion, It needs to quadruple the GDP for achieving its goal, the necessary steps are:

to accelerate the transition of the state from a largely agrarian economy to an industrial one.
to reduce the regional variations by implementing region-specific policies
to ensure that the growth is broad-based and benefits all social groups.

These steps are fundamental for creating a trillion-dollar economy.

Now, talking about various sectors and necessary reforms in them to achieve the goal.

Agriculture (Most Important)

The vast and diverse geography and different regional needs of UP mean that a single policy cannot be formulated for the whole state. There is a need for specific plans for each of the sub-regions, which are unified by a common vision of promoting growth and supporting farmers.

Agriculture in UP is in distress with meagre growth due to paucity of investment in the sector. Policy-makers should work towards a new green revolution, which skipped UP except for its western parts. But the mistakes of the heavy dependence on chemical fertilizers, pesticides and unsustainable water and power usages must be avoided.

Traditional techniques must be revived and modernized using the latest knowledge with a focus on sustainability. Massive investment in R & D in both traditional and frontier areas is required. A major problem is the weak property rights in the countryside. The rights of farmers are not secure and the land is susceptible to be taken over by either the government in an arbitrary manner or by powerful local families, resulting in endless litigations, social disruption and loss of productivity.

Better land management, rationalization and consolidation of land holdings, enforcement of legal mechanisms to ensure property rights are a must to create a solid foundation for agricultural growth.

Then, better access to credit and markets forms the next important step. Proper institutions to ensure agricultural credit must be created to revitalize the sector. Market access needs to be expanded and the monopoly of state companies must be repealed.

Infrastructural development in the field of transportation, storage, etc., is required to cut down wastage and to ensure better integration with the regional, national and international markets.

It should not be forgotten that agriculture forms the basis of the economic pyramid and that it has a direct impact on poverty reduction in the state. Agricultural growth directly reduces poverty in the countryside.

Industry

Uttar Pradesh already has a sound industrial and manufacturing base. Every city of the state is a mini-economy in its own right and several of them are important manufacturing and export hubs.

But the misplaced government policies in the past have resulted in isolated factories having weak linkages with its surroundings or a few capitals- and technology-intensive complexes providing employment only to few highly-educated people.

What UP needs is rapid growth in the mass-manufacturing sector, which is rooted in the local resource base and provides employment to the locals. Industrialization is not limited to big industries with which it is often hyphenated.

Apart from promoting big industries, UP needs to focus on low capital, traditional and new industries that can absorb the ever-growing legions of the unemployed.

However, the old polices of restrictive policies based on a rigid distinction between small & medium and large-scale industries must be avoided. Small & medium industries are not competitors of large-scale industries but are its auxiliaries, with very strong backward and forward linkages.

We must see them in holistic terms and there must be opportunities for small enterprises to grow into medium enterprises and medium enterprises into large enterprises.

UP also has ample potential for the growth of agro-based industries, which should be promoted, especially in the agricultural belts.

Infrastructure

Infrastructural development is the most crucial factor in tapping the potential for industrialisation. The Infrastructure has seen a boom under the Yogi governance, Infrastructure development projects such as the Purvanchal Expressway (340.82 km), Bundelkhand Expressway (296.070 km) and Ganga Expressway (596.00 km) have been a boon for the states connectivity system and the projects have been implemented irrespective of any regional imbalance.

UP is situated far off from the coastline and international export nodes; therefore, the development of state-of-the-art railway and road links to ports in Bengal & Orissa should be undertaken on a priority basis.

While road connection to the nearest metropolitan centre at NCR has undergone tremendous improvement over the past decade, rail connectivity leaves much to be desired. It makes no sense for trains to run at a measly speed of 40-50 km in the northern plains.

The state government should collaborate with the centre and the railways to create a network of semi-high-speed and high-speed trains with special focus on freight trains, to ensure better economic integration with neighbouring states by cutting down on fuel and time cost of transportation.

The state also needs to resolve the electricity issue. It is difficult for UP to rely on wind and solar energy due to geographical challenges. The only source that can provide a solution is nuclear energy and the state should aim at building nuclear reactors for future demands. UP must embrace nuclear energy.

Urbanisation

UP needs a kick in this particular aspect, Cities suffer from excessive density, pollution, low living standards and shortage of electricity and water. Unlivable cities don’t attract outside talent and new ideas. And this lack of influx does take a toll because economically vibrant cities are those that are most cosmopolitan too.

These areas must be addressed to improve the quality of life and enable a welcoming environment for migrants who often find themselves moving from rural poverty to urban poverty. Urban planning needs to become a major focus area.

The state needs to change its policy outlook towards cities, which should see them as engines of economic growth and not just as a real-estate problem. City planning must include flexibility with a long-term view.

The revitalizing and rejuvenation of the municipal bodies by creating a technical and professional bureaucracy and ensuring an efficient financial system is a long-term task that should be among the first priorities.

Besides this, we need to ensure the sustainability of the urbanization process. Most of our cities are battling pollution, lack of freshwater and problems of resource flow. These lessons need to be incorporated into the urbanization drive in UP along with the new experimental policies and technologies being evolved and encouraged.

Health And Education

Ultimately it all boils down to the ‘people’. We need to remember that economic growth, productivity, technological advancement and modernisation are all about the people and not the machines.

It is the investment in human beings that leads to technological advancement, industrialisation, increased productivity and higher living standards. And so, health and education are the two fundamental areas where the Yogi government must act on a war footing.

All the efforts of promoting economic growth and industrialisation can’t succeed without a well-educated, skilled and healthy workforce. But education and health surprisingly remain the most neglected areas of public policy in the state.

And the main reason for this has been the decay of the public sector. It is often forgotten that the private sector is not the substitute but rather a complement to the public sector in the crucial areas of health and education.

And it seems that the Yogi government has its eyes set on the right path. It’s not just the improved general law and order situation but the fact that CM Yogi has already announced plans for Universal Healthcare by 2021 and work is underway in 13 new medical colleges and 500 new diagnostic centres.

These are the changes that are necessary for Uttar Pradesh to attain a $1 trillion economy, Though the idea may look far fetched in the current scenario, with necessary changes and decisions, the goal shall be very realistic to achieve.

I apologise for any unintentional error and edits are welcome.

Jay Hind!

And so, health and education are the two fundamental areas where the Yogi government must act on a war footing.\n\nAll the efforts of promoting economic growth and industrialisation can’t succeed without a well-educated, skilled and healthy workforce.

It is often forgotten that the private sector is not the substitute but rather a complement to the public sector in the crucial areas of health and education.\n\nAnd it seems that the Yogi government has its eyes set on the right path. It’s not just the improved general law and order situation but the fact that CM Yogi has already announced plans for Universal Healthcare by 2021 and work is underway in 13 new medical colleges and 500 new diagnostic centres.\n\nThese are the changes that are necessary for Uttar Pradesh to attain a $1 trillion economy, Though the idea may look far fetched in the current scenario, with necessary changes and decisions, the goal shall be very realistic to achieve.\n\nI apologise for any unintentional error and edits are welcome.\n\nJay Hind!\n\nThanks for reading.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.26153333333333
Maulik Singhal,Updated 8y,What is the ongoing Greek economic disaster all about and what does it mean for India?,"At the outset, European countries are getting kicked in their face for all the financial support to Greece. Here's how the fascinating Greek conundrum started:

As a background to the crisis, Greece was one of the fastest growing economies in the Eurozone from 2000 to 2007: during this period it grew at an annual rate of 4.2%, as foreign capital flooded the country. But, growth was at the expense of deficits that were constantly hitting the roof.

Greece joined EU in 1981, important thing to notice here is that it was only in 2001( Jan 1 2001) that Greece entered the Euro Zone and started using Euro as their currency. Prior to that, Greece used Greek Drachma(GRD) as their currency.

Whoopee it may sound, Greek Government had a Public Debt of 95 Billion Euros in 1995 which became inflation-adjusted 425 Billion Euros in 2013.

As pointed out in Dr. Balaji Viswanathan (பாலாஜி விஸ்வநாதன்)'s answer, to keep up their appearance, the Greek Government's spending surpassed their tax or revenue collection beyond proportions. Now, from where does the government get the money when tax collection is really low? It borrows, and Greek government did borrow, shamelessly and relentlessly.

Borrowing proportions became so high that Greece's Debt-to-GDP ratio reached 1.98 i.e. 198%. That means, for every 1 Euro produced in the country, the Government owed 2 Euros to the lenders.

As a cascading effect, such high debt of the government led to a crisis of confidence among the private lenders. Consequentially, interest rates on loans by private lenders to the Greek Government shot up owing to the obvious risk of repayment failure.

European Central Bank has formulated that the Debt'to'GDP ratio of any Eurozone country must not exceed 60% or if it does, the ratio shall at least be found to have ""sufficiently diminished and must be approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace"". In order to evade the ECB rules, Greek government did accounting shenanigans but it caught the ECB's eyes as Greece economy was spiralling out of hands. Trust in the government, as a result of this, further went down and interest rates on loans to govt. shot further up.

So ECB and other Euro zone members forced 'austerity' measures on Greek government, which essentially requires the government to cut down its public-spending. Austerity is not easy as cutting down public spending includes pensions of retirees and other govt. obligations. Austerity is imposed by higher taxes on the public.

How does Austerity hurt the Economy of a country?

Paradox of Thrift:

When government's monetary support in the form of monetary easing and infrastructural development goes down, the firms and industries start laying off people. Since taxes are high, spending capacity of an average person goes down and demand in the market plummets, which further pushes the firms to employ less and less workers, contributing greatly to unemployment.
Fearing job losses, public tends to save more than spending their money which consequentially lowers the overall economic output of the country.
It's a vicious cycle: Austerity leading to economy going further down, tax collection dropping and deficits increasing further up.

As a proof of this I'll give you GDP statistics of Greece's Real GDP growth since it started with austerity measures in 2009.

Year Real GDP growth
2007 3.0%
2008 -0.2%
2009 -3.3%
2010 -3.5%
2011 -6.9%

Yes, it was -6.9% of real GDP growth in 2011. And, Greece's national debt in 2012 was 303.x billion Euros which shot up to astonishingly high 425 billion Euros in 2013.


PART 2 of the crisis:

ECB, IMF and European countries poured money into Greece as a loan(read: bail out) to save its economy and with a promise of austerity measures from the Greek government. New Greek government that came in 2014 under Alexis Tsipras is anti-austere and suffering equally if it had chosen to be austere.

You can see here the lender list and amounts that were loaned to Greek government:
European Debt Crisis: Who Loaned Greece the Money?

After all the fresh blood pumped into Greek body , it was expected to liven up and it did, but only to an extent. The Greek public was fed up of the already few austerity measures in place, then came Syriza Party's Alexis Tsipras, riding on the slogans of anti-austerity to be the Prime Miinister of Greece in 2014. He didn't give much of a fuck to the austerity measures and old ways, ways prior to the crisis were restored. Remind you, as I should, Greece then, like now, was under the same, serious economic turmoil.

Now, the situation that fits the word 'disaster' is that Greece has the cut-out date of 1st July 2015, 5 days from now, to make its final loan repayment. And, Greek government looks very likely to default on this loan. This date is already a stretched after earlier requests from Greek government. And, requests to stretch the date further have been declined.
See: Greece’s Request for Loan Extension Is Rejected by Germany

If Greece defaults on its loan, Greece economy will have a collapsing effect and also the lenders will take a big hit. Mind you, the loan granted to Greece is to the tune of 400 billion Euros, imagine the hit lenders will take if Greek government defaults.

If Greece defaults, it will be kicked out of Eurozone and Greece will have to go back to Drachma-printing days and try very hard to come back to 21st century. The Euro-Drachma conversion rate will become so high that an average Greek person will find himself suddenly very poor. It will lead to a disastrous or violent austerity. Euro influx to Greece goes down and Greece will become the new Zimbabwe.

In simple terms, if Greece exits Euro Zone, it could lead to a contagion; many other countries (Italy, Portugal, Spain) struggling under huge debt could follow suit resulting in a domino effect.

This is what the Greek Economic Crisis and the disaster that's likely to ensue is all about.

However, there are theories that go around which try hard to pose Greek population as a serial tax defaulter which is a myth that needs to be bursted.
See:
Elena Alexi's answer to What hardships are Greek citizens facing under the ongoing economic crisis?

Coming to the impact of this disaster on a country like India:
As the RBI Governer Raghuram Rajan pointed out yesterday, India has sufficient Foreign Exchange Reserve and will be insulated from the Greek- crash. I will add more about the impact of the crisis on India if I happen to read up and hold it in sight.

Ramesh Subramanian,1y,Why is the Sri Lankan economy in crisis? What’s the reason for people fleeing towards India?,"Bad ECONOMICS driven by “Badder” 😉 POLITICIANS / POLITICS

I had the opportunity to visit this beautiful island nation a few times between 2005 and 2010. Despite a bloody civil war that raged for 2.5 decades, the country was not even a fraction of the bad shape it is in today. Odel in Colombo was a nice place to shop. Amazingly good quality garments at dirt cheap prices, exotic flavored teas… The south west coast had numerous beautiful beach resorts…

Fast Forward to 2022…

The country is going through its worst economic crisis ever and is on the brink of bankruptcy. The economy has been spiraling downwards since 2019.

Before we understand the issue, lets look at some key indicators.

Source: Wikipedia

What ails Sri Lanka?

Several factors have contributed to the current state of affairs. Some go as long back as the early 2010s while some others were driven by poor economic decisions by the current govt headed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019.

INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY:

1. Tourism: Tourism represents 13% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Starting with the Easter bombings in 2019 in Colombo and further aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic, this industry has been in doldrums since the last 3 years. The biggest impact was on forex earnings and obviously, job losses in this industry.

2. Agriculture: 30% of Sri Lankans are engaged in agriculture which contributes about 6% to the GDP. Last year, the govt came up with an absurd plan of becoming a 100% organic farming country. Usage of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides were banned which directly impacted those industries. The bigger and massive fallout of this decision was a 50% reduction in crop output with consequent food shortages and inflation. Worldwide, it is a known fact that yields from organic farming are much lower than regular commercial farming apart from the prohibitively highet costs. Sri Lanka's famed Ceylon Tea production plummeted impacting exports and forex earnings. The plans were abandoned late last year but the effects are still ongoing with food rationing being implemented.

3. Electricity, Fuel and Gas: Like several other countries, Sri Lanka is almost entirely dependent on imported fuel, the cost of which has spiralled in recent months further aggreviating Sri Lanka's woes. Electricity cuts have been imposed for 5 to 7 hours every day impacting industrial production. High cost of gas has impacted the food industry triggering further unemployment. Power cuts are rendering it unsafe for women to work at night. Long queues are being witnessed at fuel bunks which impacts transport and logistics. Violent incidents have also been reported at these bunks resulting in a couple of deaths.

4. Infrastructure Projects: Perhaps the earliest victims of Sri Lanka's poor infrastructure capacity forecasting was the Hambantota Port built by China. Forecasted traffic failed to materialise thereby straining debt servicing. A few years back, 85% stakes in the port was handed over to China on a 99 year lease. China has provided billions of dollars in loans to Sri Lanka for developing a seaport, airport, highways and power stations. While the country’s debt liability to China has increased to about $ 8 bln (2020), these projects have yet to yield adequate revenues for debt servicing.

FISCAL PRUDENCE:

1. Taxation: Massive tax cuts promised by the govt before elections saw govt revenues dipping and their fiscal deficit soaring. A manageable deficit is around 3% ~ 4% which can be stretched to 6% for short durations under exceptional situations. Sri Lanka’s fiscal deficit stands at a massive 15% in 2022 as against 5% two years earlier.

2. Monetary Policy: To fund the fiscal deficit, the central bank issued treasury bonds. When there weren't enough takers for the bonds, they started printing currency notes. About 1.6 trillion LKR came into the economy - 23 times all of the notes printed between 1952 and 2019.

3. Inflation: High fiscal deficit funded by printing notes saw inflation shooting about to 18% and increasing quickly. Food inflation stands at 26%.

4. Trade Deficit & Forex Reserves: High import reliance (petroleum, food, paper etc) combined with a big dip in export earnings has brought their forex reserve to dangerously low levels of about USD 2.3 bln. Trade deficit stands at 10 bln. They have big loan payments (7+ bln) coming up later in the year and no money to fund it. Sri Lanka has approached the IMF, China and India for loans. China declined while India has extended a 1 bln line of credit a few days ago apart from 500 mln a short while earlier. The LKR has devalued to about LKR 270 against the USD.

5. Foreign Debt: Sri Lanka's foreign debt profile has seen a dramatic change over the last 15 years. From relying predominantly on low interest rate loans (1%) from development banks like IMF, Asian development Bank etc with long payback periods and flexible grace periods, the country switched to issuing ISBs which are commercial borrowings with shorter tenure and high interest rates (6%). The country has taken a stubborn stand of not approaching the IMF for help (due to IMFs conditions of fiscal tightening measures). Debt servicing became expensive and a strain on the forex reserves.

Since 2005, the foreign debt has increased from 10 bln to over 50 bln.

The situation looks pretty gloomy for Sri Lankans. The country has no money to import paper and ink. Consequently, all student exams have been postponed by a few months. Refugees have started trickling into India.

Lessons for politicians and general public in India

Death and taxes are the only permanent things in life. If you cut taxes in one place, it has to be compensated by an increase elsewhere.
There are no free lunches and our politicians who are ever so happy to dole out freebies should note that somebody else has to foot the bill for these elections gimmicks.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/m8irohl52c3yzavk', 'title': 'Why is the Sri Lankan economy in crisis?

Inflation: High fiscal deficit funded by printing notes saw inflation shooting about to 18% and increasing quickly. Food inflation stands at 26%.\n\n4. Trade Deficit & Forex Reserves: High import reliance (petroleum, food, paper etc) combined with a big dip in export earnings has brought their forex reserve to dangerously low levels of about USD 2.3 bln. Trade deficit stands at 10 bln. They have big loan payments (7+ bln) coming up later in the year and no money to fund it. Sri Lanka has approached the IMF, China and India for loans. China declined while India has extended a 1 bln line of credit a few days ago apart from 500 mln a short while earlier. The LKR has devalued to about LKR 270 against the USD.\n\n5. Foreign Debt: Sri Lanka's foreign debt profile has seen a dramatic change over the last 15 years. From relying predominantly on low interest rate loans (1%) from development banks like IMF, Asian development Bank etc with long payback periods and flexible grace periods, the country switched to issuing ISBs which are commercial borrowings with shorter tenure and high interest rates (6%). The country has taken a stubborn stand of not approaching the IMF for help (due to IMFs conditions of fiscal tightening measures). Debt servicing became expensive and a strain on the forex reserves.\n\nSince 2005, the foreign debt has increased from 10 bln to over 50 bln.\n\nThe situation looks pretty gloomy for Sri Lankans.

Despite a bloody civil war that raged for 2.5 decades, the country was not even a fraction of the bad shape it is in today. Odel in Colombo was a nice place to shop. Amazingly good quality garments at dirt cheap prices, exotic flavored teas… The south west coast had numerous beautiful beach resorts…\n\nFast Forward to 2022…\n\nThe country is going through its worst economic crisis ever and is on the brink of bankruptcy. The economy has been spiraling downwards since 2019.\n\nBefore we understand the issue, lets look at some key indicators.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nWhat ails Sri Lanka?\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the current state of affairs. Some go as long back as the early 2010s while some others were driven by poor economic decisions by the current govt headed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019.\n\nINDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY:\n\n1. Tourism: Tourism represents 13% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Starting with the Easter bombings in 2019 in Colombo and further aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic, this industry has been in doldrums since the last 3 years. The biggest impact was on forex earnings and obviously, job losses in this industry.\n\nBuddhist Cave Temple Complex, Dambulla\n\n2. Agriculture: 30% of Sri Lankans are engaged in agriculture which contributes about 6% to the GDP. Last year, the govt came up with an absurd plan of becoming a 100% organic farming country. Usage of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides were banned which directly impacted those industries. The bigger and massive fallout of this decision was a 50% reduction in crop output with consequent food shortages and inflation. Worldwide, it is a known fact that yields from organic farming are much lower than regular commercial farming apart from the prohibitively highet costs. Sri Lanka's famed Ceylon Tea production plummeted impacting exports and forex earnings. The plans were abandoned late last year but the effects are still ongoing with food rationing being implemented.\n\nDilmah's Ceylon Tea Plantation\n\n3. Electricity, Fuel and Gas: Like several other countries, Sri Lanka is almost entirely dependent on imported fuel, the cost of which has spiralled in recent months further aggreviating Sri Lanka's woes. Electricity cuts have been imposed for 5 to 7 hours every day impacting industrial production. High cost of gas has impacted the food industry triggering further unemployment. Power cuts are rendering it unsafe for women to work at night. Long queues are being witnessed at fuel bunks which impacts transport and logistics. Violent incidents have also been reported at these bunks resulting in a couple of deaths.\n\n4. Infrastructure Projects: Perhaps the earliest victims of Sri Lanka's poor infrastructure capacity forecasting was the Hambantota Port built by China. Forecasted traffic failed to materialise thereby straining debt servicing. A few years back, 85% stakes in the port was handed over to China on a 99 year lease. China has provided billions of dollars in loans to Sri Lanka for developing a seaport, airport, highways and power stations. While the country’s debt liability to China has increased to about $ 8 bln (2020), these projects have yet to yield adequate revenues for debt servicing.\n\nHambantota Sea Port\n\nFISCAL PRUDENCE:\n\n1. Taxation: Massive tax cuts promised by the govt before elections saw govt revenues dipping and their fiscal deficit soaring. A manageable deficit is around 3% ~ 4% which can be stretched to 6% for short durations under exceptional situations. Sri Lanka’s fiscal deficit stands at a massive 15% in 2022 as against 5% two years earlier.\n\n2. Monetary Policy: To fund the fiscal deficit, the central bank issued treasury bonds. When there weren't enough takers for the bonds, they started printing currency notes. About 1.6 trillion LKR came into the economy - 23 times all of the notes printed between 1952 and 2019.\n\n3.

Reason : domestic market is down and they dont have sufficient funds even for day to day working of their industry.

If ceramic tiles industry is under distress that means that real estate must be in distress too, as they are their main buyers.

And if all of them are in distress that simply means the people working in these industries might not be able to afford luxury hence automobiles, garment sector and real estate sector is in distress.

So you can see that a complete wheel of economy has stopped primarily due to demonetization ( because most of the funds flowing in India's real estate was black money and demonetization stopped that to a large extent.)

Ashok Rathor,4y,Which country has the highest potential for economic growth currently?,"The Indian economy will see robust GDP growth of 7.3% in 2018-19 and 7.5% for the next two as “factors holding back growth in India fade"", the World Bank has forecast, allowing the country to retain the tag as the world’s fastest-growing major emerging economy.

“India’s economy (today) is robust, resilient and has potential to deliver sustained growth,"" Ayhan Kose, Director of the Development Prospects Group at the World Bank, told PTI. Growth in India is projected to advance 7.3% in FY 2018-19 (1 April 2018-31 March 2019) and 7.5% in FY 2019-20, reflecting robust private consumption and strengthening investment, the bank said in its June 2018 edition of the Global Economic Prospect report.

The report, released on Wednesday, is the global lender’s flagship publication on the state of the world economy. It said that growth in South Asia is projected to strengthen to 6.9% in 2018 and to 7.1% in 2019, mainly as “factors holding back growth in India fade.""

Previously international lenders have said the demonetization and the initial hiccups in the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) had impacted India’s growth. India retains the tag of the fastest growing country among the world’s major emerging economies, Kose said.

India’s growth projections remain unchanged since its January 2018 forecast. China is expected to slow down slightly from 6.9% in 2017 to 6.5% in 2018, 6.3% in 2019 and 6.2% in 2020, it said. India’s growth potential is about 7%, and it is currently growing at a pace above its potential, he said, attributing it to the major economic reforms and fiscal measures undertaken by the government.

“India is doing well. Growth is being robust. Investment growth remains high. Consumption remains strong. All in all these numbers are encouraging,"" Kose said, referring to the World Bank report on India’s growth rate figures.

“And India is the fastest growing economy in major emerging markets,"" he said. Noting that India’s growth prospects are strong, the official said the potential growth rate of India is around seven percent. “However, you look at it, India is in a very strong position,"" he said.

“In terms of economic growth, the fact that India is able to deliver a robust consumption growth, robust investment... All these are good news. The big issue is now that India has a potential to sustain this growth and we are optimistic about India to realise that potential,"" Kose said.

Seeking an increasing female labour force participation, he said on the productivity side India has room for improvement in secondary education completion rates. Noting that there are risks that all emerging market economies are facing because of global economic developments, he said, for example the disorderly tightening of global financial conditions could have implications for emerging market economies.

“There is trade tensions out there. These tensions have been escalating in recent weeks. These have implications for growth prospects as well,"" he said. Like other oil importers, India is also facing a higher oil prices, he said.

In its latest report, the bank said in India, investment growth has firmed recently, as the effects of temporary factors wane. It said that growth in South Asia is projected to accelerate to 6.9% in 2018, mainly reflecting strengthening domestic demand in India as temporary policy-driven disruptions fade.

Elsewhere in the region, ongoing recoveries in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are expected to be accompanied by moderating activity in Afghanistan, Bhutan and Maldives, the World Bank said.

“Over the medium term, growth is expected to remain strong and reach 7.2 per cent by 2020 amid robust domestic demand. Downside risks continue to predominate. They include the possibility of fiscal slippages, delays in reforms to resolve financial vulnerabilities and improve the health of regional banking systems, and a faster-than-expected tightening in global financing conditions,"" the report said.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jcv49otzkafb7s30', 'title': 'Which country has the highest potential for economic growth currently?', 'score': {'original': 0.60355, 'ai': 0.39645}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The Indian economy will see robust GDP growth of 7.3% in 2018-19 and 7.5% for the next two as “factors holding back growth in India fade"", the World Bank has forecast, allowing the country to retain the tag as the world’s fastest-growing major emerging economy.\n\n“India’s economy (today) is robust, resilient and has potential to deliver sustained growth,"" Ayhan Kose, Director of the Development Prospects Group at the World Bank, told PTI.

Jay Bazzinotti,Updated 1y,What are some examples of fraud collapsing an economy?,"In 1807 in Boston, a man named Andrew Dexter Jr decided to build what was then a new concept: the indoor stock exchange. Up until then, merchants would gather under a big tree near what is now Quincy Market on Boston Harbor and make deals for goods such as meat and fruits and salt and firewood. It was often an inconvenience for merchants to stand under this tree and bicker in any weather. So Dexter, being civic minded, decided to create a stock market building in Boston. He wanted to pattern if after Lloyds of London, in a fashion. Lloyds was the pre-eminent maritime insurance firm, but it got its start as a coffee house on the docks where ship captains met to get a meal and make deals. Dexter wanted that on a grander scale.

So Dexter proposed to build the largest business office in the United State, the Boston Coffee and Tea Exchange, right next to the Old State House (which still exists today). Even by today’s standards, the building was to be enormous. It would be nine stories high; it would have a wide open bottom floor with a gigantic coffee and tea bar as well as a beer bar, with special tables where businessmen could put their large ledgers and also provided all the available newspapers from all over the world, brought in by ship captains, as well as the local rags (they were called “rags” because paper was made from rags in those days. The ability to make paper from wood wouldn’t be discovered for another 25 years or so).

The problem was that Dexter couldn’t raise the capital to build his building.

Not one to be discouraged, Dexter thought up an ingenious plan to get money. At the time, the US had no central banking system. Every bank printed up its own paper money, backed by the gold in its vaults. (The first paper money in America was made by Paul Revere in Boston). It was easy for people to take their paper money to a bank and redeem it for gold if they wanted to, but paper money was lighter, easier to store and less prone to robbery than gold so it was an accepted medium of exchange.

Now, in those days, people would come from other parts of the country with money from some never-heard-of bank like the Central Bank of Michigan for example. People were wary about the existence of the gold in these banks because they simply couldn’t check that the gold was there. So what they did was for every dollar of some strange bank, they only gave 80 cents purchasing power. This way, they would hedge their bets if the money was bad. The system had worked for many years and was well accepted. The people who came from out of town grumbled about the loss of purchasing power of their money, but they had little choice.

Dexter went out and started buying banks far away from Boston. In fact, one of his purchases was the Central Bank of Michigan. In 1807, Michigan was almost as far away as the moon. Just getting to NYC by land took over a month on the bad roads of the time. (We have the surviving journal of a brave woman who made the attempt with a guide and all the adventures she experienced, from Indian attacks, to religious hysteria in some towns where they wanted to hang her for being an uppity woman traveling to New York, to people who actually allowed the Black slaves to eat at the same table as them). So Dexter knew that it would be hard for people to go to Michigan to check on the gold in the bank, and he immediately started printing bank notes from the bank and using them to buy property and labor and so on to build his Coffee and Tea Exchange. However, he couldn’t raise enough money so he started buying banks in Western Massachusetts, which was still the outback (It’s STILL the outback today, very rural, it’s like going to another country out there). And then he bought almost all the banks in Rhode Island. Eventually, he raised something like 800,000 dollars. It’s hard to rectify the value of money from those times to today, but that amount of money would be worth almost 200 million dollars today.

Dexter was a fraudster but he was not a conman. He built the building he promised, a massive edifice that blocked out the sun and created canyons in the otherwise low-rise town of Boston (Boston didn’t become a city until 1822 under Josiah Quincy, the most honest political leader in history). The building was outfit with the best of everything; the offices were plush and included every amenity. The building even included its own beer brewery in the basement. It had everything it needed to be a success.

It flopped.

There were many reasons for the building to fail. The merchants simply weren’t ready to change to new ideas. Instead of gathering by the warm fires of the business lobby and making deals around a hot cup of coffee or tea, they continued to stand under the massive oak tree by the waterfront and make deals. And no one rented the plush offices in the nine story building, either. The reason was because it took nine flights of stairs to get to the top. Otis wouldn’t invent the elevator until 1857. Additionally, the rooms were cold because the patrons were required to pay for their own firewood and carrying firewood up nine stories was a grueling undertaking. There were servants paid to do this and it was a never ending task, carrying the firewood up and the ashes down. The mechanical dumbwaiter wouldn’t be invented until 1877. And finally, the “jakes” as the restroom was called, only extended to the fourth floor and dumped waste into a shaft on the outside of the building where it was mucked out at the bottom. If you were on higher floors, you had to run down five flights to relieve or yourself - or dump the commode out the window (which was actually quite common back then and the reason women carried parasols).

The building failed.

And when it failed, all the laborers and servicmen and workers wanted their money. And the rumor started that Dexter, who had been spreading massive amounts of currency from far away banks actually had no money. So a Boston newspaper, in a daring act of investigation (which was new for them in those days but then there would be no police in Boston until 1835) sent a rider to Providence to redeem his paper money for gold.

Sadly, there was no gold.

An immediate investigation was ordered. It turned out that the total amount of gold in all of Dexter’s banks amounted to about 50 dollars. He used 50 dollars to leverage 800,000 dollars. No one got paid.

Dexter was a well-meaning fraudster but he wasn’t stupid. Before it became well known what he had done, he had his wife and children and his furniture loaded onto a ship and he sailed to Nova Scotia where he was free from extradition. Meanwhile, in Boston, all hell was breaking loose because of the huge amount of worthless paper money floating around. Not only was Dexter’s money now worthless and the brickmakers and carpenters and fensters and firewood suppliers and so on all lost their savings, but as a result, no one would accept the “good” currency from any other bank. No one wanted paper money at all. The entire banking system of New England ground to a halt. Businesses collapsed; people lost their homes and businesses. Livelihoods were ruined. Commerce came to a standstill because no one knew if they could trust the currency. Suddenly, people went back to using gold and English pounds sterling. In fact, English Pounds were the currency of record until 1853 when it was finally outlawed as legal tender. The entire banking system was crushed - but it did not change.

Without a central bank, America had to continue to trust in paper money printed by banks with the hope they had the backing for it. It wasn’t until Abraham Lincoln took over the banking system that a Federal note was issued and it wasn’t until 1995 that those old bank notes were finally eliminated as legal tender.

As for Dexter? While in Nova Scotia, he discovered he had inherited a piece of worthless scrub land in Alabama. He moved his family there and founded the city of Montgomery and is considered a hero. He has statues and there are streets and schools named after him.

And as for the Coffee and Tea Exchange? After Dexter absconded, the town of Boston seized the building. It was abandoned for a time but then someone suggested it be operated at least partially to make up for the losses. The bottom floors were open for business and it became a successful bar - until a fire tender accidentally set the building on fire tending one of the dozens of fireplaces. The fire department, such as it was, was completely unable to address the magnitude of the fire of such a building. Their ladders didn’t extend beyond the first story; their hoses were like garden hoses today. They stood back and let the building burn to the ground. It burned for three days. The only fatality was a young boy looting the building who fell through the burned out floor into a vat of boiling beer that had been brewing in the basement. The burned out foundation sat for years until the Suffolk County Courthouse was built on the site, an ugly building that still sits there today.

But in its time, Dexter destroyed the entire economy of New England and sowed nationwide distrust in the banking system that lasted for nearly 50 years.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ldknm1qoi2yb7w3r', 'title': 'What are some examples of fraud collapsing an economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.56765, 'ai': 0.43235}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In 1807 in Boston, a man named Andrew Dexter Jr decided to build what was then a new concept: the indoor stock exchange.

Stacy Tidwell,Updated Jan 21,Why do the rich become richer and the poor poorer?,"Rich people leverage labor, capital, or both.

I grew up in a very poor family in the poorest neighborhood in Houston. Our school coach called us Heights Rats. We thought it was a compliment.

My uncle was a rancher. Later in life, I accidentally learned my uncle had given us free beef over many years. This was done in total secrecy.

Growing up, we sometimes had huge T-bone steaks, baked potatoes, and pecan pie.

That was a big deal!

Looking back, I now realize we never could have afforded those meals.

When I was 10 years old, a construction guy put a yellow marker on the abandoned firehouse next to my home. (Houston has no zoning.)

I said: Hey, Mister. What is that marker?

We are demolishing this place first thing Monday morning.

I said: Can I have some of the bricks?

Sure, kid. Take all you want. These bricks are going to the county dump. But get what you want this weekend. Monday morning, bulldozers and dump trucks arrive 7 AM. You cannot be around here while they are working.

The 1960s were a different time in America.

My brothers, cousins, and I used sledgehammers and wheelbarrows. We worked like ants. We filled our backyard and the vacant lot next door with bricks. Enormous piles.

We did not know what we would do with the bricks. But we knew they were free.

Texans are big believers in: Mind your own business.

No one interrupted our work. No one even asked what we were doing.

When that demolition crew arrived Monday morning, they were probably shocked to discover much of the job had already been completed.

Within four days, my Dad found a contractor who would pay 10 cents for each brick. But they had to be cleaned. No mortar hanging off.

This contractor built circular driveways. Circular driveways were sophisticated in the 1960s. These were especially popular in River Oaks.

Wealthy oil men lived there. We never ventured that far. For us, River Oaks could have been on Pluto.

So I offered all my buddies 4 cents each to clean the bricks. My fastest workers could make four bucks an hour. That was an unbelievable amount of money for kids in the fifth grade.

Godzilla triple features at the Yale Theater only cost 35 cents. The air conditioning alone was worth 35 cents. When it was 104 degrees outside, our table fans at home did little good.

We cleaned the bricks using hammers, chisels, and hatchets. No one wore safety glasses. We had no idea safety glasses existed.

My friends were delighted to have a paying job. Mom made us lemonade and oatmeal cookies. We tried chocolate chip. But the heat melted chocolate all over the bricks.

We sat in a circle and horsed around. It was more fun than work. We had constant contests:

Fastest bricks
Cleanest bricks
Fewest chips

My favorite was the Cleaver contest. The winner was the one who could completely clean the side of a brick with one perfect stroke of the hatchet.

I was Supervisor. But my best friend objected: Why do you get 6 cents for doing nothing, while the rest of us get 4 cents for doing all the work?

My people skills were a little rough. I replied: Take it or leave it, Donkey Breath.

I suspected my best friend was a Communist—though I had no idea what that might be. From Walter Cronkite, I knew there were Communist Gorillas in Vietnam.

Eventually, my best friend came around. He decided to clean bricks, too. So I had 8 kids working for me.

He later became a highly respected professor at Rice University.

Back then, the rule was: Everyone had to get home before the street lights came on.

My buddies and I could go on 6-hour adventures without our parents knowing where we were.

As mentioned, it was a different era.

Our assembly line was soon humming. We delivered bricks daily. As we say in the South:

We were cooking with gas.

But we were also generating lots of chips and dust in the process. My refuse pile was growing.

On Wednesday afternoons, a garbage truck came by. Each homeowner was limited to three garbage cans.

There is a solution to every problem!

If we met the garbage men with ice-cold cans of Dr. Pepper and Coca-Cola, they would empty extra trash cans. The very first week, I learned the importance of “winning over” the driver.

My brother said I was bribing public officials. Dad assured me I would not be arrested.

On Sunday mornings, we walked to church wearing our best clothes. Clean and starched. The moment we got home, I raced to put on regular clothes.

One Sunday afternoon, Mom caught us working on the bricks. This upset her. We were breaking the 10 Commandments. We immediately stopped working.

Dad said: Don’t worry, son. You can still beat Howard Hughes working 6 days a week.

Then, he winked at me.

That is how I made a small fortune at age 10.

With a lot of help from:

City of Houston
A kind construction supervisor
Wonderful buddies
Hard-working garbage men
My brothers and cousins
Mom & Dad

Bottom Line

Rich people leverage labor, capital, or both.

Poor people do not.

Answers to Questions in Comments

Yes. I am now rich. We have employees in Texas, California, District of Columbia, and four countries overseas.
No. I eat few steaks, but lots of pie. Pie is one of my 4 major food groups.
Yes. Our mission is to do business according to the Holy Bible.
Yes. We took unfair advantage of whomever owned the vacant lot where we stored bricks.
No. I no longer call people Donkey Breath. Not to their faces anyway.
Yes. The Heights was a very poor neighborhood in the 1960s. The area has been completely revitalized. The Heights skipped gentrification and went straight to luxury. Our neighbors in the 1960s were steel fabrication yards and freight trains.
I have witnessed three major turnarounds in my lifetime:
East Palo Alto, California
Baltimore Harbor, Maryland
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

The renaissance in the Heights was almost as amazing. Of course, the irony is this:

I travelled all over the world trying to make it big. But I would have made more money if I had stayed home — loading the boat with vacant lots and rundown houses in the Heights.

7 days later. More questions…

Yes. People in River Oaks had elaborate and beautiful Christmas lights. Many Houstonians drove there to see those displays. People in the Heights could not afford Christmas lights.
Yes. Yale Theater is still there. But there are no more Godzilla triple features or buckets of popcorn for 35 cents.
No. We did not cause environmental problems by recycling the bricks.
No. We did not create a “tragedy of the commons” by taking free bricks.
Yes. I believed there were Communist Gorillas in Vietnam. I never said I was smart.
Yes. It is still possible to get rich in 2024 starting with nothing.
No. If you want to be poor, do what poor people do. If you want to be rich, do what rich people do.
Yes. There is a millionaire mindset. But it is not about positive thinking.

Here is the real mindset for success.

Determine the price — the full price — required to achieve your goals.

Then, resolve fully and completely to pay that price.

Big goals create big problems. You will need grit and steel. Not happy talk and rainbows.

Yes. We knew the Corll family. Their shop was across from Helms Elementary. My Little League team practiced at Helms.
Yes. I knew Elmer Wayne Henley. He was in Boy Scouts (Troop 24). But Wayne had long hair. My Dad was Old School military. My brothers and I had buzz cuts until we left home. Mom gave us haircuts in the kitchen. Dad said Wayne was a “hippie or worse.” We were not allowed to have any contact with him.
Yes. Howard Hughes was from Houston. His family members still live in the area. He was the richest man in the world for awhile. When I drove a flatbed truck, I made “Hot Shot” deliveries to Hughes Tool Company. Those paid 2x the normal rate.
In Texas, an eccentric billionaire is called a real character. They can be found all over the state.

In the 1950s, the richest man in the world was H.L. Hunt. He would hand out free copies of his anti-Communist book at the Texas State Fair. He would personally talk with fair visitors for 8 hours at a time.

Mr. Hunt did not like pie. He liked carrot cake. Everywhere he went, he carried two pieces in a brown paper bag.

As he and his lawyer drove to inspect oil fields, he would stop at a roadside stand to buy a watermelon for lunch. The two men would split the melon. His lawyer said:

Mr. Hunt always haggled with farmers. He refused to pay more than 75 cents.

Mr. Hunt’s neighbor was even more eccentric. While his wife and daughters were vacationing in Europe, he refrigerated part of his mansion.

His family returned to a chilly home — and a squadron of indoor/outdoor penguins.

Below is the richest man in the world in 2024.

In the 1970s, Jeff Bezos and I were classmates in Houston at Vanguard (public school). That is his grandfather on the porch. Their family owns a cattle ranch outside Cotulla.

Jeff was always brilliant. Like most billionaires, he is a real character. His Dad is on the right.

Jeff worked cattle as a teenager. We all did. Here is a little-known parenting tip…

If you want your C-minus student to become an A-plus student, let him work one summer as a cowboy.

Why does Texas generate so much wealth? Peculiar culture!

Texans openly admire rich people. It has been that way for 200 years.
Texans have zero sympathy for slackers and whiners.
No state income tax. No corporate income tax. No inheritance tax. No grocery tax.
It’s nutty to tax people who work hard to give freebies to people who do nothing. Looking right at you, California.
Texans value law and order. That is good for business, bad for hoodlums.

15 days later. More questions…

No. Moving from the Bottom 1% to the Top 1% will never be easy.
But I did it. My brothers did it. My cousin did it. You can do it, too!
Yes. The United States is still full of amazing opportunities. Anyone who is willing to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week can become wealthy.
Yes. Monty Burns and I are similar — though I have more hair.

Alex Mann,2y,What are some examples of fraud collapsing an economy?,"Well, there are lots of examples but my favorite isn’t from the US or even this century. It’s the South Sea Bubble.

So the exchequer of England, Robert Harley, needs to raise some capital and quick. As head of the treasury (basically) he needs to do a bang-up job for both his political career and his political partners. Problem is, England is broke.

How broke? About 9–10 million pounds in debt. That may not seem like a ton but this the early 1700s.

So Harley turns to a man named John Blunt- a “creative” economic mind who has some ideas. Prior to this Blunt had cooked up a scheme involving Irish land sales, stock in his sword-making company, and IOUs paid to the army. Blunt gave the government a nice loan out of his profits which made him friends and thus brought him to the attention of Harley.

Harley and Blunt decide to create a company- a new shining company for everyone to invest in. The biggest company in town at the time was the “Honorable East India Trade Company” so Blunt and Harley created the “South Sea Company”.

They promised the company would be like the East India Company, just in the South Sea.

The key here is this- they offered shares of the company in exchange for government debt. So that 9 million pounds the British Government owed could be swapped for shares in this new company.

Soon all the debt was in the hands of The South Sea Company. That means interest payments on the debt were paid to The South Sea Company. Make sense?

So the South Sea Company is now getting steady income without doing anything actually real. Soon the South Sea Company starts selling shares to citizens who are enraptured with this new company.

Here is the problem- there was no profit coming from the South Sea. In fact, the South Seas were almost entirely Spanish and the British were at war with Spain. So while Blunt and Harley advertised the South Sea Company like a new East India Company- it was mostly a bank.

Before long the entire nation had invested in South Seas. The demand for stock meant the price soared and Blunt would offer incredible terms on anyone looking to buy stock. He would even loan people money to buy stock.

The Company was eventually valued at 300 million pounds- which was a sizeable chunk of the British Economy. It would be like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Walmart rolled into one time 10 if it existed today.

Again the problem here is that the South Sea Company wasn’t making a profit- there was no “company” to speak of. The

Eventually, the bottom fell out. The price got so high, it freaked everyone out. Many people started selling and that was that. There was no money to pay them of course which caused a panic. This caused to stock price to plummet to worthless.

In 1 week the stock went from 1000 pounds a share to 150 pounds a share. Then in another week, the stock was worth nothing.

The entire nation of England- from the King to the peasants- had invested HEAVILY in South Sea and they were all ruined. It was an economic collapse on a scale the Great Depression but perhaps even worse.

The good news is that we all learned a lesson about fraud in investing and how rampant market speculation can cause economic disasters.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/k7ycn2wg09p1u3bh', 'title': 'What are some examples of fraud collapsing an economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.46865, 'ai': 0.53135}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Well, there are lots of examples but my favorite isn’t from the US or even this century.

Alan,Updated 2y,Why is Germany's infrastructure so superior to the UK's?,"Ok, go with me here. My comments/answer is informed somewhat by living in Germany and also history.

UK infrastructure, other than motorways, is largely of victorian in origin. Railways in particular date from the 1850s. Whilst WW2 made a bit of a dent in it, this was miniscule compared to what the allied airforces did to German infrastructure. In 1945 key parts of the German socio - economic - industrial base were a wasteland. Cities were flattened, railways were ripped appart, supply chain logistics were fractured and utilities were, well to put it bluntly, absolutely buggered. German infrastructure was totally and utterly shattered.

I don't propose to go into the argument of who paid who and who got aid from whom for what. Other answers and comments cover that off far better than I am able to do. My hypothesis, based on what I saw living in Germany and my study of WW2 and the cold war, is that when Germany reinvented itself and rebuilt its post war infrastructure, it was largely able to do so with a blank canvas reflecting post war requirements.

Meanwhille UK infrastructure was far less impacted by WW2 and remains founded largely on victorian and pre war needs. Clearly the UK motorway network is the exception, but built in the 60s and 70s it too is creaking somewhat due to investment being denied by successive governments since the 80s.

As I said, my hypothesis is not presented as the reason, but it is a reason. Politics and spending priorities are clearly other reasons.

Susanna Viljanen,Updated 4y,"How has the decline of Nokia affected Finland, and Finnish people?","The shock has been more mental than economic.

Before Nokia’s rise, Finland was a ‘smokestack industry’ country; forestry, paper, heavy industry and process industry country. If you said ‘industry’, people would understand it as a brickwork factory with a tall chimney.

In the late 1970s the Finnish futurologists understood computers and electronics would be the stuff of the future. They suggested the whole society to adapt on it. Finland had just undergone a school reform, and stuff essential for computing, like logics and set theory, was included in the curriculum. I learned to do arithmetics by the set theory. I learned in the early classes that union is addition, intersection is multiplication and subtraction is subset. OR, AND and NOT. The result was that our parents did not understand a thing. They had learned math on rote. I actually loved math.

Came the eighties and the Prime Minister Harri Holkeri had the slogan hallittu rakennemuutos (Controlled Structural Change), whose intention was to change the structure of Finnish economy from smokestack industry into hightech industry. Nokia, formerly a rubber and paper manufacturer, later a conglomerate, shed off the other industries (the rubber manufacturer is today known as Nokian Tyres OY) and concentrated on electronics.

See the whole history of Nokia here: Nokia - Wikipedia

Cue the 1990s depression and collapse of USSR. Finland was in really deep poo-poo. It was a worse depression than the 1930s and unemployment reached 25% at worst. The controlled structural change had become uncontrolled, catastrophic. Something had to be done.

The state is a bad business manager, but an excellent business angel. The Finnish state had funded several promising electronics corporations and their research and development, and Nokia had already manufactured the best military communication device of the era, SANLA
 (short from Sanomalaite M/90 or Messaging Device, Model 1990). It was a revolutionary gadget which neither NATO nor USSR had. It both encrypted the message automatically, sent it as a burst on radio - any military radio transmitter could be used - and decrypted it at the other end. I was instructed to use it. It was basically uncrackable.

Scandinavia had had the NMT (Nordiska Mobiltelefon) network, and Nokia was one of the manufacturers. The follower of NMT was GSM, which was to be global. Nokia used the encryption technique learned when developing SANLA, and applied on mobile phones, making communication secure. The killer application was SMS (Short Message Service), which really blew up the bank. Nokia proved superior to all its competitors. The rise of Nokia began 1991.

Nokia expanded like soufflé, and it really was needed. Nokia absorbed a lot of the available work force and soon became the leading employer. Nokia did not pay a good salary, but in those years anything was better than the dole. A cheap and available highly educated work force certainly helped the situation.

The next 20 years were history. Nokia was THE Finnish company. While Wärtsilä, Kone, Valmet, United Paper Mills, Kymi, Stora Enso and such corporations certainly still existed, Nokia overshadowed everything. It was also a lesson of capitalism. In the world of ‘smokestack industry’, everything was predictable, the planning period was a decade ahead, markets meant volume and availability of capitals, energy and cheap raw materials were the key, in the new ‘hightech industry’ everything was unpredictable, the planning period was now a quartal - four months, and shares were to be purchased for speculating, not for investing for the future and harvesting the dividends.

Nokia was (and is still) the finishing school for Finnish engineers. There they would learn the true secrets of electronics, computing, telecommunication and other hightech stuff.

Finns are excellent engineers, but bad businessmen. It is said if you want to have a successful corporation, hire Finns for engineers, Germans for managers and Jews for marketing. And unfortunately the complacency of the management - not that of the engineers - hit hard. Nokia had become a prisoner of its success. The initial engineer-led management style was superceded with business-led, and it led in the catastrophe of 2011.

It was a horrible mental shock in Finland. Demoralization ensued. Everyone feared a similar disaster to the 1990s depression. And it was the depression of 2008 initiated by Lehmann Brothers which had hit globally. In the ‘smokestack industry’, corporations did not collapse nor go bankrupt nor be outsourced. They were stable, they were firm, and they were reliable. In the ‘hightech industry’, everything is unpredictable, swift, and volatile. Anything can happen. And that was yet another lesson.

Yet the 20 years of Nokia in Finland had generated a whole generation of good and competent engineers. When Nokia sold its consumer markets to Microsoft, many of the former Nokia engineers founded new businesses, new industries and new companies, and they quickly absorbed all the engineers and other personnel left redundant from Nokia.

Finland has grown out of dependency of Nokia alone. But the corporation itself is still there, and it has an amazing ability of renewing and reinventing itself. It is likely it will again reinvent itself in the future - and become something anew and yet unpredictable.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/47ox62u9fy0jcbk1', 'title': 'How has the decline of Nokia affected Finland, and Finnish people?', 'score': {'original': 0.84065, 'ai': 0.15935}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The shock has been more mental than economic.\n\nBefore Nokia’s rise, Finland was a ‘smokestack industry’ country; forestry, paper, heavy industry and process industry country.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,8y,How is GST beneficial for the country? How would it help to improve the country's economy?,"Let's say a truck is moving stuff from Delhi to Chennai. It will pass through about 8 states. During that time, it will pay a variety of taxes - octroi, VAT, excise duties and so on. Each source of tax collection is a source of confusion, corruption and delay. By the time the truck arrives at a destination in a couple of weeks, a huge amount of cost is indirectly added to the consumer. Instead of India being a common economy, we are a patchwork of dozens of economies making growth slow, business impossible and corruption high.

This problem has been recognized by the developed economies and all the progressive ones - Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Japan - have moved to a common GST (Goods and Service Tax) to provide a one common window for tax collection. With just one place of collecting taxes, there won't be much delays and corruption. When delays and corruption reduce, economy prospers. The single place for tax collection will drastically improve amount of revenues collected [since it will be much easier to verify who didn't pay] and at the same time help businesses grow. Win-Win.

India Inc pleads with lawmakers as time runs short for tax reform

Explained: How India will become a common market with GST

So, who gets to lose? All the babus and police who are in the middle and used to collecting random taxes & bribes from these businesses will lose if the taxes are streamlined. Even some businesses that are built around babu connections will lose as their competitors can grow without much political connections. The middleman is the ultimate power in India - whether it be kiranas blocking retail reforms or blocking GST through a variety of hidden tactics - and given that the consumers are sheep with no voice for themselves reforms will sleep.

The thing is, the issue is so straightforward that all the major political parties agree to it. However, it doesn't move. Because, all political parties depend on the middleman. Thus, they all keep making noise about it - with no real action.

Manisha,2y,What should be paid attention to for the development of the Indian economy?,"6 things :-

Prioritise manufacturing

It's been too long now and we've avoided talking about this. The problem is government yes, but even bigger problem is the people. We don't support anyone who wanted to start a business. Parents want their daughters to marry either a govt employee or a white/gold collar employee. Nobody cares about the blue collar sector and we can't produce one damn thing without them. Physical manufacturing is very important. It's what made China, China! That's where we have failed, spectacularly.

Relaunch Indian tourism

Forts, palaces, museums, beaches, corals, adventure sports, mountains, rivers, zoos, temples, statues, deserts, snow, trekking, forests, animals, shopping, spiritual tour, honeymoon, post retirement, children's holidays…

India has EVERYTHING (may be except Aurora but you know what I mean).

Is India tapping this huge market potential? What's the condition of Amer fort? Do you know the travel situation of Andaman islands!?

People come here, “make do” with what's available and leave.

I realised this problem when I visited Europe! They've even turned their tragedies into tourist hotspots and we don't have a single weekend show in Bundi Fort.

India needs responsible tourism and she needs it now.

I'm really furious over this one. I mean there are Spanish Steps in Italy. What are they? Steps!! Yes Trevi Fountain is good but Steps!?

For the love of all that is beautiful in this country, please Government look at this sector!!

Provide last mile connectivity

I see the work is in progress but oh dear the buses & trains and in general any kind of transport in rural India are in a sorry state of existence. This also leads to costly logistics and disconnect of rural & urban centres! Roads, railway lines and air routes are not the only things that connect the country. We need water, hospitality, medical facilities, markets, police stations, etc in remote areas too. Do we have that? At least till 5 years ago, I can name places where even a tea stall was a rarity. I just needed to drink some water. Had to wait hours before I could have a sip of clean drinking water. These issues are a blot on India's physical structure. This is a part of development that this country needs, badly…

Encourage privatisation

I'm about to use a bad word, sorry 🤫 PROFIT.

The way this one word is made the devil is beyond any sane human being's understanding. You don't earn? You don't eat. As simple as that. Profit is a step ahead, as you know.

Privatise certain sections of businesses that govt is holding in its tight grip! Are you telling me cleaning department of railway stations is a core sector job that govt should handle? When was the last time you visited a Nagar Nigam office?. The dilapidated condition of govt offices, businesses etc is worrying.

Physical appeal of a workplace is very much important to keep the enthusiasm of employees on top. One of the tricks of positive motivation? May be. They gave maintenance of Red Fort to Dalmia, right? ASI isn't doing anything to conserve the place. Dalmia should even restore the place & earn with it! Jaipur Airport maintenance has gone to Adani? What's the problem with this? Only core sector should be with govt, everything else should be open for competition. Allow me to charge for maintaining Mandava Fort and you'll see it in Padharo Mhare Des ads next year! Yeah, I can do wonders with it. But nah…

Reform Farm Sector

Well the govt tried but we love to be pauper, we love the suffering and we love the suicides that come with it. No govt for the next few decades will touch this topic with a ten foot pole. Thank your stars there wasn't any social media during 1991 NEP, else we'd see a couple riots against LPG Reforms also…

Rather than negotiating the problem areas, what we saw was blackmail & arm twisting. But that's okay. End customer was not directly suffering. Farmers were.

You know what politics is like? When in 1970s Late Mrs Indira Gandhi requested wheat from US, she was protested against here. Our politicians were ready to let our people die of hunger than swollow humiliation & feed us. She did. She fed us. She bent the knee and her people lived.

The same thing happened this time, only violently.

I'd say it again. Primary Sector of Indian economy needs urgent reforms & it needs to be done now. We're already three decades late…

We have romanticised poverty and hate the rich. I don't know who's at fault but throw this thought away NOW.

Invest in Human Resources

We all complain about brain drain. Ever thought why it happens? No don't bring in reservation here. Every welfare state of the world does it in some form or the other.

The problem is we don't give paid opportunities to our brains. We are improving business friendliness (still a lot to be done but I'm appreciating whatever has been done till now) yes but we need to provide money for those who can do wonders but are not business minded. Still confused?

Let's take an example:

Imagine Mr A gets admission in Harvard B School or London School of Economics or Cambridge Law. He'll need millions to get that course done.Every year thousands get the chance to study in top education hubs of the world. What does India do with it? Nothing. They go there, study there and get a job there. And we complain of brain drain. Now I think GoI should invest in these people and provide them money, not only to study there but also give them incentive that whatever first placement or job offer you get, you do that in India and the tax payer will fund you. NASA? Why don't you try ISRO and we'll pay what NASA offered to pay you. I understand this may not cover all sectors but in few, where we really need sharp brains, this can work. Innovation, science & tech, agriculture, software industry etc can make use of this. I don't see any other reason for them to stay back. My brother didn't come back for over a decade, and he went to Stockholm School of Economics. Why? He got the perfect job, perfect pay, perfect place to live! Why would he come back? At least I got to visit Zurich & Prague when he was there. If he had had an offer from Govt of India to work with SBI or RBI with a pay at par with what he was offered right after college he'd be here. It's not my words, it's his…

There's this really good bood “Investing in People” by Cascio, Boudreau & Fink and there's another “Power of People” by Pearson. Many techniques to bring out the best in people and keep them too.

We need to work on all sectors of economy and we need that work to start now. And start with tourism! It's our USP…

Rajveer Singh,5y,Can you explain me the economy of India?,"India is one of the largest, if not the largest economy in the world. It is predicted to be the second largest economy in the world by 2050. So, what contributes to the Indian economy? To answer this, we need to divide India’s economy into three parts and study the sectors of Indian economy in detail. We will also discuss the problems faced by each sector and solutions to these sectors respectively.

Sources of Income

Baluta System

Gross Domestic Product GDP

Indian Economy

They are three sectors in the Indian economy, they are; primary economy, secondary economy, and tertiary economy. In terms of operations, the Indian economy is divided into organized and unorganized. While for ownership, it is divided into the public sector and the private sector. But today, we are only going to talk about the sectors of Indian economy and what consists of these sectors.

Sectors of the Indian Economy

Primary Sector

The primary sector in India is the sector which is largely dependant on the availability of natural resources in order to manufacture the goods and also to execute various processes. The services in this sector are entirely dependant on the availability of the natural resources in order to keep the day-to-day operations running.

As we have the clear idea of this sector is, the best example to discuss in this sector is the agriculture sector. The other examples in this sector include fishing and forestry, but agriculture accounts for the largest in this sector.

One of the major problem that this sector faces is the underemployment and the disguised employment. Underemployment accounts for the workers not working to the best of their capabilities while the latter accounts for the workers not working to their true potential.

As a solution to the problems, the state, as well as the national government, can increase the funds for the irrigation facilities and provide loans for buying high-quality seeds and fertilizers.

Secondary Sector

The economy in the sector is dependent on the natural ingredients which are used to create the services and products offered and which at the end are used for consumption. In terms of value added to the products and services, this sector is the best sector. The major examples that fall under this category are transportation and manufacturing.

Both these sectors end product is the consumption by the people. This sector is responsible for the employment of almost 14 percent of the entire workforce currently working in India. The secondary sector also contributes to almost 28 percent of the share of GDP. This sector is the backbone of Indian economy and there are more development and growth in the near future.

Tertiary Sector

This sector contributes the largest in terms of share in GDP in India. The sector is also the service sector and is important when you consider the development of the other two sectors. Like the previous sector, this sector also adds the value to the products. This sector is responsible for employing 23 percentage of the workforce out of the total workforce currently working in India.

The example of this sector is all service sectors which IT services, consulting, etc. This sector contributes to almost 59 percent of the total share of GDP. The main problem that this sector is that the jobs which involve lower salaries do not attract much employment. And this remains the future dilemma as India is looking for double-digit growth in the near future.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nh7pfb06a3rlc19q', 'title': 'Can you explain me the economy of India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9944, 'ai': 0.0056}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'India is one of the largest, if not the largest economy in the world.

Subodh Mathur,Updated 3y,"For Jan-Mar 2020, India’s GDP growth is a measly 3.1% and that when there was no Covid impact. What has gone so terribly wrong with the economy? Is the government really to blame?","This is a rather unfortunate occurrence. India needs high growth rates.

Unfortunately, there’s no external force that we can blame. For 2019, Bangladesh has a growth rate of 7.9%, while India’s rate in around 4%.

I blame the Union and State governments. There’s a lot of talk of reaching this target and that target, but it’s all just talk. In the end, we need policies that will increase private domestic investment, The Niti Aayog head said this recently.[1] Thanks to Kishan Bhardwaj for posting this link.

There’s some comfort that the Union government has finally decided to promote MSMEs. Sidelined Make in India, which did not do much for India. But, the MSME’s fate depends more in the State governments than the Union government.

Anyhow, let’s not focus too much on who is to blame. Let’s talk about the future. The Union government needs to shift its focus back to economic growth. There have been too many distractions in the past year. And too much resistance to the ground reality - hype is enough. That has to go.

The State governments need to wake up from their sleep, particularly the large Hindi-speaking States.

Of course, 2020 will be a problem because of the coronavirus. And, no one really knows how to bounce back quickly and fully. But, I am not pessimistic. While it will be hard to fund and implement large infrastructure projects, there’s much India can do to use its existing infrastructure better. That’s what the CM must focus on: low-cost, quickly implemented actions that facilitate private investment and output.

No doubt, we have to first find a solution to the virus. It’s time to realize that India has not conquered it. Putting yourself high on international rankings, probably with dodgy data, serves no purpose. Doing better than the US is not a badge of honor. What is needed is to get the poor people back to work. That’s the Union government’s main responsibility, as I see it.

Subramaniam Duraisamy,1y,What happens in a jobless growth economy? Is India going through this phase currently?,"Thanks for A2A Sai Dileep. There are two ways to answer the question.

The first way is to include random images of India, China, Japan, Biden, Zelenskyy and then say democracy bad, Modi bad, Stalin bad…and gain 2500 upvotes in 2 hours, and experience a new found rush of dopamine. That is what data challenged ignoramuses do.
The second way is to look at data critically, understand what jobless growth is all about and lay forward a holistic perspective. The downside is my answer might get less than 100 upvotes, but upside gives me and (hopefully you) a satisfaction of learning something.

Jobless growth is a phenomenon where the economy revives without any substantial rise in income levels. Lets say there is a factory that can produce 100 mobile phones in one day and employing 100 workers. If the factory owner finds there is a way to save 20% of manpower costs and double the production, he will go for it. So the factory produces 200 mobile phones per day, but with 80 people.

Theoretically the “economic output” of the factory has improved, but they laid off 20 people. In a way- automation and better efficiency has caused “jobless growth” in the factory.

This is what happens in large nations, albeit in a complex manner. As the economy grows past the agricultural driven and leapfrogs into industry and service, businesses find it easier to produce more with less people. A growing economy always has some level of joblessness. There are three types of unemployment

Frictional unemployment: When people leave a job for many reasons [birthing a child, higher studies, starting their own business].
Structural unemployment: Caused by changes in technology, market trends. Millions of sternos and typist jobs of last century are now obsolete. These happen due to the results of innovation.
Cyclical Unemployment: Which is caused by external factors like COVID, recession, wars or due to sudden changes. This is the natural cycle of any economy. However the governments and economists can only guard against this type of unemployment.

We can never eliminate frictional unemployment since they are voluntary. We can never eliminate structural unemployment because they are a result of innovation.

In India, we have a combination of all three types of unemployment. Due to COVID and war the US economy is heading towards recession, which can impact jobs in service and finance sector of India and South East Asia. This is the cyclical unemployment we are talking about. A Bloomberg report shows the chance of recession and job cuts in US and India by 2023 is 30% likely.

However in India we have a set of challenges in measuring unemployment and income levels itself.

A large chunk of people are still employed in agricultural, who are pretty much exempt from coming under the formal economy and paying income taxes. Since this large demographic is exempt from paying income taxes, the unemployment numbers are far understated.
If we look at the formal sector, the number of employees filing taxes are too low. As of July 31, only 5 crore people have filed IT returns, which means we can safely assume these 5 Crore people are “employed” in a job. But we know how screwed the data collection mechanism is when it comes to measuring income levels. ITR filing deadline today, over 5 crore tax returns received till now
India has a lot of self employed businesses which employ less than 10 people. Imagine if there are 1 Crore small businesses like that , that is a total of 10 Crore people which are missed out.
A lot of household jobs [like child care, cleaning, cooking] which are traditionally taken care by the women of the household are not coming under the economic activity. If I employ a maid to take care of my ailing grandfather, I pay salary to her, which gets counted. If I take of my grandfather myself, that activity does not come under the formal economy. A lot of jobs like these go uncounted.

All of this is natural for a growing economy. Get out of the middle class bubble. Learn to look beyond the screaming TV reporter and the data challenged ignoramuses.

Josiah Greenbrier,Updated 3y,Why is Bavaria so wealthy?,"Because of a cunning strategy in the aftermath of the war.

Beforehand, Bavaria had been poorish and overwhelmingly agricultural. Germany’s heavy industry was mostly located in Prussia, concentrated in the Ruhr Valley and in Thuringia and Saxony.

When Germany was divided into four occupation zones by the Allies, Bavaria was almost entirely in the US sector. The eastern part of Germany, where a lot of big industrial and media companies were based, ended up in the Soviet sector, and it was clear very soon that many businesses would be nationalized and their property seized as war reparations by the Soviets.

So Bavaria with American help and advisement offered incentives for eastern industrialists and media creatives to relocate to Bavaria. They were going to flee west anyway, but the Bavarians rolled out the red carpet with cheap loans and subsidies and rebates and zoning laws and such to encourage the fleeing industrialists to move to Bavaria.

Much of the heavy industry in the Soviet sector was in the southern part of that sector, in Thuringia and Saxony, closest to Bavaria — which of course also helped attract them.

And of course where the Ruhr Valley had been bombed to ruins, had a major rebuild taking place before reentering production, and was saddled by partly outdated infrastructure (and lots of rubble), in Bavaria they were largely building from scratch on a clean slate.

From then on, Bavaria has run an interventionist, but still relatively business-friendly economy, and got a head start by attracting businesses to their state. So major businesses like Auto Union (Audi), Siemens, Allianz, much of the German film and TV industry, and so on moved to Bavaria from East Germany — while they still could.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6pfd5cm09w8yog4u', 'title': 'Why is Bavaria so wealthy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Because of a cunning strategy in the aftermath of the war.\n\nBeforehand, Bavaria had been poorish and overwhelmingly agricultural.

Hector Quintanilla,6y,Why is the rich getting richer day by day and the poor getting poorer?,"Two fishermen wake up early in the morning to go to work. Both of them work the same number of hours — from 5:00AM to 1:00PM.

Both of them have the same physical strength.

Both of them go fishing to the same location.

Both of them use a very similar boat.

One of them is rich — the other is poor.

Why?

The difference is how they fish.

The rich fisherman uses LEVERAGE. His nets catch hundreds of fish each day.

The poor fisherman uses NO leverage. His fishing lines catch just enough fish to make a living.

The more fish the rich man catches using his abundant business leverage, the cheaper the fish get, making it harder and harder to make a living, for the poor fisherman.

Anonymous,9y,What was it like to get laid off or fired during the 2007-2009 recession period in India?,"TL;DR
To be precise, the recession hit India sometime towards the 3rd quarter of 2008. I was single then, I still am.
I joined one of the technology majors in India in the middle of 2007, and was paid something in the lines of 7 lpa when i started off and was making somewhere in the range of 8-8.5 lpa in 2008. I had a very good life, chilling around with friends. I had 2 flatmates, all making similar amounts of money and we had rented a place somewhere around BTM phase 2 in Bangalore.

Sometime in the mid of 2008, a start up approached me. The company used to work on what we used to call ""Web 3.0"". I was interested but just not ready to take the risk. I talked with my flatmates and after many rounds of brainstorming about how this start up experience might help us in our own future endeavours, I said yes to the start up. My flatmates continued with their jobs in the technology major.

Things started off very well. The rate at which I was learning was way faster than what I was learning at my previous company. We were 7 people start up working on a automated photo tagging product. We were funded by an American investor who had made a fortune with shares in Microsoft or something. The investor would send $20,000 every month to keep the product development going. This money would pay for our office rent and the salary of 5 of us(22 year olds), the CTO(35 years old), and the CEO(around 40 years old). I was involved majorly on creation of the learning algorithm alongside another guy. There were a few others working on the front-end, scaling etc.

In the meanwhile, once Lehman Brothers went down, we started hearing news about lay offs. I heard about huge lay offs in Gridstone Research(One of my friends got laid off), Pangea(Another friend of mine got laid off) and many more. However, we were a little unaware. We were making good money for 22 year olds. Slowly, we started to hear that the investor was not sure how he would market the product and how he will launch it and many other things. We would see our CEO scream at things and go crazy at guys(I was at the receiving end a few times).

One day in December, the CEO and CTO called us for a meeting and told us that the investor was jittery about the product and that he basically is going to stop the funding starting January. We were all numb. We couldn't believe it but that was that. We would receive 2 months of salary and we were off, then and there.
I went back home, half crying, half trying to gather myself from all this. In the evening, two of my flatmates came back home and one of them told me about lay offs in Yahoo and that he was lucky. I told them that I need to find a new job. I come from a middle class Indian family. I didn't tell me family about my lay off. I just told my elder brother, who was like don't worry, you will get something soon. But soon wasn't soon enough.

I started applying for every possible firm that I could think of. I was ready to take a 50% pay cut, do low quality work and what and what not. I even went for a testing profile interview; I didn't clear it. It was ITC Infotech. In the meanwhile, I started working very hard on Machine Learning Techniques, R, Python and many other things. But the offer just won't come. We were not hit badly by the recession but it wasn't a good state either. In the meanwhile, we got in touch with this American businessman who had a crappy music selling website. He was from New York. I thought, I would shoot him a mail that i and my team can work on his website and do some work for him. He asked us to show us a some sample work. We said we would do something free for him. He gave us some work. He gave us 7 days. I worked the entire night that day, alongside my flatmate, and delivered what he wanted in 12 hours. Probably, the 12 most productive hours of my life. We shot a mail to him that the work was done. He promised us $1000 for the work we did and a little more. He wanted us to complete the remaining work which actually took us 2 more days. He asked us if we had a paypal account in place. We didn't have one. We created one but didn't use it because withdrawing money from Paypal is hard in India. We asked him to use Western Union Money Transfer. He promised us more work. I remember one of my friends calling me and telling me ""Dude, we are lucky, Dollar is soaring today($1 was 46 probably). We got more work from this New York gentleman, because we were super cheap. We were like $20 per hour and he was happy with the quality. The work was however on PHP. I hated it.

We started to get more work from this person. He got us in touch with more people who wanted to get cheap work done. I didn't have any work. I would work 10-12 hours daily. The two flatmates would come back home and work 2 hrs each too. We were running around $2000-$3000 per month. I would take share of 60000($1300) per month. The other two would take around 15000($350 each) per month. The rest, we would keep in a joint account. In the meanwhile, I kept applying for jobs because we knew that all this was not permanent.

Everything was okay until one day when we woke up and saw that the 3 laptops that were our lifeline basically, were stolen. Disheartened, crying, we went to the police station. It was our mistake. We didn't lock the door, when one of us left for office, and 2 of us were sleeping. The police abused us for being idiots. They took a bribe of Rs 500 to write the FIR. I have never felt as bad as that ever. However, we knew that we needed machines to keep me going atleast. We went to some Bangalore market and bought 2 second hand desktops to keep our work going. We kept working till one day in May, I finally got a job offer. I had to go to Mumbai. The other two had to remain in Bangalore. We planned that we would keep the work going. Maybe, we would start a company. We kept working for another 2 months making some money. But, one day, we finally decided, we wanted to work on something great, something that would make a ding in the universe. So, we stopped the freelance work. Since then, all 3 of us are doing well. We have tried to make a few good Machine Learning products. We have failed awfully at these, but who knows some day we might get lucky again. Maybe, we need another recession to do something good again.

Lesson learnt: Recessions are best time to start up.

I was single then, I still am.\nI joined one of the technology majors in India in the middle of 2007, and was paid something in the lines of 7 lpa when i started off and was making somewhere in the range of 8-8.5 lpa in 2008. I had a very good life, chilling around with friends. I had 2 flatmates, all making similar amounts of money and we had rented a place somewhere around BTM phase 2 in Bangalore.\n\nSometime in the mid of 2008, a start up approached me. The company used to work on what we used to call ""Web 3.0"". I was interested but just not ready to take the risk. I talked with my flatmates and after many rounds of brainstorming about how this start up experience might help us in our own future endeavours, I said yes to the start up. My flatmates continued with their jobs in the technology major.\n\nThings started off very well. The rate at which I was learning was way faster than what I was learning at my previous company. We were 7 people start up working on a automated photo tagging product. We were funded by an American investor who had made a fortune with shares in Microsoft or something. The investor would send $20,000 every month to keep the product development going. This money would pay for our office rent and the salary of 5 of us(22 year olds), the CTO(35 years old), and the CEO(around 40 years old). I was involved majorly on creation of the learning algorithm alongside another guy. There were a few others working on the front-end, scaling etc.\n\nIn the meanwhile, once Lehman Brothers went down, we started hearing news about lay offs.

Palkesh Asawa,8y,How can GST be beneficial if the tax on the goods go to the state where the product is consumed?,"This is a thought provoking question, let me attempt to explain this.


What is a ""Rich State""?


This question is based on the premise that rich states will have a higher consumption. However, there is one issue of interpretation here. In terms of taxation, a 'rich state' is a state which has a higher tax collection. We do not mean states where people are rich in general. Therefore, rich state is not about people being rich, it is about the government being rich.

And, there is a difference between the two.

Before we proceed, take a look at the tax collections of various states in India





The ""rich states"" (having high tax collections, such as - Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh etc.) are those where there are a lot of businesses - manufacturing, services etc. And since a lot of businesses are in these states, they are rich because all those businesses pay taxes to the originating state.

However, there emerges something extremely shocking when you look at another set of numbers - the population of these states -




Look at Bihar, for example. It has the third highest population in the country, but its tax collections are way down in the matrix. To get a clearer picture of this, see the chart below. It shows the per-capita tax collection of states (tax collection divided by number of people)


Bihar, which has the third highest population in the country, is only generating taxes of about Rs. 3000 per person, while sparsely populated states such as Punjab have per capita taxes as high as Rs. 40,000 per person.

Clearly, something is wrong. Let's see what it is.


Why do some states have more taxes than others?


This is not a difficult question to answer. States that have more manufacturing plants, service sector, trade and commerce will obviously pay taxes. The real question is - how come these states pay more taxes in spite of having much lower population!

How is it possible that 10 Crores of people in Bihar, combined, pay less taxes compared to only 2 Crores people in Haryana? The real issue is - there are a lot of businesses, factories etc in such states.


Why are there more businesses in some states?


The answer is: because these states, rich as they are, provide better facilities to businesses and better incentives to develop there. The state of Gujarat provides power, water, labour to industries; which encourages them to set up shop there. Hence, industries prefer to set up factories in Gujarat.

One might therefore argue, why can't states like Bihar do the same? The answer is: because they are not rich enough!


Why is Bihar not rich enough?


This is because their tax collections are lower. So, even though Bihar has to cater to a lot more number of people, it has limited finances to cover it up. This is really like a vicious cycle. Poor states cannot afford to provide better infrastructure to the industries, because of which industries can't be set up; which further pushes them down to poverty.


How can GST change this?


GST can change this because now the tax collection will go to states where consumption takes place. Goods, which were previously manufactured in Gujarat and sent to Bihar were taxed by Gujarat government; now the same goods will be taxed by Bihar government. Therefore, their tax collections will increase.

Therefore, in the long run, Bihar will be able to provide equal opportunities to industries, generating employment for their people resulting in economic upliftment of everyone!


Consumption is driven by population


Contrary to what the question believes, consumption is not more in ""rich states"", consumption is more in states with higher population. A lot of goods are manufactured in Maharashtra or Gujarat, but these are not necessarily consumed in these states itself. Most of these goods are exported to other states.

GST will ensure that this tax collection now goes to the state in which these goods are exported, so that the vicious cycle can end.

Hope it's clear now.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bmtzfnj1cg3qik07', 'title': 'How can GST be beneficial if the tax on the goods go to the state where the product is consumed?', 'score': {'original': 0.5762, 'ai': 0.4238}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This is a thought provoking question, let me attempt to explain this.\n\n\nWhat is a ""Rich State""?\n\n\nThis question is based on the premise that rich states will have a higher consumption.

I have seen the surprised look of customers as well as bankers not long ago. I have made many ATMs operational in 2000-2003 & still remember flabbergasted faces.

It has many uses including balance inquiry, such a useful machine and saves heavy transaction costs of staff over the counter. Each transaction on counter used to cost Rs 52–55, new ATM would cost only Rs 10-12 in spite of huge cost on infrastructure and operations!

But .. As technology advanced, banks offered many delivery channels. For balance enquiry, stop payment etc, saavy customers preferred Internet Banking from home instead of going to ATM. (Telephone banking - IVRS never became popular due to tedious user verification process).

At present, Banks give much more convenient delivery channels (cheque deposit kiosk, missed call banking, pass book on your mobile) for which ATM used to be popular and convenient.

Hence, use of ATM is limited to cash withdrawal at most of locations, cash deposits is still not much popular due to limitations.

The operational costs of ATM remains the same for banks, rather increased due to heavier rents. Break even of an ATM used to be 25 cash transactions in addition to other transactions.

Operation costs increased heavily in 2016 due to change in size of currency (500 & 2000). Cassettes which keeps currency looks iron box but cost is extraordinary. Due to change in size, some of them became useless or require costly recalibration.

To summarize,

Transactions at ATM decreased considerably so cost per transaction increased substantially.

And on other hand,

Cost of maintenance, rent etc have increased significantly.
All banks have installed ATM in every nook and corner. Each ATM can cater to customers of any bank. Due to density, transactions per ATM decreased considerably.

Consequently, ATM at remote locations, or locations with high density of ATM, cannot cross break even.

Profitability of ATM was reducing fast, but forthcoming recalibration due to change in size of Rs 100 is last straw on camel. This is the reason ATMs are shutting down, IMHO.

I would add, change in size and features in notes has many advantages, but that is for another day.

EDIT: I missed important point.

That is security aspect.

ATM is very simple computer.

When card is inserted, it throws simple menu. Within 3-5 steps, it has collected all the required information. It will pass on the information to ATM switch at remote location. Hi-tech Switch will process information and send response (in number). On the basis of response, ATM will fulfill or reject requirement of card holders and note down the actions it performs in its log. Very simple computation. No data is stored except log (electronic journal) and images by video surveillance camera.

Due to low requirements and direct access to limited users, softwares used were basic to save costs (before 3 years when I retired) even OS used was Microsoft XP, which is no longer supported by owner Microsoft.

But RBI sees vulnerability. Being regulator, RBI asked ATM owners to increase security. IMHO, compliance is not that costly. But costs is huge for a low margin business.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/iczpbh2o0a7qgx3s', 'title': 'What is the reason behind shutting down lakhs of ATMs in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.7532, 'ai': 0.2468}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am honored for A2A, Nagarajan Sir.\n\nShort answer is obvious - They are not profitable now.

Dima Vorobiev,3y,Was it illegal to own US dollars in the Soviet Union?,"Short answer:

Holding “currency of Capitalist countries” in the USSR was regulated much like gun ownership in most of modern Europe. Those Soviet citizens who could prove they received it under the strict rules imposed by the government, were allowed to own it under certain conditions.

In my time, holding the USD or other foreign currency in cash for regular people was more of nuisance than a privilege.

This changed during the last couple of years of the USSR. The dollar increasingly became a parallel currency for consumer items that were impossible to find in government-owned shops.

Long answer:

The Criminal Code of the RSFSR (the Soviet predecessor of today’s Russia), Article 88 provided harsh sentences up to the death penalty for “transgressions” of the governments rules for holding foreign currency. The most known victims who paid with their life for owning too much of it were the defendants in the Rokotov–Faibishenko case
.

General rules

If you weren’t a Soviet citizen, your holding foreign currency was alright.
As a Soviet citizen, if you travel abroad, your employer would provide you with some foreign currency for travel expences and per diem a few days ahead of the departure.
When you returned home, you couldn’t keep the remaining cash in your home. You handed it back to the State, and you got some currency-denominated tokens for the use in special shops with restricted admission, so-called “Beryozka” retail system.
If someone abroad paid you for anything in hard currency, you handed it over to the State. After taking its cut, the Soviet State deposited the remainder on special currency account in its bank in your name. You wouldn’t be able to cash it in unless you’re traveling abroad again. To wire the money abroad in order to cash it in a foreign bank, you would need a special permission from the State.
In case someone caught you with the money in your pocket, you had to explain where exactly the currency came from. If you didn’t receive it from the State, or didn’t declare it when returning home from abroad, you were in deep trouble. This was enough for opening a criminal case against you under the Article 88.
Even if you “lawfully” acquired the currency for your foreign stay and declared the remainder at the customs at the return, but didn’t hand it back within a few weeks, you violated the rules. This wouldn’t necessarily result in prosecution, but could leave a fat nasty blotch in your personal file.

Safety rules

Career-minded people like me tried not to hold the currency at home. Burglars could lay hand on it. When travelling abroad the next time, there was a chance that the customs would require documentation on the declared sum of money, and the surplus amount would be busted.

Offering the currency as payments under the table inside the country rarely made sense. Even if your dentist could use it for procuring gold and jewellery as a nest egg for emigration to Israel, it was too risky. The simple fact of transaction in foreign money inside the USSR would make both parts targets of the Article 88. “Up to the death penalty”, remember?

Flashing your wealth

Generally, offering US dollars as payment even to people you knew was like taking a stroll around your apartment block with a Kalashnikov in your hands. No one might arrest you, but a whole lot of people would learn that you have something interesting at home. You would appear on several radars where you really didn’t want to be, including the worst sort of criminals.

Twilight zone

Life was somewhat different in the port cities of the USSR. Several ethnic communities were living off the smuggling business there. It was also home to many sailors who received parts of their payment in foreign currency. In the grey zone between a simple “transgression of rules” and outright violation of Article 88, they turned over many more dollars, punds, francs, liras, and suchlike.

Here, you ran a different kind of risk. As people in close contact with foreigners, the Soviet smugglers and sailors were a constant source of interest for the local cops and especially KGB. Every time you undertook a transaction in hard currencies inside the USSR, you risked falling prey to their operations. They were not so much eager to put you behind bars. Rather, they preferred keeping you as an informant or pawn in their games. Sooner or later, you would risk finding yourself blackmailed, maimed, tortured, killed, or doing things you totally didn’t want to do.

As people in close contact with foreigners, the Soviet smugglers and sailors were a constant source of interest for the local cops and especially KGB. Every time you undertook a transaction in hard currencies inside the USSR, you risked falling prey to their operations. They were not so much eager to put you behind bars. Rather, they preferred keeping you as an informant or pawn in their games. Sooner or later, you would risk finding yourself blackmailed, maimed, tortured, killed, or doing things you totally didn’t want to do.\n\nAdditional reading\n\nWhy did the Soviet Union have cash to allow to buy state produced goods?\nWhy didn't the USSR abolish money?\nThe Soviet Union tried to abolish money and failed. Did it try to abolish the state and classes? If yes, how?\nWas the Great Famine in Ukraine planned in order to lure gold out of Ukrainians?\n\nBelow, a Torgsin shop at Petrovka 6 in Moscow\n, one of three such shops opened in Moscow. They vacuumed foreign currency, jewellery, gold out of people’s stashes in the USSR. Amid the country-sized hole of poverty, food shortages, and dearth of simple consumer items, you could come here with your “Capitalist currency”, exchange it into “Torgsin cheques”, and buy food, cloth, shoes, other items, no question asked.\n\nIn my time, this evolved into the system of Beryózka retail stores\n. However, the currency control was much more strictly enforced. And the Torgsin stories of people walking in with gold and silver bars would simply be impossible in the |970s and 1980s."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9779

Susanna Viljanen,3y,What’s wrong with the Scandinavian model of economics?,"The climate.

Scandinavia is located between the 55th and 71st degrees North. It means we have winter five to seven months each year, short growth season for crops, Atlantic comes down from sky each spring and autumn, and oh, did I mention the rasputitsa?

In short: failing in economy means death. I mean, literally, because poor people tended to freeze to death every Autumn. Tulis talvi ja tappais köyhät (Wish the winter would come and kill the poor!) is an age-old malediction in Finland. The direct consequence is everyone attempts to avoid failure and ensuing bankruptcy at any cost and not take any risks.

While the Scandinavian social security has today made the death from exposure due to poverty a thing from the past, this mindset is still very much deeply rooted in the Scandinavian soul. Scandinavians rather play safely than take high-paying but potentially disastrous risks. The risk aversion is very typical for all Scandinavian countries, which prefer slow but steady affluence than maximizing the gradient of getting rich. The consequence is that a) state-owned corporations are the boldest risk takers and b) people prefer to rather work in corporate world than become entrepreneurs. Personal bankruptcy was recognized in the Scandinavian judicial systems only in the 2000s: “how can a personal bankruptcy happen because you really cannot kill the debtor and divide his organs between his creditors?” Before the 2000s, any debts followed you until death. There was no way to get rid out of debt before death except suicide.

Even today, bankruptcy is essentially a social death sentence. You really never get a second chance anymore if you fail. There must be something profoundly wrong in you if you let things go so bad you get bankrupt.

The climate also makes business difficult. Not only does it set strict requirements on infrastructure, buildings and traffic routes, but it also means 5 to 6 months of miserable darkness each year due to celestial geometry. This darkness is poison to the psyche, and has effects on psychology. It is no secret Scandinavians are heavy drinkers - getting plastered is simply a coping mechanism against that soul-shattering darkness.

I wish we could hoist the anchors and move down 10 degrees more south. Life would be less stressful then, and we might not drink ourselves to death anymore.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rnaiogzmuk5feb68', 'title': 'What’s wrong with the Scandinavian model of economics?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The climate.\n\nScandinavia is located between the 55th and 71st degrees North.

Shashank Goyal,Updated 5y,How true is it that India will surpass the UK as the 5th largest economy?,"Yes, it is true that currently India is breathing down UK’s neck with both economies being close to $2.5 trillion each in nominal GDP [1] [2]
UK’s GDP is estimated to grow at around 1.3% [3] compared to India’s estimated growth rate of 7% to 7.5% [4]
With this growth differential, Indian economy will overtake both UK and France before the end of this decade (2020) [5]
Before end of next decade (2030), India’s economy ($6.6 trillion) is estimated to be almost twice that of UK ($3.5 trillion) [6]

However, the above should be consumed only with the following additional factors of consideration -

Nominal GDP is just one indicator of overall economic situation
UK’s GDP per capita ($40k) is more than 20 times higher than India’s GDP per capita ($1.8k)
There are more billionaires in India (131) than in UK (54),[7] but India is also home to more than 200 million people living below the line of poverty
GDP growth is necessary, but not the sufficient indicator for overall economic growth. India may shortly reach 5th in nominal GDP, but currently it ranks 140th[8] in per capita GDP, 131st[9] in Human Development Index, 46th[10] on Innovation Index and 46th [11] in Quality of life
GDP increase is admirable, but India needs to continue improving on all these additional parameters too to ensure an inclusive and more meaningful growth

Bala Senthil Kumar,1y,How can India take infinite advantage of the current Sri Lanka economic crisis?,"It is one of Sri Lanka’s own making.

It would help if we just watched as Sri Lankans came to their own conclusions about their country, their choices, and their goals.

A much touted peaceful country, which boasts of a higher human development index than India, and by every boasts, claims superiority over most things Indian, should be able to stand up on its own. But we know it cannot.

It hasn’t yet bottomed out, but it is getting there. Scratch is a good place to start any reform from.

India should just ensure there is no massive refugee influx from Sri Lanka, because that would not just be the inevitable fallout, it would be the most convenient reason for some of them to escape from their own failures.

That said, it should not be too hard to stabilise a small economy like Sri Lanka’s. Their fundamentals are not sound at the moment, and it will take some repair, but the elephant in the room is revenue. Where is Sri Lanka going to generate revenue from? Tourism is at an all time low, and it was their prime source.

When a country imports almost everything, it becomes weak and dependent. If it cannot earn enough foreign capital to purchase, it has to hawk things that future generations will have to pay for. Right now, the ruling class in Sri Lanka is a bunch of incompetent nincompoops, that thought China was the panacea for their problems, and they borrowed recklessly.

China would love to see India bleed, then make a re entry, pay the usual bribes, and get their pound of flesh, which is already owed to it.

So, that leaves India with a simple choice, albeit a tough one. India should ask Sri Lanka to open up an Exclusive Economic Zone, including port access, for India - in exchange for a bailout package. As part of this settlement, India should also ask for first right of refusal on any project, be it infrastructure, or power or development.

India should also help install a government or group of leaders that is respectful of India’s regional concerns, and not do anything provocative, especially using China as leverage.

No gifts, only lines of credit. As much as possible, only material aid, not money. It would be wonderful to see Sri Lanka offer China a ship load of Indian rice instead of money to settle a loan.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/631yv07sjqz2hfpa', 'title': 'How can India take infinite advantage of the current Sri Lanka economic crisis?', 'score': {'original': 0.9952, 'ai': 0.0048}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It is one of Sri Lanka’s own making.\n\nIt would help if we just watched as Sri Lankans came to their own conclusions about their country, their choices, and their goals.\n\nA much touted peaceful country, which boasts of a higher human development index than India, and by every boasts, claims superiority over most things Indian, should be able to stand up on its own.

So what will trigger the next recession?

It's become a new Wall Street adage that economic recoveries don't usually die of old age. Rather, they are often the result of an active central bank policy to slow an overheating economy.

However, a new report from the Bank of International Settlements, an association of 60 member central banks around the world, suggests that's not the way it's going down next time around (and they don't try to predict when that time will be):

""The main cause of the next recession will perhaps resemble more closely that of the latest one - a financial cycle bust,"" the BIS report says.

""While an inflation spurt cannot be excluded, it may not be the main factor threatening the expansion, at least in the near term,"" the BIS adds. ""Judging from what is priced in financial assets, also financial market participants appear to hold this view.""

Yet Fed officials seem squarely focused on the potential for overheating as they continue to raise interest rates this year despite signs that inflation is actually moving further below the central bank's 2% target, which it had already undershot for the bulk of this recovery.

New York Fed President William Dudley is worried the unemployment rate could ""crash"" if the Fed doesn't tighten monetary conditions, leading to a bout of unforeseen inflation that forces the central bank to hike rates even faster.

Bank for International Settlements

The report points to a lack of wage growth, due in part to the globalization of the labor force and increased automation, as key factors in restraining inflation. ""Labor's lower pricing power is consistent with the decline in Labor's income share in many advanced economies. And it may also help explain why wages have not always kept up with productivity trends.""

Bank for International Settlements

""In light of the above, the potential role of financial cycle risks comes to the fore,"" the report says.

The recessions of the early 1990s had already begun to show a similar pattern, the BIS says, even if they were not nearly as deep as the Great Recession. Those downturns were ""preceded by outsize increases in credit and property prices, which collapsed once monetary policy started to tighten, leading to financial and banking strains.""

The depth of the 2007-2009 recession, which began with the popping of a historic housing bubble but quickly infected an overindebted banking sector, made those earlier events look like small ripples.

Misha Firer,Nov 18,What is the Achille’s heel of the Russian economy?,"Military Museum in Catherine Park, Moscow. AUTHOR’S PHOTOS.

“Russians are legally employed beggars”

“50% of large families in Russia live in poverty.”

O. Golodets, Deputy Prime Minister

In regards to the last quote, Russian government is pushing hard for elevating birth rates by banning women’s access to contraception and abortion.

However, for every additional child that a woman has in her care, her chances of falling into poverty increase significantly.

The government officials believe that serfs would commit personal sacrifices for the sake of making the state nobility happy.

This reminds me of a bucket in the discount food store that I saw the other day with a printed piece of paper saying that it was for the donations to the veterans of the Special Military Operation. I looked inside there was nothing but a gob of spit.

The immoral ruling elites, all of whom are comfortably well off, knowingly condemn the new generation to live in destitution and negligence as mothers are forced to take two-three jobs just to survive.

The Achilles heel of the Russian economy is meagre salaries that people earn. When you can barely make the ends meet, there’s no space to thrive and no motivation to excel in what you do.

I noticed that Russian trolls on Quora show official stats of the average salaries to prove that Russians are not poor.

However, what the authorities do is they slap together wages of the rich bosses (nachalstvo) and the poor and you get a sum that nobody earns nor heard of anyone earning.

A common salary in the regions is around $300–$400 a month.

In Moscow, the medium salary of 54,000 rubles ($600). 77% of salaries in Moscow are below 87,000 ($900) a month. And yet officially the average salary is 125,000 rubles when you add super high earners.

The salary of salespeople in shopping centers is from $150–200 a month, salary of teachers is from $130 a month. The salary in call centers is from $70 a month, the salary in factory production is from $100 a month.

Employers calmly give out wages everywhere below the subsistence level and lower than what is indicated in the vacancies at the employment center.

Eight million households stopped paying utility bills in Russia this year.

The workload rarely corresponds to the salary as one serf is forced to do work of two or three serfs.

Why people don’t protest and rebel? The last two times they did in 1917 and 1991 , savage bandits came to power through being more violent than the other parties and ended up destroying what people had built through hard work.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/do2iprfube7xsqgj', 'title': 'What is the Achille’s heel of the Russian economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Military Museum in Catherine Park, Moscow.

Subodh Mathur,4y,Is the economic situation in India worrisome or is it a crisis? IMF and Arvind Subramanian have expressed deep concern about the current slowdown.,"The deep concern is justified because India is missing a golden opportunity to reduce poverty. At 5% GDP growth, the economy does not create enough jobs for the millions of young Indians who are coming of working age. Nor does it create enough rural incomes to keep farmers out of debt.

The Union government says it will take actions to promote more growth. So far, it has not worked. However, it’s just wrong to focus only on the Union government. India’s Chief Ministers have a major role to play in economic growth. Here is a llnk to my op-ed in the Times of India about it. Time for CMs to take control: Here are the things they can do to raise India’s economic growth rate

In this op-ed, I define 7 States as W7 -critical for economic growth. I am preparing another article about the Next 5 States - W Bengal, Rajasthan, MP, T’gana and Odissa. We cannot focus anymore on just the Union government.

Note that I write Union government. This is the correct term in the Constitution. The term Government of India is misleading - seems to give it more powers than the State governments. The term was accurate under British rule - not after 1950.

I also don’t write Central government. This is misleading. It seems to imply that this government is in the center, surrounded by satellite governments. Not so. In the Constitution, State governments has their powers directly from the Constitution, not from anywhere else. So, please, use the correct term - Union government.

These are the success stories that make India great. Kids of poor parents are able to get into the national system though hard work at studies -with some occasional support from guides and benefactors.

Asharam Choudhary, the son of a ragpicker in Madhya Pradesh cracked the AIIMS MBBS [top medical school] in his first attempt. The boy secured 707 [rank] all India ranking.

Paul Harding,4y,Why do Illinois and Connecticut have a net population decline?,"People are fleeing Illinois at an alarming rate. A lot of that is just people following the jobs. Illinois tax and regulatory policies have chased out so many businesses that it's often difficult for people to find decent jobs here. Of those who are fortunate enough to be in good, stable jobs, every other one you talk to has a plan to move to another state as soon as they retire.

In fact, that retirement situation is getting so bad that our current legislature and governor are floating plans to build a sort of Berlin Wall to keep people in. Well, ok, it's not a physical wall of course, but it's a plan to force people to leave some of their money here in Illinois if they decide to leave when they retire - a sort of “exit tax.” When you've created a state so dysfunctional that you have to penalize people for leaving, you should take the hint that you're not running it very well.

A state like California, with its beautiful landscape and climate, can put more pressure on its citizens and business owners, and they'll put up with it to keep living there (though many of them are fleeing to places like Colorado and Texas as well). Illinois has a relatively miserable climate and boring landscape though. When the state legislature starts heaping on the misery, chasing out the employers, and raising taxes while reducing basic services (like keeping the roads repaired), people start running out of reasons to stay here.

When you go downstate, where I live, there are a lot of pleasant, unpretentious little towns that are still a good place to live and raise kids, if you're OK with small town living (it's not for everybody). We pay our high taxes to the state, and every year they send back a little bit of that tax money to help fund our schools. Every year there are credible reports that the state is too broke to send back that money. Most years the payments are late, meaning that the schools can't make any plans which depend upon that funding.

Thirty or forty years ago, state employees were promised generous pensions if they would accept lower wages. This was actually a good deal for taxpayers. The yearly cost of funding those pension funds was more than offset by the money saved on wages, and the interest gained over the course of decades, on huge, state-sized investment accounts, would make it easy to pay the pensions when they came due. Well, it would have been easy if the state had actually made those comparatively small payments each year. Instead, they used those pension funds as their own, special interest piggy banks, and now they're way behind. Writing those pension checks is enormously expensive when you've squandered the 30 years of capital plus interest which were supposed to fund them.

Our new governor is promising yet another tax increase to recover the squandered pension fund money so that we can pay what we owe to all these retirees. I can't really blame him. We have to pay what we owe, as it's not the retirees’ fault that the state raided the pension funds they had paid into for all those years. The only way to raise the money to pay those debts in the short term is to raise taxes. The problem is that Illinois already has high taxes, and raising them even more is simply going to accelerate the process of chasing businesses and jobs out of the state. There's nowhere else to get the money. It's not like we can skimp any more on our road maintenance. I already drive under overpasses that are draped with nets to keep the crumbling concrete from falling on the cars below.

Illinois is a sinking ship, and people are abandoning it like crazy. Many of them voted for the politicians who created this mess and now will escape the consequences by moving to a more functional state where they will, unfortunately, use their votes to attempt to bring that state down to a level similar to Illinois’. Many of them were never satisfied with the state of affairs in Illinois, though, and are taking their first opportunity to move to a state where like-minded people are in the majority.

On paper Illinois should be a prosperous state. With Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River, and lots of flat land not prone to flooding, our geography is conducive to industry and business. We have much of the best farm ground in the world, which also opens up the potential for all of the industry that goes along with farming. In Chicago we have one of the world's centers for business and finance. Unfortunately, Chicago's political legacy is basically descended from the days when Al Capone ran that city, and its politics dominate the whole state. Get South of I-80, and you are in a different world, nothing at all like the cesspool of Chicago corruption, but it's still all dominated by a state legislature mostly elected in Chicago.

That's why Illinois’ population is declining. Decades of short sighted, and often blatantly corrupt, state governance, dominated by Chicago, have degraded what should be a prosperous state to the point where it's starting to look like it's too late to save it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a0nx2buzqlvjmh1e', 'title': 'Why do Illinois and Connecticut have a net population decline?', 'score': {'original': 0.3954, 'ai': 0.6046}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""People are fleeing Illinois at an alarming rate.

Aryan,3y,Why do the rich become richer and the poor poorer?,"When I was 17 I noticed my parents always asked me “Have you completed your work?”

Instead of asking “How many hours did you study today?”

My parents were middle class and it was deeply ingrained in their subconscious!

They were always working to not loose their job instead of working to be the best in office!

This is the problem, even when you toss a coin, you imagine which side you want and it effects the outcome every time!!!

Every thought in your mind manifests itself in physical reality!

He is Michael Phelps

He has a record of breaking all records!

He wanted to create the world record of winning 8 Gold Medals in Olympics.

He wrote his goal on every wall in his house!

In whichever direction he sees, he found his goal written!

This forced him to practice 12 hours everyday irrespective of the festivals, holidays!

And my god!

It works!

He has broken all records in swimming!

This is the power of subconscious.

Whatever you want to achieve, record it and listen it 24 hours everyday with earphones!

Write it down on every wall of your house!

Your family members will think you are crazy and yes!

All the successful people are crazy psychopaths!

There are no secrets as you were expecting, only simple habits.

Most people think getting rich is impossible!?!?!?

I have read 700 books on Money and Success and I found Only '7 Habits' which have worked for all the successful and super successful people and thousands of ""normal"" people like Me to make our own fortune!

You can learn them from the Video in My Bio... It will be the Last Video For Your Best Life!

Subodh Mathur,Updated 3y,India's GDP grew by 4.7% in Q3FY20. Is this a sign that the economy might be on the verge of rebound?,"Most likely. But, that’s not enough.

Dino Dionne,Updated 3y,Why is the stock market soaring while the economy is down?,"I get this question very often now! The long answer is exhausting and the short one is: The Fed. The Fed literally has promised to bail-out everyone no matter how large and crooked their mistakes! The markets are forward looking! They are trying to predict the future.

I posted this today on my LinkedIn account:

“I’ve worked on WS for over 20 years! I’ve never been ashamed of my career until recent weeks! It’s a bad joke when 14 million people can’t even file for unemployment benefits, struggling financially and mentally, and markets celebrate corporate socialism! I have no idea how a self-proclaimed capitalists can take money from the impoverished tax-payers and sleep at night?!

It’s disgusting!

And yet again, I guess everyone must have completely lost their mind!

Watch out for Unemployment numbers to get even uglier in future months coupled with historical Chapter 11 filings! “

When in doubt- look at Oil, Interest Rates, Bond Markets, Dollar, Gold and Financials. They are predicting Armageddon.

Dima Vorobiev,8mo,What made the Soviet Union's economy become unsuccessful?,"“What made the Soviet Union's economy unsuccessful?”

Several factors. The most overlooked one is a rejection of economic constraints. The mantra of Stalinism was, “There are no fortresses that the Bolsheviks couldn’t take.”

Or, as a joke from my time had it:

In the middle of the battle, the heavy machine gun falls silent.

— Comrade Commissar, I’m out of ammo!

— Comrade Ivanov, you’re a Party member. Show some Communist spirit!

And the heavy machine gun starts shooting again.

Heavy theory

This is a great paradox of Marxism. In theory, it postulates the primacy of economy (“the basis”) over ideology and politics (“the superstructure”). In practice, it’s a teaching of political action that shall transform the economic “basis.” In Marxist speak, it “harmonizes” the superstructure with the basis.

Are you in the mood to know why? Because the basis consists of two parts, the “productive forces” and “relations of production.” According to Marx, under Capitalism, the relations of production do not keep up with the productive forces. Hence, the disbalances, crises, class struggle, oppression, the works. The proletarian political muscle shall cut through this mess.

Proletarians of all countries, unite! Remember the battle cry? This is 100% politics, 0% economy.

Economy is politics

Communists started out as the most successful clandestine group in history. They were masters of undercover funding. But there stopped their interest in economic matters. The mindset of expropriating the bloodsuckers and leeches made them the champions of Raubwirschaft (“plunder economy”) as the development strategy wherever the Communists took power.

Maoists and the Korean Kims were not blessed with Russia’s natural riches. Much sooner than us, they hit the wall of economic constraints once the property of vanquished exploiters was digested. Hence the medieval brutality of the Kims. Hence Mao’s appetite for a global war that led him to break with the USSR and our heresy of “peaceful competition” with Capitalism.

Abundance around the corner

Labor creates all wealth we see around us, right?

From this trite observation, the Communists deduced that all it takes to get results is to throw enough labor at the task. Hence the labor armies, the Gulag, the Great Leap, and other epic projects. Russia’s and China’s demography in the first half of the 20th century gave a bottomless resource of human lives. And outside our borders, there were untold riches owned by the Imperialists and their local sidekicks, waiting to be expropriated like we did with the German and Japanese stuff in WW2.

Why would Stalin and Mao think of constraints? Cost accounting is bunk. Shed the blinkers of bourgeois theories! Trust the creative energies of workers and peasants! One day there will be enough of everything for everyone!

How did the Soviet Union come to stagnate after their rapid growth during the 60s?

Toward the end of Soviet rule, thanks to universal education, the 101 of economic sanity started to spread through the body of Communist management.

The exhaustion of demographic wealth was obviously an eye-opener, even for Stalinists. General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev even launched a campaign, “The economy must be economical.” Hilarity ensued, with jokes like “Beauty must please the eye!” and “The water must be humid!”. Embracing the basics of the real-life economy started a tectonic process in the heads of Vladimir Putin and the men of his generation. Ultimately, they dismantled the Marxist project and put Russia back on solid Capitalist tracks.

Below, a Soviet cartoon from my time in propaganda. The title is “Technical Progress in the Countryside.”

Two inventive men are preparing firewood for heating during winter. They put a heavy construction machine to the task of chopping logs. The beast is obviously spending much more energy in the process than the firewood ever can produce. Depreciation, transport, insurance, all wasted. Under Capitalism, this is value destruction, a clear case of economic inefficiency.

However, under Soviet cost accounting, the value of two men’s work armed with an expensive machine drives up the value of the chopped logs. The expensive firewood increases the national GDP. This looks good on the stat sheets.

But most importantly, the firewood will keep a few Soviet citizens warm through the winter. And the Soviet motto was “Everything for man, for man’s weal!”. Not for profit!

Frank Gardner,4y,Will interest rates drop soon in the US?,"Uncertainty looms ahead as we transition into 2019. But one thing remains clear: Borrowing costs — at least for now — are still going up.

Thanks to the world cryptocurrency leaders for bringing in other options of earning cryptocurrency

The Federal Reserve rattled markets by raising its benchmark interest rate in December, bringing the total number of rate hikes in 2018 to four. Short-term interest rates will keep climbing, but the central bank signaled that there could be two interest rate increases this year instead of the three it previously projected.

Expect more volatility as the stock market responds to the daily news cycle, says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst. It all depends on how trade talks with China play out, but in the first quarter, McBride says we’ll probably see a strong market rally of more than 10 percent followed by a return to bear market territory for the S&P 500. As the year progresses, the economy is expected to slow while fears of an impending recession will grow.

Though policymakers have suggested that the next Fed rate hike may not happen for another several months, borrowers with outstanding balances should be prepared to pay more out of pocket. Whether you’re struggling to get rid of high-interest credit card debt or preparing to buy a new house or car, here’s what rising interest rates could mean for your wallet.

Mortgage rates headed back up

Mortgage rates have fallen in recent weeks amid market fluctuations, trade tensions and other political concerns. But experts say that trend should soon reverse.

“After a sharp drop in December, markets are poised to rebound any moment given the solid underlying economic fundamentals, and this will take bond yields and mortgage rates back up,” McBride says. “When investors are ready to embrace risk assets again, that won’t be good news for mortgage rates.”

Many industry analysts expect the average rate for 30-year fixed mortgages to hit 5 percent in 2019. Currently, it’s around 4.7 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield — which mortgage rates tend to follow — could rise close to 3.5 percent before falling back down to 2.45 percent by the end of 2019, McBride says.

Mortgage rates rose almost a full percentage point over the course of 2018. But this year, rates shouldn’t jump back up too quickly and we should be in a steadier rate environment, says Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.

“I would expect over the next couple of quarters we’ll get back on this path of low increases in rates,” Fratantoni says. “And honestly, I expect that we’re going to be in a pretty good position for the spring housing market with rates a little bit lower than we have seen just a few months ago (and) more inventory in the market.”

As the Fed trims its balance sheet and pushes up short-term interest rates, McBride believes mortgage rates will pass 5.25 percent. Eventually, they’ll dip, he says, with the average rate for 30-year fixed mortgages falling to 4.35 percent as we close out 2019.

Home equity borrowers will pay a bit more

The latest Fed rate hike doesn’t mean much for homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages. But if you have an adjustable-rate mortgage with a rate that will soon adjust or a home equity line of credit, your interest rate is probably going up.

Most HELOCs are tied to the prime rate, which follows the Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate. Since the central bank raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point in December, the prime rate went up by the same amount.

“Each rate hike means the minimum payment on a $30,000 home equity line increases by $6,” McBride says. “I expect the Fed to raise rates twice next year, bringing the increase in minimum payments to $12.50 per month by year end.”

HELOC rates will rise and then flatten out, McBride says. He expects the average HELOC rate to reach 6.85 percent by the end of 2019. Borrowers concerned about rising monthly payments can refinance and choose a fixed-rate loan. Or they can ask lenders to freeze the interest rate tied to their unpaid balances. Either way, there are steps you may need to take to qualify for one of those options.

“Pull copies of your credit report to make sure there are no errors that would drag down your credit score,” McBride says. “Pay down other debt so your debt ratio is in line, and most importantly, stay current on all of your obligations.”

Slight jump in credit card interest payments

Credit card holders carrying a balance will also pay a bit more following the latest Fed rate hike. Bankrate data shows that average credit card rates are about 17.6 percent. By the end of 2019, McBride predicts that they’ll hit 18.1 percent.

Even with two additional Fed rate hikes potentially on the horizon, however, the impact on credit card holders should be minimal.

“I expect rates to rise one-half percentage point in response to two Fed hikes, but because of minimum payments, the household budget impact is muted,” McBride explains. “On a $10,000 balance, that would only increase the minimum monthly payment by $4.”

Still, there are solutions if you’re feeling insecure about the amount of credit card debt you’re sitting on. A balance transfer credit card, for example, can save you money, and the best cards have a zero percent introductory offer that applies for 15 months or more.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/80eb7y3hj4nz912t', 'title': 'Will interest rates drop soon in the US?', 'score': {'original': 0.92795, 'ai': 0.07205}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Uncertainty looms ahead as we transition into 2019.

Elena Gold,6mo,Why is the Russian Ruble collapsing?,"Today the Russian ruble hit 100 to 1 USD — and didn’t stop there: it went all the way to 101.

100.88 RUB/US Dollar
110.4 RUB/EURO
13.86 RUB/yuan

1 dollar is now 100 rubles, but Russians don’t panic – this is why:

55% of the population have loans; they don't care or even will be even better off with the cheaper ruble;
47% of Russians have no savings at all, they don't care either;
About 5% of Russians have savings in foreign currency, they have won.
Only 5–7% of people have sizable deposits in banks in rubles, but these are patriots. They just endure the pain for the benefit of the greatness of Russia!

However, such a cheap ruble will be a huge headache for the banks. They issued loans when the US dollar was worth 60 rubles, and now will get back much cheaper rubles.

The following factors continue to play against the Russian currency:

There is no inflow of additional earnings from the increase in oil prices, as foreign currency is left in offshore accounts (to buy “grey import” parts for missiles, machinery and planes).
The foreign currency deficit in Russia is about U.S. $3 billion per month.
Without drastic measures, the value of US dollar will reach 115-120 rubles, Alor Broker predicted.

Consequences of the ruble dropping in value:

Inflation hike: first, everything imported will cost more in rubles. Then everything else will catch up.
Death of dreams about ""technological sovereignty"" of Russia.
Likely increase in interest rates.
Difficulties for the Ministry of Finance with attracting ruble loans.

Meanwhile, a Duma member from Chuvashia said that Russians don’t care about the ruble hitting 100 against the U.S. Dollar.

""There are smiles on the faces, and there is no stress,"" Anatoly Aksakov, head of Duma’s financial market committee, said about Russians’ attitude to the news.

Anatoly Aksakov: Ruble drops to over 100:1 to USD? Russians don’t care!

Meanwhile, in Chuvashia, the region that Aksakov represents, 177,000 people live below the poverty line.

The poverty line is the income of 11,800 rubles per month ($118 in today’s exchange rate).
At the same time, the median salary in Chuvashia is 14,000, or $140.
The median monthly salary in the whole of Russia is about 50,000 rubles or $500, minimum wage – $162, pension – $200.

This is the result achieved in the 23rd year of Putin's rule.

In the last year, the average monthly pension in Russia increased from 18,500 to 19,500 rubles. That is, the average monthly pension dropped from 294 to 177 euros. What pensioners can buy with this money is now much, much less – most part of the pension retirees spend on paying for electricity, gas, water, rates, they have little left to buy food or essentials, cost of which went up by about 50% in a year.

The poorer are the people of Russia, the easier it will be for army recruiters to score more meat. The wages and death payments also become cheaper.

At the same time, foreign parts don’t cost any less. The purchase of gadgets like thermal imagers, canopies for weapons, turnstiles, etc., which are usually crowdfunded by volunteers, will be harder to fund. And that’s good news.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rp16swlbo4jkq90i', 'title': 'Why is the Russian Ruble collapsing?', 'score': {'original': 0.4972, 'ai': 0.5028}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Today the Russian ruble hit 100 to 1 USD — and didn’t stop there: it went all the way to 101.\n\n100.88 RUB/US Dollar\n110.4 RUB/EURO\n13.86 RUB/yuan\n\n1 dollar is now 100 rubles, but Russians don’t panic – this is why:\n\n55% of the population have loans; they don\'t care or even will be even better off with the cheaper ruble;\n47% of Russians have no savings at all, they don\'t care either;\nAbout 5% of Russians have savings in foreign currency, they have won.\nOnly 5–7% of people have sizable deposits in banks in rubles, but these are patriots.

Harmeet Singh Hunjan (ਹਰਮੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਹੰਜਨ),3y,How can India achieve a $5 trillion economy goal? Is it possible in the current situation?,"The goal of making India a $5 Trillion economy has been discussed a lot, many have dismissed the aspiration by calling it impossible, while many are optimistic about the goal. To speak realistically and analyzing the question. We need to answer the following question.

“If a $5 trillion economy really possible and if yes, what are the conditions and requirements necessary to achieve the goal?”

The answer to the above question is “Yes”, but it comes with a basic condition and many requirements that we need to undertake for becoming successful.

Condition:

India cannot achieve its aspirational goal of becoming a $5-trillion economy by 2024-25 unless it sustains a growth rate of about 11.5% percent per annum for the next 4 years. The COVID pandemic has not only hit the economy badly but has also created various conditions that will only create hurdles in achieving the goal. But it is not impossible.

I’ll try to list the necessary requirements to make India a $5 trillion economy.

#1. Increase ease of business and ease of living to enable the private sector to create wealth over a long period of time.

In the past few years, we have been moderately successful in presenting India as a potential hub for foreign investments and also as an alternative to other South-Asian countries. But still, there are few aspects that need to improve to improve further.

We need to fare well in various other parameters that play a huge role in easing business and attracting investors like Enforcement of contracts, ease of getting credit for setting up the business, and also catering to the need of big players but not at the cost of letting down minority investors.

If we are able to bring about reforms and perform well in this particular sector, we may see ourselves a step closer to the dream of a $5 trillion economy.

#2 Urbanization

The process of cities is important because cities are centers of growth, they are centers of dynamism, they are centers of innovation, and they bring in a spirit of economic growth.

Presently 63% of Indian GDP is contributed by the urban centers of the country. But the total urban land area in India is just over 6% and caters to 31% of the total population. This shows that with increased urbanization and increased level of industrialization of rural areas will play a huge role in India’s progress and also generate employment that’ll boost the nation’s GDP.

The above graph evidently shows how Urbanisation and Per Capita GDP are interlinked to each other by showing a relative comparison of China, the US, and India.

Hence Urbanisation is another step that will take us closer to a $5 trillion economy.

#3. Benefit from Globalisation and realizing Protectionism will not help much.

If we realistically think of a $5 Trillion economy, Protectionism would definitely not help us in achieving the goal. We need to accept the fact that we exist in a globalized world. China has grown on the back of exports. Japan and South Korea too would pin Globalisation to be one of the important factors in supplementing their progress as an economy. All these countries have benefited from globalization by penetrating the American as well as European markets.

India must learn the art of size and scale, of manufacturing to the size of the scale and to penetrate. India's share in global export is less than 2%.

India needs to create 5 or 6 large autonomous economic zones where the ease of doing business is immense and restraints are almost next to none. The second is our ability to push out goods for exports in a very fast time. So, the cost of logistics must fall sharply, and there, technology must come into play. The cost of logistics in India is still high, which we must bring down. One of the key things we've done is to open up our economy to foreign direct investment. In the last 5 years, we opened up our economy to a range of areas from real estate, to defense, to insurance, to pension funds. Every single sector of the economy we opened up. In the last five years, India's FDI has grown by 66%, at a point of time where FDI across the world has fallen by 13%. This will enable the Indian economy to benefit from the forces of globalization.

Elevating India’s presence in the global market will take us another step closer to a $5 Trillion economy.

#4 Increasing Women Participation in the workforce.

India cannot grow at high rates without gender parity. In India, only 27% of the women work; the worldwide average is 48%. If such a major chunk of the population is not working and we consciously don't put women into positions of power, it will be very difficult for India to grow. We must give more opportunities to women consciously. And each one of us must ensure that women are put into the position of power so that India becomes a nation of gender parity. Without that, India will not grow. It's not possible. And if India was to reach that worldwide average of 48%, you will add $700 billion to your economy.

Hence, women empowerment and gender parity will take us a step closer to the $5 trillion dollar economy.

#5 Reforms in Agriculture.

The last few years have not been great for the agriculture sector, It is the primary source of employment in our country and employs around 42% of the total workforce of our country

It's not possible to grow over long periods of time without some very major structural reforms in the agriculture sector. You can't keep growing on subsidies, you can't keep going on just giving assistance to farmers without ensuring better markets, without putting technology, without contract farming, and so on. Agriculture sector reforms are critical.

Reforms in Agriculture are necessary for taking India another step closer to a $5 Trillion economy.

These are the requirements necessary to make India a $5 Trillion economy and though the process is an uphill task but not impossible. With proper steps to ease and open up our economy and also boosting Infrastructure that would cater to the increasing demands of industries, reforms in various sectors like Agriculture that have shown a decline in the past few years is critical, If we are able to consolidate the requirements at the right time, we can achieve the goal and make India a $5 Trillion economy.

I hope you liked the answer and do care to leave an upvote as it motivates me to write more.

Matthew Bates,Updated 2y,Why does the cost of living vary so widely within the United States?,"Supply, demand, and taxes.

If you live near a particular resource, the prices for that resource will be lower. That’s why my friends back in the Outer Banks of NC can enjoy all-you-can-eat shrimp meals for $7, while I’m here in Chicago, paying $15 for a meal of just 20 shrimp.

If you live in a crowded place, the demand for a lot of things… particularly housing… will be high, and thus prices will rise. That’s why my house here in Chicago, which is about twice as big as the one my mother lives in in her small town in NC, cost me about 8 times what she paid for her house. She has a smaller house, but twice as much land, for 1/8th of the price of what I’m paying here. But lately, when a house goes on sale here, there will be 40+ all-cash offers within the first day it’s on the market, whereas houses in my mom’s neighborhood sit on the market for months with no offers. There just isn’t as much demand there, because there aren’t as many people there.

Places with high populations also tend to have higher taxes. My mom pays about 70% of the price that I pay for gas. The difference is almost entirely taxes, both on the gas itself, and property taxes on the gas station, and payroll taxes on every employee that was involved in getting that gas to me, trickling down to me, the consumer.

Chicagoans like me… homeowners with large vehicles and disposable income… often try to save money by driving to Indiana, where taxes and demand are much lower, to purchase things and bring them back to Chicago. It’s considered polite, if you happen to be driving through Indiana anyway, to see if anyone you know needs anything while you’re there.

Alcatraz Dey,2y,"With USA withdrawing from Afghanistan, how does it affect India now?","It is going to start a butterfly effect (property of chaotic systems and environments.)

There were unconfirmed reports of ISI asking the Taliban to divert some of its forces to Kashmir way back in 2001 when Mullah Rabani was in power.[1] Similar requests may soon be turned in by ISI, and highly trained and brainwashed insurgents might start swarming the valley soon.

The point to be noted is that India has always been a force that has tried to stabilize the chaos in the subcontinent. Now, with Pakistan’s close BFF-like relations with the Taliban, it might become a nation that has Pakistan jumping around like a cat on a hot tin roof, closely supported by its Ally, China, and with forces swarming in from the Taliban occupied regions.

Keep in mind, India has always had an Anti-Taliban stance since its collapse, and although The Taliban has stated promiscuously it supports Indian development projects in Afghanistan, I am not sure if New Delhi would recognize the Taliban government in the near future.[2]

Just from a neutral standpoint, the Taliban would surely choose Pakistan’s side just like in the past, and that would definitely mean a higher workload for Indian intelligence, forces, foreign affairs, more content for Western Media, and last but not the least, lots of hope for China.

New Delhi might also try to make their stand clear in the UN through the security council but history suggests that it might be a futile effort.

Lastly, the refugees will be a huge point of concern. If India continues its CAA stance, things might seem bleak for a majority of the refugees. Afghan Sikh and Hindu communities might get a helping hand but certain communities like Hazara Shias might not. As of now, India has shut down its embassy in Kabul and is allowing emergency e-visas to Afghans of all religions. How long would this be sustained and to what sections needs to be seen. [3]

The Taliban is definitely not good news for India. As much as some sections of Media are trying to portray that it has changed and wants the betterment of Afghans and surrounding regions, I do not think any sane diplomat would believe such atrocious lies.

A group capable of harassing women and forcing families to marry their daughters off to its soldiers can only wreak havoc.[4]

“It used to be thought that the events that changed the world were things like big bombs, maniac politicians, huge earthquakes, or vast population movements, but it has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought.” - Neil Gaiman

Narasimha Prasanna HN,Dec 23,How does the creation of Ram Mandir help in the growth of the economy?,"Though not much, it does contribute to economy in very specific ways.

Look at this statistics:

Tamilnadu and UP has more domestic visitors than states like Himachal and Kerala. What's so unique in these states? Himachal has Himalayas, Kerala has backwaters and hill stations like Munnar, yet they can't beat UP and TN.

The most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus - that is Varanasi and Rameshwarm are situated in UP and TN respectively. Not just Rameshwaram, Tamilnadu is home for some of the oldest temples in India, like Madurai Meenakshi, Srirangam, Brihadeshwara Temple, Tiruvannamalai etc. Just visit these temples on weekends, you have to literally wait for 2hrs in the queue! There are also queues where they charge 50/-, 100/- and 500/- respectively, even these queues will be crowded always! There are separate charges for prasadam, archana etc! Given the scale of people visiting these temples, they will for sure generate crores per week.

With Ayodhya added on along with Varanasi, the tourist inflow will spike significantly. With this, more people will travel by flights, buses, trains etc, money will be in flow end to end, movement of money means movement of economy, that means growth! Ayodhya will now become hotspot for jobs because of large-scale construction of hotels, hospitals and other infrastructure required to be built to accommodate huge inflow of tourists, not just during construction, people are needed to continuously manage the infrastructure. Just think how many families will get benefitted from this.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/re51dqzhj6u283ta', 'title': 'How does the creation of Ram Mandir help in the growth of the economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Though not much, it does contribute to economy in very specific ways.\n\nLook at this statistics:\n\nTamilnadu and UP has more domestic visitors than states like Himachal and Kerala.

Dan Bradbury,1y,"If you had the choice of living in the USA or the EU, which would be your preferred choice and why?","Hmmm. That’s a good question.

I idealize life in Spain a lot. Spain is the Spain I know from living there in the early 90s as a student with no understanding of life. Spain is the Spain of my various vacations there every few years. Living in Spain is the kind of thing I dream about doing when I retire.

Of some importance: I have no clue how daily work life works in Spain and I am not retired. I’m of working ages. I’m of working age and in the incredibly rare position of loving my job. Like, you just can’t imagine how much I love my manager, my team, the work, our clients, the company, the pay, the benefits. And mayyyyyybe I could get a near equivalent working for Meta’s recruiting teams in Europe.

But I doubt it. I am a package deal. For my husband to survive, he needs to know the native language. Then he needs to be credentialed in the native nursing license. The good news is that at least here, American credentialing standards still compare very well with other countries. That leaves Dublin, London, mmmmmmaybe the Netherlands (if they don’t require Dutch mastery, about which I have no clue), and Malta.

Just not worth it. I live in one of America’s most blessed states. That blessing is part curse. And that curse is too much for many. Be it politics or housing or transport. Those are huge problems we haven’t solved. They are problems I don’t face in my daily life. So it seems preposterous to trade up right now.

If the very worst came to worse, we’d move to Australia. Oz actively recruits American nurses. There is visa sponsorship. I work for a company that has a lovely office in Sydney. I could probably apply for a role in APAC, possibly get it. Probably get the relo.

Jainil Vachhani,4y,What's wrong with Venezuela's economy?,"They decided to make it rain like there is no tomorrow. And then tomorrow came.

See, for an individual relying on a day job is probably fine. For a household relying on a single income is not great but, it works in many instances. For a company, only having one source of revenue, is very very reckless. For a nation, relying purely on one form of income and doing very very little to create wealth otherwise is just a recipe for disaster.

In the 1970s, and later, Venezuela decided to go on a spending spree. Taxes were lowered and government spending was increased in the form of handouts. This led to an increase in the purchase of foreign cars and other luxury items. The government then went crazy with its government-owned enterprises moving into utilities, roadways, health, internet, telecommunication, and tourism. They also entered the finance industry, buying up private banks and making them state-run which were financially crippling to purchase and then so poorly run that they never made a profit.

When government-run enterprises and workers get all the money they need, it makes it incredibly hard for private enterprises and small businesses to compete. Why would an individual start a business, if the government will just open a competing business, run it to a loss and drive the individual out of work.

In 2008, all export industries apart from oil had collapsed which resulted in massive unemployment but the government took massive debt and provided handouts. At this point, the country was literally a lottery winner who quit their job, spent all of the money and then re-mortgages the homes, they bought with their winnings in order to buy more lottery tickets.

Geoffrey Widdison,3y,Is it practical to try to get rid of pennies in the United States economy?,"It would be incredibly simple: stop minting pennies! That's it, that's all the government would need to do. As existing pennies wear out, they'd be removed from circulation, and businesses would eventually just stop accepting and dispensing them. Electronic payments woukd probably still be calculated to the cent, but if you paid cash, they'd just round it off to the nickel. It's that easy.

The best test for whether a coin is necessary is whether you can actually buy anything for that coin. When I was in high school, you could still buy penny candies, in some places, which was an argument for the “save the penny"" crowd. Those days are long gone. I genuinely can't remember the last time I saw anything priced for less than a quarter. (Incidentally, when the penny first became the smallest coin in circulation, it was worth about a quarter today). Vending machines won't even take pennies anymore. When sellers won't take your currency anymore, it no longer has a function as currency.

Ian Lang,1y,What separates the working class from the middle class in the UK?,"Moats.

In Proleshire, we dig moats with drawbridges in the road round our collection of Coronation Street like houses, and have them manned twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. When the brats aren’t at school we make them do it.

As soon as we see an Audi, or worse a Tesla, up goes that drawbridge and the keeper starts an air-raid siren to let us know there’s some middle-class folk trying to get in. We bring our catapults and tell ’em to bugger off or else that bloody Audi is going to need a lot of bodywork done on it.

Often, you get pedestrians wanting to go over the drawbridge, and if the keeper doesn’t know them he will shout “’alt! Oo goos theere?” At that point the pedestrian will identify themselves and if they sound a bit posh the bayonet gets presented and that air-raid siren is sounded again. A detachment of Border Control Plebs will then wing it on very old motorbikes to the drawbridge and the interloper will be searched. If he or she is found in possession of a copy of the Guardian they will be taken to the back room of a rough pub and will undergo trial by ferret. Assuming they survive, they will be given a meal of black pudding and mushy peas with a pickled egg, and a cup of sweet ’n’ milky PG Tips unless they have been a bit uncooperative, in which case it’ll be Yorkshire tea. In an enamel mug. Made by the village’s most sadistic old bat:

C’mon yer shandy-suppin’ southern ponce, gerrit down yer neck………

Then they are escorted under ferret watch back to the point of attempted entry, where they are made to walk back over the drawbridge to whatever demesne of nancydom they came from. Few return.

It’s a system that has worked for many years. Except when we put that little bleeder Kyle Crunkhorn on the drawbridge watch. Seventeen times he cried “AUDI!” at four o’ clock in t’morning when there weren’t. On t’eighteenth his dad tanned his arse red raw and told ‘im ‘e couldn’t ‘ave any pickled onions for a month.

Inshal,8mo,What made the Soviet Union's economy become unsuccessful?,"The Soviet Union had plenty of reasons for its economic decline due to various structural and operational issues within the system. Here's a comprehensive rundown.

Central Planning: At the heart of the Soviet economy was Gosplan, the state planning agency that established production goals and quotas for virtually every sector of the economy. While the central planning model can ensure a degree of economic stability and meet the basic needs of the population, it lacks the flexibility and adaptiveness inherent to market economies. A centrally planned economy often fails to respond to changing consumer demands and technological advances, leading to inefficiencies and stagnation over time.

Lack of Incentives: The socialist nature of the Soviet Union's economy suppressed personal incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation. Without the motivation to surpass their quotas or to strive for better efficiency, managers and workers often performed only to the minimum required standard. This lack of incentives also led to a lack of competition, which stifled innovation and overall economic growth.

Corruption and bureaucracy: The Soviet Union was characterized by an extensive bureaucratic system, which often led to corruption and resource misallocation. Furthermore, with economic decisions being made centrally, local knowledge was largely ignored, which often resulted in inefficiencies and production that was out of sync with actual demand.

Military Spending: The Soviet Union's commitment to maintaining a formidable military presence put an enormous strain on the economy. A significant proportion of the Soviet GDP was directed toward military spending during the Cold War. This resulted in fewer resources available for consumer goods and services, leading to lower living standards for the average citizen.

Environmental Degradation: The Soviet Union's drive for industrialization often overlooked environmental concerns, leading to severe environmental degradation. Over time, this resulted in significant economic costs, as the country had to deal with the repercussions of poor environmental management, such as decreased agricultural productivity and increased health problems among the population.

Failure to Adapt to Global Economic Changes: The Soviet economy was slow to respond to global shifts, particularly the move towards a service-based economy and the rise of information technology in the late 20th century. As the rest of the world transitioned into a new economic era, the Soviet Union's failure to adapt to these changes further hindered its economic development.

In essence, the Soviet Union's economic decline was due to an inflexible, centrally planned system that struggled to keep up with changing global trends, technological advancements, and consumer preferences.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6sdcbx1qk4h2lwgr', 'title': ""What made the Soviet Union's economy become unsuccessful?"", 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The Soviet Union had plenty of reasons for its economic decline due to various structural and operational issues within the system.

Ian Lang,1y,What direction is the UK headed in?,"East, and back off again to the aphelion.

Like everything else on the rock on which you are reading this (unless you’re reading this on the ISS in which case if you’re passing over Barnsley give us a toot on the horn please), it’s in constant motion as the rock rotates around its own axis from west to east, taking the UK with it.

But not only that, the earth does a great big ellipsey-thing round the big ’n’ yellow overhead fusion reactor too (which would be white if you could see it without the atmosphere but if you were seeing it without an atmosphere the exact hue of it would be the least of your concerns but hey-ho) and a couple of days ago we went past the perihelion, which is the bit where we go round farpoint of the semi-major axis with the sun in it and are consequently closer (which occurs when Australia has their summer, so Bruce ‘’n’ Sheila get to hog all the best sunshine; still on reflection since they live in a country where venomous spiders bite you whilst you’re on the toilet, equally deadly snakes curl up in your boots, there’s a cuddly-looking teddy-bear thing that can bite your arm off, the whole place is infested with giant, hoppy, bad-tempered rats and even some of the sheep might kill you if you upset them (there’s nothing like Australia indeed, eh Australian Tourist Information Office, especially if you’ve got some sort of death-wish) it would be churlish to begrudge them a nice warm-up every December) and I’ve no idea where I was going with that sentence now and it’s like one of those German ones that goes on for ages before you get to the verb so hang on a minute whilst I just get my bearings.

Oh, yes. That was it. The UK is heading east and to the other end of the ellipse. Like it should be, along with the rest of the planet. The Moon’s going with it too. But that’s a three-body problem. Ask an astrophysicist about the three-body problem. Go on. It’s fun to watch their expressions and listen to how many words it takes to say “I dunno”. The best I’ve got from one is nine-hundred and eighty-six.

Bet you thought, when you started reading this, that it’d be like the other two dozen or so I notice there is banging on about Brexit, didn’t you? Nah. I had a proper education, me. I voted Leave.

Also I live in Barnsley, so dun’t tell t’neighbours I’ve used words like aphelion (which they think is a posh theatre in Sheffield), fusion reactor (a rock band from Belgium) semi-major axis (another rock band but from Germany), perihelion (a fancy French restaurant in Leeds) ellipse (a posh nightie) and three-body problem (which they think is an act that is not suitable to be discussed in front of children).

Ashok Dhamija,4y,Punjab was once the most prosperous state and it has lost its shine. What steps can bring it back on track?,"There have been many reasons for this. Here are a few.

Firstly, terrorism in Punjab took the shine off it. Punjab was in the fifth gear before terrorism took over it. But, long years of terrorism put Punjab in the reverse gear for more than a decade. It takes time and energy to go back from reverse gear to top gear again. Moreover, you need the right kind of environment and motivation to come back to top gear. While life in Punjab has returned to normalcy, the environment is not the same. It lacks the previous spirits and enthusiasm and the confidence. It is broken somewhere from inside, though not visible from outside.

Secondly, Punjab is basically an agricultural economy, though there are some pockets with good industries, such as in Ludhiana. But, agriculture, as a whole, has taken a back seat in India, with the development of industries and services sector. Punjab has not been able to pick up in services sector (as other areas such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, Gurgaon and even Noida, for example) and in industries too. Agriculture is not likely to lead you to the top status, in an industrialised world. Previously, India was mainly an agricultural economy, so Punjab was in lead. But, no more.

Thirdly, the youth in Punjab have taken to drugs on a large scale. The drug menace is quite severe. It is the youth who have to take the state ahead. But, unfortunately, a large number of youth are no more in command of themselves. Drugs have taken their control.

Fourthly, a large number of hard-working people (including youth) from Punjab have migrated to other countries, such as Canada. Long years of terrorism had accelerated this process. Previously, Punjabis themselves used to do hard work. Now, they have delegated their work mostly to outside labour. There is always a difference between a person doing his work himself and getting it done from others. Many of the local Punjabis have become lazy in comparative terms vis-a-vis the past.

Fifthly, Punjab is a land-locked state, with no coastal boundaries. Generally speaking, coastal states have better chances of growth in today’s world due to more trade / industry opportunities. Yet, there is no reason why Punjab cannot pick up in services sector (which may not be handicapped in a land-locked state too), but, no serious efforts appear to have been made in a planned manner.

Sixthly, it is not that Punjab has become a poor state. It still continues to be a reasonable better-off state in India. But, the fact of the matter is that other states in India have come up very well vis-a-vis Punjab, due to which ranking of Punjab might have got lowered. In 2017, out of the 33 states and UTs, in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita, Punjab stood at 15th rank with $8076 per capita, while the top state Goa had $21218 per capita, lowest rank-holder Bihar had $2390 per capita, and the all-India average was $6375 per capita.[1] So, Punjab is somewhere in the middle, but still reasonably above the national average.

These are some of the main reasons that I could think of ex tempore. I am not going in further minute details.

What can be done to bring it back on track? Well, reverse some of the above reasons, to the extent possible, and wherever possible. For example, control drug menace. Invest in services sector with proper planning, and in industries. Encourage private sector in these sectors. Invite MNCs. But, for that, first improve the local ecosystem. Don’t allow the terrorism to raise its ugly head again.

Punjabi people have traditionally been very hard-working and they can bounce back quite fast even in adverse circumstances. You have to get the right environment back.

Bangalorean,Dec 20,How does the creation of Ram Mandir help in the growth of the economy?,"Of course, it helps in the growth of the economy. Short answer.

I see lot of answers asking why we should even bother about “economic questions” and think of economy, when it comes to matters of faith which are so important to Hindus.

Well, yes. But that does not answer the question. I agree that not everything needs to be seen with the prism of economic growth, but the question is, how does it help in economic growth?

Even if we go by the reasoning that we should indeed look at everything from the perspective of economics, as Ravi Sundararaman says, even in that case, the Ram Mandir passes the test.

There is one answer by the China-chanter claiming that the economic impact of Ram Mandir is ""Zilch, zip, nada"". I tell you, anyone who says this should be banned from preaching on economics for the next several months at least. Anyone who can make such a dumbarse comment should not be preaching economics to anyone.

If we go by the standard economic measurement metric of GDP (after all, everyone measures economic growth by GDP only), which is directly related to expenditure and consumption, it needs a special level of STUPID to claim that tourism has no impact on the economy.

What is the economic impact of running houseboats in Kerala backwaters? What is the economic impact of maintaining a botanical garden in Ooty? What is the economic impact of maintaining a tiger reserve in Corbett? What is the economic impact of building any tourist site at all?

This guy has just, with one sweeping statement, completely negated tourism as a beneficial sector of any economy. There are entire small countries which sustain and survive only and solely due to tourism. As per this guy, they should not be existing at all, since they go against the basic grain of KBNomics.

Oh, ""people will visit Ram Mandir 1-2 times in their lifetimes at most"" it seems. Yeah genius, I will visit Ladakh also only 1-2 times in my life. I will visit Lakshadweep once maybe, Andamans once maybe. So what now - we flatten all these islands and invite the Chinese to set up knockoff factories to build bags and plastic buckets and cheap electric fans and LED lights with shelf-life of 10 months?

Ayodha and surrounding regions will be transformed and will grow at unprecedented rate in the coming decade. That is what this will do to the economy.

Now, if someone claims that Ram Mandir will ""not result in tourism growth in the first place"", I have nothing to say to such a person. You cannot argue with a wall.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mi6vcyxrha5417gn', 'title': 'How does the creation of Ram Mandir help in the growth of the economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Of course, it helps in the growth of the economy.

What is the economic impact of building any tourist site at all?\n\nThis guy has just, with one sweeping statement, completely negated tourism as a beneficial sector of any economy. There are entire small countries which sustain and survive only and solely due to tourism. As per this guy, they should not be existing at all, since they go against the basic grain of KBNomics.\n\nOh, ""people will visit Ram Mandir 1-2 times in their lifetimes at most"" it seems. Yeah genius, I will visit Ladakh also only 1-2 times in my life. I will visit Lakshadweep once maybe, Andamans once maybe. So what now - we flatten all these islands and invite the Chinese to set up knockoff factories to build bags and plastic buckets and cheap electric fans and LED lights with shelf-life of 10 months?\n\nAyodha and surrounding regions will be transformed and will grow at unprecedented rate in the coming decade. That is what this will do to the economy.\n\nNow, if someone claims that Ram Mandir will ""not result in tourism growth in the first place"", I have nothing to say to such a person.

Akand Sitra,Updated 9y,How are fuel (petrol/diesel) prices decided in India? Why does each city (even in same state) have a different price-point?,"Diesel Pricing in India

Let as assume that Diesel is being imported by IOC (Indian Oil Corporation) from a company in Saudi Arabia. The price at which this Diesel is purchased is called FOB Price i.e. Free On Board Price. In simple words this is the price IOC will pay the Saudi Arabian company to deliver Diesel at a nearby international port

Now this Diesel will be transported on ships from aforementioned port to some Indian Port. For this a charge will be paid to transporter. This charge is called Ocean Freight. When Ocean Freight is added to FOB Price we get resultant as C & F Price i.e. Cost & Freight Price. Thus




C&F Price = FOB Price + Ocean Freight




Now the Diesel has reached an Indian Port. Here a term called Import Charges comes into picture. It consists of three charges -
Insurance charges i.e. Premium paid to an insurance company for the insurance cover it provided to the crude

Port Dues i.e. Fees paid in lieu of using the facilities of a port

Ocean Losses i.e. to compensate for the oil lost during transportation





On the imported crude oil, the Govt of India imposes a tax called Customs Duty. It is 2.5 % of the C&F Price i.e. if IOC purchases crude oil whose C & F Price is Rs. 100 per Litre then Custom Duty will be Rs 2.5 per Litre

When we add C&F Price, Import Charges and Custom Duty we get a very important term called IPP, i.e. Import Parity Price. In very simple words IPP is the price of Diesel paid by IOC at an Indian Port. Hence




IPP = C&F Price + Import Charges + Custom Duty




One more term becomes worth mentioning here which is EPP, i.e. Export Parity Price. It basically is a hypothetical term. It is equal to the FOB price realised by IOC if it WOULD HAVE exported its Diesel to international market
In India the weighted average of IPP and EPP is used. Thus we get another popular term called TPP, i.e. Trade Parity Price. It is calculated as follows:





TPP = 0.8 x IPP + 0.2 x EPP




After a Refinery has processed crude oil into Petrol/ Diesel/ Kerosene etc, a term called RTP, i.e. Refinery Transfer Price comes into the picture. It is the price paid by OMCs (Oil Marketing Companies) to Refinery for the purchase of Diesel and in case of Diesel it is equal to TPP. In other words,

RTP = TPP
This refined Diesel is transported by Rail/ Road to different retail outlets. For this Inland Freight is paid. OMCs spends money on marketing its products. When we add them we get TDP i.e. Total Desired Price. In other words





TDP = RTP + Inland Freight + Marketing Cost




But OMCs sell aforementioned Diesel to retail outlet at a price which is less than TDP. This price is called Depot Price.
Now the Diesel has reached retail outlet. Here, Central Govt imposes Excise Duty, State Govt. imposes Value Added Tax (VAT) and a fixed profit margin per Litre of fuel is added.

To answer your question about different prices in different cities, the state collects different taxes and transportation costs also change
Hence, finally we get the retail price of Diesel





Let's now understand above definitions in with some data - It is some old data that I found on the internet, so don't mind me. It is just for illustration.





FOB Price of Diesel - $ 124 / Barrel

Ocean Freight - $ 2 / Barrel

C&F Price (1 + 2) - $ 126 / Barrel = Rs. 48 / Litre

(1 Barrel = 159 Litres and $1 = Rs 62)

Import Charges - Rs. 0.5 / Lt

Custom duty - Rs. 1.5 / Lt

IPP (3 + 4 + 5) - Rs. 50 / Lt





EPP - Rs. 48 / Lt

TPP - Rs. 49 / Lt

RTP - Rs. 49 / Lt

Inland Freight + Marketing Cost of OMC - Rs. 3 / Lt

Total Desired Price (8 + 10) - Rs. 52 / Lt

Subsidy by Central Govt. - Rs.10/Lt

Depot Price - Rs. 42 / Lt

Excise Duty + VAT + Dealer Commission - Rs. 10 / Lt

Retail Price (13 + 14) - Rs. 52 / Lt


Let’s find out the answers of some Basic Questions-

What is Under Recovery?
Under Recovery is the difference between Total Desired Price & Depot price. Mathematically:

Under Recovery = TDP – Depot price

Are Under Recovery and Loss are similar terms?
OMCs are selling Diesel at Rs. 10/L loss. They get the same amount back, partly through Govt. subsidies and partly through discounts from oil suppliers (ONGC and OIL). Notionally, OMCs dont incur any losses but the delay in repayment of subsidies by Govt. means OMCs have to borrow money from the market and that entails a heavy Interest cost.

Central and State Govt. are taking a big amount as taxes but the subsidy bill is footed by Central Govt. only. Essentially, the subsidy bill is being paid by the taxes you are paying to the Central Govt.
Hence, Under-Recovery and Loss are not the same terms.

What is presently used in India EPP/ IPP/ TPP?
Presently for the pricing of diesel TPP is used.

Why Finance Ministry is insisting on using EPP?
From the above table it is clear that if EPP is used instead of TPP, then TDP will become 51 instead of 52. Hence Under-Recovery will reduce by Rs.1/L. So, Govt. will have to give lesser subsidy to OMCs. Therefore, Govt. deficit will come down.

Why OMCs and Petroleum Ministry are insisting on using TPP?
It is clear from the above answer that if EPP is used instead of TPP than OMCs will get less subsidy from Central Govt. But their expenditure will remain exactly same as earlier. Hence, their financial health will deteriorate.

3 movies released on 2nd October 2019 saw earning of over ₹120 crore.[1]

There is too much money people have hidden in their home and unnecessarily shouting of economics crisis.

Joker earned good money.

War earned much better.

Sye Raa also earned some money.

This is really good. People have a lot of money. Even they must have bought so many popcorn bucket on the day.

I still remember the days when these movies came on screen.

Thugs of Hindustan.

Zero

Ramgopal Verma's Aag.

On the day of their release, our economic growth saw a huge slowdown and was going to the crisis situation. Economy was going backwards when few movies such as:-

KGF

Kabir Singh

Came and took the economy back on track.

At present, Ayushman Khurana is trying to make the economy better.

I really hope, Salman Khan releases his next movie soon.

Lutz Enke,9y,"How does the German economy work? Considering they make big progress in every sector every year, is there any good competitor for them?","Strengths of the German economy:


Well-educated workforce
Low corruption, functioning institutions

Good infrastructure (roads, electricity etc. - but also geographic location as a trade hub in Europe)
Foreign relations (a lot of free trade agreements, take the Euro Zone alone)
Joint currency in the Euro Zone creates an efficient market
Established array of hundreds of specialized ""hidden champions
"" companies who are well capitalized, have distinct know-how advantages & enjoy good margins


Challenges / weaknesses of the German economy:


Aging society & squeeze-out of middle income jobs due to automation and globalisation - social costs that in turn create financial cost, in turn creating potentially an increasing tax burden for individuals & corporations
Due to not being an English-speaking society & being less entrepreneurial, having a bigger challenge to attract immigration of high-skilled workers and entrepreneurial risk-takers (compared to the Anglo world, i.e. US, UK, AU, NZ, SG, HK
Focus on tangible products over high-value-added services (such as Big Tech) potentially makes Germany's economy ""lop-sided"" & vulnerable
Germany is resource-poor
For reasons rooted in possibly both regulation and mentality, Germany did not create its own Giants in newer industries such as Big Tech (SAP is by far the newest company in the DAX index, and it's already decades old - compare that to the US)
Investment on key infrastructure is probably too low in recent years


Core ""competitors"" of Germany (read: countries that are similar on the strength profile):


United States, Korea, Japan, Netherlands, Canada, Australia
All share most of Germany's strengths, i.e. can compete on high-value-added businesses
Japan e.g. shares key Germany's weaknesses (resource poor, ageing), the US not really (no imminent aging problem, no lack of resources, huge success in new industries - read: Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, ...)
But economy isn't a zero sum game - these countries are vital trade partners and key for the stability of both the World and Germany


Drawing a negative scenario for Germany:


Globalization & automation further eliminate middle-income jobs, polarizing between low-paying service jobs & high-income jobs
Aging society increases tax burden

Immigration too low skilled, i.e. just fills the gaps on the low-paying service jobs end, not on the high end that brings / accelerates further innovation
Tax burden harms competitiveness of German high-value-added companies, forcing them to invest mostly abroad (e.g. in the US)
Similar, but more sever crises in other large EU countries (France, Spain, Italy) harm key German trade partners & create cost for the union (i.e. Germany)
Slowdown in China further reduces demand for German exports
Lack in tax receipts harms spending in vital infrastructure & education rather than pension & welfare payments for political reasons
Negative economic climate is not met with desire to reform, but futile/flawed desire to preserve


Potential remedies, roughly sorted from more likely to less likely:


Germany companies stay innovative enough to keep being the ""high end workshop"" of the world (e.g. building machinery & factories & high-end products for other economies and consumers)
Continued US growth creates continued high demand for German products

Other EU countries succeed in reforming, reducing the danger of the union becoming a net burden for Germany
Big Bet on Renewable Energy turns out to be net positive in the long term
Russia makes a political and economic turnaround, creating a huge trade partner with perfect fit (Russia/Germany are very complementary in their economic strengths)
Immigration nets enough high-skill workers to soften aging effects & bolster innovation
Tax system is reformed, with a stronger emphasis on taxing stuff that cannot run (i.e. less taxing of jobs & corporates; more taxing of land value, estate/inheritance)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h3yc9inlxqbf0m4w', 'title': 'How does the German economy work?

Mahesh Rallabhandi,2y,Why does Russia have such a low GDP but such a high international status?,"GDP is never a deal with regard to international status, it is all about a country’s military power. Russia stands at 2nd position.

USSR throughout its existence was not a money and business-minded society like the USA and European countries. Still, it had a larger GDP in the 1950s and 60s than other countries. Because at that time many nations were recovering from the repercussions of WW2 and colonial legacy.

On top of that USA and USSR were the only two countries in the world that possessed nuclear arsenals in the early years.

Afterwards, USSR and USA competed with each other in space race, started producing nuclear arsenals and strengthened their military and no country were able to match their level.

But by the time of 1980s and 90s, Japan and Germany replaced USSR economically yet they didn't had any strong military.

After the collapse of USSR, Russia went through a big economic trauma but it tried everything to maintain its large military and nuclear arms to challenge USA and Europe.

The reason why Russia has such a high international status is because it still has that capability to challenge the hegemony of the US with its military power.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j5acrzhmebdi26pt', 'title': 'Why does Russia have such a low GDP but such a high international status?', 'score': {'original': 0.9933, 'ai': 0.0067}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""GDP is never a deal with regard to international status, it is all about a country’s military power.

Ravi Sundararaman,Dec 18,How does the creation of Ram Mandir help in the growth of the economy?,"I am a firm believer that in a country like India, where we have barely reached lower middle-class status after battling immense poverty for centuries, we should primarily focus on economics.

Others may see non-economic value in the Ram Mandir - socio-political, cultural, sentimental, and believers would argue, ‘spiritual’, values. I don’t.

Show me the money. Kitna deti hai? What is the Return of Investment? We should have a Gujju-like focus on such matters.

So, can the Ram Mandir be an economic good? How can a temple be useful to economics?

An easy example to start with would be movies. People like watching movies. Hence, producing and showing them movies can be beneficial to the economy.

That doesn’t mean all movies are useful from the point of view of economics. Good quality, popular movies that attract an audience willing to pay more for the movie than its cost of production are useful to the economy. Dud movies or movies that go over budget are a waste of resources.

There could also be positive side-effects. A movie theatre may not recover its screening cost from ticket sales, but may generate a positive return by selling overpriced popcorn and soda. A mall would get footfalls by screening movies and get shoppers for other goods.

You may believe that movies are the opium of the masses. Your opinion is not relevant to economics.

Coming to religion - Indians are heavy consumers of spiritual and Godly services. They pay a lot for such services. You feel good while watching a Formula One race. Others feel good while watching an aarti in a temple. They are not stopping you. You shouldn’t stop them.

Whether the Ram Mandir will be an economic good or a dud will depend on how efficiently it is built and run, and its positive side-effects.

Was it constructed within budget? Are the finances of the temple managed without corruption? Is the money earned by the temple further put to good use? Do visitors find it easy to visit, or do they have to fear stampedes? Are there a variety of shops in the vicinity and do they offer good quality products? How is business for the hotels around? What are the positive side-effects via infrastructure development in the town? Can we use this to build a city in a State that is sorely lacking in urbanization?

Those are the specific questions to ask. Not a general question about the economic value-add of a temple.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pisc8flvtkha236n', 'title': 'How does the creation of Ram Mandir help in the growth of the economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am a firm believer that in a country like India, where we have barely reached lower middle-class status after battling immense poverty for centuries, we should primarily focus on economics.\n\nOthers may see non-economic value in the Ram Mandir - socio-political, cultural, sentimental, and believers would argue, ‘spiritual’, values.

Elmer White,Sep 13,What would happen if America suddenly decided to ban guns?,"Here’s my thoughts -

mind you I’m a little further out than most, so my opinion may be invalid or incorrect. But I see it going like this-

(remember that this is all hypothetical)

-an actual initiative makes it through and becomes signed and enacted (very unlikely due to Supreme Court and the senate being held majority by Americans who love freedom and patriotism)

-pro gun platforms on Facebook / Instagram / Twitter / whatever start posting the news and their following becomes well informed on what’s to come. People start preparing.

-government says “anyone who doesn’t return or relinquish their firearm by (whatever date) is now considered a felon and we will be coming to take your guns”

-(patriots hate hearing this one)- 75–80% of the gun owners will turn in their guns and comply, but complain about the infringement while doing nothing. 15ish% of the gun owners will be in areas that the feds would never try to encroach on (private land, outside city limits, people who can live off the land for years without ever seeing another human being or ever going to a grocery store, who know the land and have known that land for decades) so they won’t change anything about their lives, the feds won’t be going there. Too risky.

- A small percentage of gun owners who refuse to turn in guns will be in an area that is effected by the confiscation. Most of these guys are probably either well armed, or know a good group of people who are also well armed and can form mini militias. It’s not unrealistic to think that a group of 4–5 semi-well trained guys can hold off an ATF squad raid.

-Blood will be shed on both sides. This is when it starts to get real.

-The less-willing folks who never thought of fighting for their rights will see that civilians are standing up (and most likely winning) against the governments goon squad. More and more people will fight for their rights. Let’s be honest, every communist / socialist / dictatorial country started first by taking their citizens guns. That’s fact. Here in America, a good portion of us would rather die fighting the good fight over taking a knee and being subjected to the stripping of our rights and freedoms. I myself am included, and would rather die during a confiscation raid fighting the good fight than to live in a country that’s government has total control over the people. But that’s just me.

-these fights (civilian against government) will continue on. Probably for months - years. The government has more money than us, but will soon realize that we are not backing down. The agents employed by the government will start refusing to go out on these confiscation raids. They have families that they need to get home to.

-This is where it gets good. The government can’t stop us, we’re willing to fight, we won (or semi-won) the fight, and the people employed by the government are backing down. Now it’s time to take what’s ours.

-The mini militias all become interconnected. We decide that not only are we unwilling to give up our 2nd amendment rights, but we are now going on the attack to reclaim what America used to be.

-The country starts seeing a major shape shift and change. The government finally realizes what makes this country great. They are defeated. This will go down in history, future generations will reflect on the decisions made by their ancestors to preserve this country. Going forward, people will know not to fuck with gun owners, because only a SMALL portion of gun owners will fight the fight, but the amount of people fighting the fight will still be way larger than the amount of government employees who would be tasked with confiscation.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/61b2hvsum9o7plza', 'title': 'What would happen if America suddenly decided to ban guns?', 'score': {'original': 0.95295, 'ai': 0.04705}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Here’s my thoughts -\n\nmind you I’m a little further out than most, so my opinion may be invalid or incorrect.

Mike Simonsen,8y,How sustainable are the rising rents and property prices in the Bay Area? How would you know when they're in bubble territory? The tech industry in California attracts huge money which has flowed into Bay Area real estate.,"The short answer is that exorbitant home prices and rents are, generally speaking, sustainable. The three home price bubble bursts of the last 25 years have, in retrospect, been amazing buying opportunities for Bay Area real estate.

The longer answer is more nuanced, because the ""Bay Area"" is a big place, and as experienced in the 1991-1993, 2001-2003, and 2008-2011 real estate busts, home prices acted VERY differently across this big geography both in collapse and recovery.

So for brevity - I will call your attention to what we at Altos Research regard as the single most important variable for ""unaffordable"" price sustainability in a given market.

We created a metric called Inventory per Capita because it turns out we can measure Supply vs. Demand in a way previously impossible (due to the byzantine US real estate industry).

Inventory per Capita is the number of homes currently for sale in a market divided by the population. Or inversely, the number of potential buyers who have to compete for a given home for sale. Take three cities of similar size (~30,000) and high-end demographics: Los Altos, CA, Winnetka, IL, and Southlake, TX.

Southlake has bout 255 homes for sale as of August 7, 2015 and a median home price about $800k.
Winnetka has about 190 at $1.3M median home price
Los Altos has exactly 17 homes for sale and a $3 million median home price


We hear about how ""median home prices are unaffordable to the median income"" in the Bay Area. But in a place like Los Altos, they don't have to be affordable to the median income. They only have to be affordable to 17 people!

Bay Area home prices are high because demand is moderate and supply is infinitesimal.

When marginal demand tanks as in 1991, 2001, and 2008 prices adjust down rapidly. But they tend to recover quickly with demand.

California has a chronic shortage of available housing for two reasons


Restrictive zoning prevents new construction
California's goofy Prop 13 tax law that acts as a giant rent control. People can't move without resetting their tax basis, so they don't. So fewer homes are for sale and they cost more -- to people who don't already own.

Both of the legal structures were explicitly designed to favor existing home owners over outsiders who want to buy. ""I'm already here. Screw you."" They are unlikely to change.

Incidentally - rents and prices do not move counter to each other, but in tandem. Both are driven by household formation (economic growth), so demand increases for each simultaneously.

Finally, when you want to know if a market is due to an over-pricing correction back down, like Vegas in 2005, I suggest you look at Inventory per Capita. It tells the tale you're looking for.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tlv8bq9ajskcd5ro', 'title': ""How sustainable are the rising rents and property prices in the Bay Area?

Tomaž Vargazon,8mo,What made the Soviet Union's economy become unsuccessful?,"There are no good or bad economic systems. There are only suitable and unsuitable ones.

Assyria

The Soviet Union opted for a command economy, where the state decides on allocation of all resources. The state says who will plant which crops, where will those crops be planted, when they will be harvested and what will become of them and likewise on all other resources. It may seem obvious to you today this doesn’t work, but the image of Assyria is not randomly chosen.

At least three of the four empires of early antiquity - Assyrians, Hitties and Egyptians - used roughly the same approach in the late bronze age and it served them well for centuries. The states were immensly powerful and could raise armies very quickly, they just needed to tell the smiths to stop making plows and make swords or spears. They could erect new fortresses by simply ordering a new batch of peasants to do less field work and do more work in masonry and so on. The command economy opted by the Soviet Union is a valid approach to political economy in some circumstances.

This is the crux of the issue. The economy of ancient empires was simple, they had farmers who produced everything crop-related, a few classes of artisans who produced weapons and tools. Beyond that you had people who worked in administration (including religion), rule and military, which was often roudned up into one bundle. An economy like that can function quite well as a command economy, I’d even go so far as to say it’s better than alternatives. You can’t use modern approaches of capitalism to short sell wheat in anticipation of a good harvest when other people are expecting a bad harvest in a barter economy.

The advantage of capitalism is to raise capital, to pool money for large investments. This makes sense in an industrialized world, where expensive machinery is used to make a single worker or a small group of workers enormously productive. An ancient potter only needs a potter’s wheel, a shack, clay and an oven, you don’t need to sell shares to purchase those.

The Soviet Union adopted an economic model that is suitable for a simple economy and tried to apply it to a modern industrialized world. That’s why it failed. A state administration can adequately run farms, plus manage artisans and miners centered within a walking distance around a city. It can’t adequately run an integrated economy spanning two continents and eleven time zones, where you have factories specialized in creating industrial tools for use in other factories, that need minerals only found in a specific part of the world, then smelted in exactly the right fashion to have the qualities necessary for that drill bit to work.

There’s too much of everything all at once, calls are made by people unqualified to make them and decisions take too much time to go through. Such a system will be ineffecient and thus slowly erode as mistakes accumulate while the system grows ever more complex. Note the Soviet economy worked relatively well after World War 2. The post-apocalyptic nature of the recovery after the conflict allowed for state administration to be good enough and solve the problems as they appeared. Starting around 1960 however the economy grew more complex and the top-heavy approach began to weigh the country down like a millstone around the neck.

Note that Western countries also took a state heavy approach in the post war rebuilding era. So did South Korea after Korean war. It’s the most effecient way to manage a country at point zero, because the state can marshall resources inaccessible to anyone else and very quickly. The difference is these countries only used it for as long as it was appropriate, then relaxed for something more suitable to the new situation.

USSR didn’t.

Such a system will be ineffecient and thus slowly erode as mistakes accumulate while the system grows ever more complex. Note the Soviet economy worked relatively well after World War 2. The post-apocalyptic nature of the recovery after the conflict allowed for state administration to be good enough and solve the problems as they appeared. Starting around 1960 however the economy grew more complex and the top-heavy approach began to weigh the country down like a millstone around the neck.\n\nNote that Western countries also took a state heavy approach in the post war rebuilding era. So did South Korea after Korean war. It’s the most effecient way to manage a country at point zero, because the state can marshall resources inaccessible to anyone else and very quickly. The difference is these countries only used it for as long as it was appropriate, then relaxed for something more suitable to the new situation.\n\nUSSR didn’t. That’s why their economy fell.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.99485
Muhammad Aamir Khokhar,7mo,What is the economic future of Pakistan?,"Pakistan's economy has been in a dire state for the past 1.5 years, and there are concerns that it may face bankruptcy if it fails to meet its debt obligations on time. However, thanks to the support of certain Arab nations and China, Pakistan has received a favorable response from the IMF. The IMF has approved loan of $3 billion, which will be disbursed in the near future.

Meanwhile, Pakistan is gearing up to create one of the largest flags ever on August 14th.

The battle for the tallest flagpoles between Pakistan and India is nothing new.

India hoisted a 360 feet tall tricolor flag in March 2017. In response, Pakistan hoisted a 400 feet tall flag on its 70th Independence Day on August 14, 2017.

As a rebuttal, India hoisted a 418-f00t-long flag on the Joint Check Post (JCP) at Wahga Border. Not to be outdone, Pakistan is set to install a 500-foot-high flag at Liberty, Lahore.

The provincial government will procure a whopping Rs. 400 million for the project from the development budget. The flag-raising ceremony will take place on Independence Day — August 14, 2023.

The caretaker Chief Minister Punjab Mohsin Naqvi also announced earlier today that Lahore will get three new underpasses. Their construction will start on July 17. [1]

When individuals lack foresight and have no knowledge of effectively utilizing public funds, it becomes quite predictable what the outcome will be.

It sums up very well the economic future of Pakistan. I’ve nothing to say.

Cheers

Colin Riegels,1y,What are the reasons why the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer?,"The poor are not literally getting poorer. The poor are getting richer, but just not as fast as the rich are getting richer, so the gap between them grows. Although it fluctuates periodically, the long term trend is steadily upwards for the poorest households. The bottom quintile today may seem poor in relative terms, but they are vastly better off than the bottom quintile 30, 40 or 50 years ago. And their position is unimaginably better than the poorest in society from earlier centuries.

As to why: the simplest answer is that money makes money. We now live in an age where it is relatively easy to invest surplus money and use it to generate further returns, thereby multiplying your wealth. That is obviously a lot easier to do the wealthier you are, and a lot harder to do if you are poor and can barely get by.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zkjvxrgh8pwus5c3', 'title': 'What are the reasons why the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer?', 'score': {'original': 0.9984, 'ai': 0.0016}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The poor are not literally getting poorer.

Terry Lambert,Updated 3y,"What happens when Moore's law ""ends""? What will be the effects on software and technology, programming, and the economy?","It probably doesn’t end.

Full disclosure: I am a Senior Associate at the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, which means I contribute support, get a title out of it, and occasionally throw peanuts from the cheap seats.

Moore’s law is:

The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year. Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years.

[Per Gordon Moore, at the time, director of research at Fairchild Semiconductor]

I don’t see this as a problem, or as slowing down.

While it’s frequently applied to the idea of transistor count and feature size, it applies equally well to parallelism.

And even if the former, not the latter, were the rule you were using to measure, we haven’t even been forced off of Silicon yet, let alone forced to move to something like thermodynamically reversible computing, or nanomechanical systems with atomic level feature size. For example, here’s an atomic level sleeve bearing:

Here’s a molecular logic gate, which is part of a MEMS project to recreate the Intel 4004 processor, at an atomic scale:

[Ralph Merkle, Robert Freitas, Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, Foresight Institute]

Above – Part of a molecular mechanical logic gate. This molecular machine would have 120695 atoms, 87595 carbon and 33100 hydrogen, and occupies a volume of about 27 nm × 32 nm × 7 nm.

That’s a full logic gate, at about the same size as a single transistor, with no supporting structures, at the 5nm feature node, which we are currently sampling.

We have a long ways to go.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pr5k0tzofxh74d9l', 'title': 'What happens when Moore\'s law ""ends""?

Dan Bradbury,3y,Is the current pandemic unknowingly helping us by turning our economy from consumeristic to need-based?,"No. No because you loaded the question with two assumptions:

that the economy is in any way turning into a “need based” economy.
that such a change would be “helping” us.

In fact:

the entire economy has helped people in record numbers with this being (globally speaking) the greatest, wealthiest, freest time ever.
making more people capable of deciding how to live their own lives through mass education and employment.
nothing about the current crisis is changing or can change the nature of our economy without completely collapsing it, resulting in the mass deaths of billions of people.
