Ara Mambreyan,Updated 4y,What is cheap when you're poor and expensive when you're rich?,"Should Conor McGregor do his own chores?

The man in the picture earned north of $30,000,000 in 2019 alone. Conor McGregor is one of the world’s biggest sports superstars.

If he washes his clothes by himself, spending 1 hour of his time, he will save $20 on hiring a housekeeper.

“LOL. WHY WOULD HE DO THAT! JUST PAY SOMEONE ELSE.” —you will say and you will be right.

But wait… in one scenario, he will spend $20 and, in another scenario, he will spend $0. Why will anyone choose the former?!

The reason is that we ignored the opportunity cost
. In other words, we only looked at the money aspect of things.

If he does not hire a housekeeper, he also loses 1 hour of his time. How much is 1 hour of his time worth?

There are many ways to calculate this. For instance, we can divide his yearly income by the hours he worked—assuming a standard 8 hour workday—and he will get more than $10,000. Whatever figure we use, it is likely going to be significantly larger than $20.

“Wait, but he does not spend all his time on training for his fights! He also spends time doing nothing at home, surely? Everyone does!” — and you will be right again.

This time we ignored all the immaterial benefits too! For instance, watching a movie and relaxing, Conor gets his strength back and, in turn, performs higher in his training. This, in turn, affects Conor’s income!

Even assuming a 1% rise in income, it is a huge difference, $300,000, which is far more than a housekeeper will make washing Conor’s clothes every hour per week.

So what is cheap when you are poor and expensive when you are rich?

Time.

That is the reason why Conor McGregor does not wash his clothes and Barack Obama flies in private planes.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/l2tjkvb9we3pzy50', 'title': ""What is cheap when you're poor and expensive when you're rich?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Should Conor McGregor do his own chores?\n\nThe man in the picture earned north of $30,000,000 in 2019 alone.

Asim Qureshi,6y,Why isn’t gold considered to be a good investment?,"Throughout the ages, gold has been a universal currency and a great store of value.

It hasn’t really been an investment until recent times, in the same way the US$ isn’t really an investment today.

But the reason why gold isn’t a great investment today is as follows…

All the gold in the world is worth around US$7,500Bn. And it'd fit in a cube of 20m length.

Now, gold has uses, but none that are significant except jewellery, so, big picture, it’s pretty useless.

If you bought all the gold in the world for $7.5Tn after, say, 20 years, it’d be worth a little more than $7.5Tn (inflation and the global economy would push up the price).

Now sure, I'm ignoring the speculative element, but you don't invest long-term in the expectation you will sell in a speculative bubble - you look at fundamentals.

Note, you would get no dividend or yield on gold - in fact, you’d need to pay for storage.

What could you buy instead of that $7.5Tn worth of gold?

You could buy Apple ($900Bn), Facebook ($500Bn), Alibaba ($450Bn), Google ($750Bn), Amazon ($550Bn), Microsoft ($650Bn), Netflix ($80Bn), Uber ($50Bn), and Tesla ($55Bn).

That’d cost you $4Tn.

You could then buy all the property in London for $1.5Tn. Add New York for $1Tn. You would benefit from all the rent and still own it all after 20 years.

And with the $1Tn change, you could buy 250 million acres of income-producing farmland in the US. You would not only make money on the crop produced but own the land at the end.

So, 20 years down the line, which investment do you think would have been the better one?

This line of argument is exactly why the world’s best investor, Warren Buffett, doesn’t own gold.

And it’s why you shouldn’t either…","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/z31bkxcv5pfywj9h', 'title': 'Why isn’t gold considered to be a good investment?', 'score': {'original': 0.986, 'ai': 0.014}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Throughout the ages, gold has been a universal currency and a great store of value.\n\nIt hasn’t really been an investment until recent times, in the same way the US$ isn’t really an investment today.\n\nBut the reason why gold isn’t a great investment today is as follows…\n\nAll the gold in the world is worth around US$7,500Bn.

Ajay Gautam,Updated 6y,What does it feel like to be poor?,"My grandfather was rich but did not have any sense of responsibility. Three out of his four sons grew up uneducated and affected by alcoholism. (One of them is my father). They also had this false sense of pride that created this feeling of shame in doing small jobs.

So what happened? By the time I gained conscience, we were shit poor.
Getting bread with some vegetables on the plate, twice a day, was a dream. On countless occasions, we used to eat only roti
 with chilly chutney.

Sadly, sometimes there won't be enough chilli even to make chutney.

In early childhood, I used to get old books from my cousin (lets call him Pappu) who was one class ahead of me in school. Pappu was a contemptible person, he used to bully me for his old books.

From early age (~10), I used to work on farms with my mother. After ~14, I started working at a whole lot of places.

This is my resume before I entered college-

Worked on Sugar cane farms for as low as 10 INR a day. (US $1 = 64 INR)
Sold Ice creams, earning ~15-20 INR a day.
Worked as daily wage labour in house construction for 45-60 INR a day.
Worked in transporting bricks from brick fields to construction sites for ~80 INR a day.
Worked in an Indian wedding band for ~60 INR a day (only once). And yes, I had to wear a uniform like this.
My most memorable day is when I sold Kakadi (cucumber) for the full day with same cousin Pappu earning 7.50 INR. Each one of us got 3.75 rupees, with lots of Kakadi to eat.

How poverty affected my education?
If I look back, I was above average in my class. But all that work for food, bad neighborhood, and lack of resources (time, stationery, school uniform etc.) affected my education badly. Also, my self confidence was very low.

So what happened? By the time I came in 10th Standard, my education was messed up. I got 46% marks in 10th exams. I cleared 11th standard with grace marks and finally...I failed 12th standard.

But, my failure was actually a gift. My friend-circle was gone, everything was meaningless to me. I had that talk with myself that made me realize that nothing matters except a good education.

One of my uncle guided me in this tough time. He asked me to carry my 11th standard Physics, Chemistry, Maths books and go to a nearby Ashram
 everyday in the morning. I used to study there, eat free food, and come back in the evening. I followed that routine during my summer vacations and built my fundamentals. I realized that education is the only way out of my pathetic life. I used to recall Booker T. Washington's essay, The Struggle for an Education 
from my 10th English syllabus. It was a real inspiration.

Next year, with same level of dedication, I cleared 12th with flying colours with distinction in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Also, I appeared for Chaudhary Charan Singh University
 engineering exam and secured 3rd rank. That gave me enough confidence to try something bigger.

Next one year I did nothing but prepared for biggest engineering entrance exam, Indian Institute of Technology, Joint Entrance Examination
 and cleared it. I spent next five years studying Computer Science & Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (BHU)
. Life was all set.

How poverty changed me as a person.
It made me rock solid. When usually people are scared about something, I drink some tea and carry on. Unless its about someone's life, I keep my cool.

Also, I have immense respect for hard working people. While so many people around me feel ashamed to talk to Rickshaw
 pullers, it gives me immense pleasure to talk to them. I speak politely with Rickshaw pullers, farmers, waiters and all those people trying to earn a living in tough economy.

It also made me realize the value of food. Usually this is how my plate looks like once I am done eating (even if food is not so tasty).

I never smoke. Sometimes I will drink a beer with my friends, but no hard liquor. Possibly because partially I hold my father and his drinking habits responsible for my bad childhood,

As far as money is concerned, being an ex-Oracle and current VMware employee, I earn well. Still, I don't waste money. I consider buying costly gadgets, drinking a lot, and doing something useless to impress your ""friends"" as a waste of money.

That doesn't mean I am a miser. For me, only few things are worth my hard earned money. I am living at a great place paying more than average rent for this apartment, because its so beautiful and peaceful.

I am also a proud owner of a Royal Enfield Thunderbird
.

All in all, poverty made me the person I am today. It was one hell of a journey. And it's still going on. It's just not that challenging any more :D

Aitijya Sarkar,5y,Does money really buy happiness?,"I was invited by someone who has a monthly salary of 5000 rupees to come and spend 31st evening with him and his friends.

When the time came to leave, my friends conveniently had other plans to attend to.

I had to go. I promised.

He lived in a slum near a dirty, fungus filled lake, overlooking a bridge that ferried passengers to and from my area.

The slum was fascinating to look at.

Muddy roads leading to a narrow, dark passage which led to a makeshift club house where there was a party.

Broken houses, with tin foiled roofs, overcrowded with barely enough space for the families who lived there.

With bated breath, I made my way to the club house.

There were about 40-50 people there. It was 10 30 pm, and the party had already begun.

Bottles of Blenders Pride, Old Monk, Desi Alcohol, you name it, it was there.

There was a borrowed speaker that had cracks in its body, due to years and years of use.

It blasted songs of Honey Singh, Raaftar, Bengali music, and the occasional Enrique Iglesias song.

I met Dada, the guy who'd invited me. The happiness on his face when he saw me, made all my anxiety fade away.

He paraded me around, and showed me off to anyone he could find.

His wife. His son. His best friend. His father. His friends. A local politician. A local don. Everyone. He introduced me to his world.

I was offered a seat to sit in, and a glass of Blenders Pride was poured for me.

Every two seconds someone checked in to see if I was okay.

Chicken was cooked, and everyone just dipped their hands in the bowl and picked a piece. I was offered the leg piece.

The entire time I was there, my glass was never empty. Not for a second.

Smiles adorned their faces, and with time, it was on mine.

Their world was mine, a stranger.

Their food, and booze, and the music, and everything else they had, was mine to share.

Little children lit rockets from their own bare hands, with a desi-mixed version of Tunir Maa blasting from the speakers.

With time, there were seven pegs of rum and whisky inside me.

I'd heard stories of brotherhood, evil, misery, poverty from those around me.

The whole party was thrown by contributing a meagre amount of 100 rupees from all who attended.

I wasn't asked to pay. I was their guest. Their friend's friend. That's all they needed to grace me with love, empathy and care.

When it was twelve, and the sky lit up with the world celebrating the end of yet another year, I stood hand in hand with Dada.

I was moved to tears.

Hand in hand. Counting the seconds. 5…4….3….2….1….Happy New Year.

I felt whole. I felt safe. I was one with the happiness around me. I was one of them.

As the old rusty speakers announced the dawn of another year, everyone hugged everyone.

I drank another peg, and Dada's best friend dropped me home with the promise to meet again.

I remember this so vividly because it taught me something very important.

Akshat Agarwal,Updated 9y,Why can't Indian government pay world bank loan by just printing money?,"Let us say you are a farmer and you have mango plantation (keeping in line with the season's favorite :P). You do hard labor and work day and night and grow 100 kg mangoes every year.

Now, one cannot live his life eating only mangoes, And since mango is a good seasonal fruit, good for health, and not to mention utterly delicious, there would be others who'd happily trade their farm products, say wheat, for some of your mangoes. Realizing this, you decide to exchange your mangoes for other products. You tell about it to your friend who has wheat farms. Incidentally, he happens to be a mango lover like me and together you develop a rate of exchange, with mutual understanding of course in this example, say, 5 kg mangoes for 10 kg of wheat. You give him 10 kg mangoes and get 20 kg wheat for your family, which you assume should suffice for 6 months. You do the same thing with your other friends as well in exchange for pulses, rice, vegetables etc.

Now, past 6 months comes winter, and your supplies have started to diminish. Moreover, you do not have any mangoes to offer in exchange for wheat and other commodities. But without the commodities you wont survive for next six months. Now what should, or rather, what could you trade in exchange for wheat?

You find a solution. You go to your best friend who trusts you a lot, and you promise to give him 5 kg of mangoes next summer for 10 kg of wheat right now. He thinks about it for a while. There are of course things to be concerned here. What if you refuse to give him mangoes later? What if the mangoes you give him aren't good quality? What if next year is a drought and there are no mangoes?

Let us say for the sake of simplicity here that your friend here thinks about it but on goodwill and years of friendship, he trusts you and agrees. Similarly, you go to your other friends, gain their confidence and promise them some mangoes next summer for providing you with supplies right now. Now, what you have done here is that you have developed a trading system wherein you trade items and commodities for other items and commodities. And the trading currency is none other than the ""items and commodities"".

But now, since you are trading with so many different people at different time, it is getting difficult for you to keep track of how much mangoes you owe to whom. So what you do is that you start handing over promissory notes to the people you trade with, with your sign on it and the amount of mangoes you owe them. So next summer, whenever you have mangoes harvested, people come to you, show you the promissory note with your sign on it, and take the mangoes.

But there is a problem with this system: you are promising X kg of mangoes which you have not harvested yet, i.e., which do not exist. Similarly you would have supplied mangoes to someone for a certain commodity he'll have in future but doesn't have it now. And then there is always a risk factor, i.e., next year maybe a dry one and you may not have enough mangoes to trade.

Realizing this, you are worried now. You need a damage control. You consult this with your trusted friend and ask him how to avoid possible damage. Now this friend of yours is quite a trader himself and has traveled many cities and traded with many people. He tells you not to worry about it and that he'll let you on a little secret. He explains it to you how people will need mango no matter what: after all it is a seasonal fruit and very delicious. Now if there is less growth of mangoes next year, then he can ask to negotiate exchange rates in his favor, i.e., more commodities for same amount of mangoes. Simply put, due to scarcity, his mangoes will become costly.

You get it a little bit, but you are still confused. You wonder how will you negotiate rates when you do not know how much mangoes you are going to harvest next year; how can you negotiate when there is uncertainty? Your friend smiles, and tells you that you can. He suggests you to issue only a certain value of promissory notes, lets say 1000, and then do the trading with these notes after declaring their new meaning to the traders. These 1000 notes will represent 100% of your harvest, no mater how much you harvest. So if there is a guy with your promissory notes valuing to 100, he''ll have 10% of your harvest next summer, no matter how much you harvest. He can also decide to not exchange it for mangoes next year when there is a drought, and wait for next to next year hoping for more amount of mangoes then. Lets call your promissory notes as Mango Currency (MC)

All goes good and the mangoes, being good quality and sweeter than its competitors, are valued more. People want to buy mangoes from you even if they have to pay more. This means the value of MC gets more, only a few people can afford it. The very lower class, who wants to eat mangoes but cannot get hold of MC due to its high value is suffering. This also causes you loss in business since people are now holding MC instead of trading it for mangoes since the value is increasing. Since mangoes are not being traded, they are rotting in the collecting compound with very less people to buy them, causing you huge loss. You now need to keep the value of MC in check so that people do not hold up to it.

You go to your friend again and consult him on how to keep value of MC in check. He tells you to simply issue more promissory notes. Since the total sum of promissory notes is equal to 100 % of your harvest, if you issue 1000 more promissory notes in addition to the initial 1000 that you've had, the value of MC would be halved. 100 MC that was 10% of the harvest would now only be 5% of your harvest. (This is also how RBI keeps the value of Rupee under check, else Economic activity of country would go down)

Now you have developed a good trade system and also know how to keep the value of MC under check by regulating the supply of promissory notes. Now you decide to expand your business. You go to your best friend who deals in wheat and has currency WC (Wheat Currency). He is already doing very good in business and has surplus money. You tell him about your plans to expand our business and your requirement of more money for expansion purpose. He listens to you and agrees to lend you some money at certain interest rate: he already has enough money and extra money sitting at home isn't earning him anything, so lending it to you for certain interest seems a good deal.

You borrow 500 WC from him. Now WC is quite strong in market. So much that 500 WC costs around 1000 MC (how much % of wheat harvest it represents doesn't matter).

Now, you use up all the WC for expansion but suffer heavy losses. All the WC went down into the drain. You bought some stuff from it and have it still, but it is not bringing you any revenue and nobody is ready to buy it back. You are now left with only a few MC (remember, your currency is also floating in the market; you have maybe 1200 MC at hand). To pay back 500 WC, you need 1000 MC. But if you give 1000 MC right now, your remaining business will not be able to sustain itself with only 200 MC at disposal and you'll eventually end up bankrupt.

You now think about possible way out. You plan to issue 2000 MC more, exchange 1000 MC for WC and return the loan. But if you issue more MC, the value of MC will be halved. Moreover, you can not think of cheating because the value of various currencies is now checked by Association of Auditors and you need to report any more printing of currency to them before it can be floated in the market, and all the currencies are numbered to keep the authenticity in check

Basically, you are now left with only one option: to try to get your act together and grow your business back to what it was, and then further more to get enough MC with sufficient value, to be able to return the loan amount.

Now in the above scenario, lets replace you with our country India, and replace mangoes you harvest with the economic activity that takes place in country; and replace your promissory notes, valuing to 100% of your harvest, to 100% of the economic activity in the country.

Now, back to your question: What happens when RBI prints more money to pay off bank loans? You should be able to guess it. More the money printed, lesser the value of currency. Money flowing in the country is nothing but standardized promissory notes issued by RBI. They are equivalent to the total economic activity of the country. If the economic activity does not increase in proportion to the money printed by RBI, the value of Indian Rupee will go down.

And obviously, value of MC will go down with respect to promissory notes issued by other people for other commodities. So when value of Rupee goes down, it does w.r.t other currencies, USD being one of them.

Its not difficult to guess that loans provided by World Bank are in USD. If money is printed to pay off the loan, value of Rupee goes down, which means you need more Indian Rupee to buy USD. As you can see, you can not repay the loan unless you actually have the money, over and above what you 'll need to run the country.

Since the total sum of promissory notes is equal to 100 % of your harvest, if you issue 1000 more promissory notes in addition to the initial 1000 that you\'ve had, the value of MC would be halved. 100 MC that was 10% of the harvest would now only be 5% of your harvest. (This is also how RBI keeps the value of Rupee under check, else Economic activity of country would go down)\n\nNow you have developed a good trade system and also know how to keep the value of MC under check by regulating the supply of promissory notes. Now you decide to expand your business. You go to your best friend who deals in wheat and has currency WC (Wheat Currency). He is already doing very good in business and has surplus money. You tell him about your plans to expand our business and your requirement of more money for expansion purpose. He listens to you and agrees to lend you some money at certain interest rate: he already has enough money and extra money sitting at home isn\'t earning him anything, so lending it to you for certain interest seems a good deal.\n\nYou borrow 500 WC from him. Now WC is quite strong in market. So much that 500 WC costs around 1000 MC (how much % of wheat harvest it represents doesn\'t matter).\n\nNow, you use up all the WC for expansion but suffer heavy losses. All the WC went down into the drain. You bought some stuff from it and have it still, but it is not bringing you any revenue and nobody is ready to buy it back. You are now left with only a few MC (remember, your currency is also floating in the market; you have maybe 1200 MC at hand). To pay back 500 WC, you need 1000 MC. But if you give 1000 MC right now, your remaining business will not be able to sustain itself with only 200 MC at disposal and you\'ll eventually end up bankrupt.\n\nYou now think about possible way out. You plan to issue 2000 MC more, exchange 1000 MC for WC and return the loan. But if you issue more MC, the value of MC will be halved. Moreover, you can not think of cheating because the value of various currencies is now checked by Association of Auditors and you need to report any more printing of currency to them before it can be floated in the market, and all the currencies are numbered to keep the authenticity in check\n\nBasically, you are now left with only one option: to try to get your act together and grow your business back to what it was, and then further more to get enough MC with sufficient value, to be able to return the loan amount.\n\nNow in the above scenario, lets replace you with our country India, and replace mangoes you harvest with the economic activity that takes place in country; and replace your promissory notes, valuing to 100% of your harvest, to 100% of the economic activity in the country.\n\nNow, back to your question: What happens when RBI prints more money to pay off bank loans? You should be able to guess it. More the money printed, lesser the value of currency. Money flowing in the country is nothing but standardized promissory notes issued by RBI. They are equivalent to the total economic activity of the country. If the economic activity does not increase in proportion to the money printed by RBI, the value of Indian Rupee will go down.\n\nAnd obviously, value of MC will go down with respect to promissory notes issued by other people for other commodities. So when value of Rupee goes down, it does w.r.t other currencies, USD being one of them.\n\nIts not difficult to guess that loans provided by World Bank are in USD. If money is printed to pay off the loan, value of Rupee goes down, which means you need more Indian Rupee to buy USD. As you can see, you can not repay the loan unless you actually have the money, over and above what you \'ll need to run the country.\n\nP.S.: Up-vote and Comment.. ;) :P\n\nP.P.S.: In case of any wrong concept/explanation, please comment such, so that changes can be made.\n\nP.P.P.S.: Sorry for the long answer, I was getting bored in office. ^_^', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.6123
Joy Deb,Updated 5y,What is the power of money?,"The power of money is not how much luxury or sex it could buy. It is something else.

When I was in Class XII(High School), I used to often go to this restaurant in Kota, Rajasthan which used to serve delicious vegetarian dishes.

Kota is a famous place in India, known for its coaching institutes, which prepares students for one of the toughest college entrance examinations, IIT-JEE. I was a student of a reputed coaching institute of Kota and used to live in a rented house far away from my home town.

In India, it is not mandatory to tip your waiter. Your waiter in India, will not misbehave with you if you do not tip him/her, like it happened in hundreds of American stories I have heard so far. I have seen in many big restaurants, people often dont even think of tipping their waiters let alone in that small veg restaurant that I frequently used to visit.

Most of the time, my lunch bill would come under ₹150/-(<$2.5). Vegetarian meals are really inexpensive in India. Every time, I used to tip the waiter ₹10/- (<20cents). I was a student at that time, it was a surprise for the waiter, when the first time I tipped him, as students rarely tip the waiter(saving pocket money).

Slowly with more frequent visits, all the waiters started noticing me. I can’t explain in words, the type of majestic treatment I used to get from the waiters for tipping them only Rs.10/- .

There was one waiter who used to wait on my table, most of the time.

Onetime, it was my birthday. I went there with some of my friends. The total bill came close to Rs 800/($12) . Pleased with his service, I tipped him Rs.100/-.

He asked me with a smile, “Bhaiyyaji, itna kyun de rahe ho?”(“Brother, Why are you giving me so much?”)

“Raklo bhaiyya, aaj waise bhi mera birthday hain, kuch kha lena”(Keep it bro, today’s my birthday, eat something with that)

After sometime, he became so accustomed with my orders and taste, that he almost used to write the orders by himself. He used to make sure that I get the most fresh vegetables and Paneer in my dishes.

It happened oneday, after returning to my room, I found that I forgot somewhere my backpack containing Rs.70,000/-(almost $1000). It was my coaching fees for the entire year plus my room rent. It was really a very big deal for me losing that kind of money. I got tensed and started recalling the places I had halted at, after I withdrew the amount from the bank.

I visited two to three places in search of the bag and then finally arrived at the restaurant.

Seeing me entering the restaurant, the waiter came to me quickly, with a huge smile on his face, carrying that backpack which I forgot in the restaurant that noon.

I took the bag from him, opened it to see that the small packet of cash was well sealed.

I heaved a sigh of relief.

Waiter : “Bhaiyyaji, apka bag. Main apke piche gaya tha paar tab tak jaa chuke the. Phir maine apne pass rakh liya tha isko”. (Brother, Your bag, I went after you but you had left by then. So, I kept it safe with myself.)

I smiled and replied, “Bhaiyya, aaj bacha liya tumne” (Brother, you saved me today )

That day, I understood one very important aspect of money.

Money is tremendously powerful, if you invest in the right person at the right time.

Thanks for reading :)

Sarthak Singh,5y,Does money really buy happiness?,"This question reminds me of an Episode in Tom and Jerry.

The Million Dollar Cat.

Tom was busy playing with Jerry.

Then he received a parcel.

It said that, He now got 1 million Dollars left by his Aunt.

He was extremely happy.

Soon Jerry saw it, and he too became happy.

There was a term, it read that, Tom cannot harm a mouse or his money will be forfeited.

News of Tom becoming a Millionaire spread over the city.

He leads a luxurious life.

But he could not harm Jerry. Jerry used this term to trouble him.

Even while sleeping, Tom was troubled.

He could not eat properly too.

But now, His Conscience was stricken. He could not tolerate this anymore.

He tore the agreement.

And threw it towards Jerry.

And the Most important line, he said at last,

“I am throwing away a Million Dollars. But I am Happy!”

And their chase continued. This was how the episode ended.

Lesson learnt : Happiness is more important than being rich.

Money can buy Momentary Happiness.

But Money comes with a compromise. You need to fulfill some conditions in order to get money.

If those conditions hurt your inner self, then sadly, even Money can't buy you happiness.

Thanks for reading.

John Soroushian,6y,What is an economic bubble in layman's terms?,"Joseph Kennedy was a Wall Street titan and the father to future United States President John F. Kennedy. Legend has it that Kennedy learned his most important lesson about the stock market through an interaction with a shoeshine boy.

One day Kennedy is getting his shoes shined and offers the shoeshine boy a big tip if he does a good job. Kennedy’s plan works and his shoes look brand new after the boy is done. Kennedy smiles and tells the kid his big tip is “stay in school”, then chuckles.

Sayan Mukherjee,Updated 3y,Why does India spend so much on defence instead of focusing on social and economic welfare?,"Look at these beautiful pics of Medieval Indian States and Empires

• Indraprastha (Delhi or Dilli) State

• Mewar (Chittorgargh)

• Vijayanagara Empire

• Maratha Empire

Do you know how did these great states and Empires come to an end?

Obviously, because they lost battle(s) against the Turkish and Mongol Invaders.

But why did they lose the battles?

The Hindu Empires of both Rana Sanga and Prithviraj Chauhan lost against the Afghan (and Mughal) Artillery

Rana Uday Singh's Mewar lost against the Mughal Rifles

Vijayanagar Empire lost against the artillery of Deccan Forces

Maratha Empire lost against the British Rifles

From history we can say, India was invaded, attacked, looted and conquered, because Indian Rulers lacked advanced weapons and weaponry system, like Gunpowder, Cannons, Rifles and Artillery.

This answers your question as to why should we focus and spend on our Defence as well.

Subith,Updated 4y,What should Kerala do to improve its economy?,"The Chinese once said “If you want to get rich, build roads first”
. To present to you the abysmal condition of roads in Kerala, I am sharing the screenshot of the time taken to travel between two major cities of Kerala on the left hand side and on the right hand side the time taken to cover the same distance in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu.

It’s a whopping extra 6 hours taken to travel 460 kms on Kerala roads. That’s almost double the time taken to drive the same distance in Tamil Nadu, or Karnataka or most other states in India. The worst part is, such a pathetic route has tolls. Some parts of the highway don’t have a divider and is highly unsafe. Processions by political parties or religious ones are quite a common sight on these highways and so are traffic jams.

If Kerala needs to improve its economy, it needs to build world class roads first. Or at least we should match the high standards set by Tamil Nadu roads. The 200 kms drive between the two biggest cities Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram should be possible in 2.5 hours instead of 5 hours.

Only if such road infrastructure exists, manufacturing can flourish. At present Kerala depends solely on agriculture, services, tourism and foreign remittances. But to become a major economic power, you need manufacturing and such industries need top class roads for reducing the logistic cost and time. The port of Kochi or the upcoming Vizhinjam port cannot run at its maximum capacity without good roads connecting to it.

I have always envisioned a North-South expressway for my state. Kerala’s geography is in such a way that it simply needs a 500-600 km long non-stop expressway to connect majority of the tier 1, 2 and 3 cities. The expressway needs to be 3 lanes minimum in one direction. The speed limit should be no less than 100–120 kmph. There shouldn’t be any traffic signals. Rather there should be entry and exit lanes from/to the cities on the way so that ongoing vehicles are not slowed down by entering or exiting traffic.

The expressway should ideally run closer to the west coast of Kerala since that region is fairly flat and majority of the cities, airports, sea ports and population exist in the western half of Kerala. There should be perpendicular extensions from this expressway to the eastern regions like Sabarimala, Idukki, Wayanad and Palakkad.

The Government in fact had a similar plan
 in the 2003. But there were several protests 
(as usual with any projects in Kerala). Some of the arguments against the project were silly and stupid. For example, the expressway would turn out to be a “great wall” and divide the state into two halves. These people clearly don’t have any idea what an expressway would look like and how people (and vehicles) go from one side of the expressway to the other. Such politicians and activists were always a curse to the state by stalling some excellent ideas and projects in the state. Had this project materialized at that time, Kerala wouldn’t be facing the terrible transportation woes in 2019 which worsens every year due to the increase in the number of vehicles and deteriorating roads.

I recently came to know that an utterly stupid project is in fact approved - Kerala Hill Highway
 along the eastern half of the state. Firstly, the eastern Kerala is sparsely populated compared to west. Secondly, the fragile Western Ghats will have a huge impact due to this. This region is also prone to landslides and it’s risky business to disturb the ghats. Thirdly, however great the construction is going to be, you cannot drive at 100km/h on the hilly terrain which makes the purpose of a highway useless. If the idea is to connect the residents of east Kerala, then as I illustrated above, a west coast highway with extension to eastern towns is a better approach.

None of the governments that come and go in Kerala has ever shown the political will to make a manufacturing base in Kerala and improve the highways. Worst part is the citizens of the state are happy with the present condition. We know what the problem is. We use the best of our analytical skills, judgmental abilities, do extensive research to prove that no development can work out in our state since ours is unique compared to other states in India. But I have hardly come across someone who proactively spent time researching and finding out a solution to our problems rather than showcasing how things don’t work in the “unique” state of Kerala. The state has already done good strides in the field of education and healthcare. More number of people have come out of poverty. Living standards are better.

“What do you mean, Mr. Greedy?” asks the innocent Luigi.

“Today you pay $1,500 a month. That’s terrible. You’re giving that money away to your landlord. You save zero in equity! Terrible investment, Mr. Luigi,” salivating for his HUGE commissions.

“Well, I know. I hope we can someday qualify for a loan, Mr. Greedy.”

“With our loan, you will pay the bank only $1,300 a month, saving you $200 every month.”

“Wow, that’s like a dream.”

“Mr. Luigi, are you sitting down?”

“Yes, Mr. Greedy. Why?”

“You are qualified for a 100% loan, Mr. Luigi! No money down! The bank will give you all the money needed to purchase the house.”

“Really? Really? Wow, this is life-changing news, Mr. Greedy! Every one of my friends that have purchased a home is happy — real estate prices just keep going up!”

“And they will continue to rise, Mr. Luigi. Congratulations!”

“This is a life-changing event! Thank you, Mr. Greedy!”

Now, to answer your question, why did 10 million Americans lose their homes after the 2008 financial crisis?

Remember when you last purchased something with credit?

When we buy something, we’re focused on the satisfaction of the purchase, not on the obligation of the payment we just assumed.

Our behavior as a consumer is easily influenced by emotions and excitement to fill that emotional void with the purchase. This becomes a huge problem in a world where there’s an alarming lack of financial education — people may be deceived or make bad decisions.

I still remember those pre-crisis years. The world was different. Everyone wanted a piece of the pie. The real estate “party” was something nobody wanted to miss. Naturally, millions of Americans were emotionally attracted to the dream while ignoring the future legal and financial demands of their loans.

The banking system was extremely greedy. Banks qualified what are known as subprime mortgages. These are loans granted to individuals with poor credit scores (640 or less, and often below 600), who would normally not be able to qualify for a mortgage.

Mr. Greedy abused many consumers like Luigi, selling too many unqualified mortgages. Now, Luigi purchased his home for $200,000. He qualified for a 100% loan.

Luigi started making payments.

Then, the unexpected happened. In 2006 home prices started to drop. Suddenly Luigi’s $200,000 home was worth $50,000 less.

Luigi faced a decision: pay back the loan for $200,000 or give the home back to the bank.

Like Luigi, millions of Americans were not willing (or able) to pay the mortgage on their unreasonably expensive home anymore.

People stopped making their payments, which triggered defaults.

Now the banks were full of expensive foreclosures in their inventory. Prices kept falling. Nobody was willing to buy them.

The problem quickly spread nationwide.

Meanwhile, financial corporations who owned these junk sub-prime loans stopped receiving payments. This triggered the perfect storm.

A collision of two gigantic “cornerstone” industries of the economy followed.

It was scary … Devastating for millions around the world.

The rest is history …

…

…

Will history repeat?

Darrell Nelson,Updated 3y,"How do progressives view the ""free rider problem” that is typically the bane of free programs?","“We don't run our business for the 2%!” That is quote that every business owner needs to take to heart once they are truly past the start-up phase.

What does it mean: 2% of the population will lie, cheat, steal to get something for free. That means 98% of the people will give you money for something that gives them value. Those are the people you run your business for. They are called, “Customers”.

That doesn't mean you ignore the 2% trying to cheat you. They will drive you broke if you do. But if you go the other way and try too hard to stop them you will drive away more business than those cheaters cost you.

If you set up clearly defined rules, ie: if a pizza is wrong the customer gets a free one, problem with a product it is replaced no questions asked... 2% of the people WILL try and take advantage of it. You have to ask yourself two things, “How much does it cost to stop this?” and “How much does the fraud cost me?” If the fraud costs you less than the cost to stop it. Then it's a cost of doing business.

How does this relate to the “free rider problem”?

At the Democratic Debates, they talked about the horror of a billionaire sending their children to a “free” public college. My question was so what? You are talking 0.1% of the population. If Harvard, Yale, and Princeton all closed their doors because they figure they can't compete with public schools this “free rider problem” would cost a whopping $17 per student per semester.

Paperwork has gotten a lot cheaper, but the cost to A) Figure out a fair price for the education and B) means test every student. That is going to cost a lot more than $17 per student.

In reality I went to a very good public university SUNY Potsdam, “Go Polecats!” We didn't have the elite getting their helicopters getting stuck in the mud coming to visit. That was for parents of St. Lawrence University students, 10 miles away.

To change the old saying, “It's illegal for a billionaire to sleep under a bridge just like it is for a homeless person.” If you means test people who sleep under a bridge, you aren't hurting the billionaires in the least, but you are spending money to turn away the people who really need to sleep there.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xlbzogdm14j08rqy', 'title': 'How do progressives view the ""free rider problem” that is typically the bane of free programs?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""“We don't run our business for the 2%!” That is quote that every business owner needs to take to heart once they are truly past the start-up phase.\n\nWhat does it mean: 2% of the population will lie, cheat, steal to get something for free.

Scott Dismukes,3y,Why do some people consider gun rights to be a more important issue than immigration or the economy?,"Well, it’s simply that gun rights are specifically mentioned in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, as being an inalienable right, one that government can not infringe upon.

Sean Kernan,5y,What are the most underpaid jobs?,"American military leaders rank right up there.

Similar to politicians, most 3 and 4 star generals (or Admirals) make between $170,000 and $190,000 a year.

But unlike Politicians, who are often wealthy before entering government, most military leaders started out as junior officers right out of college, regular people, with regular paychecks.

Then they had to work their way up the ranks, serve in combat multiple times.

These soldiers frequently moved every year or two, at great expense and sacrifice to the family, over the course of 30 years. (Divorce rates are high in the military).

Garit Boothe,2y,"Everywhere I go I see ""Help Wanted"" signs. None of these jobs pay minimum wage anymore and yet they go unfilled. What's happening?","At a small e-commerce business that I used to work for, our boss insisted on using this job ad language:

“Must have fingers to touch, nose to smell, and eyes to see.

Required minimum ability to lift 50 pounds.”

(No pay listed.)

This is for a customer service job, where you sit on your butt all day answering calls and social media messages.

I’m not sure which is funnier, “must have fingers to touch” or the fact that the old man who insisted on using this language was so out of touch with reality.

You have to pitch a job like you’re pitching a product.

What type of person would work for $10/hour in customer service? Or that would work at that wage part time?

Young people, college students, people without job skills, immigrants desperate for a job.

I’ve seen a small call center operate effectively, keep their people happy, and still pay them (low) call center wages.

They did this by:

Making the job fun, with small perks, snacks, bonuses, weekly company breakfast, competitions and prizes
Asking for referrals from current employees, and then hired them. So that they could work with their friends
Ensuring that people got breaks, and could stand up and leave their desk and walk around
Would instill them with a sense of purpose. One place that I worked at even had people stand up and recite a company motto every morning. (Old school and a little creepy, but it worked.)
Train managers to listen to their employees and give a crap about their personal lives.

Remember that awfully wonderful Netflix documentary, Tiger King?

In the Netflix documentary, Joe claims that Carol Baskin’s workers all work for free to take care of the tigers at “Big Cat Rescue.”

Her volunteers sign up for full time work without pay because they feel that they are saving these animals.

They feel a purpose.

As it turns out, people aren’t money-seeking machines.

Things like:

Purpose
Identity
Human connection
A chance to learn
Life or work experience

usually will trump a person’s desire for money.

People work for low wages every day. What they don’t generally want is to work for low pay AND do work that they hate AND be treated like a soulless, corporate robot.

Then, on top of that, the job ad is laughably unpersuasive.

Not only can theynot offer a good job, but they can’t even pretend that it’s good.

And they wonder why no one responds.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3bq7opyuk1gefxl4', 'title': 'Everywhere I go I see ""Help Wanted"" signs.

Colin Riegels,1y,"If Roe v. Wade is overturned, why don't women simply make mass migration out of the danger state to more abortion-friendly states? Mass depopulation will force employers to leave and pressure the state government to adapt or die, no?","You often get questions like this Quora: “why don’t people simply move state, or move country”. The inappropriate word is of course, “simply”. There is nothing simple about it when it comes to packing up, leaving your home, leaving your family and friends, leaving your job, pulling your children out of school, and starting over in a new location.

But is interesting that the although there are a large number of states which have ‘trigger’ laws or which have indicated that they will ban abortion completely if Roe is overturned, a lot of those are already fairly lightly populated states. In terms of the US population, by far the larger part of it is in states where the right to an abortion will subsist even if Roe is overturned.

The states with trigger laws are Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. Other than Texas, those are some pretty lightly populated states. I haven’t done the maths, but I’d guess that (excluding Texas) their combined population is comfortably smaller than either of California or New York.",{'message': 'Server Error'},

Yes. The whole premise is silly. It’s based on the assumption that employers don’t create new jobs because they lack money. That’s nonsense. They don’t create new jobs because they see no opportunity for new jobs to create profits for them. If they saw that opportunity they would create the jobs without any additional encouragement.

Aled Jenkins,4y,What are some less than obvious monopolies in business?,"How to own everything?

Be a mysterious Japanese zip company.

Tadao Yoshida had a plan.

Yoshida had lived through World War 2, having survived the bombings of Tokyo.

He owned a small zipping company that he called YKK and he had the aim of modernising the zip industry. He got to work and created some designs for a custom-made zipper machine. But…

No machine tool makers wanted to create a machine that could only produce zips. You want a machine that can do multiple things. Zips are too specific.

Yoshida was not a man to give up easily. He simply created his own machine.

This gave YKK a competitive advantage. No longer would YKK have to rely on another company’s machines. They could develop their own machine at a cheaper cost. In turn, this meant that YKK could ensure both quality and low prices.

By the 1960s, YKK owned 95% of the Japanese Zipper market. They learned something incredible

There are many faulty zippers out there, but if YKK could produce everything themselves, they would be trusted.

So that is what they did. Every part of the production company, YKK produced and owned. The LA Times reported that YKK

“Smelts its own brass, concocts its own polyester, spins and twists its own thread, weaves and color-dyes cloth for its zipper tapes, forges and molds its scooped zipper teeth”

And on top of all that, YKK manufactures the boxes that they ship the zips in.

YKK does not rely on anybody else. They own everything.

Today, YKK produce more than 50% of zips worldwide.

Zips may be easy to make; they may have not seen much innovation in the last fifty years, and they may be simple but no company can compete against the YKK Monopoly.

If you are interested I will leave a few fun facts about YKK in the comments. I hope you enjoyed the story!!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/luy2kifpe7jn3c6m', 'title': 'What are some less than obvious monopolies in business?', 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'How to own everything?\n\nBe a mysterious Japanese zip company.\n\nTadao Yoshida had a plan.\n\nYoshida had lived through World War 2, having survived the bombings of Tokyo.\n\nHe owned a small zipping company that he called YKK and he had the aim of modernising the zip industry.

David W. Rudlin,1y,Business Insider reports that Biden says he’s tired of trickle down economics leaving out the middle class. Is it possible that trickle down IS what historically created the middle class?,"Nope.

George H. W. Bush was right when he called that “voodoo economics.”

Do you really think rich people create jobs or raise wages simply because they’ve got some spare cash lying around and can’t be bothered sending it to the Cayman Islands?

You hire people when you’ve got work that needs to be done. You raise wages when you need to in order to attract and retain the right people.

Which is exactly what’s going on right now. For years we were told that if the minimum wage was raised above $7.25, small businesses everywhere would collapse. Improvements in efficiency and output made top management and shareholders rich, but none of that money trickled down the the guys in the factory or the warehouse.

Then, coming out of the pandemic, we’ve suddenly got more demand for labor than supply. And in many places the starting hourly wage doubled. Yet the world kept on spinning.

You might argue that when the rich buy a super-yacht, they’re creating jobs for everyone who works on making and manning that boat. But guess what: the same thing happens when you buy a slice of pizza from that family-run shop on the corner.

Moreover, those yacht-building jobs might be in Italy or Holland, not in your neighborhood.

And when the money is banked in Switzerland or the Bahamas, absolutely nothing trickles down to anyone.

Which is why if you want to grow the economy, put money in the hands of the people who will spend it. And when you do that, you get something that’s not talked about nearly enough: trickle up economics.

If a working class family can afford to buy a new printer at Amazon, Jeff Bezos gets a little richer. If they buy steak instead of chicken at Walmart, the Walton family benefits.

The best way to help both American workers and American business owners is to give money to people who don’t have enough.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qsemyvbckrhaluno', 'title': 'Business Insider reports that Biden says he’s tired of trickle down economics leaving out the middle class.

Awdhesh Singh,Updated 5y,"If 1% of the people own 80% of the wealth and rule the world, then what are rest of 99% of the people doing? Are 99% of people not wise, daring, creative, competitive, & innovators but are happy with the herd mentality and happy with a routine life?","According to reports, there are 300 Million monthly users on Quora. [1]

It is almost certain that at least 10 Million Quorans are writing answers.

However, according to my guess, hardly top 1,00,000 (1%) Quora writers would be getting at least 99% of answer views on Quora.

What do the rest 99% of users do?

Are they not wise, daring, creative, competitive and innovator?
Are they not happy or have the herd mentality?

I don’t think so.

The 99% of the Quora users are learning and enjoying the answers written by 1% of people.

If the 99% don’t exist, 1% too would vanish.

The leaders and followers complement each other.
The author and readers need each other.
The players and the audience enjoy each other.

You don’t have to be always a winner in life to enjoy life.

It is lonely at the top of the hill and nothing grows there.

The blessed people live together on the ground in the company of each other, enjoy the beauty of the sky and the hill and share the joys and sorrows with each other.

Anubhav Jain,3y,What's your favourite middle class thing?,"I went to my manager's son's birthday.

They have a very small one room house; however, the beautiful decorations and cheerfulness made it look like a dream world, much better than an empty castle.

There were many little children from the neighbourhood laughing and playing joyfully.

When the modest pineapple cake was brought, children jumped in joy.

Out of a one kg cake, they cut around twenty small pieces, and still each child ate it in joy.

Suddenly, I recalled how people smash cakes on each other’s face and waste it to attain happiness.

The boy was gifted a bat by his father, and the way he didn't leave the gift and kept it along, showed how happy he was and maybe wanted it for a while.

Seeing that I remembered how our kids can't wait for even the weekend to get their urges fulfilled.

Being there, I could recall my childhood when the world was not so prosperous, at least in habits.

My favourite things about middle-class is the value for luxuries, the ability to delay gratification and to find joy in smallest of things.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ne2cf5ji1bp6q8v9', 'title': ""What's your favourite middle class thing?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9577, 'ai': 0.0423}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I went to my manager's son's birthday.\n\nThey have a very small one room house; however, the beautiful decorations and cheerfulness made it look like a dream world, much better than an empty castle.\n\nThere were many little children from the neighbourhood laughing and playing joyfully.\n\nWhen the modest pineapple cake was brought, children jumped in joy.\n\nOut of a one kg cake, they cut around twenty small pieces, and still each child ate it in joy.\n\nSuddenly, I recalled how people smash cakes on each other’s face and waste it to attain happiness.\n\nThe boy was gifted a bat by his father, and the way he didn't leave the gift and kept it along, showed how happy he was and maybe wanted it for a while.\n\nSeeing that I remembered how our kids can't wait for even the weekend to get their urges fulfilled.\n\nBeing there, I could recall my childhood when the world was not so prosperous, at least in habits.\n\nMy favourite things about middle-class is the value for luxuries, the ability to delay gratification and to find joy in smallest of things."", 'result': {'fake': 0.0423, 'real': 0.9577}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1981577, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""I went to my manager's son's birthday.\n\nThey have a very small one room house; however, the beautiful decorations and cheerfulness made it look like a dream world, much better than an empty castle.\n\nThere were many little children from the neighbourhood laughing and playing joyfully.\n\nWhen the modest pineapple cake was brought, children jumped in joy.\n\nOut of a one kg cake, they cut around twenty small pieces, and still each child ate it in joy.\n\nSuddenly, I recalled how people smash cakes on each other’s face and waste it to attain happiness.\n\nThe boy was gifted a bat by his father, and the way he didn't leave the gift and kept it along, showed how happy he was and maybe wanted it for a while.\n\nSeeing that I remembered how our kids can't wait for even the weekend to get their urges fulfilled.\n\nBeing there, I could recall my childhood when the world was not so prosperous, at least in habits.\n\nMy favourite things about middle-class is the value for luxuries, the ability to delay gratification and to find joy in smallest of things."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9577
Ian Lang,Tue,"What comes first, economics or political science?","Ah.

Given the way the question is phrased, my immediate answer would be “screw them both, and let’s find out” but I suppose one of the haute-bourgeois soi-disant intellectuals on here will accuse me of being a vulgarian for it. Not that I’m not a vulgarian, of course, so they would be quite right, but hey-ho, vulgar just means “of the common people” and since if oikism was an Olympic event I’d probably get at least the bronze it’s rather pointless to point it out.

Er……was there not a question? Was it “how much of a dirty joke can you make from an innocent question?” No? Damn. Better go and look again, then: oh, that.

Political Science may claim to be a science but it is so in the same way that I can put on a tutu and claim to be Tatyana Prancallova, a Prima Ballerina Assoluta at the Bolshoi. It’s one of the social sciences. Now, social sciences are what you do when you aren’t good enough at maths for proper sciences, you aren’t good enough at practical things for engineering or design, you can’t draw or paint well enough for art, and you haven’t got the patience to plough through any of the Humanities. So it’s either SocSci or Geography (which gets lumped in with humanities, true, because although it is actually very slow physics with trees stuck on, the physicists really do not want any truck with it, and the geographers themselves don’t want to be stuck with Humanities, and again all the geographers are far too bright to want to be regarded as social science; so Humanities, who think it a bit too mathsy to be a proper humanities subject, get stuck with it as they are a bunch of arty-fairies and they don’t want to be shouted at for refusing) and if you can’t grasp the hang of trigonometry then you’re not going to get very far in map-juggling, so SocSci it is for you and you should have worked a bit harder at French, or History, or even Geography, at whatever it is you did instead of O level at school, shouldn’t you?

Er, again…..oh, yes. That. The practical upshot is that SocSci attracts the dull-brained kids. No, really, y’know the ones. The ones that have read works of philosophy that they only half-understand but they’re going to cite them until the cows come home and it doesn’t matter that the essays are full of citations of half-understood works and nothing original because all the people who teach it are like that too. The ones who write using simple words in a monotone and very, odd punctuation because the talent for creating interesting work is not, one they have and suddenly they will at, random intervals insert a buzzword because it is, a consensus. Nietzsche says so.

But even in the dull-brained kids there is a hierarchy (Maslow) and right up the top there, as kings of this dismal netherworld, for “better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven” (Milton, Paradise Lost, 1.263), are the economists. No. Really. They are. Yes indeed. Think about that. Economists are the brightest of them. What must the others be like?

I will tell you. Second in line are the politics students. They are the unoriginal thinkers who can’t do long division, which precludes their getting on an economics course. A looooong way down from that are the psychology students, who can’t add, subtract, or multiply, which is why they do psychology and not politics. I don’t recommend it as a practical course of action, but you can go deeper down into the infernal circles, and there you will discover sociologists. They are doing this degree because their English isn’t good enough for psychology.

Whisper it gently, and if you are of a nervous disposition, you may want to bail out here on this paragraph, because there is a level lower than Sociology. No, it isn’t tapeworms. They’re roughly on a par. That which we are talking about here is a subject that few men dare to countenance, and should you be eating or drinking swallow it now, for I do not wish you to choke as I mention that which, in polite circles, and even most impolite ones, is considered taboo- the matter of Gender Studies. The reason that few men dare to countenance it is that it is the demesne of the sort of person that has been described as “a bunch of hairy-legged vegan lesbian crackpots and dreadful old harpies” (Descartes’ final letter to Hobbes) where misandry is not only the norm but the expected. Seriously, if you are in possession of a bulge in your trousers rather than your blouses avoid them like the plague; Captain Kirk wouldn’t boldy go there, and even Picard is on record as saying he’d rather face the Borg.

Well, I had an economist look over this piece and he reckons that it should upset about fifty-five percent of everybody who reads it and so my work here is done. Although since it’s an economist that’s made that prediction, I’ve weighted it for how wrong they usually are and I reckon it’s going to be more like eighty-seven. Bwuhahaha!

I blame the EU.

Then you deliver them to a party and get paid $30 for your 30 fresh-baked cookies.

You just created $30 minus $2.75 of expenses = $27.25 of wealth.

So, to answer your question, what does it mean that wealth is created?

“Created wealth” means the value that someone else was willing to pay for it.

In my example above, the value was:

Going to Walmart
Buying the ingredients
Preparing the cookies with your secret recipe
Delivering them to the customer

The profit of $27.25 was the value (wealth) you created during this transaction.

The more value you can deliver to the market… the more wealthy you will become.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r96ekp2qlnsa17uo', 'title': 'What does it mean that wealth is created?', 'score': {'original': 0.9396, 'ai': 0.0604}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'You go to Walmart to buy:\n\nOne cup of salted butter — $0.65\nOne cup of white sugar — $0.15\nOne cup of brown sugar — $0.15\nTwo tablespoons of vanilla — $0.05\nTwo large eggs — $0.15\nThree cups of all-purpose flour — $1.50\nOne tablespoon of baking soda — $0.05\n½ Tablespoon of baking powder —$0.05\nTotal: $2.75 USD\n\nNext, you go home and bake 30 cookies.\n\nThen you deliver them to a party and get paid $30 for your 30 fresh-baked cookies.\n\nYou just created $30 minus $2.75 of expenses = $27.25 of wealth.\n\nSo, to answer your question, what does it mean that wealth is created?\n\n“Created wealth” means the value that someone else was willing to pay for it.\n\nIn my example above, the value was:\n\nGoing to Walmart\nBuying the ingredients\nPreparing the cookies with your secret recipe\nDelivering them to the customer\n\nThe profit of $27.25 was the value (wealth) you created during this transaction.\n\nThe more value you can deliver to the market… the more wealthy you will become.', 'result': {'fake': 0.0604, 'real': 0.9396}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1981565, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'You go to Walmart to buy:\n\nOne cup of salted butter — $0.65\nOne cup of white sugar — $0.15\nOne cup of brown sugar — $0.15\nTwo tablespoons of vanilla — $0.05\nTwo large eggs — $0.15\nThree cups of all-purpose flour — $1.50\nOne tablespoon of baking soda — $0.05\n½ Tablespoon of baking powder —$0.05\nTotal: $2.75 USD\n\nNext, you go home and bake 30 cookies.\n\nThen you deliver them to a party and get paid $30 for your 30 fresh-baked cookies.\n\nYou just created $30 minus $2.75 of expenses = $27.25 of wealth.\n\nSo, to answer your question, what does it mean that wealth is created?\n\n“Created wealth” means the value that someone else was willing to pay for it.\n\nIn my example above, the value was:\n\nGoing to Walmart\nBuying the ingredients\nPreparing the cookies with your secret recipe\nDelivering them to the customer\n\nThe profit of $27.25 was the value (wealth) you created during this transaction.\n\nThe more value you can deliver to the market… the more wealthy you will become.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9396

Daniel Schwarz Carigiet,Updated 3y,Why do poor people deserve welfare benefits?,"It’s questions such as this (which almost certainly comes from the US) which make me despair.

Poor people don’t “deserve” welfare. It’s not a question of being worthy of support. The asker is looking at this issue all wrong. It’s not a question of whether the poor “deserve”. It’s a question of whether a society is worth being a part of or not. A society which allows its poor to die is not a society I wish to be a part of, which is why I could never, ever imagine moving to the US.

The measure of how functional a society is, is how it treats its weakest members. I live in Switzerland. Here (and in most countries in Europe), we are proud of the fact that we have built societies which look out for their poor, their sick. They don’t look out for them by handing out alms. They do their best to give the poor a means to survive without being on the streets, without having to fear starvation. They give the sick treatment, no questions asked. So that they won’t become homeless due to astronomical medical bills. We do this because - get this - we believe that this is the right thing to do. Because we don’t believe that unbridled greed is the mark of a good, functional and sustainable society.

We pay for this as part of our taxes. This means that if I lose my job and am not able to find a new one, I will receive unemployment benefits which will allow me to survive with some semblance of dignity. Working full-time at minimum wage here actually earns a living wage.

If someone is poor or sick, we don’t immediately assume that they are lazy. We don’t immediately assume that their predicament is their fault. Of course we know that there will always be those who seek to “milk” the generosity of a society, and we are tough on them. They basically need to pay back all the benefits they received without being eligible. And this can be a LOT of money.

I cannot understand how a society that lays value on christian ideology can behave in such an unchristian manner: Judgemental, greedy, lacking in compassion, empathy, kindness… Have you been paying any attention at all to what Jesus preached? I mean… Have you guys been on your smartphones playing Angry Birds the entire time?

I’m an atheist, for Christ’s sake (and I use that formulation deliberately) - and I won’t let people starve on our streets. That would be unacceptable. We are a rich society. We can afford to help our neighbours. We can afford to be a compassionate society. And we do our best to be one.

So back to your question: “Why do poor people deserve support?” They don’t have to. They have a right to live as human beings and to be treated as such. Even if they are poor, sick, addicted to drugs, even if they have mental issues.

We as a society are only as good as the way we treat our weakest members.

It’s not a question of “deserving”. And even if it were, this throws up the question of who has the right to judge who is “worthy” and who we simply watch die? The bible has a few things to say about that.

Teresa Bryan Peneguy,Updated 5y,Why doesn't the current low US unemployment rate prove that trickle down economics works?,"Why doesn't the current low US unemployment rate prove that trickle down economics works?

Does the OP realize that supply-side economics went into action in the early 1980s? Essentially a generation ago. The employment rate has gone up and down since then.

Here is how the employment rate has looked for the past few decades:

As you can see, the trend was generally up until the recession. It doesn't appear that Reaganomics did much to affect that.

However, this is what average wages have looked like since Reaganomics:

Productivity has been increasing all that time. And the top 1% has done very, very well. Not so for the rest of us; adjusted for inflation, the wages of the average worker have barely budged since 1980, while the costs of health care, housing and education have increased exponentially.

Sucks, doesn't it?

Here is what the unemployment rate looked like after the 2008 crash. It peaked around 2010, and returned to its 2008 level in around 2015.

And here is how the unemployment rate has looked under Obama and Trump so far. As you can see, unemployment has continued to fall under Trump -- but it's simply stayed on the same trajectory as it had under Obama.

The GOP tax bill that passed in April enshrined Reaganomics into our economy till Kingdom Come. The Republicans claimed that the tax cuts would spur job growth, which was an odd claim, as it's been objectively known for decades that isn't how this works.

Economists were essentially unanimous that the bill would increase the deficit, eventually hurt the middle class and do nothing for job growth, but those pesky Republicans passed it anyway.

Since then, they have claimed victory even though it's too early for data: GOP tax cut not why economy is booming

This is Bruce Bartlett:

Mr. Bartlett is a historian, formerly with the Heritage Foundation, a Conservative Think Tank. He served as a domestic policy
adviser to Ronald Reagan
 and as a Treasury
 official under George H. W. Bush
. He was the chief architect of Supply Side Economics.

Since then, he has changed his mind. He has written books and articles on the failure of “Trickle Down” economics: I helped create the GOP tax myth. Trump is wrong: Tax cuts don’t equal growth.
 And he has been very outspoken against GOP tax policy.

I really don't understand why there is any confusion over this.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tj0q53o4yhkgxfzc', 'title': ""Why doesn't the current low US unemployment rate prove that trickle down economics works?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Why doesn't the current low US unemployment rate prove that trickle down economics works?\n\nDoes the OP realize that supply-side economics went into action in the early 1980s?

Prathamesh More,Updated 3y,What's the reason for the rising unemployment in India?,"I am a final year computer engineering student from tier -3 college as the majority of the students. My areas of interests are Android And Web Development with ML in the pipeline.

I am facing many problems. I will share all of them as per my experience till date in my engineering.

When I was in third year, mostly I wasn’t attending college lectures because I was busy with teaching myself new technologies, doing some competitive programming and trying to gain new skills. One day, there was a lecture going on - Theory of Computation. The lecturer literally had no knowledge of his subject. He always comes and just used to while away his time the whole lecture. He always wanted to point out me for my 75% attendance and this happened every time. He asked me what are you doing instead of attending classes. I told him, I was building my personal projects. He said, don't waste your time on useless things, you must be attending college and you need 100% attendance. Now I have one question to ask that teacher. Can you give me an internship or full-time job in product based company without any project experience or a strong resume? “No”.

I had applied for lots of internships, I got shortlisted for many companies because of my personal projects and a strong resume and the teacher still advises me not to waste my time on the projects and asked me to be present in class.

How bad is this dragging someone who tries to improve himself? I don’t expect it from the teacher. So bad.

Practicals - Total 2 hours of time pass. All students used the internet to browse emails and random browsing.

Now talking about internships, There is no meaning for internships in our college. College doesn’t allow for an internship which lasts more than 1 month. I countlessly applied for many internships after the exam. After 2 months of hard work, I got an offer for an internship from a company based in Hinjewadi Pune. But that internship period was 3 months and I know my college won’t sanction 3 months and they will ask me to take one year break from college. How bad it is? As expected the company rejected me.

As a final year student, Why are they still forcing us to sit in the classroom? I want to prepare myself for coding interviews and projects.

Instead of practicing code, we are writing these 5–6 pages notes in the classroom in just 1 lecture and they are totally useless.

I think these are not notes, all lines are the same as the textbook. That same teacher I had told you above is Making timepass of the whole classroom.

Cracking The Coding Interview author say:

I feel so bad inside because of these reasons. They always warn that you will be detained.

That’s why most of the engineering graduates are unemployed and people who want to improve are dragged down because of 75% attendance and detained.

I am not saying that all this waste of time. But there is something going wrong.

Colin Riegels,Updated 2y,How do some people get out of poverty while others stay in it?,"I volunteer at our local food bank, and whilst I am no expert, driving around doing deliveries of food I tend to broadly categorise the recipients (who are generally stuck in grinding poverty) into three broad categories:

Mental challenges. A lot of the people who we deliver to clearly are not all fully there. Not unwell enough to be put into a care facility, but clearly not well enough to fully work and take care of themselves as a normal adult without help.
Bad decisions. A slightly broad category which we can sub divide further. But a lot of those “poor decision” makers tend to be younger females who made some unlucky choices in partners, and are now stuck with young kids and no support network, and so are unable to get out and work whilst still having to take care of a young family.
Old and ran out of money. Older people who just didn’t put enough away, and now cannot get by on what they have left. These ones kind of touch me the most because of the strong sense of pride they still have. Most of the homes we deliver food to look like impoverished homes. A lot of people in the “bad decisions” category answer the door in their underwear having just got out of bed at 1pm. But not the oldies. The older recipients are much more likely to be “old and proud”. They still try to make their home look nice, and always make sure they are up and dressed when we deliver food.

I’d guess those three groups cover about 90% of the people we deliver food to. The other 10% are a weird mix, and some I just can’t figure out. But obviously we only see a very fleeting glimpse of their lives in our role so who is to know what else they have to deal with.

EDIT: A couple of people have expressed concern about the way I phrased my second point, implying that young women “chose” a bad partner, and therefore are architects of their own misfortune. I appreciate that using that figure of speech wasn’t a good choice, but I certainly never meant to imply any fault on behalf of those women. However I am very happy to imply (and express) fault on the part of their erstwhile partners.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/puygxznv2q93jfbw', 'title': 'How do some people get out of poverty while others stay in it?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I volunteer at our local food bank, and whilst I am no expert, driving around doing deliveries of food I tend to broadly categorise the recipients (who are generally stuck in grinding poverty) into three broad categories:\n\nMental challenges.

Erika Fernandez,6mo,How come several of the Dassault Falcon business jets are commercially successful with a 3-engine design when the world of larger airliners is moving to 2 engines because of better economics?,"The Dassault Falcon is a family of business jets that are known for their versatility, performance, and efficiency. The Falcon 50, 900, and 7X are the models that feature a 3-engine configuration, which gives them several advantages over other aircraft in their category.

One of the main advantages of the 3-engine design is that it allows the Falcon jets to operate from shorter runways and more challenging airports, such as high-altitude, hot, or congested ones. This gives the Falcon jets more flexibility and access to more destinations than other business jets.

Another advantage of the 3-engine design is that it improves the safety and reliability of the Falcon jets, especially in case of engine failure or adverse weather conditions. The Falcon jets can fly with one engine out and still maintain their speed and altitude. They can also fly over water or remote areas without worrying about the availability of diversion airports.

Also, it enhances the fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness of the Falcon jets. The 3-engine configuration allows the Falcon jets to use less thrust and drag than other aircraft in their class, which reduces their fuel consumption and emissions. The Falcon jets also have advanced aerodynamics and avionics, which optimize their flight performance and reduce their noise footprint.

That’s why several of the Dassault Falcon business jets are commercially successful with a 3-engine design as they offer more benefits than drawbacks compared to other aircraft in their category. The 3-engine design gives the Falcon jets more flexibility, safety, reliability, efficiency, and eco-friendliness than other business jets.

Tomaž Vargazon,Jan 15,Why do some nations prosper and others fail?,"There is really one, and only one, factor that truly matters in which nations prosper and which ones fail: human capital.

The only thing that matters

If you look at a list of richest nations in the world you notice something peculiar. There are several entries that have no natural resources to speak of, most were former colonies and ordinarily might struggle to just feed themselves, yet are somehow among the richest countries in the world: Switzerland, Finland, Ireland, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan. These countries never had colonial empires, most were either colonies or backwater outposts of larger empires and that was because they had no significant natural resources, yet built up world-classs economies.

What they all have in common is human capital. They have good education and economic systems that allow one to prosper on his own merits. These aren’t always equally available (South Korea is notorious for this), but they exist and those that make good on the system will usually prosper. This is what makes a difference between a prosperous society, all other rich societies have the same setup: build up your own talent pool or attract it from abroad and make sure they can make best with what they have to offer.

Everything else: natural resources, arable land, strategic location, network of navigable rivers, you name it, is useless if you don’t have a source of human capital. Of course if you have all of the above (USA) you’re essentially destined to become a major power, but without human capital you’ll be a backwater, exploited by others. All major powers had access to human capital and the rise of USA as a major power coincides with attracting major additional human capital from authoritarian and/or war-torn Europe. You can build a major power that way, but you can’t sustain it. You need domestic sources of human capital as well.

That’s why public education and universal healthcare shouldn’t be seen as an entitlement, let alone waste of public funds. They’re not even a right. What public education and universal healthcare are is an invesment, they’re an invesment that’s basically guaranteed to pay itself out to the society a hundred times over.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/po3zvgbrsj9y5he6', 'title': 'Why do some nations prosper and others fail?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'There is really one, and only one, factor that truly matters in which nations prosper and which ones fail: human capital.\n\nThe only thing that matters\n\nIf you look at a list of richest nations in the world you notice something peculiar.

Ian Lang,3y,"Which sciences are still not technically esteemed as “sciences” yet? For example, I heard it wasn’t until recently when psychology was actually categorized as a science. I also heard economics is by no means considered a science yet. Anything else?","Economics is actually a science, it’s just not a very good one, as it’s the science of making wild guesses from data that bears no relation to future trends.

Then there’s management science, which is the method of poncing about looking important whilst waiting for something lucky to happen that you can take the credit for.

Engineering isn’t considered a science since what it is is physics with its head out of its arse-end and doing something useful. Physicists think that vacuums are a useful model. Engineers know that vacuums are useful sucky devices and can also be used to stop conduction (but not radiation). Physics gave us the theory of powered flight. Two bicycle mechanics gave us an aeroplane and a railway mechanic gave us the Spitfire and a carpenter the Hurricane, and how did that work out for you, Doctor Heinkel?

What I do is considered far from science but you just try working out what the bollocks emanating from the customer’s gob actually translates to in practical upshot and you’ll soon find out it’s harder than lab work. “My printer doesn’t print” can often be translated as “I have done something unnecessary and complicated and so completely shot my computer and indeed my network that now it’s a smoking wreck so can you please spend the next ninety minutes listening to me use words the definition of which I do not know and then derive what it is I actually mean and clean up this mess I have made because I cannot follow an instruction that is so simple the average hamster could have done it, thank you, whilst I question your every move and make breathtakingly twatty suggestions in which I may or may not drop a very brief nugget of relevance that you will miss if you are not paying the fullest attention”, and “telly doesn’t get any channels” often means “I have no Sky, Virgin, or other means of input and I am not aware, because I did a degree in Business Admin, that to receive Freeview, it is necessary to have an aerial” or alternatively “I have pressed something on the remote control and I don’t know what and am unable to concisely articulate to you what it is I am seeing on the screen and all of this is your fault, however once you have pointed out that I am in fact as dumb as toast and told me what buttons to press so that I can again watch the Kardashians, I will give you no credit for it”. Similarly “a battery shouldn’t go after fourteen months” can be directly translated as “I know very little about battery chemistries, the proper care and maintenance thereof, or indeed the fact that my device actually had a battery despite the fact that I put it on charge twice a day, and because I know very little about that but I have done a degree in Psychology at the University of Twatshire I expect that you, who did your degree in grubby things like EME, know less than I do despite the fact that you’re a qualified technician, you bloody oik”.

Similarly food nutrition isn’t a real science even though they work in labs, the very least qualified of them will have at least an HND and they’re what’s stopping you from simultaneously gorging yourself and starving to death with their knowledge of how you can or can’t get energy from what you stuff down your gorge.

I once knew a horrible woman who had done Sports Sciences. This is what we used to call PE. I’m probably being unfair to those who have done this discipline here but since she is the only example I have and she was as thick as a cow’s arse then sorry, but no, if that’s a science then I’m a Russian ballerina and yes, I may from time dress up in a tutu and put on a silly accent but a Russian ballerina in fact I am most decidedly not.

And that’s another thing. People think that ballet is poncing about being twinkly, but I have known a genuine ballerina or two and the precision with which they have to move their feet, hands and even arses if they’re going to get anywhere in the ballet world or not get shouted at vehemently by some dreadful valkyrie with a big stick and a sharp tongue actually exceeds the precision I used to work to on my bloody lathe. It’s the same with musicians. Your average violinist has got a much better understanding of frequencies and when something is wrong with a violin than I have because he or she knows precisely what 440Hz sounds like, even if they do call it A. And those little squiggly dot things on lines are occult to me. I’ve got a good idea what they mean. No idea what bits of a piano I should be pressing when I see one, though. And if I pressed the right bit, and instead of tinkle it went “spoink” I wouldn’t know the difference. The science of producing aesthetically pleasing noises. It’s like voodoo, I tell you, voodoo.

And that’s another another thing. Theatre technicians are often looked down on as poncing about screaming. Oh yes? Do you know all about lighting, acoustics, and the bits at the back that move things about? No you don’t, you bloody sociologist, but the miserable-looking bloke by the back door wearing a polo-shirt and chain-smoking does. He’s doing applied sciences whilst your arse is plonked on a comfy seat watching equally skilled thespians, dancers, singers or whatever applying their skilled trades for your delectation doing something you can’t grasp. Alright?

Crikey. Even for me, that was an oblique rant. I blame the fact that it’s Christmas Eve. For the next three days I’m forced by convention to be sociable, benevolent, and full of bonhomie.

Balls. I’m going to need a crate of John Player’s and a tankerful of Red Bull for that.

Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. I suppose I ought to add in something about not catching Coronabollocks but since the little bastard appears to have sent in the elite stormtroopers now I don’t see much point, but try to stay out of the bullets anyway.

Merry Christmas, EU.

Feck. I’ll not survive all this cheeriness intact.

Hector Quintanilla,3y,"In a tight economic time, what can middle class people do to stay middle class?","Imagine catching a Coca-Cola top executive drinking a Pepsi-Cola!

That would be just priceless, wouldn't it?

Ohh, I can't express enough how much I desired to accomplish this prank on my friend! Each time I invited him home for dinner or a family event, I made sure I had a Pepsi bottle ready. My goal was to find the opportunity to distract him, have him grab the Pepsi bottle, and take a picture!

I never succeeded; it was impossible! My friend was unbelievably loyal and proud to work for Coca-Cola.

Ever since my friend graduated college, he had been super lucky to find this job. That was almost 25 years ago. The opportunity to scale the corporate ladder in this corporation was huge.

My friend consistently exceeded expectations. With discipline and hard work, he found success and grew a good reputation inside the corporation. In fact, he was so successful in his area of expertise, that he recently was promoted to run a new division in the United States.

Then, the unimaginable happened!

Early in May, he called me. He was torn in pieces. I could sense a tremor in his voice. Devastated, he told me, “Hector, I don’t know what I am gonna do. I lost my job!”

With millions of restaurants closed and all social events canceled, the beverage industry has been tremendously impacted by the pandemic. His division was severely damaged. The company leaders were swift and decisive, sending hundreds of people in his area home.

He was included.

Coca-Cola laying off people? Really? Who could imagine that! I know he didn't. Personally, I never thought it could ever happen. I mean, his job was supposed to be probably one of the “safest” jobs I had in mind.

Now, to answer your question, in a tight economic time, what can middle class people do to stay middle class?

Today, the biggest problem my friend has is the fact that he has zero income. He lost his job, and his paycheck was his ONLY source of income, a mistake that nobody of us could have predicted.

What is the lesson?

In the words of Mr. Warren Buffett, “Never depend on a single source of income.”

Most members of the middle class rely on a single source of income. This is a HUGE mistake. The best way to secure this economic status is by diversifying risk.

Never trust your future entirely to a paycheck in today's rapidly-changing world. The risk of disruption is growing exponentially.

I’ve been guiding my friend on how to diversify and generate multiple sources of income. I’ll be revealing these experiences very soon to my clients and students.

Vote for politicians who will work for everyone once they are in office. Not just for their traditional identity group - religion, caste, tribe, language, region, whatever. This will mean lower focus on divisive traditional identity issues, and more on economic growth.

Get yourself the best education possible. You are no longer limited to your local teachers. The internet is at your command. Use it.

YG,3y,What are your views on Narayan Murthy's statement that Indians should work for 60 hours a week to make the economic losses good when the coronavirus pandemic is over?,"Been with Infosys for 3 years now, all I can say is that 60 hours a week would roughly come to 12 hours (excluding 2 Saturday and Sunday).

Let me tell you how it actually works in Infosys. I work for a client (US based) which demands me (obviously indirectly) to work for 10–11 hours. The routine is somewhat like this for most of the days; Early morning call from 8AM-9AM or may be 9AM-10AM. Then daily professional chores until 6PM (including lunch of 45mins and tea break of 20–25mins). Late evening calls of minimum 2 hours from 8PM-10PM. Apart from this we also have to be on “On call” support on weekends (for full 9 hours). This routine is considered NORMAL (mind you!) and 80% of project mates follow this.

More or less this trend is followed across in most the projects within Infosys. If you do not follow this or refuse to make it a habit, then you are bound to fall into the hit list of the “MANAGER” (I am quoting because he is the GOD)!! I am not sure what else is expected from us after COVID 19. We are anyway working for long hours.

I oftenly hear that the project bids are won mostly because of promises made for such routines. Client is obviously happy to accept boot licking and Indian IT companies you know have very obedient slaves!

Coming onto Respected Narayana Murthy; I personally do not have any grudge against this man but then also I do not look upto him. He has done quite a good things in life and built such a big empire, but then may be forgot to match up to new generation. We do not want slavery, or Sir or MADAM culture; we just need balanced personal and professional life along with self respect at workplace. Infosys does not at all have any such words in its dictionary or POLICY!

Jean-Marie Valheur,Feb 15,What are some of the best hoaxes of all time?,"This is a hoax I, myself, fell for. Everyone did, at the time. See there’s this lady, Sacheen Littlefeather. She died in 2022.

She did this to “raise awareness for the plight of Native Americans”. It caused a huge uproar, and it was enormously controversial at the time. Incredibly effective activism, too. Anyway the lady died and her sisters — last name Cruz — came out and said she had been lying, misrepresenting her heritage.[1] Born Maria Louise Cruz, “Littlefeather” was the daughter of a Mexican immigrant and a white mother of French, German and Dutch heritage.

Sacheen Littlefeather has ZERO association with any Native American tribes. Her whole identity was as fake as the name she adopted for herself. She was, for all intents and purposes, the Rachel Dolezal of Native American activism. And for over fifty years… most bought it. Hell, in 2022 the Oscars even came out with an “official apology”.

Anubhav Jain,Updated 4y,What's the reason for the rising unemployment in India?,"“Humaara beta vakeel ban gaya”

(Our son has become a lawyer)

His parents boasted in front of the entire society and distributed Desi ghee Laddoos.

Their son recently completed LLB from a renowned state university.

He didn't attend a single class, even the college wasn't interested in making him attend any class because active students require heavy investment.

He was handed over a Kunji (a 30–40 page shortcut book) every semester which was meant to be read a day before exam to easily pass in a subject.

But he was confident enough to avoid that also.

Read little bit, little bit cheating and the highest degree of liberal checking by examiners arranged 50% marks in platter for him.

And finally fake internship.

But nevertheless he scored 100% in partying, sleeping, drinking, bullying and other related subjects.

Finally he didn't get any job and couldn't think about freelancing because his knowledge and skills were like a brand new tiffin being sold at a store, looks beautiful but can't feed your stomach.

He couldn't earn any money, all his achievements were shadowed under his failures.

His parents became stressed from being proud.

Finally, they arranged for a loan and opened a photostat shop for him near the court, but some parents can't even do that.

What's the reason for rising unemployment in India?

Universities, which aim only at reducing the number of failures by distributing free marks and carrying out no surprise inspection of colleges.
Colleges, which are like money minting factories aiming at enrolling students and minimizing operating expenses. (Many colleges are indirectly owned by corrupt politicians)
Students who belong to middle or lower middle or even lower class families but firmly believe/dream that just a degree will get them a wonderful career. They have absolutely no interest towards learning, and lack of any control makes them even more motivated. They just don't think about the future.
Lack of practical knowledge and skills in syllabus, theory based studies.
The over all development pattern of the country, which means the growth in number of people seeking employment is much higher than the growth in job generation due to slow development and population explosion.
And finally the governments for not strictly regulating universities, and colleges, and not taking enough measures for employment generation.

Misha Firer,Feb 15,Why has Russia always been poor?,"A Russian man’s flower bouquet to assist him in his noble mission to destroy American Hegemony: a camouflage wrapper with symbolic nuts and a bottle of American Coca Cola.

Putin’s regime started off in 2000 with false flag terrorist attack against civilians in Moscow to justify launching another war in Chechnya. It rapidly spiraled into real terrorist attacks creating a vicious cycle.

External terrorism became the internal terrorization of the critics of the regime and un-controlled opposition.

Putin has built Terrorist Dystopia, in which social degradation spread like cancer tumor: branches of power lost independence, corruption became the norm, institution of marriage and birthrates collapsed.

In professional activities all the rules and norms have been thrown out of the window along with its critics, brain drain accelerated. There’s a shortage of personnel while management costs of unproductive workforce is only increasing.

In this winter, millions of people have been left without central heating and electricity as a cascade of accidents spread across the country.

The most corrupt and sycophant individuals became the leaders everywhere from public schools to regional legislature.

There are no journalists left, only propagandists. Labor productivity fell as bosses are not held accountable. They don’t care to make employees work hard as they are paid pennies and can’t be promoted because all the top spots are taken by the inner circle appointees leaving them unmotivated.

Every evening I watch a stampede of Russian Railways office plankton at 6pm from the glass office building running across the road on red light risking their lives to put the distance faster between the hated job and the metro station.

The Russian made Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft is preparing for an emergency landing at Sheremetyevo Airport. The aircraft took off from Moscow heading to St. Petersburg, an hour away. According to the source, one of the plane's engines failed.

The number of the employees of this state corporation has tripled since the collapse of the Soviet Union and revenues come from ticket sales that cost as much as flight tickets and transportation of natural resources overseas using the old Soviet rail tracks. No new lines have been built.

Putin decided to follow in the footsteps of Nazi Germany and when the society started to get torn apart and internal terror couldn’t cope with it, he relieved tensions through external expansion.

Rebranded McDonald’s called “Tasty and Period” continues to get new equipment and support from McDonald's in neighbor country Kazakstan. Russia can’t run a fast food chain on its own without a supervision and its own technologies.

Putin ordered to create organization of the patriotic competition for mentors “To be, not to seem!”

The phrase “To be, not to seem!” (Mehr sein als scheinen) was the slogan of political schools in Nazi Germany, where they trained leadership for the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) and the SS - the party's paramilitary units. When World War II began, many school graduates joined the SS and Wehrmacht.

Putin is witlessly creating Nazism in Russia under the guise of anti-Nazi fight.

Border city of Belgorod has become a shooting range for the Ukrainian Army bombardments. Special Military Operation has nothing to do with securing borders and making Russia safer. If anything, it made Russia much less safe than ever before.

Russia is world’s largest country and second least densely populated and yet Putin sacrifices the remaining workforce and economy to enlarge it through a war of conquest.

Pouring asphalt into water and spreading it with a shovel. Patent pending: 384949.

As a KGB agent, Putin knows only one social mechanism available to him - terror.

His utopian promises about great achievements that will be done in some distant future is a relic of the Bolshevik pseudo-religious doctrine that sold future to the uneducated peasants because they lagged far behind the Western civilization in the present.

Putin does not have a plan for post-war Russia. Even if he were to occupy all of Ukraine and defeat American hegemony, his country lacks workforce, technologies and a clear vision of the future to take the global lead.

As such, Russia’s future is to be China’s vassal for many decades if not centuries to come. This is Putin’s real legacy.

John Cate,5y,Would America be better off without food stamps?,"America would be better off if food stamps were no longer necessary.

A question like this takes the wrong tack. Food stamps exist because there are many people in this country who would be unable to eat, or at least eat anything resembling healthy food, if they didn’t exist. Some might be able to get food from their local churches or food banks, but this isn’t guaranteed, and it might not be nutritious food even if it’s available.

As long as this is the case, we’re not better off without food stamps. That doesn’t mean we should simply accept their existence as a fact of life, however. A great American once had this to say about social welfare programs:

Welfare's purpose should be to eliminate, as far as possible, the need for its own existence.

Ronald Reagan said that on 7 January 1970 in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. I think it gets right to the point. He didn’t say we should get rid of welfare programs, he thought we should strive to get to a point where they were no longer necessary.

And it’s not just Reagan who felt that way. Here’s a quote from the most famous Socialist who ever held power in this country, the guy who created most of these programs:

We have here a human as well as an economic problem. When humane considerations are concerned, Americans give them precedence. The lessons of history, confirmed by the evidence immediately before me, show conclusively that continued dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national fibre. To dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.

Those are the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt on 4 January 1935, in an address to Congress.

The question we should be asking is why the country with the world’s largest economy has 38.9 million people on food stamps? (It was more than 44 million just a few years ago.) And when people demand a $15/hour wage for work that doesn’t command such a salary, we should be asking why that is necessary, as well. Do we not have enough jobs available that pay a living wage? Or is it simply that we don’t have readily available job training that allows people to learn the skills needed to work a job that pays a living wage? Either way, when we think it’s necessary to put artificial controls on the cost of labor, we’re doing something wrong that goes way beyond the surface of the matter.

Even FDR only intended welfare programs as a temporary measure to help people get back on their feet. We as a society have transformed them into a way of life for some people—and it’s not because all of them are lazy and don’t want to work. Some are like this, but there are many more who simply lack opportunity to escape the cycle. They want jobs and opportunity, not handouts, but society offers too little of the former and plenty of the latter.

We’ll never get rid of social welfare programs entirely. But the goal should be to get them to a point where they’re not an ongoing topic of discussion, because they will only be a temporary expedient for people until they can get back on their feet—which is what they were always intended to be. When we can get to that point, then America will be much better off.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/80neyjao4cstzvwk', 'title': 'Would America be better off without food stamps?', 'score': {'original': 0.49705, 'ai': 0.50295}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""America would be better off if food stamps were no longer necessary.\n\nA question like this takes the wrong tack.

Misha Firer,Sep 17,Why does it seem that most countries have a better economic situation than Russia’s?,"Russia has redirected commercial activities from Europe to China, but there are a number of insurmountable obstacles to this economic partnership.

The fundamental one is that, unlike America and Europe, Russia does not have its own technologies, machinery, or factory equipment to design and manufacture consumer goods, from electronic wristwatches to passenger vehicles.

In the past two decades, Russians have been counting money and buying stuff produced by transnational corporations rather than investing in research and development and creating their own technologies. The reckoning is just around the corner.

There lies a chasm between the dependence of America on China, and that of Russia. Mexico has become America’s largest trading partner and the new iPhone is Made in India. America is actively decoupling from China, while Russia is doing exactly the opposite - becoming more dependent on China by the day.

For example, all the new vehicles that are hitting roads (built with German equipment) in Russia are now Chinese. They’re planning to open a Chery auto factory in St. Petersburg taking advantage of the departed South Korean Hyundai. Like their Western counterparts in the past, the Chinese will not share technologies with the Russians. The local workforce will attach doors and screw the screws, but all the engineers will be Chinese.

On their own, Russia cannot substitute departed Western brands - only China can do it with the technologies they “borrowed” from the West. Anything more complicated than off-brand shampoo or plastic cups is beyond Russia’s capabilities.

Public officials can pretend for all they like that the former Renault-Nissan factory in Moscow now produces the “Moskvich” car brand associated with the mass-produced Opel copycats in the Soviet Union, it is still JAC JS4 SUV, and it’s as Russian as the Peking duck.

The second issue is logistics. There are potted roads with one lane each way and far fewer railway tracks in Siberia than in the European part of Russia.

As a consequence, freight trains with timber, coal, and other raw materials headed across eleven time zones are stuck for days and weeks waiting in line for their turn to pass through. The situation is exacerbated by trains with military equipment headed to bring military equipment from storage facilities in the Far East.

China is in no rush to jump in to build infrastructure projects in Siberia and open up shops in Russia to produce consumer goods of the departed Western brands as they’re in bad economic shape and fear that sanctions from America might completely crush their economy.

The future, however, is crystal clear - if Russia doesn’t manage to patch up relationships with the West, which right now appears unlikely, China will fill in the vacuum and Russia will become a raw materials appendage to the Red Dragon.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,5y,Is it possible for Kashmir to survive on its own? Is it capable of sustaining its economy and GDP? How various sectors fare with respect to overall Indian economy?,"Jammu and Kashmir GDP is about $18 billion and that is just below that of countries like Afghanistan and Zimbabwe. In terms of GDP contribution the entire state is probably equivalent to Andheri and accounts for just 0.6% of Indian GDP.

And a lot of that GDP comes from the Jammu region that has a sizeable manufacturing and agricultural base. Kashmir valley alone makes less than half of the state’s GDP. And a lot of it is due to Indian government’s direct spending [on army, police, infrastructure], grants to the state and spending of Indian tourists. In short, the state is currently worth almost nothing in economic terms.

In terms of the finances of the state, it is horrible. Look at the 4th line in the table below and see how it stands out from the rest. That is the amount the central government just gives it as grant — in return for nothing.

The Kashmir valley is landlocked and if it becomes independent, will be sandwiched between India and Pakistan. There is no manufacturing industry and the chaos in division, besides closer relationship with Pakistan will destroy whatever is left of its tourism industry. Do a lot of people go to the Swat valley in Pakistan? Similar story for Kashmir if it gets out of India.

Other than shawls and saffron they produce nothing much of worth and that would not be sufficient to import bare minimum coal, oil and gas to support the economy. The valley has virtually no energy source.

There is no global trade and the agriculture cannot sustain even its population of 6 million. J&K imported goods worth Rs 58,050 cr in 2017-18
 Without sufficient food production there will be hunger just like in many parts of Afghanistan.

There are no major universities in the Kashmir valley. They are not great in almost any sport, art or academic field — even worse than an already poor Indian level.

Ashok Dhamija,4y,What do you think of Rahul Gandhi’s ₹72000 to 20% poor promise? Is it even achievable?,"Time has come to make provision for a Negative vote too. We already have a Positive vote and a Zero vote (NOTA).

Is Rahul Gandhi going to pay from some Swiss accounts?

No. He will pay from the taxes collected from you and me. For which we toil hard. Be ready to work extra so that Rahul Gandhi can fulfil his dream of becoming PM of India.

Rahul Gandhi wants about 25 crore people in India to just relax and earn ₹ 72,000 per year without doing anything. He is just trying to create 25 crore parasites.

So, you and me will have to work more and sacrifice more, so that 25 crore parasites can just sleep at home and wake up to get ready-made food. Only because they voted for Rahul Gandhi.

And, for this Rahul Gandhi deserves a NEGATIVE vote in elections. Not just vote positive vote to his opponent.

It is the Congress party which has created the freebie culture. Now, this culture of “getting money for doing nothing” is being taken to a new level. A new pedestal.

Previously, there was at least a “drama” of doing some work, a drama of creating some “asset” to pay the so-called wages, which were basically freebies.

Now, no need even to do anything. Just relax at your home and get money from Government.

Just stop whatever small work you are doing. Just ensure that your name figures in the so-called 20% poor of India.

Voila!!! You are entitled to get money now for doing nothing. NOTHING as in vacuum.

Let India go to hell. Who bothers for India if one’s political party can win by giving such bribes to the voters.

It has been mentioned in the media that ₹ 360,000 crore would be needed every year to distribute this free money to 20% poor by Rahul Gandhi, who wants to become the new PM of India. Okay. Let me accept this figure for the time being.

What else could have been done with this money?

Firstly, just modify the mechanism of the scheme proposed. Instead of giving ₹ 72,000 every year free, this money can create employment for 5 crore people every year for ₹ 6000 per month. Get constructive work done from 5 crore people for 365 days of the year, and pay them salary of ₹ 72,000 per year, instead of paying them for doing nothing and thereby diminishing the productivity of India.

So, look at how much employment can be generated in a respectable way!

The cost of construction of a two-lane flexible pavement road (bituminous pavement) of width about 7 meter would be about ₹ 1 crore per km. So, with ₹ 360,000 crore, you can build 360,000 km roads every year! Yes, it is every year!!

And, substantial part of this money would still go ultimately to poor persons who would work on road construction, or work in industries which supply construction materials.

So, Mr. Rahul Gandhi, you can create 360,000 km roads EVERY YEAR with this much money, and yet a substantial part of this money will go to poor. But, in a respectable manner, while creating assets for the nation.

Just to put the things in correct perspective, till 2015-16, India had about 100,000 km of national highways, 176,000 km of state highways, and about 560,000 km of district roads. I am not mentioning the rural roads which are much more in length, because a two-lane flexible pavement road (bituminous pavement) of width about 7 meter will be equivalent to at least a district road!!!

So, in 5 years of Rahul rule, India can have 3 times more roads with this much money, with employment for a large number of people.

Okay. Presuming that in about ₹ 500 per month fee, a child can be given reasonably good school education (one of my close relatives is running a school in a big town giving good English medium school education at less than this fee), it will cost ₹ 6000 per year. With ₹ 360,000 crore per year, you can give good quality school education to 60 crore children every year!!! Give education tokens.

Are you listening, Mr. Rahul Gandhi? And, of course, it will also lead to employment to a large number of people, directly or indirectly, while making children properly educated and smart.

In the 2019 budget, ₹ 61,398 crore budgetary allocation was made for the health sector, with ₹ 6,400 crore earmarked for the centre's ambitious ""Ayushman Bharat"" scheme, which is highly publicized as a game-changer programme. Look at the impact, that this scheme is creating with only this much budget!

Come on, Mr Gandhi. You could have made about 6 TIMES more provision for health with your ₹ 360,000 crore funds. And, for Ayushman Bharat, the increase could have been about 56 TIMES!!!

And, this would also have provided employment to people, in addition to providing good health.

The cost of our successful Mars mission (Mangalyaan) was only ₹ 450 crore.

The cost of 36 Rafale fighter jets is about ₹ 59,000 crore. So, every year (yes every year), we could have purchased / manufactured 216 Rafale jets with your money! Means 1080 Rafale fighter plane in 5 years of your government with the money that you want to put in the drain!!!

Can you imagine what it would have meant? The kind of restraint that it would have created on Pakistan and China? The number of lives that would have been saved due to reduction in terrorism?

I can go on and on.

The fact remains that I have no issue with spending ₹ 360,000 crore per year. But, spend it on some constructive things. Roads, health, education, industries, agriculture, irrigation. Any type of constructive work. Do not use this money to create 25 crore beggars in India.

Don’t use this money (which belongs to us, we the people, and comes from us) to buy votes for your party. This is just bribery. And, dacoity too.

To reply to the second part of your question, whether this much money is achievable, let me tell you that total revenue collection of Government of India as per 2018 budget was about ₹ 24 lakh crore. And, total expenditure was about ₹ 29 lakh crore. So, we are already spending more than the revenue. If you want to spend ₹ 3.6 lakh crore extra every year, then you have to squeeze some other expenditure. Or, you may have to tax us more.

So, either you increase taxes by about 15%. I am being simplistic.

Or, you decrease existing expenditure accordingly. What expenditure will you decrease? On defence? On education? On health? Because you cannot touch salaries and pension which take away a large part of expenditure by government.

Or, will you decrease the existing subsidies or completely abolish all subsidies to replace them with this new freebie scheme for 20% poor? Remember, that may not be possible for you because existing subsidies go a much wider section of the society. For example, food subsidies are given to about 66% of the population (this was started by your mother, Mr. Rahul Gandhi). So, if you give all this money to 20% poor, where from you will pay to the remaining people for various types of subsidies?

In essence, the proposed scheme of Rahul Gandhi is a disaster for India. From any angle you consider it.

Worst of all, it will further solidify the position of India as a country of beggars.

If you can get free money, why will you work?

So, another competition may start to declare oneself poor.

It will be mostly the middle class who would be paying to Rahul Gandhi so that he can buy votes from poor.

The only saving grace is that Rahul Gandhi’s party is not likely to win 2019 elections despite this bribe of ₹ 360,000 crore every year to 20% of voters!!!

To come back to what I said in the beginning, if a new system of Negative vote is introduced, I will cast my Negative vote against Congress, for trying to destroy whatever is left of India.

There is already a race to destroy India – in one way or the other. And, it appears the competition is becoming more and more intense. Politicians do not want to see India prosper. They just want their votes. So that they could then loot India for 5 years.

So, my Negative Vote goes to Rahul Gandhi.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hwr7v5qmcgbeno4t', 'title': 'What do you think of Rahul Gandhi’s ₹72000 to 20% poor promise?

Be ready to work extra so that Rahul Gandhi can fulfil his dream of becoming PM of India.\n\nRahul Gandhi wants about 25 crore people in India to just relax and earn ₹ 72,000 per year without doing anything. He is just trying to create 25 crore parasites.\n\nSo, you and me will have to work more and sacrifice more, so that 25 crore parasites can just sleep at home and wake up to get ready-made food. Only because they voted for Rahul Gandhi.\n\nAnd, for this Rahul Gandhi deserves a NEGATIVE vote in elections. Not just vote positive vote to his opponent.\n\nIt is the Congress party which has created the freebie culture. Now, this culture of “getting money for doing nothing” is being taken to a new level. A new pedestal.\n\nPreviously, there was at least a “drama” of doing some work, a drama of creating some “asset” to pay the so-called wages, which were basically freebies.\n\nNow, no need even to do anything.

Okay. Let me accept this figure for the time being.\n\nWhat else could have been done with this money?\n\nFirstly, just modify the mechanism of the scheme proposed. Instead of giving ₹ 72,000 every year free, this money can create employment for 5 crore people every year for ₹ 6000 per month. Get constructive work done from 5 crore people for 365 days of the year, and pay them salary of ₹ 72,000 per year, instead of paying them for doing nothing and thereby diminishing the productivity of India.\n\nSo, look at how much employment can be generated in a respectable way!\n\nThe cost of construction of a two-lane flexible pavement road (bituminous pavement) of width about 7 meter would be about ₹ 1 crore per km.

The first budget of Modi 2.0 has been quite disappointing. While their social schemes have been quite good, these welfare schemes have to be paid by the large businesses. And the government has not been paying attention to them.

I get that we need to build toilets and give out LPG cylinders. But, is that an excuse for not speeding up the economic reforms and unlock key investments? When are we going to bring key major foreign investments in retail, aviation, agriculture and other key sectors?

With the opposition decimated, this is the best time to bring bold new reforms. I expected the victorious Modi in second term to bring out the long awaited reforms that unshackled China in the 1980s. It is one thing to engage in welfare politics before the elections, but now that it is won and no major state elections are near, what is the excuse for going slow?

There has not been big bang reforms and economic reforms are getting as bad as past Congress governments. Even basic things like selling Air India and BSNL is taking far too long.

The NPA mess that UPA 1 created are yet to be cleaned off. There is no nationwide urgency to clean the banks and no public recognition of the dire crisis.

There are no big reforms in land and labour — two chains that shackle Indian businesses. There is no big push for exports — although we make in India, we have never seen any benefit to that. There are no new cities built — the smart cities have neither been smart nor been cities.

We expected the former Gujarat CM to replicate his magic at the centre. Rather it is increasingly looking like Congress [just more efficient & less corrupt] — more on welfare politics and less on capitalism.

Let Amit Shah keep working on his realpolitik, but Modi needs to come out and go big bang on issues of real substance. That is the only way to make history.

If you don’t take right kind of risks at the right time, you risk losing everything. Just as Dhoni [who cleared the team of old timers when he took over] found out, BJP has to realise that the same forces that sent them up, can also bring them down.

Joan Vredik Broadley,2y,What do the rich buy that the poor don't even know about?,"Thanks to some family inheritances, my daughter and her husband moved to a wealthy neighbourhood in our town. Life is very different there than in the middle-lower class neighbourhood they both grew up in! One of the items that wealthy people use here in Calgary, are backpack snow blowers for the many winter days that sidewalks must be cleared after frequent snowfalls. My son-in-law told me that their neighbourhood is a hub for the noisy machines working away early mornings clearing sidewalks. For years I have been shovelling snow and, quite frankly, hate that job.

Ty Doyle,8mo,What are the biggest “money traps” surrounding home ownership that people seldom realize until they buy a home?,"The biggest money traps when it comes to home ownership are taking care of what you have. When you rent, it's usually the case that when something breaks, it's your landlord's problem.

Chris Everett,8mo,What are the biggest “money traps” surrounding home ownership that people seldom realize until they buy a home?,"hmmm…

That people don’t realize.

I mean, I think most people understand some of them… Taxes, insurance, appliances…

And I think that most people have at least some idea of some bigger ones… roof replacements or a new furnace, for example.

Things that seem to catch people less aware, in my experience, include:

Landscaping. Especially tree services. Having a tree removed can be really expensive. If you are looking at a home with large trees on the property, I’d strongly suggest taking a very close look at if those trees will need to be removed or have serious pruning work done soon.
Water heaters. Especially if not maintained properly, water heaters don’t last all that long. (Drain your tank every six months).
Painting. Exterior paint is a critical protection for your home, and it can be an expensive service.

More broadly, the thing I see is new homeowners who can’t DIY most tasks… Bluntly, most home maintenance and repair isn’t complicated. It rarely requires special tools or expensive parts. And I see a lot of new homeowners hire out for things they should be able to do themselves, and what’s really expensive is people.

For example, let’s take a furnace.

Nothing here is complicated. Nearly every part can be replaced, (except for the heat exchanger), with a fairly limited set of tools and abilities.

As long as the heat exchanger remains intact, it almost never makes sense to just replace a furnace because some random part fails. But if you go to a service, they will always tell you you need a new one, at the cost of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars rather than replacing a ten dollar part… Which you can probably do yourself with a five dollar screwdriver.

Yes, this requires a certain degree of common sense. Knowing to shut off the power and/or gas, etc. But here in 2023, there are youtube channels devoted entirely to doing this sort of thing yourself, walking you through step by step.

The biggest money trap of all is to rely on other to maintain your home.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sw81mh9nf7cpid3z', 'title': 'What are the biggest “money traps” surrounding home ownership that people seldom realize until they buy a home?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'hmmm…\n\nThat people don’t realize.\n\nI mean, I think most people understand some of them… Taxes, insurance, appliances…\n\nAnd I think that most people have at least some idea of some bigger ones… roof replacements or a new furnace, for example.\n\nThings that seem to catch people less aware, in my experience, include:\n\nLandscaping.

Barrie Levine,Updated 4y,What was life like in 2008?,"Ten years ago, another lifetime.

I was in my early sixties. Feeling healthy, immortal.

Married for thirty five beautiful years.

Managing a full caseload and court schedule of divorces and mediations.

My husband PAUL operated a busy beauty salon, master of the precision haircut and raconteur extraordinaire, another secret of his success.

I visited my elderly mom Rose three times a week, buying groceries, doing laundry, then bringing her home for a weekend stay when meals were not served at her senior residence.

I texted daily with my legal mentor and Best Friend Forever, Neila.

The seasons unfolded as they usually did in New England, a brutal winter with blizzards and power outages, then spring a long time coming, summer lush and bright with vegetables filling the garden and then the salad bowl, autumn deeply colorful from the backyard to the mountains in northern Vermont.

Ten years later, in 2018, my life is unrecognizable.

I am into my seventies, widowed.

My law practice no more. Of all the work/family balancing acts I successfully achieved early on—raising children and building my career—it didn’t work this time. Retirement didn’t turn into financial security and going on cruises. Necessity meant setting all else aside to take on the privilege of caregiver to my life partner.

Paul’s shop, the pride and joy of a talented Dorchester boy who quit high school to go to hairdressing school, is closed. He worked mightily to maintain his identity as a hairdresser but a severe dementia disease took him down hard by the end of 2013.

Rose is gone too, but I’ve been told that is in the natural scheme of things. Her sweet and loving nature was so powerful that it casts a warm and gentle light over my life to this day. She told me not to double down on grief on her account. I respected her wisdom and carried out her wish for me.

Neila died last year due to a freak accident on a cruise ship near Puerto Rico. She shepherded me through tough times when grief was on my daily plate. Who will help me next time?

But the distinct seasons play out, same as they did in 2008.

Today I am in New York City on a crisp autumn morning, walking with my SIL, daughter, and little grandson in Riverside Park, along the Hudson.

The wide paths lined with shade trees and wrought-iron framed park benches remind me of Paris. Central Park not our venue today as it is crowded with spectators waiting for the marathon runners.

So much that is irreplaceable has been taken away from me in the past ten years.

Yet much has been added too. Called upon to deal with loss, resilience has been my gift.

Letting in memory, acceptance, and gratitude eventually conquered the dark and hopeless days when healing seemed unattainable, for a long time only a foreign concept to me.

Blessed with a sweet grandson, an unexpected new relationship, and a perfect autumn day in New York City, I open my heart again.

I feel like a cat who has claimed one more of its nine lives.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6hlw2tg79n4mpof8', 'title': 'What was life like in 2008?', 'score': {'original': 0.49715, 'ai': 0.50285}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Ten years ago, another lifetime.\n\nI was in my early sixties.

The goal of a lockdown is to contain the spread and in most of India the spread is low. Only about 5 cities with <1% of the area account for most of the cases. Without lockdown the fate of those 5 cities would have been the fate of all of India.

Here is the statistics of Karnataka — a state with 15 times the population of New Zealand, with a global city as its capital and two international airports. Only about 3000 active cases and the number of active cases have not increased in the past 10 days. Whatever the rise in curve you see from May beginning is due to the migrant labour allowed to move back home from Mumbai to places like Kalburgi and Udupi. Without a lockdown a far bigger movement and a far bigger spread from Mumbai and Chennai flowing into Bengaluru.

You can see a very comparable performance in other states like Kerala and Odisha.

You can see how low the cases are relative to the population and whatever rise was from the time the lockdowns got relaxed. And the entire north east is spared of the pandemic so far. That is by limiting the flow of people. Goa had 0 active cases in May and once the unlock happened on Jun 1, the cases spiked. You can clearly see the effect of lockdown in the slope of the curve.

Nearly 23 states & UTS in the country have managed to keep the virus under reasonable level of control with the help of lockdowns.

India is a super large country with the largest levels of internal displacement /migrant labour. The challenges with containment is different from say the challenges of tiny countries. The lockdown worked partially but unlike in Italy, we had a far bigger problem in slums with no possibility of social distancing. The labour congregated in large crowds and went back home in crowded trains. There was no way to keep them locked down for a long time.

The lockdown can arrest the spread of Coronavirus from Mumbai to Bengaluru. However, how will we arrest the spread of the virus in the slums of Mumbai and north Chennai?

The lockdown has partly worked and that is how we in cities like Bengaluru are having normalcy now. However, in cities with huge slums and migrant labour it is impossible to have social distancing or containment. As I wrote earlier in April, it would be futile to attempt to curtail the virus by lockdowns in slums & shanties. The only way to manage in those localities is through herd immunity, isolating the vulnerable and field hospitals.

The virus is going to rip through the slums and the government has to prepare for the worst in that [with millions of cases] and just work to arrest the geographical spread and also preventing it from affecting the elderly.

In summary, the lockdown worked and you see the impact both in the rate of growth of infection and the lower geographic spread. However, it is not a magic button — in a poor country with a lot of slums and shanties with migrant labour desperately wanting to go home, the poor could not have social distancing or basic hygiene. However, for the rich and middle class the lockdown mostly worked and you would be hard pressed to identify your direct friends who got infected of the virus.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/uc1rhfto2i75awpq', 'title': 'Despite the longest and strictest COVID-19 lockdown in India, why are the cases growing at such a nasty rate?

Ian Lang,Updated 3y,"What is a job that is often described as 'unskilled labour', but really isn't?","Fork-lift driver.

People think it’s like driving a dodgem. It bloody isn’t. Yes, you can teach somebody to drive a counterbalance in a week. But then it’s a long time before they get any good at it. Sometimes you’ve got to put things down with precision (I’ve had stuff that stacks on little mounds and if you’re a sixteenth of an inch out it wont go on right) and you’ve got to know what you can lift and how.

Stuff is going on left and right and up and down, and backwards and forwards, not to mention tilt and side-shift and you’ve always got to be looking out for some screamy wanker walking behind you who thinks that a vehicle the size of a car but on average about three times heavier isn’t going to do much harm if it hits him (or her, but then it’d have to be a screamy wankeress, I suppose).

No, you do get screamy wankeresses. I’d got two tons of highly explosive stuff on my forks in an armoured container once when the bloody H&S woman decided to get in front of my truck and force me to stop. I swallowed my tongue and jammed the anchors on pretty quickly, which you aren’t supposed to do. Do you know what she wanted? To inspect, and make sure I’ve got the right back tilt on and my forks were six inches from the ground at the heel. They turned out to be four and a half. I got a card for that. I should have just run her over.

There’s a horrible thing that counterbalances do if you aren’t careful. Consider the pivot point:

There it is, marked fulcrum. The reason it’s marked fulcrum is that this thing is in fact a lever. Like a see-saw is. If you’ve got a too-heavy weight too far from the load centre the arse of the counterbalance is going up. And throwing you forwards. Consequently you’ve got to be paying attention to what’s on that palette and where. If it’s heavier on one side than the other, that’s the side you want closest to the mast; the mast being the tall bit the forks are connected to.

Also don’t be turning with your forks in the air, because this raises the common centre of gravity. When the CCoG is too far up the cab, the truck will tip over really easily. When going down an incline, go down backwards, or you’ll drop your load. And that’s just the start.

CCoG, eh? Load centre, what? Don’t normally have to worry about that when your job is gazing at spreadsheets, do you?

And that’s just counterbalance. When you do reach, bendy, or tele-handler, it gets even worse. And yet some companies won’t pay their drivers much over minimum wage, which is a bloody disgrace.

FLT drivers are gods. The reason it looks easy is that they make it look easy.

Michael W.,1y,Why did RadioShack go bankrupt?,"Radio Shack was the place to go for hobbyists - they sold electronic parts of all kinds, and not just for the hobbyist who was soldering things together. If you needed a COAX extension cable for your TV, that was just about the only place to go.

But dealing with Radio Shack became difficult. They wanted your name and address on any purchase including small cash purchases, and they peddled an extended warranty on everything, including individually packaged batteries.

How can the net worth of any app-based services like Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, Uber, or Byju's be assessed fairly and realistically on a sound economic basis?
Its Simple How much is the Technology Worth? How Legal and Easy is it to recreate the same App? Thats it. More than Enough Lets take Zomato What is their Technology? An App which uses GPS (Generic) to connect food delivery boys with their customers after the customers place orders with various restaurants Is it Unique? No. You have more than 1500 Apps worldwide doing the absolute same thing and in many cases far better and more interactive than Zomato Are there any Assets? No. Literally Zilch. Generic GPS, Generic Licensed Encryption, Generic Programming , Even the Scooters and Uniforms are not their own What is their Worth? Ans - Rs. 1 LAKH CRORE What should be their worth based on any Conventional Model? Ans - Rs. 139 Crore at the Most How much is it bloated by? Ans - 700 Times Lets take Byjus What is their Technology? Generic Tablets and Apps with access to Coaching and Training Materials for Education Purposes Is it Unique? No! You have 50 such Apps in India itself and over 10,000 such Apps worldwide Are there any Assets? Zilch. None. Again No Technology. Just some Tablets, Uniforms. Offices are Rented. Is the Course Content Unique? No. Standard Course Content. Of course the Teaching Materials are Custom Made Valuation? Ans - Rs. 1, 27,500 Crore !!!!! One Point Two Seven Five TRILLION!!!! What should be their worth based on Conventional Model? Ans - Rs. 640 Crore at the MOST HOw much is it Bloated by? Ans - 200 Times at the very least even BEFORE IPO Have you heard of Mass Hypnosis? Magicians like David Copperfield etc perform magic tricks like making the Statue of Liberty disappear or PC Sorkar making a Train disappear That is exactly what is happening with these Indian Apps. A Bunch of Educated yet utterly naive gentlemen are convinced using Technical Terms that our Old Conventional Method of Valuation is ancient and worthless and some modern methods of valuation exist wherein any junk can be valued in lakhs of crores using a combo of the words “Interactive” + “Customer Base” + “Platform” + “Expansion” etc. These Halfwits convince more Quarter wits until finally - you have a Mass Hysteria of Speculation which will lead to a bubble - 1000 times worse than Evergrande. Not one of these Apps has got - (a) Unique Business Model (b) First Global Advantage (c) Unique Certified Technology (d) Global Customer Base There is no difference between Bunty Taxi wallah and Ola There is no difference between Gupta Aunty Tiffin Service and Zomato Just Businesses which are on a much Larger Scale.

This is my response to Kanthaswamy’s answer on Zomato and BYJUS valuation being flawed.

Here’s what I think:

I agree with you on the fact that there are thousands of companies that are doing the same thing as BYJUS or Zomato. But how are they performing so much better than others? It’s because they have mastered their product better than anyone else.

I feel Mr. Kanthswamy’s take on issues is negative and he tries to find fault with everything using some stats he found somewhere on the internet. I read publications such as Forbes, Time of India, The New York Times, The Economist, etc and I’d rather believe in the facts presented by reputable new agencies over a Quora influencer.

One does not have to come up with a groundbreaking, first-of-its-kind idea in order to have a big valuation. While the idea acts as a crux, how its implemented plays a crucial role in success. BYJUS or Zomato might not have the factors outlined by Mr. Kanthaswamy i.e., Unique Business Model, First Global Advantage, Unique Certified Technology or Global Customer Base but they offer the best product among its competitors and therefore, they have a higher growth potential. While Zomato is purely domestic at the moment, I think BYJUS does have a global customer base, considering all the new acquisitions and recent company developments.

The biggest advantage they have is, Zomato and BYJUS started the company at the right time, when the market was largely untapped. That’s why, they are way ahead of other brands which are mimicking their products.

Honestly, I don’t think the valuation of both companies is “bloated”. Just because someone cannot see the future potential does not mean the company is faking it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3ibhyp0lj548fem1', 'title': ""How can the net worth of any app-based services like Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, Uber, or Byju's be assessed fairly and realistically on a sound economic basis?"", 'score': {'original': 0.82765, 'ai': 0.17235}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam\n · 2y\nHow can the net worth of any app-based services like Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, Uber, or Byju's be assessed fairly and realistically on a sound economic basis?\nIts Simple How much is the Technology Worth?

Saulius Muliolis,1y,"Trickle down economics has been tried without success many times before this one, by the tories. As one definition of madness is repeating the same action in the hope of a different outcome, are they mad as well as nasty?","Since there is no such thing as “trickle down economics”, because “trickle down economics” is a smear word and strawman for supply side economics, and what we have implemented for the last 119 years, ever since the beginning of the central banking era is demand side economics, why do people keep engaging in the madness of blaming “trickle down economics”?

If there is ever a contest for the biggest lie in politics, this one should be a top contender. While there have been all too many lies told in politics, most have some little tiny fraction of truth in them, to make them seem plausible. But the ""trickle-down"" lie is 100 percent lie. It should win the contest both because of its purity — no contaminating speck of truth — and because of how many people have repeated it over the years, without any evidence being asked for or given. Years ago, this column challenged anybody to quote any economist outside of an insane asylum who had ever advocated this ""trickle-down"" theory. Some readers said that somebody said that somebody else had advocated a ""trickle-down"" policy. But they could never name that somebody else and quote them.—Thomas Sowell, “The Trickle Down Lie.”

“Trickle down economics” is used as a strawman argument against supply side and free market economics, which have absolutely nothing to do with anything trickling anywhere.

The idea behind free markets is to leave people free to work and produce wealth. Leaving it in the hands of those who produced it allows them to invest in capital goods, machines, new technology, new production methods and economies of scale. This results in an increase in the supply of consumer goods available to people to buy. The capital investment allows that increased supply to be produced with less labor, so more goods are available to buy at lower prices, making even the poor workers better off even if they don’t earn more money because what money they do earn buys more and is therefore worth more.

In contrast, demand side economic thinkers such as Keynesians are more concerned with the flow of money, where money goes. Keynesians in particular have their “Circular Flow” model of the economy, and they measure the health of the economy in terms of GDP, which is the quantity of money that changes hands (at best adjusted for inflation).

If you think that where the money flows is what is most important, then you will assume that the way any tax cut will help the poor is by allowing the rich to have more money which will “trickle down” to the poor workers as they pay wages and buy goods.

Because demand side thinkers have been in charge of our economy, they have tried to flood it with paper money, hoping some of it would “trickle down” to the poor. Yes, they are projecting. That is the way THEY think the poor benefit from economic activity. They print up paper money, create a lot of it out of thin air through accounting entries, and have the government spend mountains of it. The rich get most of this money because they get to borrow from the banks, they get most of the subsidies and bailouts and big, multi-billion dollar government contracts. The demand side Keynesians think this will circulate and trickle down to the workers, who will be better off for it.

As a result, worker wages have risen dramatically. They should be vastly better off now, right?

Nominal wages are the number of dollars workers earn. Real wages are what the workers can buy with the money they earn.

If the demand siders were right, then they should have succeeded. We wouldn’t have any poverty left. The workers earning so much more money would be rich. But their demand side policies have caused inflation, especially in housing.

Cuomo Announces Action to Provide $2.4 Trillion in Mortgages for Affordable Housing for 28.1 Million Families
CUOMO ANNOUNCES ACTION TO PROVIDE $2.4 TRILLION IN MORTGAGES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR 28.1 MILLION FAMILIES See full chart of higher goals by metropolitan area WASHINGTON - Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo today announced a policy to require the nation's two largest housing finance companies to buy $2.4 trillion in mortgages over the next 10 years to provide affordable housing for about 28.1 million low- and moderate-income families. Cuomo said the historic action by HUD raises the required percentage of mortgage loans for low- and moderate-income families that finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must buy from the current 42 percent of their total purchases to a new high of 50 percent - a 19 percent increase - in the year 2001. The percentage will first increase to 48 percent in 2000. Commenting on the action, President Clinton said: ""During the last six and a half years, my Administration has put tremendous emphasis on promoting homeowners and making housing more affordable for all Americans. Our housing programs and institutions have been a success. Today, the homeownership rate is at an all-time high, with more than 66 percent of all American families owning their homes. Today, we take another significant step. Raising the GSEs goals will help us generate increased momentum in addressing the nation's housing needs. I congratulate HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and the entire HUD team on their efforts in this important area."" ""This action will transform the lives of millions of families across our country by giving them new opportunities to buy homes or move into apartments with rents they can afford,"" Cuomo said. ""It will strengthen our economy and create jobs by stimulating more home construction, it will help ease the terrible shortage of affordable housing plaguing far too many communities, and it will help reduce the huge homeownership gap dividing whites from minorities and suburbs from cities."" The mortgage purchase requirement for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - known as the Affordable Housing Goals - was last set by HUD in 1995, under a requirement mandated by Congress. The goals came up for renewal this year, and HUD had the choice of leaving them unchanged, lowering them, or raising them. In addition to helping low- and moderate-income families, the new initiative will also increase the affordable housing goals for loans made to underserved areas and will raise the goal for mortgages to benefit families with very low incomes. Under the higher goals, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will buy an additional $488.3 billion in mortgages that will be used to provide affordable housing for 7 million more low- and moderate-income families over the next 10 years. Those new mortgages and families are over and above the $1.9 trillion in mortgages for 21.1 million families that would have been generated if the current goals had been retained. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages for both individual homes and f

More money available to buy goods causes the people with that money to outbid one another to buy the limited supply.

Demand siders have forgotten, or maybe never learned, the lesson that Frederic Bastiat tried to teach us over 170 years ago.

What Is Money?
“ Hateful money! hateful money!” cried F— , the economist, despairingly, as he came from the Committee of Finance, where a project of paper money had just been discussed. “What's the matter?” said I. “What is the meaning of this sudden dislike to the most extolled of all the divinities of this world?” F. Hateful money! hateful money! B. You alarm me. I hear peace, liberty, and life cried down, and Brutus went so far even as to say, “Virtue! thou art but a name!” But what can have happened? F. Hateful money! hateful money! B. Come, come, exercise a little philosophy. What has happened to you? Has Croesus been affecting you? Has Jones been playing you false? or has Smith been libeling you in the papers? F. I have nothing to do with Croesus; my character, by its insignificance, is safe from any slanders of Smith; and as to Jones... B. Ah! Now I have it. How could I be so blind? You, too, are the inventor of a social reorganization — of the F—-system , in fact. Your society is to be more perfect than that of Sparta, and, therefore, all money is to be rigidly banished from it. And the thing that troubles you is, how to persuade your people to throw away the contents of their purses. What would you have? This is the rock on which all reorganizers split. There is not one but would do wonders, if he could contrive to overcome all resisting influences, and if all mankind would consent to become soft wax in his fingers; but men are resolved not to be soft wax; they listen, applaud, or reject and — go on as before. F. Thank heaven I am still free from this fashionable mania. Instead of inventing social laws, I am studying those which it has pleased Providence to invent, and I am delighted to find them admirable in their progressive development. This is why I exclaim, “Hateful money! hateful money!” B. You are a disciple of Proudhon, then? Well, there is a very simple way for you to satisfy yourself. Throw your purse into the river, only reserving a small draft on the Bank of Exchange. F. If I cry out against money, is it likely I should tolerate its deceitful substitute? B. Then I have only one more guess to make. You are a new Diogenes, and are going to victimize me with a discourse on the contempt of riches. F. Heaven preserve me from that! For riches, don't you see, are not a little more or a little less money. They are bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, fuel to warm you, oil to lengthen the day, a career open to your son, a certain portion for your daughter, a day of rest after fatigue, a cordial for the faint, a little assistance slipped into the hand of a poor man, a shelter from the storm, a diversion for a brain worn by thought, the incomparable pleasure of making those happy who are dear to us. Riches are instruction, independence, dignity, confidence, charity; they are progress and civilization. Riches are the admirable civilizing result of two admirable agents, more civilizing even than riches themselves — labor and exchange. B. Well! n

For riches, don't you see, are not a little more or a little less money. They are bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, fuel to warm you, oil to lengthen the day, a career open to your son, a certain portion for your daughter, a day of rest after fatigue, a cordial for the faint, a little assistance slipped into the hand of a poor man, a shelter from the storm, a diversion for a brain worn by thought, the incomparable pleasure of making those happy who are dear to us. Riches are instruction, independence, dignity, confidence, charity; they are progress and civilization. Riches are the admirable civilizing result of two admirable agents, more civilizing even than riches themselves — labor and exchange.

Money is important. It is a means of exchange, an accounting tool, and it is supposed to be a means to store value. A complex, industrialized division of labor economy is impossible without it. But it introduces a lot of confusion. Everyone knows that they, as individuals, will be better off if they have more money. Too many commit the fallacy of composition in thinking that if everyone has more money, then everyone will be better off.

I cry out against money, just because everybody confounds it, as you did just now, with riches, and that this confusion is the cause of errors and calamities without number. I cry out against it because its function in society is not understood, and very difficult to explain. I cry out against it because it jumbles all ideas, causes the means to be taken for the end, the obstacle for the cause, the alpha for the omega; because its presence in the world, though in itself beneficial, has, nevertheless, introduced a fatal notion, a perversion of principles, a contradictory theory, which, in a multitude of forms, has impoverished mankind and deluged the earth with blood. I cry out against it, because I feel that I am incapable of contending against the error to which it has given birth, otherwise than by a long and fastidious dissertation to which no one would listen. Oh! if I could only find a patient and benevolent listener!

ITS NOT ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY TRICKLES!

The closest we ever came to full supply side, free market economics was the 19th century. Markets were relatively free, taxes were low, and entrepreneurs and industrialists were investing in new technologies, mass production methods, and economies of scale. Production of things like cloth went from this:

To this:

Working conditions and living standards were poor, compared to what we have now, but they were improving by leaps and bounds. New marketing methods like mail order and department stores emerged to bring a much larger supply of goods to consumers. People were better fed and clothed, and were able to obtain all sorts of new products that never existed before.

When actual free market and supply side policies are followed (not those DEMAND SIDE “trickle down economics”), living standards of the working poor improve dramatically. It works.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/597hujqzkimrfng8', 'title': 'Trickle down economics has been tried without success many times before this one, by the tories.

While there have been all too many lies told in politics, most have some little tiny fraction of truth in them, to make them seem plausible. But the ""trickle-down"" lie is 100 percent lie. It should win the contest both because of its purity — no contaminating speck of truth — and because of how many people have repeated it over the years, without any evidence being asked for or given. Years ago, this column challenged anybody to quote any economist outside of an insane asylum who had ever advocated this ""trickle-down"" theory. Some readers said that somebody said that somebody else had advocated a ""trickle-down"" policy. But they could never name that somebody else and quote them.—Thomas Sowell, “The Trickle Down Lie.”\n\n“Trickle down economics” is used as a strawman argument against supply side and free market economics, which have absolutely nothing to do with anything trickling anywhere.\n\nThe idea behind free markets is to leave people free to work and produce wealth. Leaving it in the hands of those who produced it allows them to invest in capital goods, machines, new technology, new production methods and economies of scale. This results in an increase in the supply of consumer goods available to people to buy. The capital investment allows that increased supply to be produced with less labor, so more goods are available to buy at lower prices, making even the poor workers better off even if they don’t earn more money because what money they do earn buys more and is therefore worth more.\n\nIn contrast, demand side economic thinkers such as Keynesians are more concerned with the flow of money, where money goes. Keynesians in particular have their “Circular Flow” model of the economy, and they measure the health of the economy in terms of GDP, which is the quantity of money that changes hands (at best adjusted for inflation).\n\nIf you think that where the money flows is what is most important, then you will assume that the way any tax cut will help the poor is by allowing the rich to have more money which will “trickle down” to the poor workers as they pay wages and buy goods.\n\nBecause demand side thinkers have been in charge of our economy, they have tried to flood it with paper money, hoping some of it would “trickle down” to the poor. Yes, they are projecting. That is the way THEY think the poor benefit from economic activity. They print up paper money, create a lot of it out of thin air through accounting entries, and have the government spend mountains of it. The rich get most of this money because they get to borrow from the banks, they get most of the subsidies and bailouts and big, multi-billion dollar government contracts. The demand side Keynesians think this will circulate and trickle down to the workers, who will be better off for it.\n\nAs a result, worker wages have risen dramatically. They should be vastly better off now, right?\n\nNominal wages are the number of dollars workers earn. Real wages are what the workers can buy with the money they earn.\n\nIf the demand siders were right, then they should have succeeded. We wouldn’t have any poverty left. The workers earning so much more money would be rich. But their demand side policies have caused inflation, especially in housing.\n\nCuomo Announces Action to Provide $2.4 Trillion in Mortgages for Affordable Housing for 28.1 Million Families\nCUOMO ANNOUNCES ACTION TO PROVIDE $2.4 TRILLION IN MORTGAGES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR 28.1 MILLION FAMILIES See full chart of higher goals by metropolitan area WASHINGTON - Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo today announced a policy to require the nation\'s two largest housing finance companies to buy $2.4 trillion in mortgages over the next 10 years to provide affordable housing for about 28.1 million low- and moderate-income families. Cuomo said the historic action by HUD raises the required percentage of mortgage loans for low- and moderate-income families that finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must buy from the current 42 percent of their total purchases to a new high of 50 percent - a 19 percent increase - in the year 2001. The percentage will first increase to 48 percent in 2000. Commenting on the action, President Clinton said: ""During the last six and a half years, my Administration has put tremendous emphasis on promoting homeowners and making housing more affordable for all Americans. Our housing programs and institutions have been a success. Today, the homeownership rate is at an all-time high, with more than 66 percent of all American families owning their homes. Today, we take another significant step. Raising the GSEs goals will help us generate increased momentum in addressing the nation\'s housing needs. I congratulate HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and the entire HUD team on their efforts in this important area."" ""This action will transform the lives of millions of families across our country by giving them new opportunities to buy homes or move into apartments with rents they can afford,"" Cuomo said. ""It will strengthen our economy and create jobs by stimulating more home construction, it will help ease the terrible shortage of affordable housing plaguing far too many communities, and it will help reduce the huge homeownership gap dividing whites from minorities and suburbs from cities."" The mortgage purchase requirement for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - known as the Affordable Housing Goals - was last set by HUD in 1995, under a requirement mandated by Congress. The goals came up for renewal this year, and HUD had the choice of leaving them unchanged, lowering them, or raising them. In addition to helping low- and moderate-income families, the new initiative will also increase the affordable housing goals for loans made to underserved areas and will raise the goal for mortgages to benefit families with very low incomes. Under the higher goals, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will buy an additional $488.3 billion in mortgages that will be used to provide affordable housing for 7 million more low- and moderate-income families over the next 10 years. Those new mortgages and families are over and above the $1.9 trillion in mortgages for 21.1 million families that would have been generated if the current goals had been retained. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages for both individual homes and f\nhttps://archives.hud.gov/news/1999/pr99-131.html\n\nMore money available to buy goods causes the people with that money to outbid one another to buy the limited supply.\n\nDemand siders have forgotten, or maybe never learned, the lesson that Frederic Bastiat tried to teach us over 170 years ago.\n\nWhat Is Money?\n“ Hateful money! hateful money!” cried F— , the economist, despairingly, as he came from the Committee of Finance, where a project of paper money had just been discussed. “What\'s the matter?” said I. “What is the meaning of this sudden dislike to the most extolled of all the divinities of this world?” F. Hateful money! hateful money! B. You alarm me. I hear peace, liberty, and life cried down, and Brutus went so far even as to say, “Virtue! thou art but a name!” But what can have happened? F. Hateful money! hateful money! B. Come, come, exercise a little philosophy. What has happened to you? Has Croesus been affecting you? Has Jones been playing you false? or has Smith been libeling you in the papers? F. I have nothing to do with Croesus; my character, by its insignificance, is safe from any slanders of Smith; and as to Jones... B. Ah! Now I have it. How could I be so blind? You, too, are the inventor of a social reorganization — of the F—-system , in fact. Your society is to be more perfect than that of Sparta, and, therefore, all money is to be rigidly banished from it. And the thing that troubles you is, how to persuade your people to throw away the contents of their purses. What would you have? This is the rock on which all reorganizers split. There is not one but would do wonders, if he could contrive to overcome all resisting influences, and if all mankind would consent to become soft wax in his fingers; but men are resolved not to be soft wax; they listen, applaud, or reject and — go on as before. F. Thank heaven I am still free from this fashionable mania. Instead of inventing social laws, I am studying those which it has pleased Providence to invent, and I am delighted to find them admirable in their progressive development. This is why I exclaim, “Hateful money! hateful money!” B. You are a disciple of Proudhon, then? Well, there is a very simple way for you to satisfy yourself. Throw your purse into the river, only reserving a small draft on the Bank of Exchange. F. If I cry out against money, is it likely I should tolerate its deceitful substitute? B. Then I have only one more guess to make. You are a new Diogenes, and are going to victimize me with a discourse on the contempt of riches. F. Heaven preserve me from that! For riches, don\'t you see, are not a little more or a little less money. They are bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, fuel to warm you, oil to lengthen the day, a career open to your son, a certain portion for your daughter, a day of rest after fatigue, a cordial for the faint, a little assistance slipped into the hand of a poor man, a shelter from the storm, a diversion for a brain worn by thought, the incomparable pleasure of making those happy who are dear to us. Riches are instruction, independence, dignity, confidence, charity; they are progress and civilization. Riches are the admirable civilizing result of two admirable agents, more civilizing even than riches themselves — labor and exchange. B.

Charlotte Vogel,Updated Oct 10,What are the biggest money secrets that rich people keep from us?,"It’s common knowledge that millionaires handle their money differently than many, but what’s their secret? I’ve come to discover that the super wealthy have a different set of beliefs, philosophies and strategies. Their secret to getting rich isn’t merely in the mechanics of money; rather, in their values and level of thinking.

These are some of the secrets the rich adopt that you can also put into practice in your own life;

The rich get richer by saving and investing early then using that money to make even more money for themselves. While this is true, those who invest online without exercising due diligence usually lose their money in the process. In most cases, said stolen investment can be retrieved when you employ the proficiency of authorities like Scamreveal/net as they have a record of mitigating the influence of fraudulent practices and reversing situations that would have otherwise resulted in financial setbacks.
Millionaires don’t always look like millionaires. That’s because they spend their money modestly instead of pretentiously. Think crockpot meals at home instead of trendy restaurant dinners, a 28-cent cup of coffee from home instead of a $4.95 Starbucks grande mocha.
If you use a credit card for convenience and emergencies, be sure to pay it off every month. The average person owes $4,717 in credit card debt. And the average interest rate on credit cards is 15 percent. If you paid the minimum payment of $189 every month for 10 years, you’d end up paying $18,155 in interest. Pay off the balance right away and you get that extra $18,155 in your pocket.
Spend some time thinking about your future goals. Maybe you’re hoping to travel, send your kids to college, retire comfortably or all of the above. Just remember that a little short-term sacrifice can pay big dividends in the future. With your goals in mind and some figures to work with, a retirement savings calculator can give you a better understanding of what you’ll need to meet your future financial goals.

Achieving massive goals is never a walk in the park. Those who push forward get rewarded. Consider making a list of five things you must do today that may be uncomfortable, but will get you a few steps closer to great wealth.
