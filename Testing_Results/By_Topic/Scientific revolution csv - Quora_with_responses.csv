Israel Ramirez,Updated 3y,What is the “next Einstein” working on right now?,"Very likely, the next Einstein is:

A bit player in a big team.
Working on a wrong idea.
Won’t get recognized for a long time.

Here’s why.

Scientific teams

Science has become a group enterprise. As scientific problems become harder and harder to solve, you need more and more people working together to solve those problems.

You can get a sense of that by looking at the number of authors per scientific publication. In Einstein’s day, it was common for one or a few scientists to conduct a research project and write up the results. Now big teams are common.

This chart shows the average number of authors of biomedical publications.[1] In 1910, it was common for papers to be written by a single scientist but a century later, the average was greater than five.

That’s especially true in the physical sciences in recent years.[2] This chart shows a big jump in the last few years for that discipline.[3]

Those statistics underestimate the importance of teams. In the biological sciences, it’s common for individual graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to work on a small part of a sizable scientific problem, publish their findings and move on. The head of the laboratory keeps bringing new graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, assigning them more parts of that scientific problem to work on. Eventually, a great many people will have worked on parts of that problem. The head of the laboratory oversees the work and brings in money to pay for the research but may not do much actual research.

It has become unusual for a major research problem to be solved by one or even several researchers.

Wrong ideas

Scientific problems have gotten really hard. There’s no good way to know, in advance, whether a given concept or type of experiment, is going to be better than existing ones. So, scientists try everything reasonable in the hopes of finding the correct solution.

There are lots of cases where promising lines of research haven’t been as successful as people hoped.

Einstein’s most famous theories concerned gravity. That’s still an active area of research. Many scientists have proposed alternatives to his theories and, so far, they haven’t been more successful than Einstein’s theories.[4]

Einstein himself spent many years trying to develop, what physicists call, a unified field theory. He never managed to produce a useful theory of this type.[5]

The physical science community had hoped that the enormously expensive LHC machine would produce clues about what lies beyond current ideas about particle physics. So far, they haven’t gotten as many clues as they hoped for.[6]

Years ago, some scientists claimed that the human genome project was going to provide solutions to lots of medical problems right away. There has been real progress but not as much as people had hoped.[7] [8]

Progress on curing cancer hasn’t gone as well as people had hoped.[9]

Late recognition

It now takes a long time and a lot of money to test and confirm scientific theories.

Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915. Just four years later, a study of the eclipse of 1919 seemed to confirm that theory.[10] In contrast, Peter Higgs published his theory about a hypothetical boson in 1964 but the existence of the Higgs boson wasn’t confirmed until 2012.[11] It wasn’t cheap to do that either. One estimate is that the machinery, staff, and operating expenses for proving that the Higgs boson existed, totaled about $13.25 billion dollars.[12]

In another Quora answer, I describe the reasons why scientists have to work harder each year to make progress.[13] Each advance means that there are fewer easy problems to solve and the remaining ones are mostly hard ones.

The next Einstein is going to have to be patient.

Joshua Engel,1y,Is it possible that a scientific revolution might occur in this century? Something like relativity and quantum mechanics revolutions?,"Sure.

And you’re going to miss it.

The problem is that science has had several revolutions on a par with relativity and quantum mechanics over the last century, and you missed those, too. The problem is that the last vaguely comprehensible theories date back to the 18th century. Honestly, even the 19th century conceptualization of electromagnetism requires a pretty advanced mathematics, and isn’t easily summed up in words the way Newton’s are:

But they do at least have human-scale applications. You can see electricity and magnetism at work, and they’re built on conceptions of time and space that were familiar to the ancient Greeks. They feel “normal”.

Relativity and quantum mechanics rewrite those assumptions, and a full century later people still treat them as witchcraft. Quora is chock full of people desperate to know if scientists are really, really sure about Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, or if maybe next year we’ll just make ourselves a better ruler that clears things up. And it’s full of people with advanced degrees telling them that yes, we’re sure, and that any revolutions that occur in the future are going to be harder to understand, not easier.

So you missed the discovery of the strong and weak forces, which aren’t part of either quantum mechanics or relativity. You missed the fusion of them into the Standard Model — you’ve heard of the Higgs boson but probably think that it “gives mass to things”, which it doesn’t.

That stuff is a half-century old at this point. And yeah, scientists are a bit frustrated that it’s not going faster. They’d really hoped that the Large Hadron Collider would disprove it, and it doesn’t. They wanted disproof so that they could find the next big thing, which they know is out there, but it’s so far out there that they can’t gather any data. You basically need to be standing on top of a black hole to see any difference between the Next Theory and the current one.

Which means that, if you wanted, you could catch up to the point where you could understand the next scientific revolution. In order to do that, you have to start with plain relativity and quantum mechanics, which you can’t do without the math. Then you can move on to the rest of the forces, which are way more mind-bending than the century-old stuff — the weak force in particular is probably the most exciting open question in physics today. Without knowing what we know about that, the next revolution won’t mean jack shit, because the last one didn’t.

So if you’re hoping that the next revolution means you can avoid learning stuff, then I got news for you. It means learning more stuff, not less. You can either get to work, or you can just gawk at science’s butt as it goes by.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4b026st98qnvwkuj', 'title': 'Is it possible that a scientific revolution might occur in this century?

Susanna Viljanen,3y,Did the scientific revolution happen outside of Europe?,"No.

The reason is simple; the pre-requisites were not met elsewhere.

A religion which makes distinction between mysticism and philosophy
A religion which prohibits slavery
A philosophy which stresses on rationality and the laws of the nature
A judicial system which makes the distinction between religious and secular
Discovery of the connection between mathematics and philosophy, giving rise to the scientific method
Discovery of the connection between mathematics and natural laws
Discovery of the connection between mathematics, physics and chemistry
Judicial system which guarantees the rights of the individuals and public entities against the powerholders
Functional capitalism and banking system
Citizen society based on merit, giving rise to universities
Discovery of the connection between engineering and the sciences
High overall literacy around the society, combining crafts with education

Forget things like “cheap fuel”, “cheap materials”, “cheap labour”, “colonies” and other similar Marxist fluff. The scientific revolution was essentially a societal phenomenon, so the reasons behind it also were societal - and it could not happen before all its societal pre-requisites were met. This happened only in Europe. But it could have happened elsewhere - if only all those 12 pre-reguisites had been met.

Benjamin Murphy,3y,Why is Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions one of the most cited academic books of all time?,"I was talking to my father about this just a few weeks ago. He is a physicist (Ph.D. in ultraviolet spectroscopy) who did some industrial research before taking up a job with the Open University. He said he saw a copy on display in a bookstore and decided to buy a copy. Reading it in the bath, he realized that it was the first time he had read a realistic description of what scientists spend their time doing. When he discussed science with me, there was a strong Kuhnian flavour to his explanations - he would tell me that scientists make value judgments when choosing between competing theories, for example. (I don’t want to imply that my father indoctrinated me into being a strict Kuhnian - he lent me books by Popper, Chalmers and Putnam, for example). Back in the 90’s, I had a discussion with some of his colleagues from the Faculty of Technology at the OU, and they all agreed that, looking back, it was remarkable how many things Kuhn got right. Like my father, these people were not philosophers who were interested in science, but scientists who were interested in philosophy, and who thought - not that Kuhn was some kind of oracle who was right about absolutely everything - but that he had spotted some things about science that a lot of philosophers had missed.

Of course, it is not entirely surprising that Kuhn understood what kind of things most scientists spend their days doing, since he himself had a Ph.D. in physics. He also spent time studying the history of science, and realized the importance of trying to write about philosophy of science in a way that acknowledged the realities of scientific research. Many philosophers had invested a lot in the idea that science is able to achieve knowledge of reality because it is a purely rational process, and pure rationality eschews any value judgments. When Kuhn attacked that idea, the only possible way to refute him was by using his own weapons against him, by studying the history of science as he had done, and trying to show that his conclusions had been too hasty. This is how the ideas of one philosopher come to dominate discussion. Comparatively few philosophers ever subscribed to logical positivism, for example, but a whole generation of philosophers tried to use the tools of logical analysis against the logical positivists, and that does a lot to explain the spread of analytical philosophy. So too, anyone who wanted to show that Kuhn failed to understand the rationality of science had to show that Kuhn was wrong about scientific revolutions. Then, of course, if students asked why there was so much fuss being made about scientific revolutions, they would be directed to read Kuhn’s book.

One further factor that explains Kuhn’s influence is that The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is suggestive rather than precise. Shortly after the book was published, Margaret Masterman counted twenty one different ways in which Kuhn used the word “paradigm.” I obtained this information from K. Brad Wray’s Kuhn’s Social Epistemology (Cambridge UP, 2011), p.55. Wray reports that Masterman first identified these twenty one uses of the word in a presentation at a conference in London. (Kuhn accepted that his use of the word had been loose, and tried to be more precise in his later work). Wray adds that most of the speakers at that conference were philosophers, and they were highly critical of Kuhn’s work. Masterman was speaking not as a philosopher, but as a scientist and - although she pointed out the lack of clarity - she was deeply appreciative of what Kuhn had written. (pp. 55–56) In fact, Masterman’s reaction to Kuhn, as described by Wray, sounds very similar to what my father said was his reaction:

While most of the others at the London conference, primarily loyal Popperians, focused on criticizing Kuhn ‘s notion of normal science, Masterman praised Kuhn for providing the conceptual resources for explaining scientific practice, and, especially, the work of scientists who have no theory to guide them…

p. 56

I think that Masterman and Kuhn were right that the lack of precision was a flaw that stood in need of correction, but I also think this helps explain why the book is so highly cited. First, the lack of precision leaves plenty of room for interpreters to argue about what Kuhn really meant. Secondly, I think it explains the success of the book with many scientists when it was first published. The book resonated with many scientists who were able to connect Kuhn’s description of the scientific process with their own experience. A text that is suitably suggestive is sufficiently vague so that readers can use their imagination to fill in the blanks, reading their own ideas into the text. If the word “paradigm” has up to twenty one different meanings, sympathetic readers would pick on the one that fits with their experience.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nmwcvl7gkdb24pi3', 'title': ""Why is Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions one of the most cited academic books of all time?"", 'score': {'original': 0.99265, 'ai': 0.00735}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I was talking to my father about this just a few weeks ago.

He also spent time studying the history of science, and realized the importance of trying to write about philosophy of science in a way that acknowledged the realities of scientific research. Many philosophers had invested a lot in the idea that science is able to achieve knowledge of reality because it is a purely rational process, and pure rationality eschews any value judgments. When Kuhn attacked that idea, the only possible way to refute him was by using his own weapons against him, by studying the history of science as he had done, and trying to show that his conclusions had been too hasty. This is how the ideas of one philosopher come to dominate discussion. Comparatively few philosophers ever subscribed to logical positivism, for example, but a whole generation of philosophers tried to use the tools of logical analysis against the logical positivists, and that does a lot to explain the spread of analytical philosophy. So too, anyone who wanted to show that Kuhn failed to understand the rationality of science had to show that Kuhn was wrong about scientific revolutions. Then, of course, if students asked why there was so much fuss being made about scientific revolutions, they would be directed to read Kuhn’s book.\n\nOne further factor that explains Kuhn’s influence is that The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is suggestive rather than precise. Shortly after the book was published, Margaret Masterman counted twenty one different ways in which Kuhn used the word “paradigm.” I obtained this information from K.

 - [the method of Indians] to about number systems and arithmetic. This is one of the cornerstones of mathematics.

One of the first uses of Algorithm [the foundation of Computer Science] came from a medieval French guy named Alexander of Villedieu

Nathan Ketsdever,3y,Has science become too dogmatic?,"Scientism is so pervasive today—it is the intellectual and cultural air that we breathe.

JP Moreland

But, let’s back up a bit—let’s look at the big picture:

Each academic discipline can be understood in terms of the following five key ways of understanding what it is and represents:

It’s method
It’s strengths, limits, and assumptions
It’s research, justifications, and conclusions
It’s ideals, values, norms, and culture
It’s community & people

To the extent that we only look at a couple—we may forget that ideals, values, and norms are both unconscious and shape our communications, interactions, and ultimately our institutions.

If you haven’t read Thomas Kuhn, the role of the culture, community, and value paradigms a given person or community pursues is relevance to the practice of a given discipline.

Dr. Peter Medewar, who won the Nobel Prize for Science has an excellent answer in a book he wrote about The Limits of Science:

“That there is indeed a limit upon science is made very likely by the existence of questions that science cannot answer and that no conceivable advance of science would empower it to answer. These are the questions children ask – the “ultimate questions” of Karl Popper
. I have in mind such questions as: How did everything begin? What are we all here for? What is the point of living?”

“It is not to science therefore but to metaphysics, imaginative literature or religion that we must turn for answers to questions having to do with first and last things?”

(The Limits of Science, Oxford University Press 1987).

What is this thing called scientism? And how does it differ from real lab science? Moreland points out:

Roughly, scientism is the view that the hard sciences—like chemistry, biology, physics, astronomy—provide the only genuine knowledge of reality.

Scott,4y,What is the “next Einstein” working on right now?,"The next Einstein is working on presenting the theory of everything in a way that it does not appear to be “crackpottery”.

The release of the theory of everything was in the name of “Gordon’s Theory of Everything”. The building block component of spacetime was referred as the “The GOD Entity”. Physicists do not appreciate a person’s name associated with a theory unless they associate it with the theory. (In the field of medicine, doctor’s put their name on whatever they come up with all the time.) Physicists do not appreciate any reference to GOD and worse when they find out that GOD is an acronym for Gordon Omnipresent Dot.

So what was released almost five years ago will go unnoticed by physics academia.

The next Einstein worked on finishing Einstein’s work. Einstein gave us two very important equations regarding energy. The first was E = mc^2 which is the highest energy tier of energy and is associated with mass. This equation is the equation associated with relativity.

Einstein also give us the energy equation of E = hf which can also be written as E = (h/wavelength)c^1. This is the middle energy tier representing the energy associated with light. It is also the energy equation that is associated with quantum mechanics.

The next Einstein finishes the hierarchy of energy by exposing the base energy state from which the two higher energy states arose from. It is the energy state where most of the energy in the universe resides. This energy is expressed using the term c^0 and is the energy associated with the building block entities of spacetime. The building blocks of spacetime are aligned with using this energy and spacetime is a medium of the base energy state.

The higher tiers of energy represent the energy of particles that exist “in” spacetime. The interaction of the energy tiers creates the particle’s energy fields.

It is not possible to experimentally find the energy of spacetime because you would have to break the law of conservation of energy. It is also not possible to derive the equation that expresses this energy from any of our current equations and theories… This is why physicists have reached an impasse in theoretical physics. Basically you cannot use the scientific model to advance physics the way it has been advanced for the past 400 years.

It is also why the theory of everything will not be found by a physicist or a group of physicists, they cannot think that far outside the scientific method box. The theory of everything has been found by the next Einstein who was trained as an engineer outside the academic physics community. The theory will be released next year in a book entitled, “Hierarchy of Energy Theory”. There will be teaching videos along with the free book download.

The next Einstein completes the Hierarchy of Energy and expressed it in this trademarked equation:

Serge Mavrodeo,3h,What is the “next Einstein” working on right now?,"The ""next Einstein"" could be working on a variety of groundbreaking topics in theoretical physics. Leading physicists today, like Edward Witten, Lee Smolin, and Carlo Rovelli, are exploring areas such as quantum gravity, loop quantum gravity, and the philosophical implications of science.

There are several challenging questions about the universe that science has not yet fully explained. Here are a few:

Theory of Everything (ToE)

Creating Theory of Everything (ToE) that must explain all forces and laws of physics in one consistent framework of knowledge.
This may include combining elements of existing theories: Unified Field Theory. Quantum Space-Time. Dark Matter and Dark Energy Integration, Cosmological Model, Incorporate Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry, Complex Systems and Consciousness, Testable Predictions, Mathematical Formalism, Philosophical and Conceptual Foundations.
See My answer to Will a theory of everything be mathematical?

The Universe

The Origin and the Fate of the Universe. While the Big Bang theory has been widely accepted as the explanation, it doesn't explain what caused the Big Bang or what was ""before"" it. Will our ever-expanding universe continue stretching forever, eventually fading into nothingness? Or will it reverse course, collapsing in a cosmic crunch? (the oscillating model).
Shape of the universe. Read more: Serge's answer to Is the universe round, oval, or…
Multiverse: do the multiple universes exist?
What dimensions exist beyond space and time? Read more: Serge's answer to Can you give some examples of 1-d, 2-d, 3-d, or 4-dimensional objects?

The Dark Stuff

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Dark Force. What are they? These theoretical concepts, that are believed to make up about 95% of the universe.
They have not been directly detected, and their nature and properties remain largely unknown. Do they exist in a dimension we cannot perceive?
What particles are involved?

Quanta

Unified Theory of Physics: that can combine general relativity (which describes large-scale phenomena) and quantum mechanics (which describes small-scale phenomena) into a single coherent framework.
Quantum Entanglement where particles remain connected so that the state of one affects the state of another, regardless of distance, challenges our understanding of space and information. Its implications for information transfer and quantum computing are still being explored.

Singularities and Tunnels

Black holes, fascinating objects in the universe, surrounded by mysteries: singularity, event horizon and information paradox, hawking radiation, reference to dark matter, gravitational waves and mergers, quantum gravity and unification, role in galaxy formation and evolution.
White Holes are the hypothetical opposites of black holes, presenting intriguing mysteries: observational evidence, ejection of matter, violation of physical laws, relationship to black holes and wormholes, quantum gravity and singularities. Some models predict the existence of white holes, the opposite of black holes, where matter spews out instead of getting sucked in.
Wormholes, theoretical constructs from Einstein's general relativity, present mysteries: evidence of existence, singularities relationship, time travel and causality, traversable mechanics of how objects could travel through wormholes, quantum effects. Theories suggest that black holes could connect to other parts of the universe through wormholes, essentially cosmic shortcuts. This idea, requiring exotic forms of matter and defying traditional notions of causality.

Read more: Serge’s answer to What is on the other side of black holes?

The Magic Balance

The universe's physical constants, from gravity's grip to an electron's charge, seem delicately balanced for life's existence. Why these specific values?
A slight tweak and life, as we know it, wouldn't stand a chance. This exquisite tuning remains an unexplained masterpiece.
The Matter-Antimatter Mismatch. The Big Bang should have birthed equal parts matter and antimatter, yet we're surrounded by matter. Did antimatter vanish, or did they annihilate each other, leaving a lonely surplus of matter? Or is it a magic balance?

Extraterrestrial Life

Are we alone? The Fermi paradox asks why we have not yet detected signs of extraterrestrial life, given the vast number of stars and planets in the universe.
Why is no-one contacting us?
Does alien life use DNA, or is it a biochemistry that is completely different from life on Earth?

Human Civilization

Consciousness: what is the nature of consciousness?
Cure for Major Diseases: cancer, Alzheimer’s, and HIV/AIDS.
Aging and immortality: Can we understand and manipulate the aging process?
The limits of our knowledge: how much can we ever truly know about the universe?
Bionic future. Will humans merge with machines?

Who is the “next Einstein”?

There is no equivalence. While there are undoubtedly brilliant minds working today (and still alive), none of them can match Einstein, Newton, or even Planck.

Scientific understanding has advanced tremendously since his era, and modern research relies heavily on specialization and large collaborations. Geniuses today impact the world in different ways than the revolutionary figures of the past.

Witten and Musk

Here's why it's challenging to name a direct ""modern-day Einstein"":

Specialization: Science is incredibly complex with many deep sub-fields. A genius in string theory might not have the same wide-ranging impact across physics that Einstein did.
Collaborative Nature: Large-scale projects like the Human Genome Project or the Large Hadron Collider require international teams of brilliant scientists. Individual contributions get woven into a bigger tapestry.
Different Measures of Impact: Einstein fundamentally altered our understanding of the universe. It's hard to measure the impact of modern geniuses with discoveries that take many years or decades to realize their potential.

That said, here are a few categories of thinkers worth considering if you're looking for truly exceptional modern minds:

Theoretical Physicists

Edward Witten, USA: Often mentioned as the most influential living physicist. His deep contributions to string theory and M-theory have the potential to unify our understanding of physical forces.
Nima Arkani-Hamed, USA-Canada: Explored new dimensions of spacetime and proposed novel ideas about how our universe might be structured beyond the current Standard Model.
Juan Maldacena, USA-Argentina: Made critical breakthroughs in the AdS/CFT correspondence, connecting string theory and quantum gravity to other areas in physics.

Mathematicians

Terence Tao, USA-Australia: A prodigy who's made enormous contributions to fields like harmonic analysis, number theory, partial differential equations. Received the prestigious Fields Medal.
Grigori Perelman, Russia: Made landmark breakthroughs in geometry, notoriously solving the Poincaré conjecture and refusing the Fields Medal.

Beyond Theoretical Fields

Jennifer Doudna, USA: A revolutionary figure in biotechnology for her co-development of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. This advancement holds incredible promise as well as ethical complexities.
Terrence Sejnowski, USA: A leader in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, linking how the brain computes to developing better AI systems.
Ilon Musk, USA: he does not need introduction.

Note: This list is far from exhaustive. It highlights different facets of what ""genius"" can look like in our modern world. Many brilliant scientists make incredible contributions without widespread public recognition.

It\'s hard to measure the impact of modern geniuses with discoveries that take many years or decades to realize their potential.\n\nThat said, here are a few categories of thinkers worth considering if you\'re looking for truly exceptional modern minds:\n\nTheoretical Physicists\n\nEdward Witten, USA: Often mentioned as the most influential living physicist. His deep contributions to string theory and M-theory have the potential to unify our understanding of physical forces.\nNima Arkani-Hamed, USA-Canada: Explored new dimensions of spacetime and proposed novel ideas about how our universe might be structured beyond the current Standard Model.\nJuan Maldacena, USA-Argentina: Made critical breakthroughs in the AdS/CFT correspondence, connecting string theory and quantum gravity to other areas in physics.\n\nMathematicians\n\nTerence Tao, USA-Australia: A prodigy who\'s made enormous contributions to fields like harmonic analysis, number theory, partial differential equations. Received the prestigious Fields Medal.\nGrigori Perelman, Russia: Made landmark breakthroughs in geometry, notoriously solving the Poincaré conjecture and refusing the Fields Medal.\n\nBeyond Theoretical Fields\n\nJennifer Doudna, USA: A revolutionary figure in biotechnology for her co-development of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. This advancement holds incredible promise as well as ethical complexities.\nTerrence Sejnowski, USA: A leader in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, linking how the brain computes to developing better AI systems.\nIlon Musk, USA: he does not need introduction.\n\nNote: This list is far from exhaustive.

Rishabh Ghoshal,3y,Who was the greatest Scientific Disseminator in history?,"Me!

No, just kidding. In my opinion, it should be my hero, Carl Sagan. His literary style was like elegant poetry, revealing the secrets of time and space, each syllable a master piece; perfectly encompassing the true enormity of the Cosmos itself. The man was a genius, in no exaggerated sense of the word. That brings us to ‘Cosmos’. The book which is the “…science course you never had…” according to one praise. That book was just brilliant and taught people so much about the state of the day’s technological and scientific advance and taught them about the Cosmos so that they could get to grips with it and understand some of its phenomena.

How so much could be brought about by so little!

Carl Sagan.

The fact of the matter is that while people remember him for the science populariser that he was, he made significant contributions to science as well, beyond the dissemination of scientific knowledge.

He was the major proponent of Planetary Science during the heady years of the 1970′s and 80′s, making sure that along with the other Physical, Chemical and Biological discoveries of the day, Astronomy and Planetary Sciences also got their fair share of interest from the general public. He hypothesised the surface conditions of Venus and Jupiter and examined radio waves from the planets, before the days of the Cassini Space Probe and others and was considered to be the leading consultant on the topic of our Solar System. He also ventured into pondering upon the possible existence of extra-terrestrial life, modifying the Drake equation and advocating the need for scientific thought and critical thinking to the World.

While many have criticised him for his ‘recycling’ of scientific ideas, many have also not realised the significance of his contributions towards Planetary Sciences and Science itself…

TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT ONE ASPECT OF HIS WORK;

The one thing that I am astounded by is his demonstration of the synthesis of amino acids from their simple chemical components via the effects of exposure to radiation ( this must have provided the Activation Energy required for the reaction to take place ).

The implications of this single experiment are astounding…paving way to a refined “Theory of How Life on Earth started”.

I fail to understand why this particular work of his did not garner as much attention from the scientific community as it deserved. With proper thought and providing a structure to the scientific evidence of the time, I am sure he could have formulated a theory of life. From this experiment alone, we can see that the source of the ‘radiation’, i.e, the spark to the gases and the resultant amino acids that were the result of this reaction.

Now, on early Earth, such chemicals were exposed to the bare Ultra-Violet Rays of the Sun as the Ozone layer was not existent. Thus these amino acids were produced. Over millennia, it is possible that in the fluid medium of the primordial soup, cells were the result of the mixing and interaction of these amino acid. I truly find the very concept of this, let alone A DEMONSTRATION of this reaction, remarkable.

A theory remains a theory without a logically feasible structure to it; questions such as “Does is make sense?” should be answered solidly. Now a theory with an accompanying demonstration - in my mind, I have been thoroughly convinced of the said scientist’s ideas’ validity, even if later it is found to be otherwise.

James Keenley,4y,Was Henry VIII's decision to reject the Catholic church and the pope authority the start of the technological and scientific revolution of the last 600 years?,"No.

The assertion that religion and science stand at odds with each other, and that religious superstition holds back scientific advancement has never been true.

Let’s start off with one simple fact: “the last 600 years” began in 1419. At that point, Henry VIII wouldn’t be born for another 72 years.

While there’s no precise date when the Scientific Revolution began, a commonly-agreed upon date is 1508, when Nicolaus Copernicus developed his theory that the earth revolved around the sun, and not the other way around. At that point, Henry VIII was alive, but he was only 17 years old, and he wouldn’t succeed to the throne for another year.

One could, of course, counter my assertion by noting that Copernicus didn’t officially publish his findings until his book “De Revolutionibus orbium Coelestium” appeared in 1543. At that point, Henry VIII had ascended to the throne, was still in power, and had completed the overthrow of the Catholic Church in England, and the Pope’s authority over the Church of England.

Unfortunately, Henry’s authority, and the consequences of Henry’s overthrowing the Catholic Church in England, has little effect on Copernicus, who was born and raised in Poland, and who did most of his studies and work in universities in Italy. Not to mention the fact that Copernicus was Catholic.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/anc6urpyxzvgswbd', 'title': ""Was Henry VIII's decision to reject the Catholic church and the pope authority the start of the technological and scientific revolution of the last 600 years?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9982, 'ai': 0.0018}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'No.\n\nThe assertion that religion and science stand at odds with each other, and that religious superstition holds back scientific advancement has never been true.\n\nLet’s start off with one simple fact: “the last 600 years” began in 1419.

Francis Marsden,3y,What was the role of the Protestant Reformation in the growth of the Scientific Revolution?,"The foundations of modern science were laid not post-Reformation, but in the Catholic High Middle Ages. This is a point often not appreciated.

The key doctrinal underpinning of natural science was the belief in one Creator, who had made all things in a rational and logical manner. Christianity speaks of Christ as the logos, the rational principle through Whom all things were made.

Eastern religions treat the material world as illusion. Animists think it is controlled by hordes of spirits. The Islamic Allah is arbitrary in his judgements and acts. It is because of the Christian/Catholic belief in God as logos, reason, that the West became the cradle of modern science.

Robert Grosseteste (1175–1254) had Franciscan connections. He was a mathematician and physicist who became bishop of Lincoln in 1235.

One of his pupils was Roger Bacon, Franciscan, (1220–92), who pioneered the experimental method and also optics. With Bacon at Oxford for a while was Albertus Magnus, St Albert the Great (1200–80), a polymath Dominican who wrote extensively on geology, alchemy, astronomy, mineralogy, physiology and the theory of music. William of Ockham wrote widely on maths and physics.

Jean Buridan (1301–58) realised the idea of impetus or momentum. Nicolas Oresme, bishop of Lisieux, worked out some of the principles of physics, criticized astrology, developed mathematics and discussed the possible rotation of the earth on its axis.

Cardinal Nicholas di Cusa (1400–64) was another mathematician, who anticipated Copernicus' theory of the earth being in motion, not the centre of the Universe, and planetary orbits not being circular.

Copernicus and Galileo, as others have noted, were both Catholics. Kepler and Tycho Brahe were Lutherans. Christopher Clavius was a Jesuit at the Roman College who confirmed Galileo's telescope observations, and added more of his own.

Newton was a Non-Conformist Anglican, a Unitarian, probably, who wrote reams about numerology in the Book of Revelation.

In the English-speaking world we hear more about the Protestant English scientists and engineers. Britain undoubtedly had this pragmatic engineering streak which made it so successful in trade and conquest.

A look down the list of Italian and French scientists will however show that there were brilliant scientists on both sides of the Reformation divide, and that Catholicism was no barrier to scientific enquiry, quite the opposite:

Pierre Gassendi, (1592–1655) French mathematician, priest, physicist, astronomer, first to observe the transit of Mercury across the sun.

Roger Joseph Boscovic, SJ, Croatian mathematician, astronomer, physicist.

Marin Mersenne, (1588–1648) French priest, “father of acoustics"".

Other eminent Catholic scientists included Blaise Pascal, Louis Pasteur, Charles Coulomb, Giovanni Volta, Andre-Marie Ampere, Pierre de Fermat, Antoine Lavoisier, Becquerel, Braille, Cauchy, Cassini, Cotriolis, Doppler, Duhem, Fallopio, Fermi, Fibonacci, Foucault, Fresnel, Galvani, Lagrange, da Vinci etc.

So it certainly cannot be proven that the Catholic Church retarded scientific development. The religious wars resulting from the Reformation, in France, Germany and England, caused immense damage to the fabric of society as a whole, and hence also to scientific progress -although they may have stimulated it in military science (the science of killing people).

So I would say that the jury is still out. It's impossible to prove that either Catholicism or Protestantism gave any real advantage to the Scientific Revolution. There were experimentalists and empiricists on both sides, and also reactionary anti-science fundamentalists on both sides.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/k7x4uboehqwdnizs', 'title': 'What was the role of the Protestant Reformation in the growth of the Scientific Revolution?', 'score': {'original': 0.47995, 'ai': 0.52005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The foundations of modern science were laid not post-Reformation, but in the Catholic High Middle Ages.

Nikhil Jindal,3y,What is a scientific revolution?,"The scientific revolution was the emergence of modern science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy), and chemistry transformed societal views about nature. The scientific revolution began in Europe toward the end of the Renaissance period, and continued through the late 18th century, influencing the intellectual social movement known as the Enlightenment. While its dates are disputed, the publication in 1543 of Nicolas Copernicus ‘s De revolutionbus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution. It ended with Isaac Newton (1642-1727), who proposed universal laws and a Mechanical Universe. A new view of nature emerged during the Scientific Revolution, replacing the Greek view that had dominated science for almost 2,000 years. Science became an autonomous discipline, distinct from both philosophy and technology, and it came to be regarded as having utilitarian goals. By the end of this period, it may not be too much to say that science had replaced Christianity as the focal point of European civilization.Out of the ferment of the Renaissance and Reformation there arose a new view of science, bringing about the following

Transformations: the reeducation of common sense in favor of abstract reasoning ; the substitution of a quantitative for a qualitative view of nature ; the view of nature as a machine rather than as an organism ; the development of an experimental, scientific methods that sought definite answers to certain limited questions couched in the framework of specific theories ; and the acceptance of new criteria for explanation, stressing the ‘how’ rather than the ‘why’ that had characterized the Aristotelian search for final causes. From 1500-1700, Europe experienced a scientific revolution when new ideas in physics, astronomy, biology, anatomy changed the way Europeans viewed a natural world . It is also in a certain way or manner changed the intellectual environment of 17th century Europe. The scientific revolution was also co terminus with the period of enlightment and absolutism as well. The scientific revolution is also considered by some scholars as a time of intense debate between science and religion.

During its course developed modern scientific practices and research emerged the new scientific thought. Prior to the scientific revolution, many Europeans were ignorant of basic earth science, had very little and limited means of education and knowledge. However theknowledge that did exist was controlledby the Roman Catholic Church and usually theirlessons were based on the scriptures. Most of the scientificteachings of the churchwere based on Biblical theory and ancient Greek Science.For example, Geocentric

Theory (the Earth is the Centre of the universe); Four Major Elements; Divine Controlof Motion (God controls movement/laws of motion).

The scientific revolution was built upon the foundation of ancient Greek learning andscience in the middle Ages, as it had been elaborated and further developed byRoman/Byzantine science and medieval Islamic science. The Aristotelian tradition wasstill an important intellectual framework in the 17th century, although by that time natural philosophers had moved away from much of it. Key scientific ideas dating back toclassical antiquity had changed drastically over the years, and in many cases beendiscredited. The ideas that remained (for example, Aristotle’s cosmology, which placed the Earth at the center of a spherical hierarchic cosmos or the Ptolemaic model of planetary motion) were transformed fundamentally during the scientific revolution.

Under the scientific method that was defined and applied in the 17th century, natural and artificial circumstances were abandoned, and a research tradition of systematic experimentation was slowly accepted throughout the scientific community. The philosophy of using an inductive approach to nature (to abandon assumption and to attempt to simply observe with an open mind) was in strict contrast with the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction, by which analysis of known facts produced further understanding. In practice, many scientists and philosophers believed that a healthy mix of both was needed—the willingness to both question assumptions, and to interpret observations assumed to have some degree of validity.

During the scientific revolution, changing perceptions about the role of the scientist in respect to nature, the value of evidence, experimental or observed, led towards a scientific methodology in which empiricism played a large, but not absolute, role. The term British empiricism came into use to describe philosophical differences perceived between two of its founders—Francis Bacon, described as empiricist, and René Descartes, who was described asa rationalist. Bacon’s works established and popularized inductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method, or sometimes simply the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today. Correspondingly, Descartes distinguished between the knowledge that could be attained by reason alone (rationalist approach), as, for example, in mathematics, and the knowledge that required experience of the world, as in physics. The scientific revolution laid the foundations for the Age of Enlightenment, which centered on reason as the primary source of authority and legitimacy, and emphasized the importance of the scientific method. By the 18th century, when the Enlightenment flourished, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and disciplines until then seen as legitimately scientific (e.g., alchemy and astrology) lost scientific credibility.

Science came to play a leading role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences, and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favor of the development of free speech and thought. Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued empiricism and rational thought, and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. At the time, science was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. The century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

Miguel Corazao,1y,"Why isn't the Islamic Golden Age considered to be the ""Scientific Revolution"" in world history whereas the European period of achievements are?","“Why isn't the Islamic Golden Age considered to be the ""Scientific Revolution"" in world history whereas the European period of achievements are?”

There are a few ways to respond.

First of all, genuine historians do consider the Islamic Golden Age to have been an important period of scientific revolution, just as the European Renaissance/Modern Age did. It is important not confuse high-school textbooks and popular books with actual historical research. Your typical textbooks and popular books in western countries are generally based on the political narratives that have been promoted to inflate the importance of the West. Western historiography has been written to essentially erase the contributions of the Arabs and Eastern Romans. (The contributions of the Chinese and Hindus were less well known in Europe but these were repressed as well.)

The Western Golden Age has actually spread into a worldwide golden age. Some like to point out that this is why the Western Golden Age was a real revolution whereas the Islamic Golden Age was not. That is gratuitous, of course. The level of interconnectedness possible today did not exist during the Middle Ages. The progress in the Arab world has influenced the whole planet, including Western Europe, but it took longer for their contributions to disseminate.

Western Europe could never have accomplished what it did without the advancements of the Arabs. The Arab invention of algebra by itself dramatically advanced all areas of science. Their advancements in medical science made possible the great recent medical advancements in the West during the past couple of centuries.

Nick Deakin,Updated 4y,What was the main event that started the technological revolution?,"The grinding wheel with flywheel ! Very little is known about it, but it must have existing as this artefact is evidence of it. The tools are not that difficult to make, a pointed stick with a grinding wheel attached to the top, in a table with a hole, but look what you can do with it. It was probably used to make Obsidian (volcanic glass) mirrors, not much has changed, ladies want to look their best. But look at this wonder…

Tolerances are micron scale (0.1mm or better) for the profile! 7,500BCE.

This is the start of technology as we know it today, you can’t do that much without tools. Whatever made this is tooling well ahead of the curve (a basic machine!), there is a lot of interesting things going on in the area at this time, which would lead in the fullness of time to civilisation. This is the height of the stone age and shows true mastery of the material of the age.

I’m not sure which is more remarkable the bracelet, the craftperson who made it or the machine used. In my opinion geniuses like Leonardo come once an astronomical age (about every 2000 years), they seem to be good of the art of science: technology. In the Age of Cancer 8,000 to 6,000 BCE, metal smelting was discovered, but this gets the top spot for me (a machine).

 (thanks to Colleen Anne Coyle for flagging it up). This is what really leads to the potter's wheel and the solid wheel (platforms) and machines. I think it now more likely that the grinding wheel, lead to the potter's wheel which leads to the Wheel!

Ross Freeman,Jan 18,"Can you explain the scientific revolution and its connection to other historical revolutions, such as the French Revolution and American Revolution?","Not much connection at all on paper. The American and French Revolutions were political in origin. They had identifiable causes and relatively clear start and end dates - at least for storytelling convenience.

The “scientific revolution” is just a catchall term. Do we set the start date at the Italian Renaissance? Do we note the inspiration from Greeks who worked millennia before the Renaissance in many of the basic areas that became this “revolution”? Do we note that the Italians had forgotten the Greeks, and were reintroduced by the Muslim empires of the east who had plenty of “scientific revolution” happening before the Europeans caught on?

You should stretch the term somewhat and include philosophical elements as outcomes of the “scientific revolution”. Now you are getting somewhere. What we think of as the scientific revolution was more of a philosophical revolution. Science is (hopefully) based on objective fact and logic, and presumes that humans can comprehend and discover what is going on. A corollary is that humans can make progress using said logic and understanding.

That was revolutionary. Both the American and French revolutions were solidly based on the idea that humans could design a system different from what came before that would lead to better outcomes for all. Scientific philosophy, political action.

The American Revolution was actually nothing of the kind in that it was a very conservative revolution. The objective was primarily to exercise the rights that Americans felt were their natural endowment as English citizens. It took a lot of political conflict to develop the system we have today, which is a variant of the English system, not some totally new creation. The Founding Fathers were a logical bunch, but also extremely realistic about how far that logic would take you in the real world. Tweaking the tried and true beat theory and logic every time.

The French Revolution took the idea of scientific philosophy and ran with it. If we can calculate the motion of the planets, we can logically calculate the best human system. That is the kind of thinking we are talking about.

The result was a lot of wild eyed (and half baked) experimentation, terror, death and suffering. Only to end up with a relatively obvious democratic solution after a long period of political disorder. Not for nothing is the current French system called the Fifth Republic. Took a few tries to get something that worked in the real world. But as they say in France, “sure it works in practice, but does it work in theory?”.

You can take any number of later “revolutions” and trace the impact of this “scientific” thinking. The Nazis felt the need to apply “scientific logic” to whatever wackadoodle programs they wanted to dream up. Communist regimes of all flavors are based on the pseudo scientific Marxist idea that there is this inexorable logic in history, we just need to help it along - generally by offing anybody who isn’t with the program.

So the philosophy of modern science has had a huge impact on “revolutions” of various kinds. Modern science (as opposed to Postmodern) is stuck with observation of facts and the scientific method, which makes it somewhat difficult to get too far off the rails. Scientific philosophy applied in the political and social realm is pretty much whatever you want it to be, as long as you put a coat of logical sounding paint over it. There are no objective facts to anchor the discussion, no sound basis for anyone to object to whatever set of “scientific facts” you pick, because they are not facts, they are assumptions.

Logic is a tool, not a source of reality. Logic has no morality. If you let me pick the assumptions and observations of “fact”, I can prove absolutely anything you like and you can’t prove me wrong. All I need then is to point a gun in your face and a group of like minded friends with guns to convince your friends of the logic of my position. Might need to set an example here and there, word gets around about that kind of thing. If the perfect world is just around the corner and I am leading the way to it, then getting rid of you and your buddies is extremely logical. Nothing personal, and logic has no feelings anyways - why should you?

This is not to say that the scientific revolution has not been extraordinarily valuable - one of the greatest additions to human welfare since the dawn of time, perhaps the greatest. My point, and the point I think the question is going for, is that scientific philosophy divorced from any set of objective fact is a very dangerous thing. Logic is useful but not leading to a better outcome necessarily.

The old example of nuclear power - you can power 10,000 homes for the comfort and health of the people, or use the same basic methods and vaporize those same homes with the people inside. The atoms don’t give a damn, they follow their logic.

Availability and decentralization of capital and political freedom, or bluntly put people with spare cash willing to risk that cash on research.

If you make a plot of scientific theory and discoveries since Roger Bacon almost everything started with Italian scholars or scholars financed from Italy, including Roger Bacon whose main work that put the foundations for the scientific method was financed by the Bishop of Rome, also known and the Pope :-) . During the Middle Ages Italy was the place with the money in Europe: they financed kings all over the place, from England (the first recorded financial crisis after the end of the Western Roman Empire was caused by an English king defaulting on debts owed to Italian bankers), to Spain (the Italians financed the exploration expeditions, then the wars in Europe) to France and the German states.

As you advance through time relevant scholars appear in the rest of Europe during the late 1400s and the 1500s, though until about 1800 the bulk is still in Italy. After 1800 England, France and the Netherlands take the lead, with Germany joining the top in the second half of the 1800s, then Russia, then during the 1880s USA, then around 1900 almost every country in the world becomes involved.

During the Great War USA takes the lead with UK following closely until after WWII when only USA and Soviet Union remain in the top, Soviet Union only because they focused their efforts on a very narrow field and still kept independent and concurrent research centers. The rest lagged behind, until during the 1970s Japan joined the top, then Taiwan, India, China, with the European countries starting to lag.

John Harland,3y,What were the biggest scientific advances during the Middle Ages?,"“What were the biggest scientific advances during the Middle Ages?”

When thinking of the “MIddle Ages” the temptation is to restrict one’s thinking to Europe but a lot was happening elsewhere and a lot of what was discovered in Europe was influenced by what was being discovered elsewhere.

Particularly, the Muslim conquests of the Mediterranean area and beyond brought a revival of the learning of places including Egypt and Persia. It wasn’t “Muslim learning” any more than scientific advances in Europe were “Christian learning”, often being seen to be in opposition to those religions.

However in each case the theocracy provided a level of security and communication between learned people across large areas and the “Christian” networks centred on the Church were the primary avenues for the dispersal of “Muslim” science and other learning through Europe.

As Jason Almentra mentions, Ibn al Haytham, also known as Alhazen (or Alhacen?) contributed a great deal to our modern ideas of scientific method.

However Scientific method is a reasonably-coherent set of principles developed over several thousand years and continuing to develop. It is not a single idea conceived in one moment, or one lifetime.

In embryonic form scientific method was already evident in the exquisitely precise astronomical data of the Sumerians along with their mathematics that allowed analysis of the data and prediction of some events, such as eclipses.

Al Haytham’s work built on the work of Indian, Persian and Greek scientists as well. Nor was “Scientific method” complete with his work. It was adopted and enlarged on by people from Roger Bacon, Galileo, Francis Bacon, Hooke, Newton and Descartes as the Middle Ages flowed into the Renaissance.

However fundamental aspects of modern scientific method, including the Null hypothesis and statistical methods were only developed centuries later and the development continues.

Human development is continual. Labels such as “Middle Ages” engender misconceptions about how distinct particular time period, or stages of learning, were. The “Renaissance” was like a fire licking at the edges of Medieval thinking for a long time before the fire spread.

Another huge advance in science was the development of mathematics, particularly facilitated by the adoption and adaption of Indian numerals by the Arabs then their introduction to Europe by people including Fibonacci. It is hard to conceive of Kepler or Newton advancing astronomical knowledge as they did, had they been working with Roman numerals.

Mathematical methods had been advanced greatly in Medieval times by Ibn al Khwarism (known as Algorithm) in Persia around 800 CE. His work travelled into Europe, refined by people including Fibonacci, Leibnitz, Descartes and Newton.

Will Thomas,4y,How was the discovery of the New World essential for the onset of the Industrial Revolution 200 years later?,"I suspect that the discovery of the New World played these roles in the lead-up to the Anglo-Dutch-American Industrial Revolution:

It opened the European mind to science and discovery. That the world was round was not idle science, but a most crucial fact. Other abstruce ideas could prove as vital. (And they did!) The very idea of a “new world” to explore (and exploit) helped break the bonds of tradition and open up new ways of thinking.
New products were brought into the European economy, including chocolate, maize, and the potato. These would support population growth (adding inventive minds) and no doubt provide new useful ingredients. I don’t know enough about this topic to do it justice.
The Spanish sent gold and silver from the Americas to Spain. They then spent the gold and silver on wars and merchandise. Some wars in the Low Countries, and merchandise from northern Europe, including English woolens. This monetized the future homes of the industrial revolution, making cash widely available for use in trade throughout those realms, even among the lowly. And the Spanish demand funded merchants in the North, helping develop industries like textiles.
Europeans learned new skills and got ideas about new lifestyles from the native Americans. This, too, challenged European tradition and opened the European mind to new ideas about life choices and social organization.
The opening up of the Americas to colonization greatly expanded the culturally European population over next few centuries. This had two effects: 1) It put European bankers and merchants at the center of an Atlantic-spanning trade that was bigger than what Europe alone could offer. This helped develop financial institutions. 2) It meant there were more and more of the people who were making the industrial revolution, and they had more and more resources to draw on. In time, the English colonies in North America would prove a center of industrial innovation.
The possibility of remaking oneself in the Americas served as a social safety valve for Europe. And it created an ongoing source of social challenge, since even if one could not climb to high status at home, one might in America. Who would George Washington have been in England? Likely, nobody. But in America, he helped change the world and defeat even the KIng of England.

Would there have been an industrial revolution without the colonization of the Americas? Who can say?

The Spanish gold and silver were vital in sparking the commercial revolution leading up to the Industrial take-off. And I will note as well that in China, in the Song dynasty (circa 1100 AD), iron productiion was higher than in England circa 1800. But that Chinese industrial revolution was strangled at birth by an Imperial Court that had no George Washingtons to stand against it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/d03pnrvmbhsz7yxi', 'title': 'How was the discovery of the New World essential for the onset of the Industrial Revolution 200 years later?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I suspect that the discovery of the New World played these roles in the lead-up to the Anglo-Dutch-American Industrial Revolution:\n\nIt opened the European mind to science and discovery.

Brecht Corbeel,Oct 28,How has scientific revolution changed the world?,"The period coined as the scientific revolution, notably the 16th to the 18th century, marked a radical reformation in collective thought. This era, punctuated by the works of scholars such as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, forged an unbreakable link between empirical observation and mathematical description. It became an inflection point in history, reshaping how humans perceived and interacted with the natural world.

When considering the multifaceted impact of the scientific revolution, the advent of the scientific method is certainly at the forefront. This systematic approach to inquiry demystified various facets of human experience and laid the groundwork for modern science. The scientific method, essentially an iterative process of hypothesis, experiment, and observation, replaced archaic models of reasoning, often based on speculative philosophy or religious doctrine. This transition from dogma to data acted as a catalyst for advancements in numerous fields from astronomy to zoology.

Mechanistic philosophy also owes its roots to the scientific revolution. This philosophy interprets the universe as a complex machine, a notion that extends from celestial bodies to biological organisms. This point of view informed many subsequent discoveries, including the elucidation of blood circulation by William Harvey. The mechanistic philosophy eventually paved the way for the reductionism prevalent in today’s scientific investigations. This approach dissects complicated systems into their simplest components, seeking to understand each part in isolation before reassembling the whole. It serves as a linchpin for disciplines ranging from molecular biology to computational neuroscience.

The rise of empiricism is another noteworthy outcome. Emphasizing the role of experience and sensory perception in the formation of ideas, empiricism challenged traditional authorities and accepted wisdoms. This empirical framework became the bedrock for modern scientific inquiry and drastically changed the dynamics of scholarly discussions. Nowhere is this shift more evident than in the development of peer review, which ensures the credibility and quality of scientific research by subjecting it to rigorous evaluation by experts in the field.

The transformation of technology should not be overlooked. One of the most evident impacts of the scientific revolution is its marriage with technology to produce applications that have fundamentally altered the human condition. Technological advancements, such as the telescope and microscope, were both outcomes and catalysts of the scientific revolution. These tools not only extended human senses but also radically expanded the realm of the knowable. For instance, Anton van Leeuwenhoek's microscope led to the discovery of microorganisms, igniting a cascade of innovations in microbiology that would later facilitate breakthroughs in medicine, like antibiotics.

Another major shift lay in the stratification and specialization of scientific disciplines. Prior to the scientific revolution, studies in natural philosophy encompassed what would now be considered disparate scientific disciplines. The advent of the scientific method, coupled with the growing body of knowledge, led to the establishment of specialized fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology. This specialization enabled more focused and nuanced investigations, setting the stage for monumental discoveries like the laws of thermodynamics and the structure of DNA.

The concept of inductive reasoning, popularized by Francis Bacon, established a standard model for knowledge acquisition. Unlike deductive reasoning, which derives specific truths from general premises, inductive reasoning begins with observations and culminates in general conclusions. This methodology had a profound impact on scientific literature, prompting an epistemological shift that prioritized empirical data over preconceived notions.

It's essential to discuss the propagation and accessibility of knowledge, facilitated largely through the printing press. This technological innovation allowed for the mass production of texts, including scientific literature, leading to a more democratized spread of information. It made possible the widespread dissemination of groundbreaking works, such as Copernicus’s ""De revolutionibus orbium coelestium,"" enabling scholars to build upon one another’s research in a manner previously inconceivable.

Economic implications of the scientific revolution also merit discussion. Consider, for example, the field of agronomy. Scientific advancements in understanding soil chemistry, plant biology, and meteorology led to enhanced agricultural productivity. This agricultural transformation, in turn, played a pivotal role in population growth and urbanization, indirectly influencing socioeconomic structures worldwide. The role of science in fueling economic engines cannot be overstated; from medical advancements to technological innovations, the scientific method has consistently served as a vehicle for economic prosperity.

The scientific revolution also imparted a deep-rooted cultural shift. A society once tethered to superstition and mysticism began to embrace a worldview rooted in empiricism and rationality. This cultural evolution has not only informed public policy and education but has also permeated art and literature. The scientific realism observed in the works of artists like Leonardo da Vinci serves as a testament to the pervasive influence of scientific thought on various facets of human existence.

The changes incited by the scientific revolution are by no means exhaustive in this discourse. The focus here has been on dissecting key inflection points that have reverberated through time to shape contemporary understanding and practices. The indelible impact of this period cannot be quantified but continues to resonate in the corpus of modern science, philosophy, and even daily life. The shifts in thought and practice brought forth by the scientific revolution echo through various domains, a testament to its transformative power.

The concept of universality in scientific laws became a prominent feature post-scientific revolution. The idea that the laws of physics are universal and unchanging permitted the application of mathematical models to understand the natural world. Newton’s law of gravitation, for example, revealed that the same set of principles governing a falling apple also dictate the motions of celestial bodies. This was not merely a theoretical exercise; it had practical applications. The understanding of gravitation made it possible to predict planetary movements, ocean tides, and even enabled calculations necessary for space exploration.

Another transformational change brought forth by the scientific revolution was in the field of medicine. Prior to this era, medical practices were heavily influenced by the humoral theory and religious doctrines. However, the newfound emphasis on empirical evidence and rationalism led to the meticulous study of anatomy and physiology. Dissections and autopsies, previously taboo due to religious and cultural prohibitions, were performed to understand the human body's inner workings. This understanding led to significant advancements in surgical procedures, diagnosis, and treatments, which were increasingly based on scientific principles rather than dogma or tradition.

The notion of falsifiability, introduced by philosopher Karl Popper in the 20th century but inherently applied much earlier, became a fundamental criterion for scientific theories. A theory that could be proven false through experimentation gained credibility over a theory that merely accommodated existing observations. This radically shifted the scientific landscape, making it more dynamic and self-correcting. Falsifiability reinforced the importance of skepticism in scientific inquiry and elevated the role of experimental evidence in validating theoretical frameworks.

It is also vital to address the impact of the scientific revolution on social structures. Before this period, knowledge was often confined to monasteries, courts, and elite educational institutions. The scientific revolution, combined with the advent of the printing press, democratized knowledge by making it accessible to a broader public. This marked the rise of the public intellectual and the informed citizen, fundamentally altering the relationship between science and society. Social institutions, from governmental bodies to educational systems, started integrating scientific concepts and methods, reflecting a shift towards a society increasingly guided by empirical and rational thought.

The scientific revolution has had an undeniable influence on geopolitical matters. Scientific discoveries and technological advancements became both the product and the fuel for national and imperial ambitions. For instance, advancements in navigation technology during the Age of Exploration contributed to the expansion of empires and the colonization of new worlds. The ability to accurately measure longitude and latitude, the development of the compass, and the improvements in cartography—all outcomes of the scientific revolution—played pivotal roles in geopolitical rearrangements.

The scientific revolution even influenced legal practices. The forensic science that we consider standard today had its beginnings in the scientific methodology established during this transformative period. Techniques like fingerprinting and DNA analysis owe their existence to the principles of empirical observation and systematic testing that were popularized then.

Finally, the epistemological shifts prompted by the scientific revolution warrant consideration. The way we ""know"" has been indelibly marked by the scientific method, shifting the epistemological grounds from tradition, intuition, or revelation to a system based on evidence and observation. While the epistemic transformations led to groundbreaking discoveries and technological advancements, they also gave rise to new philosophical questions about the limits of human knowledge, the nature of scientific theories, and the ethics of scientific discovery.

As we ponder the breadth of influence that the scientific revolution has had, it becomes clear that it was not just an era of scientific discoveries but also a broad cultural and intellectual transition. The transformations it triggered were not just in isolated domains but spanned across disciplines, impacting not only how we understand the universe but also how we interact with it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/70g9lh1fi85xwp64', 'title': 'How has scientific revolution changed the world?', 'score': {'original': 3.3333333333333e-05, 'ai': 0.99996666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The period coined as the scientific revolution, notably the 16th to the 18th century, marked a radical reformation in collective thought.

The understanding of gravitation made it possible to predict planetary movements, ocean tides, and even enabled calculations necessary for space exploration.\n\nAnother transformational change brought forth by the scientific revolution was in the field of medicine. Prior to this era, medical practices were heavily influenced by the humoral theory and religious doctrines. However, the newfound emphasis on empirical evidence and rationalism led to the meticulous study of anatomy and physiology.

This understanding led to significant advancements in surgical procedures, diagnosis, and treatments, which were increasingly based on scientific principles rather than dogma or tradition.\n\nThe notion', 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'of falsifiability, introduced by philosopher Karl Popper in the 20th century but inherently applied much earlier, became a fundamental criterion for scientific theories.

This radically shifted the scientific landscape, making it more dynamic and self-correcting. Falsifiability reinforced the importance of skepticism in scientific inquiry and elevated the role of experimental evidence in validating theoretical frameworks.\n\nIt is also vital to address the impact of the scientific revolution on social structures. Before this period, knowledge was often confined to monasteries, courts, and elite educational institutions. The scientific revolution, combined with the advent of the printing press, democratized knowledge by making it accessible to a broader public. This marked the rise of the public intellectual and the informed citizen, fundamentally altering the relationship between science and society. Social institutions, from governmental bodies to educational systems, started integrating scientific concepts and methods, reflecting a shift towards a society increasingly guided by empirical and rational thought.\n\nThe scientific revolution has had an undeniable influence on geopolitical matters. Scientific discoveries and technological advancements became both the product and the fuel for national and imperial ambitions. For instance, advancements in navigation technology during the Age of Exploration contributed to the expansion of empires and the colonization of new worlds. The ability to accurately measure longitude and latitude, the development of the compass, and the improvements in cartography—all outcomes of the scientific revolution—played pivotal roles in geopolitical rearrangements.\n\nThe scientific revolution even influenced legal practices. The forensic science that we consider standard today had its beginnings in the scientific methodology established during this transformative period.

The way we ""know"" has been indelibly marked by the scientific method, shifting the epistemological grounds from tradition, intuition, or revelation to a system based on evidence and observation. While the epistemic transformations led to groundbreaking discoveries and technological advancements, they also gave rise to new philosophical questions about the limits of human knowledge, the nature of scientific theories, and the ethics of scientific discovery.\n\nAs we ponder the breadth of influence that the scientific revolution has had, it becomes clear that it was not just an era of scientific discoveries but also a broad cultural and intellectual transition. The transformations it triggered were not just in isolated domains but spanned across disciplines, impacting not only how we understand the universe but also how we interact with it.', 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 15, 'credits': 1994142, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'The period coined as the scientific revolution, notably the 16th to the 18th century, marked a radical reformation in collective thought. This era, punctuated by the works of scholars such as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, forged an unbreakable link between empirical observation and mathematical description. It became an inflection point in history, reshaping how humans perceived and interacted with the natural world.\n\nWhen considering the multifaceted impact of the scientific revolution, the advent of the scientific method is certainly at the forefront. This systematic approach to inquiry demystified various facets of human experience and laid the groundwork for modern science. The scientific method, essentially an iterative process of hypothesis, experiment, and observation, replaced archaic models of reasoning, often based on speculative philosophy or religious doctrine. This transition from dogma to data acted as a catalyst for advancements in numerous fields from astronomy to zoology.\n\nMechanistic philosophy also owes its roots to the scientific revolution. This philosophy interprets the universe as a complex machine, a notion that extends from celestial bodies to biological organisms. This point of view informed many subsequent discoveries, including the elucidation of blood circulation by William Harvey. The mechanistic philosophy eventually paved the way for the reductionism prevalent in today’s scientific investigations. This approach dissects complicated systems into their simplest components, seeking to understand each part in isolation before reassembling the whole. It serves as a linchpin for disciplines ranging from molecular biology to computational neuroscience.\n\nThe rise of empiricism is another noteworthy outcome. Emphasizing the role of experience and sensory perception in the formation of ideas, empiricism challenged traditional authorities and accepted wisdoms. This empirical framework became the bedrock for modern scientific inquiry and drastically changed the dynamics of scholarly discussions. Nowhere is this shift more evident than in the development of peer review, which ensures the credibility and quality of scientific research by subjecting it to rigorous evaluation by experts in the field.\n\nThe transformation of technology should not be overlooked. One of the most evident impacts of the scientific revolution is its marriage with technology to produce applications that have fundamentally altered the human condition. Technological advancements, such as the telescope and microscope, were both outcomes and catalysts of the scientific revolution. These tools not only extended human senses but also radically expanded the realm of the knowable. For instance, Anton van Leeuwenhoek\'s microscope led to the discovery of microorganisms, igniting a cascade of innovations in microbiology that would later facilitate breakthroughs in medicine, like antibiotics.\n\nAnother major shift lay in the stratification and specialization of scientific disciplines. Prior to the scientific revolution, studies in natural philosophy encompassed what would now be considered disparate scientific disciplines. The advent of the scientific method, coupled with the growing body of knowledge, led to the establishment of specialized fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology. This specialization enabled more focused and nuanced investigations, setting the stage for monumental discoveries like the laws of thermodynamics and the structure of DNA.\n\nThe concept of inductive reasoning, popularized by Francis Bacon, established a standard model for knowledge acquisition. Unlike deductive reasoning, which derives specific truths from general premises, inductive reasoning begins with observations and culminates in general conclusions. This methodology had a profound impact on scientific literature, prompting an epistemological shift that prioritized empirical data over preconceived notions.\n\nIt\'s essential to discuss the propagation and accessibility of knowledge, facilitated largely through the printing press. This technological innovation allowed for the mass production of texts, including scientific literature, leading to a more democratized spread of information. It made possible the widespread dissemination of groundbreaking works, such as Copernicus’s ""De revolutionibus orbium coelestium,"" enabling scholars to build upon one another’s research in a manner previously inconceivable.\n\nEconomic implications of the scientific revolution also merit discussion. Consider, for example, the field of agronomy. Scientific advancements in understanding soil chemistry, plant biology, and meteorology led to enhanced agricultural productivity. This agricultural transformation, in turn, played a pivotal role in population growth and urbanization, indirectly influencing socioeconomic structures worldwide. The role of science in fueling economic engines cannot be overstated; from medical advancements to technological innovations, the scientific method has consistently served as a vehicle for economic prosperity.\n\nThe scientific revolution also imparted a deep-rooted cultural shift. A society once tethered to superstition and mysticism began to embrace a worldview rooted in empiricism and rationality. This cultural evolution has not only informed public policy and education but has also permeated art and literature. The scientific realism observed in the works of artists like Leonardo da Vinci serves as a testament to the pervasive influence of scientific thought on various facets of human existence.\n\nThe changes incited by the scientific revolution are by no means exhaustive in this discourse. The focus here has been on dissecting key inflection points that have reverberated through time to shape contemporary understanding and practices. The indelible impact of this period cannot be quantified but continues to resonate in the corpus of modern science, philosophy, and even daily life. The shifts in thought and practice brought forth by the scientific revolution echo through various domains, a testament to its transformative power.\n\nThe concept of universality in scientific laws became a prominent feature post-scientific revolution. The idea that the laws of physics are universal and unchanging permitted the application of mathematical models to understand the natural world. Newton’s law of gravitation, for example, revealed that the same set of principles governing a falling apple also dictate the motions of celestial bodies. This was not merely a theoretical exercise; it had practical applications. The understanding of gravitation made it possible to predict planetary movements, ocean tides, and even enabled calculations necessary for space exploration.\n\nAnother transformational change brought forth by the scientific revolution was in the field of medicine.

Pre-Scientific age is considered 1400s ish aka as Middle Ages

The scientific age foundation is generally thought to be around.. 1600 when the goal was to recover wisdom of the ancients, but ended with Galileo's work was focused on the recovery of the knowledge of the ancients; this is generally considered to have ended in 1632 with the publication of Galileo's Scientific Revolution, in which he supported the Work of Copernicus's (1500s ish). and is thought to be the beginning of the Scientific Age. I consider Isaac Newton the real core of the scientist foundation ((1687) and the dignity it has enjoyed, until today. ( but is being ruined) His belief in God and Granite ethics caused the Queen of England to conscript him into saving England from corrupt counterfeiters, and he did.

Progress in fields of math and physics and chemistry and other sciences continued to flourish.

The 1700s generally is considered the Age of Enlightenment, which was an intellectual stage of proclaiming the forward march of man. The leaders considered themselves as a courageous, superior group of intellectuals who were leading the world toward progress, out of superstition. It is thought that this was the foundation of the thinkers and artists. But in each situation, even in art, the struggle for independent meaning and identity went on.

Theoretically another category emerged; Romanticism, which was an extension of the enlightenment search. But these tried to find a unifying picture of the world, nature, science and in a positive element, that would bring a cohesive thrust to the forward momentum of mankind. Many artist sought the concept of the Universal; that is, some image that exuded the feeling of oneness with the cosmos. This went on from later 1700s to late 1800s. Besides the previous titles, a large title called, The Age Of Reason, was applied to these vast sections as well. Also within these timeframes in the 1800s is called the machine age then the 1940s 50s and forward The Atomic Age or Nuclear Age, Space Age, and onward to the digital age.

The great thing about Huxley is that he knew there should be something else, and that groping humanity had not, as a whole, found a direction. The arts and sciences are symptoms of a struggle. Each one, have philosophers, politicians, educators and music that proclaim that we are on the edge of discovery. Of course many people in each generation question the postulations of confident assertions. But they are dealt with as being out of touch. Many people thought WWI was the final war to achieve unity and peace.. and WWII as well. Right now, we are in the age of Fantasy Evolution. Since Newton, Science has lost its foundation, by increments. So now, the wildest claims are considered as fact regarding evolution and other ideas that are really in fragmented pieces belonging to sci fi; which require faith beyond reason. Having a struggle and finding no answers except things that give a momentary high, ( position, things, people~~ and in the end~ drugs) have led us often to despair. I'm pretty surprised that people listen to politicians that claim to be free thinkers and progressive. After going through my own dark night journey through the years, oddly enough, I dug into what Christ said and did, and how giving His Life.. transmits (kind of like an Avatar - but is a journey process) new life to us. I find that history is on a course, as humanity fights against God, will eventually amalgamate into a one world government with a fantastic leader- who is embodied by dark forces as the Anti-Christ.

Francis Marsden,4y,How did Martin Luther and the Scientific Revolution affect the hierarchy of the Catholic Church?,"I'm not sure why the questioner couples Martin Luther with the Scientific Revolution.

Luther had nothing to do with the Scientific Revolution. In fact his denigration of human reason as utterly corrupt, and concentration on faith alone, were more anti-scientific if anything.

For example, Lutherans were bitterly critical of Copernicus' “De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium”, -On the Revolution of Heavenly Bodies 1543 - because it seemed to contradict Scripture.

So long as it was just a theory, the Catholic Church wasn't that bothered.

Only in 1616 when Galileo started re-interpreting Scripture to fit the still unproven Copernican theory, did the Dominicans of the Inquisition target him and warn him off.

They in their turn may have been hyper -sensitive to Protestant accusations that the Catholic Church was unfaithful to Scripture. So in a way Luther pushed the Catholic Church in the direction of Biblical literalism.

Catholic theology holds that by the Fall, human nature and reason was wounded, but not utterly corrupt as Luther thought.

Catholicism therefore has always said that human reason and logic can help us to lead us to the existence of God (Aquinas' Five Ways, Anselm’s Ontological Argument, modern developments like the Fine-Tuning of the Universe and arguments from design).

Luther on the other hand stressed faith alone, believing against reason, accepting sola Scriptura etc. Catholic theology is broader and uses human reason much more.

Himanshu Mishra,2y,What was Thomas Kuhn's biggest contribution to philosophy?,"In the 1968 classic by Stanley Kubrick — 2001: A Space Odyssey — there is an iconic sequence, in which the hairy ancestor of the humans, having learned how to use a bone as a weapon, hurls it into the air. The next thing the viewers see is a spacecraft orbiting the earth. Much as I love this scene and feel that it is one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, I fear that its subtext is at least somewhat misleading. It emphasizes something many of us implicitly believe about science, that scientific enterprise is a slow but steady march towards the truth. Progress is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. It is imperative to understand how this particular belief took shape to appreciate Kuhn’s role in the development of philosophy of science.

Before Kuhn, the dominant scientific outlook was that of logical positivism. Logical positivists were a group of eminent scientists and philosophers who were supremely confident in the rationality of science and the ability of scientific method to reveal the hidden truths of nature. They believed that philosophy could be made equally scientific and held that philosophy of science should concern itself with studying the ‘context of justification’ (i.e., the methodology a scientist uses to prove his theory) rather than studying the ‘context of discovery’ (i.e., the actual historical process by which the theory was formulated). Furthermore, all scientific disputes could be solved by a dispassionate study of the observational data. Theories, after all, could be colored by one’s subjective biases, but data, if collected properly, were always objective.

Kuhn found this optimism on the part of positivists naive. He held that both data collected by the investigators and the theories proffered to explain them were affected by scientists’ whims and preferences, which are themselves a product of the cultural zeitgeist. And this was aptly demonstrated by the study of history of science, a field which could not be divorced from philosophy of science.

To this end, he identified a basic pattern of scientific progress: scientific progress consists of long periods of stasis, what Kuhn called ‘normal science’, and a period of scientific revolution, which led to overturning of old ideas, the ‘paradigm shift’.

One might wonder if these ideas are worth getting much worked up about. They are (or were, to Kuhn’s contemporaries), if you try to dig deeper into the philosophical basis of Kuhn’s arguments.

First is ‘incommensurability’ of scientific paradigms. Kuhn claimed that competing scientific paradigms are not just … well … competing, they are also incommensurable, i.e., there is no way that the ideas of the two paradigms can be conceptually translated. In effect, different paradigms speak different languages. Thus, Coppernican cosmology is incommensurable with Ptolemaic cosmology, and relativistic physics is incommensurable with Newtonian physics.
Second is ‘theory-ladenness’ of data. By this, Kuhn meant that it is impossible for the investigators not to contaminate the data they collect by their theoretical assumptions. When presented with competing data, they pick and choose the data to fit in with the paradigm they use to make sense of the world. It is not a matter of probability, it is a necessity since the paradigm defines the scientist’s whole worldview.

This is, in a nutshell, Kuhn’s thesis, presented in Kuhn’s seminal work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.

So, the question is, what the heck is Kuhn trying to do? If data itself is theory-laden, how can two opposing paradigms be compared. There is no neutral ground whence to assess their claims. The only inference is that scientific change is irrational, isn’t it?

No, says Kuhn, that would be an incorrect reading of his work. Science is remarkable because it has the ability to fundamentally change the set of assumptions that inform our worldview, but the positivist conception of rationality of science is too demanding. Science can’t be separated from scientists, and scientists are, fortunately or unfortunately, all too human.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lbaw45ethdmi1j0u', 'title': ""What was Thomas Kuhn's biggest contribution to philosophy?"", 'score': {'original': 0.4952, 'ai': 0.5048}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In the 1968 classic by Stanley Kubrick — 2001: A Space Odyssey — there is an iconic sequence, in which the hairy ancestor of the humans, having learned how to use a bone as a weapon, hurls it into the air.

Krish V Nair,1y,Why haven't we witnessed any ground-breaking scientific revolution in the recent past?,"Well, my friend, I cannot quite agree with you on that. Maybe, in order to be on the same page as you on this topic we should consider answers to a few fundamental questions.

What is meant by the ‘recent past’? Is it a decade or a century?

What can be called ‘ground-breaking’?

Do you consider only discoveries that translate into gadgets that use the technology that is a spin-off from that discovery?

Assuming that you are discussing the past couple of decades, we have had several discoveries that have changed the way we live, but have failed to notice them because of the rate at which changes are coming. As an example, just look at the rate at which people have changed their mobile phones year after year as technology keeps leap-frogging. Compare it to 30 years back when a fixed line set remained remained as immobile as a piece of furniture for decades.

So, I am listing a few changes in the last couple of decades.

They are not necessarily in the chronological order and are not necessarily out in the market for reasons of infrastructure development.

Hyper-loop transport

Electric vehicles

Jet-pack

Advances in alternate energy like Solar power and Green Hydrogen

Youtube

Whattsapp

Higgs-Boson

Progress in astro-physics research like quasars, dark energy and gravitational waves

Artificial Intelligence

Last but not least, QUANTUM COMPUTATION.

Your perception of the slow pace at which discoveries are happening may stem from the fact that the fundamental changes (say like the steam engine and Pencillin) had a visible hence and a tremendous effect on society since from the bicycle which transported one at 30 k.m/hour, we had jet propelled aeroplanes that transported us at 800 kms/hour, a tremedous and noticeble change though they were separated by more than a century.

Scott Krager,Jan 15,How did Renaissance humanism shape the intellectual and scientific revolution?,"Renaissance Humanism was like giving society a giant mirror and saying, ""Take a good look at yourself.""

It refocused our perspective on human potential, value, and reason. Before this cultural rebirth, Europe was in a bit of a rut - we're talking about the Middle Ages, or as some wittily call it, the 'Dark Ages'. The dominant thought was heavily influenced by the Church, which put a lot of stock into divinity and the afterlife, rather than human capability or earthly matters.

So, when Renaissance Humanism waltzed onto the scene in 14th century Italy, it brought with it a posse of thinkers who were all about celebrating human achievements and potential. We're talking about the likes of Petrarch, Boccaccio, and later guys like Erasmus and More. They were the cool kids of their day, questioning established norms and emphasizing a return to classical wisdom.

Here's how Renaissance Humanism shaped the intellectual and scientific revolution:

Adios, Middle Ages: Humanism was like a wake-up call. People started to dust off old Roman and Greek texts and say, ""Hey, these ancients were onto something."" This 'ad fontes' or back to the sources approach encouraged a critical spirit and respect for antiquity, essentially booting the Middle Ages mentality out the door.
The Dignity of Man: Humanism brought the idea that humans aren't just pawns in a divine comedy. Instead, we are capable of greatness. This focus on individual potential led to new forms of expression in art, science, and literature. It's the difference between living just to punch your ticket to heaven and actually wanting to make your mark on earth.
Enter the Renaissance Man: The Humanists' philosophy encouraged well-rounded education. Scientists began to see connections between different disciplines, fostering a breed of thinkers who were as comfortable with poetry as they were with physics. This kind of thinking pumped the gas for guys like Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo, who weren't afraid to cross lanes in their drive for knowledge.
Question Everything: Humanism was rebellious in a scholarly sense. The Humanists' methods demanded critical thinking and evidence, not just blind faith. Scientific inquiry benefited because people started to use observation and experimentation instead of just taking someone's ancient word for it.
Fanning the Flames of Reformation: Humanism indirectly set the stage for the Reformation. By emphasizing the individual's access to reason and texts, the monopoly of the Church over knowledge was challenged. This helped breed a scientific environment where people felt more comfortable questioning authoritative texts – including the Bible.

So you see, Renaissance Humanism didn't just nudge the intellectual and scientific revolution; it practically set the stage and yelled ""Action!"" Sure, the Renaissance had its fair share of funky tights and questionable hygiene, but when it came to empowering the human spirit to question, explore, and innovate, it was a rockstar. And the ripple effect of that still defines our modern world.

And if we're talking about getting back to sources, I do it quite literally out here in Portland, OR. There's nothing like a stroll along the Willamette River or a hike in the Columbia River Gorge to refresh one's appreciation for the natural world and the human capacity to understand it. After all, the greatest thinkers of the Renaissance drew inspiration from the world around them, and I like to think we can do the same.

Luboš Motl,3y,"The Scientific Revolution gets influence from Copernicus (Polish), Brahe (Danish), Kepler (German) Galilei (Italian), etc. Does history know of any great Bohemian or Moravian people of similar scientific thinking/influence?","Others have listed some important scientists born in Czechia. Some of them were ethnic Germans (like Ernst Mach and Gregor Mendel), others were Czech. None of them was as crucial for the history of physical sciences as Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, and Galileo.

A statue of Kepler and Brahe near the Prague Castle, see Mapy.cz

But what is being neglected is that 2 of the 4 “really great men” in the list actually worked in Prague: Kepler and Brahe. Tycho Brahe
 spent the last 4 years of his life (1597–1601) in Prague (an exile for him!) as the imperial astronomer. It was decades after his most famous work. But he built an observatory in Czechia.

On the other hand, Johannes Kepler
 lived in Prague in 1600–1612 with similar jobs and he did present his famous laws of planetary motion (and other things) over there; Prague was arguably the most important place where he worked (and Graz was second). These two men collaborated for a year, Brahe’s premature death remains the subject of speculations (some chemistry was involved; and Brahe had an artificial nose whose details are not understood) and Kepler himself remains a suspected murderer of Brahe.

Around 1600, Prague was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire again and it lived through the last decades before the Czech Protestant elite was eliminated and the Czech nation generally suffered a huge setback.

Aside from 1350 or so (Charles IV, the “greatest Czech” from the polls) when Prague was also the HQ of the Holy Roman Empire, the years around 1600 may be considered the “peak of Prague” and the city’s being the home to this genuine world-class research was a sign of it. The emperor in 1600, Rudolph II of Habsburg, was a quirky man who loved arts, sciences, and pseudosciences – and ignored the work needed to grow the empire. Depending on the priorities of the referees, he may be judged positively or negatively. I would surely give him thumbs up.

But my point is that at many moments, Czechia and Czechs were good at attracting the talent. In some sense, the invitation of a large number of the ethnic Germans to Bohemia and Moravia – which included guys like Mendel, Mach or Porsche – was an example of this tolerance (and respect) of the Czechs for the foreign talent, too. Czechia always had the tendency to remain open, especially on the Western side, and attract people who seemed admirable and skillful.

Again, note that Brahe was in exile. In some limited sense, so was Einstein when he got a professor job in Prague – but not elsewhere. Einstein realized the importance of the “equivalence principle” that led to the general theory of relativity (his theory of gravity) while in Prague. In 1937, when the urgent threat of Nazism was already obvious to the Czechs, Czechoslovakia gave the – already most abandoned – Nikola Tesla a medal: Nikola Tesla receiving the Order of the White Lion from Czechoslovakia from the Tesla Universe Image Collection","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lxi6qowyd5kngv70', 'title': 'The Scientific Revolution gets influence from Copernicus (Polish), Brahe (Danish), Kepler (German) Galilei (Italian), etc. Does history know of any great Bohemian or Moravian people of similar scientific thinking/influence?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Others have listed some important scientists born in Czechia.

Sumit Awana,7mo,Why is the Scientific Revolution important to world history?,"The Scientific Revolution is one of the most significant turning points in world history because it marked a fundamental shift in human understanding of the natural world. This period, which roughly spanned from the late 16th to the 17th century, laid the foundation for modern science and profoundly impacted various aspects of human life. Here are some reasons why the Scientific Revolution is essential to world history:

Breakdown of Traditional Beliefs: Before the Scientific Revolution, much of the Western world relied on ancient Greek and Roman teachings, as well as religious dogma, to explain natural phenomena. The revolution challenged these established beliefs and encouraged people to question authority, leading to a more critical and empirical approach to knowledge.
Development of the Scientific Method: The Scientific Revolution introduced the scientific method as a systematic way to investigate and understand the natural world. Scientists such as Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton made pioneering contributions to this method, emphasizing experimentation, observation, and the formulation of testable hypotheses. The scientific method became the cornerstone of modern science and remains central to scientific inquiry today.
Advancements in Astronomy and Physics: During this period, significant breakthroughs were made in astronomy and physics. Copernicus's heliocentric model of the solar system, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation revolutionized our understanding of celestial bodies and the laws governing their movements.
Dissemination of Knowledge: The invention of the printing press in the 15th century played a crucial role in disseminating scientific ideas. Books, pamphlets, and scientific journals became more accessible to a broader audience, allowing the rapid spread of knowledge and the cross-pollination of ideas across borders.
Encouragement of Empirical Observations: The emphasis on empirical observations and evidence-based reasoning encouraged the collection of accurate data and led to advances in various fields such as biology, chemistry, and medicine.
Technological Progress: Scientific discoveries during this period directly contributed to technological advancements, such as improved navigational instruments for seafaring, more accurate clocks for precise timekeeping, and better optics for telescopes and microscopes.
Influence on Enlightenment: The Scientific Revolution's principles of reason, evidence, and skepticism laid the groundwork for the Enlightenment, a period in the 18th century that advocated for individual rights, liberty, and the application of reason to all aspects of life, including politics and governance.
Shaping Modern Worldviews: The Scientific Revolution led to a more rational and secular worldview, shifting the locus of authority from religious institutions and ancient texts to scientific inquiry and empirical evidence. This intellectual transformation played a significant role in shaping modern societies and their approach to knowledge, education, and progress.

Hence, the Scientific Revolution was crucial to world history as it paved the way for the Age of Enlightenment and modern science, drastically changing how humans understand and interact with the natural world. Its legacy continues to influence and shape the course of human progress and development to this day.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vfwdx1sg40tm9y7n', 'title': 'Why is the Scientific Revolution important to world history?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The Scientific Revolution is one of the most significant turning points in world history because it marked a fundamental shift in human understanding of the natural world.

Gerold Firl,3y,"Why was Italy at the center of the Renaissance, but not for the scientific and industrial revolutions?","“The Renaissance” is overrated. If we compare the achievements of the Italian Renaissance in the 15th - 16th Centuries with what happened in the 13th Century Enlightenment (approx. 1150 - 1300) the “Renaissance” comes off a poor second best.

Compare the beauty and daring of Gothic architecture to the archaic recycling of classical styles with cherubic ornamentation:

From: Gothic architecture - Wikipedia
 (Gloucester Cathedral)

From: Chartres - Wikipedia
 (built 1193 - 1250)

Gothic was a completely original style of architecture, combining mastery of structural engineering and aesthetic beauty of the highest level. Renaissance architecture is clunky in comparison:

From: San Lorenzo, Florence - Wikipedia
 The great Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi created a more attractive interior, but compare the ponderous linearity of the trusses with the soaring beauty of Gothic:

From: Filippo Brunelleschi - Wikipedia

It’s an attractive design to be sure; but that flat ceiling is so 5th Century.

Renaissance Italy certainly produced many beautiful works of art in painting and sculpture, although the Netherlands was ahead of Italy when it comes to painting. Sculpture was another matter; there Italy led the world. Carrera marble and the classical tradition of Greece made Italy supreme in this art, but it’s really the only one.

The question, however, was why Italy produced beautiful art in the Renaissance (say 1400 - 1600) yet lagged when it came to science, enlightenment and industry; the answer is simple.

The Roman Catholic Church was responsible for both the high-quality art and the dearth of innovation. The Church was rich; it funded artists like Michelangelo. (Arguably he could have done even better work if he hadn’t been monopolized by religious themes however.)

The Church was extremely conservative. When a scientist like Galileo threatened theocratic despotism he was threatened with torture and forced to recant. It wasn’t until the Catholic dream of Total theocracy was finally crushed by the Thirty Years War than the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution could begin. But that all happened outside the reach of the Church.

Arch-conservatives work to preserve the status-quo at all costs.

Baba Vickram Aditya Bedi,1y,Did the scientific revolution happen outside of Europe?,"The Scientific Method not only existed in Ancient India, but the concepts of Zero, the Decimal System and numbering system used today around the world all came from Ancient India.

There is a myth which has been perpetuated that the “Scientific Method”, was only discovered in Ancient Greece and formed a unique reason for the ascendency of Western Europe, after it’s rediscovery during what is called the “Renaissance” period. Yet the discovery of what constitutes the Scientific Method can be documented to have come about 300 years before any mention of it in Ancient Greece. In Ancient India a philosopher lived in the 6th Century B.C. by the name of Aksapada Gotama, who formulated the “Nyaya Sutras”, the word “Nyaya” in Indian Sanskrit means “Analysis”, and hence the work deals with the methodology of how to deal with an object and the elements which need to be put forth logically. Below are the elements of the methodology he referred to.

1. Pratyaksha (Perception), The recognition of objects based on their appearance, hearing them, tactile sensations, aroma, and interaction with one’s own mind.
2. Upamana (Comparison), How one understands the object and what is compares to. A person may look at a Tiger and realize that in every attribute it resembles the humble house Cat, and a relationship is thus inferred. A person who has never seen either animal, hence should be explained the comparison, but not before being given a detailed description of how to identify them. Hence comparison is based on actual facts which are graded by importance and not on opinions or superstitions.
3. Aptavakya (Testimony), The hypothesis a person has developed has to be tested in relation to other established ideas. Of course, if it is proven that an object and or theory has never been identified before the comparison can only be made by singular testimony and reasoning. If the object is similar to other objects or the theory is similar but different in certain areas, the basis for that would be brought up in the perquisite comparative study. Hence. the idea of producing a testimony in such a case is to create a background and source for the object and or theory.

The concepts of the curvature of the Earth, the rotation of the Earth around the Sun were concepts Indian philosopher and mathematician Aryabhata narrated in his works in the 6th century.

In comparison much of the Greek “Scientific Method”, came three centuries later and it attributed much of its gains to overcoming the idea of “hidden hands”, being responsible for object properties or events such as disease. Observation was tempered by deductive logic. However, the idea of religion and philosophy related to it continued to a great extent in influencing the conclusions they made in many areas. Indian Scientific reasoning by comparison also used indicative logic and hence the Greek leaning on deductive logic made their methodology less suited for the discovery of the medicinal uses of many objects, and here Ancient India had a clear advantage. However, the Ancient Greeks like the Ancient Indians did make great strides in mathematics and their contribution though compared with Ancient India has its own place in human history. Certainly, after Alexander of Macedon’s invasion into Northwestern India there would be an overlap between both civilizations and meaningful exchange of concepts.

Sushruta Samhita would perform both Plastic Surgery and Cataract removal in the 6th Century B.C. in India. His works would be largely more advance than 19th century procedure.

The concept of the “Paramanu” or “Atom” was first attested to in the 3rd Century B.C. by Indian philosopher Kanada. He would state in his narration on the subject which is called the “Kanada Sutra”, the fact that all objects in the universe could be categorized to a certain point before simply reaching the level of atoms. At this level he would theorize that division of the atom was not possible by natural means. He also theorized the concept that these atoms had two states one of rest and one where they generated heat. His ideas seem incredibly modern if not completely proven to be accurate.

In the 12th century India would be the first to smelt Zinc, via the process of distillation. It was an important advance in metallurgy. The Persians had attempted to do so but failed, images above from Zawar, Tili Valley, Rajasthan, India.

The first globe cast without seams was done during the reign of Emperor Akbar in the 1580s. Lukman, of the Kashmir Valley would use a lost wax method of producing the masterpieces. One would be rediscovered during the 1980s ending the doubt that a globe could be cast without seams. The method is being used again today in India and the world.

Known as the Mysore Rocket, India in the 1770s had developed the world’s first surface to air missile which could travel 1.5 miles. The British East India Company would be taken by surprise when these were used by Indians trying to defend themselves from being colonized during the 1780s, under the leadership of Tippu Sultan who became known as the “Rocket man of India.” Their use would bring victory to the Indian side during the 1780s before the British in turn copied them for their own uses.

Ken Leith,2y,Which material sparked a technological revolution?,"Over the course of recorded history you could make a case for several materials. Not in exact chronological order, or ranked in importance, which would be highly subjective, I would suggest that the following all sparked some enormous changes ….

Smelted copper, our first metal. Leading to trade, civilization, weapons and a host of transformations in the survival of Man.

Bronze. They named an Age after it ...’nuff said

Paper and its manufacturing processes. A core technology of the modern world. From China to Europe it replaced vellum and becomes eventually the medium for printing from books to currency.

Potassium and its compounds. They start a chemical revolution with downstream uses in fertilizer and gunpowder. Took 1500 years to get from potash to factory manufacturing. Huge impact on the modern world. Weapons and food. Pretty big impactors on modern society.

Aluminium, from a lab creation to ubiquitous aircraft frame in just 90 years… it shows how new materials are moving more and more quickly from discovery to industrial usuage to major change multipliers on Civilization.

Carbon Steel. From Damascus steel to stainless steel to high tensile chromium steel and now hundreds of todays special alloys. From skyscrapers to rockets to drill bits. A materials revolution.

Glass….and you could break this down further into blown glass, plate glass, tempered glass and various metallic glasses. So in general amorphous solids of various types. Perhaps as large an impact as steel in terms of a tech material.

Plastics. Such a huge topic. Pick a polymer and you could argue for or against. Nylon is great in clothing or maybe not. Plastic bottles are great, or they are a scourge. Modern life needs polymers and the many products created by this hydrocarbon product. Whether you like the results depends on your biases. From an adoption cycle it took less than 30 years to be part of everything. Now we are seeing plastics effect a sustainable product cycle and a recycling cycle. Truly a material that must be controlled from manufacturing to destruction.

Graphene. From exfoliating graphite to large scale manufacturing of reduced graphene oxide solutions, to carbon vapor deposition of pristine thin film materials in about 12 years. Now we get a revolution of 2 D materials from Boron nitride to Moly disulfide to MXenes to stacked materials. I am going to suggest that this material revolution isn't just the 2D version of graphite or a flattened out carbon nanotube. Rather it is the entire thin film revolution. From 3D artificial diamonds being the state of the art, to Silica chips in fabs for computing, to more exotic assembled 2D meta material we observe more and more control over the assembly of atoms. This trend is the creation of specific materials with specific electron band gaps and specific strengths for a specific use. So I will call it the era of designer materials. We now can design a new material for a novel purpose and bring it from lab to industry in about 5 years…

So our current state of affairs is that hundreds of technological revolutions and downstream industrial and retail usages are being created each year, right now, by a stacked material. As a designer material they will all be pretty amazing. Maybe as important in the future as paper or glass was to our past.

OK, my last and most current material. Proteins.

The computational revolution is now allowing us to model protein folding. As a result we are able to deaign proteins to perform specific tasks. With gene editing tech ( e.g. Crisper Cas 9 or 12) etc. We can manufacturer proteins using the biological factories of e-Coli and other bacteria. RNA inserts give us the ability to make self replicating materials. I deem these to be in the same playground as the previously discussed materials. Here the micro and nano materials worlds allow us to use the world of proteins and their staggering complexity in folding and information storage to make the most impactful materials ever. Just as knots store information in the number and complexity of the bights so do proteins. So they can serve physical and information systems as both a material with data and catalytic impact.

As computational biology continues to advance, i would argue that proteins will be the next great material. As useful as a designer 2D material but with a lot more latent information storage capacity.

Of course, in conclusion, Nature got to it first….luckily for us there isn't a patent on Nature's bounty. But we would be wise to observe Nature closely and avoid screwing up the product. Natural systems are hughly complex and interrelated.

Walter D. Petrovic,2y,How does Shelly use Frankenstein to address the social concerns of the scientific revolution?,"I would love to answer this completely, but at this point, I don’t want to write a book, although this answer will be a bit lengthy.

You need to understand European, and to some degree, world history, in order to address your question and give it some sense, within the framework imposed by the era, in which “Frankenstein” was written.

The book was written in 1816. Over the previous 100 years, there had been a remarkable blossoming of scientific study, research, and knowledge that began to circle the planet, reaching almost every known remote spot, and making inroads that Christianity took spreading across the earth over 1600 years.

In 1687, Newton outlined scientific principles dealing with motion and gravity, and a few other “discoveries” including that of calculus. In 1752, Ben Franklin was goofing around, flying kites in lightning storms, in an attempt to understand electricity. In 1859, the discoveries continued until religion itself came under closer scrutiny when Darwin published his “The Origin of Species”.

Any well-read intellectual would have been familiar will all the changes that had taken place up to 1816, and it was inevitable that someone would write something as a warning that playing God would eventually lead to some human disaster. Mary Shelly’s “Frankenstein” was such a warning. Here is a doctor and professor who wanted to see if he could recreate the spark of life and reanimate a body that was constructed from dozens of dead people.

Doctor Frankenstein’s creation was never named, in the book. As far as the reader would be concerned, the creation was an abomination, and so was its creator, and there was no distinction made between the two after the successful reanimation was performed, and especially after the death of the innocent young girl, at the hand of the “monster”. This prejudice against Frankenstein’s creation was an off chute of the general prejudice towards European Jews, and Jews in general. There were already stories of Rabbinical Magicians that created creatures called Golem, that were supposed to protect towns and villages where the communities were predominantly Jewish. Frankenstein, although not specifically spelled out in the story (if I recall), was still given a clearly Jewish name, in order to stoke the fear and hatred that most Christian caucasian Europeans had towards the Jews.

The entire notion of the “monster” killing innocence, played into this idea that Jews were cannibals and sacrificed children, to their god. Of course, the entire population of the village, near Doctor Frankenstein’s laboratory came out to wreak their vengeance upon him and to kill his creation. Eventually, there was a purifying of the earth again, with Christianity, when the “monster” was burned to death.

Destroy what isn’t understood. Stomp on any idea that is new, and at all cost deny any scientist the ability to play god….especially if they’re Jewish. This is the message behind “Frankenstein”.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/df1pcv8iqxjw326g', 'title': 'How does Shelly use Frankenstein to address the social concerns of the scientific revolution?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I would love to answer this completely, but at this point, I don’t want to write a book, although this answer will be a bit lengthy.\n\nYou need to understand European, and to some degree, world history, in order to address your question and give it some sense, within the framework imposed by the era, in which “Frankenstein” was written.\n\nThe book was written in 1816.

C. (Charles) Michael Turner,Updated 3y,What is the “next Einstein” working on right now?,"Thank you for asking, Lol, I am currently working on a method to measure the lateral movement of a continuiously radiating wave laser beam to determine if particle wave duality is because when a photon leaves an atom its instantly 680 million miles an hour and has particle wave duality, maybe the little photon is riding a continually radiating field? By changing General Relativity from a stationary field with gravitational potential and infinite range to a radiating field obeying Newton’s three laws of motion, all the actions of the universe can be mechanically explained and the formula connecting mass, photon energy and space is the following phase change-

S=ec^3=mc^5 it’s a volume decay of a single photon at the magnetic dipole of all mass as all mass stays in static equilibrium with two processes happening at the same time.

If the singularity contained mass, energy and space as total energy of the universe then as space increases (the radiating gravitational field) and mass stays in static equilibrium with two processes happening at the same time then photon energy must decrease.

Under this version of the universe, each galaxy or cluster has a constant force of expansion and alignment with a continuously decreasing overall mass because a galaxy is the endpoint of spacetime production.

Place two balls of string 3 meters apart against the wall and tie the two free ends together in the middle and walk away holding the two free ends.

Gravity and dark matter actions are seen as the two balls of yarn come together - Newton’s third law, and the two balls of yarn continue to increase in acceleration until they are all string. This is Newton’s second law: dark energy.

By understanding that there are no exceptions to using energy to create a force, this corrects any perpetual motion machines such as the four fundamental forces.

So by moving a continuous wave laser beam laterally to a mirror, the first photon back to a timer should only take 1/2 the time it would to sent a pulse there and back.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mah6d1k5uo9ni3xs', 'title': 'What is the “next Einstein” working on right now?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Thank you for asking, Lol, I am currently working on a method to measure the lateral movement of a continuiously radiating wave laser beam to determine if particle wave duality is because when a photon leaves an atom its instantly 680 million miles an hour and has particle wave duality, maybe the little photon is riding a continually radiating field?

Nasar Mannan,3y,What is the first revolution in science?,"Seven hundred and fifty verses of the Quran (almost one-eighth of the Book) exhort believers to study Nature, to reflect, to make the best use of reason in their search for the ultimate and to make the acquiring of knowledge and scientific comprehension part of the community's life.

There are innumerable commentaries and expositions of the Holy Qur’an which have been written, and which will be written in the future, but it is impossible to encompass its contents and give a gist of them because the truths revealed in it are endless and its wonders shall not cease till the end of time.

Do you not see that Allah sends down from the clouds water, then brings forth with it fruits of different kinds (or colors). And in the mountains there are streaks, white and red, of different colors, and some intensely black. And of people and animals and cattle there are different colors likewise. Only those of His servants fear Allah who possess knowledge. [35:27-28]

The Qur’an has mentioned in the above verses the diversity of colors as evidence of the existence of God and His power and wisdom. The theory of colors is further expounded by the following verse of the Holy Qur’an, where Allah says,

Hast thou not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky, and causes it to flow in the form of streamlets in the earth and then brings forth thereby herbage, varying in its colors? Then it dries up and thou seest it turn yellow; then He reduces it to broken straw. In that verily is a reminder for men of understanding. [39:43]

The fact that this argument was given to the Holy Prophet at a time when not even the greatest philosopher or scientist knew the nature of colors is a magnificent sign of the Holy Prophet's truth. There are many hidden meanings to the above verses;

wa min al-jibali judad-un biz-un wa humr-un mukhtalif-un alwanu-ha wa gharabib sud --

“And in the mountains there are streaks, white and red, of different colors, and some intensely black.”

Wa: The ""and"", with which these words begin, is considered by the commentators of the Quran to be the kind of ""and"" which introduces a new subject (wa musta'nifa), so that these words are thought to have no connection with the preceding words: ""Do you not see that Allah sends down from the clouds water..."" But usually ""and"" is used to show a connection between the preceding and the following words, the kind of ""and"" which is called wa 'atifa. On the basis that there is a connection between the two sets of words, this turns out to be an explanation about colours which is entirely in accord with present scientific knowledge.

The word wa occurs twice more: ""white and red"", ""and (some) intensely black"". The first is again the ""and"" of connection, but it is the kind which ""refers the particular to the general"", i.e. red is a particular case while white is general. The ""and"" in the words ""and (some) intensely black"" is the kind of ""and"" known as wa mugha'ira, which excludes black from the category of colors. This fact is not even now known generally, but only to the learned ones.

Min (""And in the mountains ...""): If this particle means ""from"" indicating the source of something, as it can do, this sheds further light on modern discoveries about colors. Even if taken as meaning ""in"", it expresses the power and wisdom of God.

Jibal: This is generally applied to mountains. The effect and influence of colors may be particularly seen in mountains. Sometimes the word jibal denotes something which is of great power and worthy of honor. Jibal here indicates the grandeur, power and abundance of the thing which descends from the sky bearing colors.

Judad: Tracts, paths, streaks, that which is fast moving -- all these meanings disclose something about modern discoveries regarding colors and light.

Biz: the word ""white"" in plural. This word is evidence of how perfectly aware of colours the Arabs were, and testifies to Arabic being the perfect language.

Humr: the word ""red"" in plural. This is to show that there is not just one color red, but there are many shades and degrees of it. By mentioning red as the last of colors, and by ending with it ""different colors"", the Quran has given a perfect description which can only be appreciated by those possessing knowledge.

Mukhtalif-un alwanu-ha (lit. their different colors): the pronoun their refers to both white and red. Observing this scientific miracle of the Holy Quran, a physicist will have to concede that it is the word of God. This refers to colors occurring in pairs, a discovery made only recently.

Gharabib sud: Intensely black. After mentioning ""different colors"", the ""and"" of exclusion (wa mugha'ira) is used to exclude black from the category of colors, so that the words amount to saying: there are streaks of different colors, ranging from white to red, and there are other streaks which are intensely black. These words show a deep knowledge containing a strong evidence for scientists. Not only is black not declared to be one of the colors, but its nature is fully described as well, and this is a shining proof of the Holy Quran being the word of God.

In the verses under discussion, a likeness and analogy is drawn between rain in the form of water and rain in the form of light which brings with it colors. There are three points of likeness:

The Divine bounty of rain and of light is the doer or subject.
The thing upon which rain or light falls is the object.
The fruits and the results produced are the action or consequence.

Both kinds of rain are likened to Divine revelation, and that is the real topic of discussion. It is meant to convey that Divine revelation is a similar kind of Divine bounty coming from above which falls on the “earth” of the human heart and produces spiritual consequences. Colors are related to the physical eyesight of man, while Divine revelation is related to his insight.

Ibn-alHaitham (Alhazen, 965-1039 CE) was one of the greatest physicists of all time. He 'enunciated that a ray of light, in passing through a medium, takes the path which is the easier and “quicker”. In this he was anticipating Fermat's Principle of Least Time by many centuries. He enunciated the law of inertia, later to become Newton's first law of motion. He described the process of refraction in mechanical terms, by considering the movement of ‘particles of light’ as they passed through the surface of separation of two media, in accordance with the rectangle law of forces-an approach later rediscovered and elaborated by Newton. Part V of Roger Bacon's ‘Opus Majus’ is practically a copy of Alhazen's optics.

The man who eventually made the discovery was proclaimed the greatest man in the world in the very center of knowledge and learning. The inscription upon his gravestone read: ""Here lies buried the greatest man in the world."" Sir Isaac Newton was the man who in 1690 CE first discovered that white light which descends from the sky without any color.

By studying the languages of the world, which reflect the various phases and types of human civilization, one learns that the human conception of color has passed through seven stages:

In the beginning, color was not considered as something separate from the colored object.
At the second stage, the idea of light and darkness developed.
Then, besides black and white, the concept of red came into existence.
At the fourth stage, the idea of the yellow color was born.
Then green began to be considered as distinct from yellow.
At the sixth stage, the concept of blue came into being.
Sir Isaac Newton, at the seventh stage, put forward the theory of seven different colors.

But even this view is now considered to be the outcome of very deficient knowledge because the number of colors has at present reached about ten thousand.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ydfptvs8ibk2oa7c', 'title': 'What is the first revolution in science?', 'score': {'original': 0.71593333333333, 'ai': 0.28406666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Seven hundred and fifty verses of the Quran (almost one-eighth of the Book) exhort believers to study Nature, to reflect, to make the best use of reason in their search for the ultimate and to make the acquiring of knowledge and scientific comprehension part of the community\'s life.\n\nThere are innumerable commentaries and expositions of the Holy Qur’an which have been written, and which will be written in the future, but it is impossible to encompass its contents and give a gist of them because the truths revealed in it are endless and its wonders shall not cease till the end of time.\n\nDo you not see that Allah sends down from the clouds water, then brings forth with it fruits of different kinds (or colors).

And in the mountains there are streaks, white and red, of different colors, and some intensely black. And of people and animals and cattle there are different colors likewise. Only those of His servants fear Allah who possess knowledge. [35:27-28]\n\nThe Qur’an has mentioned in the above verses the diversity of colors as evidence of the existence of God and His power and wisdom. The theory of colors is further expounded by the following verse of the Holy Qur’an, where Allah says,\n\nHast thou not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky, and causes it to flow in the form of streamlets in the earth and then brings forth thereby herbage, varying in its colors? Then it dries up and thou seest it turn yellow; then He reduces it to broken straw. In that verily is a reminder for men of understanding. [39:43]\n\nThe fact that this argument was given to the Holy Prophet at a time when not even the greatest philosopher or scientist knew the nature of colors is a magnificent sign of the Holy Prophet\'s truth. There are many hidden meanings to the above verses;\n\nwa min al-jibali judad-un biz-un wa humr-un mukhtalif-un alwanu-ha wa gharabib sud --\n\n“And in the mountains there are streaks, white and red, of different colors, and some intensely black.”\n\nWa: The ""and"", with which these words begin, is considered by the commentators of the Quran to be the kind of ""and"" which introduces a new subject (wa musta\'nifa), so that these words are thought to have no connection with the preceding words: ""Do you not see that Allah sends down from the clouds water..."" But usually ""and"" is used to show a connection between the preceding and the following words, the kind of ""and"" which is called wa \'atifa. On the basis that there is a connection between the two sets of words, this turns out to be an explanation about colours which is entirely in accord with present scientific knowledge.\n\nThe word wa occurs twice more: ""white and red"", ""and (some) intensely black"". The first is again the ""and"" of connection, but it is the kind which ""refers the particular to the general"", i.e. red is a particular case while white is general. The ""and"" in the words ""and (some) intensely black"" is the kind of ""and"" known as wa mugha\'ira, which excludes black from the category of colors. This fact is not even now known generally, but only to the learned ones.\n\nMin (""And in the mountains ...""): If this particle means ""from"" indicating the source of something, as it can do, this sheds further light on modern discoveries about colors. Even if taken as meaning ""in"", it expresses the power and wisdom of God.\n\nJibal: This is generally applied to mountains. The effect and influence of colors may be particularly seen in mountains. Sometimes the word jibal denotes something which is of great power and worthy of honor. Jibal here indicates the grandeur, power and abundance of the thing which descends from the sky bearing colors.\n\nJudad: Tracts, paths, streaks, that which is fast moving -- all these meanings disclose something about modern discoveries regarding colors and light.\n\nBiz: the word ""white"" in plural. This word is evidence of how perfectly aware of colours the Arabs were, and testifies to Arabic being the perfect language.\n\nHumr: the word ""red"" in plural. This is to show that there is not just one color red, but there are many shades and degrees of it. By mentioning red as the last of colors, and by ending with it ""different colors"", the Quran has given a perfect description which can only be appreciated by those possessing knowledge.\n\nMukhtalif-un alwanu-ha (lit. their different colors): the pronoun their refers to both white and red. Observing this scientific miracle of the Holy Quran, a physicist will have to concede that it is the word of God. This refers to colors occurring in pairs, a discovery made only recently.\n\nGharabib sud: Intensely black. After mentioning ""different colors"", the ""and"" of exclusion (wa mugha\'ira) is used to exclude black from the category of colors, so that the words amount to saying: there are streaks of different colors, ranging from white to red, and there are other streaks which are intensely black. These words show a deep knowledge containing a strong evidence for scientists. Not only is black not declared to be one of the colors, but its nature is fully described as well, and this is a shining proof of the Holy Quran being the word of God.\n\nIn the verses under discussion, a likeness and analogy is drawn between rain in the form of water and rain in the form of light which brings with it colors. There are three points of likeness:\n\nThe Divine bounty of rain and of light is the doer or subject.\nThe thing upon which rain or light falls is the object.\nThe fruits and the results produced are the action or consequence.\n\nBoth kinds of rain are likened to Divine revelation, and that is the real topic of discussion. It is meant to convey that Divine revelation is a similar kind of Divine bounty coming from above which falls on the “earth” of the human heart and produces spiritual consequences. Colors are related to the physical eyesight of man, while Divine revelation is related to his insight.\n\nIbn-alHaitham (Alhazen, 965-1039 CE) was one of the greatest physicists of all time.

For other readers, first, just to be clear on the term “Occult properties”;

“In Renaissance natural philosophy, occult properties – from the Latin occultus meaning “hidden” – referred to properties producing manifest effects such as magnetism and heliotropism that could not be causally linked to normal elemental mixture and their manifest qualities (such as the primary dichotomies of hot, cold, wet, and dry). Often termed “occult qualities” or “occult virtues,” occult properties were typically considered natural but acting in a manner that could not be empirically understood. Because occult properties existed beyond sensory perception, they were likewise considered potentially beyond intellectual comprehension, which ensured their central position in epistemological debates throughout the Renaissance.” [My bold], From:

The Occult Properties of the Qurʾān (Ḫawāṣṣ al-Qurʾān): Notes for the History of an Idea and Literary Genre between Religion and Magic in Islam In: Oriente Moderno
 Author: Giovanni Maria Martini

 Online Publication Date: 23 Apr 2021

Abstract Although the science of the occult properties of the Qurʾān (ʿilm ḫawāṣṣ al-Qurʾān) has been regarded by Muslim intellectuals as an independent discipline within the classification of the sciences and has generated an independent literary genre over the centuries, it has never been the subject of a specific survey within Islamic Studies. Often wrongly considered simply as a component of related disciplines, the most important texts belonging to this genre remain understudied and are not critically edited. Many reasons suggest that the study of the genesis of this concept, of the homonymous discipline and of its literary corpus represent an important desideratum for the history of magic and of the occult sciences in Islam. Based on philological examination of numerous primary sources, this article aims to situate the science of the occult properties of the Qurʾān and its literature within the History of ideas in the Muslim world.”

Bhanu Padmo,1y,What happened to occult properties in the scientific revolution?,"When was there a Scientific Revolution?

Yes, what you see as a revolution is at best a Business Revolution in which “implicitly saleable invention” has been made the human objective through propaganda and lies.

These implicit inventions are mostly mercenary inventions. Mankind needs benedictory invention, serving benedictory utility. It doesn’t need convoluting inventions arising out of selfish outlook.

Just as a listed ship deviates silently from its original course, mankind’s passage has been undergoing a furtive deviation since long.

How would you know the nature and magnitude of the past deviation from the unexpected island you arrive at after a long voyage?

Yes, you know it by its incommensurability with your original pre-voyage expectation. Does the new island provide average man an ambience of increased magnanimity, decreased fear of extinction, increased empathy for solidarity of humankind, increased satisfaction of longevity, increased rate of human evolution etc or is the new island full of colorful garbage making up an ambience of much reduced value?

The ends of all four legs of a table should be coplanar to be snug with the planar floor. The current development is like a table with its smallest and the longest legs measuring one foot and thirty feet. The situation is worse than just this, because the floor is currently being dug up to accommodate the unequal legs of the great table. That is to say, the value system is being destroyed to accommodate the Business Revolution.

Who would redeem the world if your science of mercenary inventions has caused it to come to this? Can you explain what made you choose such an evil science?

I think you should confess right away without much ado that you had been a fool.

With this prelude on your identity, we may begin to talk about the correlation between science and occult in which science would be the adventurer when occult would be its director. Listen to this story carefully.

All experiences consolidate into a worldview through explicit and implicit reasoning, complementary to each other.

Explicit reasoning is objective. Implicit reasoning is emotional, genetic, instinctive and intuitive. It is subjective.

Subjective or implicit reasoning comprises subconscious reasoning involving genetic-instinctive-emotional knowing and superconscious reasoning involving intentionality or dream.

Dream or intentionality constitutes of the “twin collateral mutually-corroborative universal goal-senses” viz. evolution-sense and happiness-sense.

The processes of value acquisition through the exercise of subjective reasoning is subjectivism and through the exercise of objective reasoning is objectivism.

Subjective reasoning is alternatively understood as apriorism when objectivism is alternatively understood as empiricism.

Deep apriorism is occult.

When the difficulty of deciphering subjectivism becomes acute, to some people it seems inscrutable and occult hits them as its alternative description – “supernatural, mystical, or magical beliefs”.

If you take worldview as a circle, most part of it is the contribution of subjectivism, apriorism or occult comprising genetic, emotional, instinctive and intuitive knowing.

Only a small fraction of the worldview is the contribution of objectivism or empiricism. This is the work of the marginal consciousness or intellectual consciousness and this contribution is by far overwhelmed by the combined contributions of subconsciousness and super-consciousness.

We may arbitrarily ascribe a ratio to the “subjective-objective make of the worldview” for the sake of propagating the discussion. This can be 100:1 to 1000:1 or even more weighing against objective knowing (marginal consciousness).

The new idea that the entity is mostly its genetics and marginally its intellect may help you grasp this make of your own worldview.

Science may be defined as “finding and consummating relevance”.

Coming back to the Table Analogy in which the table has grossly unequal legs (the shortest leg is one-foot long and the longest one is thirty-foot long), it wouldn’t be difficult to realize that relevance has been amiss for a long time and unnecessary augmentation of the longest leg has been a very wrong priority. In other words, science has been amiss for a long time.

If you broaden the definition of science further to make it “relevant and practical worldview”, occult and objectivism would be its components in the ratio of 100:1 to 1000:1, roughly speaking.

It is the occult-part (subjectivism, apriorism) which would experience the problem of the Absurd Table and would try to shift mankind’s attention from “augmenting of the longest leg and digging up of the floor” to “protecting the floor and making the table snug”.

We would say “yes” to Benedictory Science groomed by apriorism (the occult) and “no” to the Satanic Science which has been fooling us around since long in the name of empty objectivism and empiricism.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jnrd9lgviwc8ato1', 'title': 'What happened to occult properties in the scientific revolution?', 'score': {'original': 0.8108, 'ai': 0.1892}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'When was there a Scientific Revolution?\n\nYes, what you see as a revolution is at best a Business Revolution in which “implicitly saleable invention” has been made the human objective through propaganda and lies.\n\nThese implicit inventions are mostly mercenary inventions.

Nick Deakin,2y,How much earlier could the Industrial Revolution have begun on Earth under the right circumstances?,"In my opinion, there is only one civilization that is on a course to industrialization before the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, it is Minoan Crete but didn’t quite get there due to a cataclysm. It is the pace and course of technical innovation demonstrated that makes them a potential candidate for industrialization sooner. None of the later civilizations investigated machines in any significant way, they had slave labour, there was no motivation to invest in expensive machines which require very significant development before they become efficient and economically attractive. This said, when they did, the hockey-stick rise in outputs did result and the modern world is entirely dependent on this huge rise in efficiency (see chart). I need to give you some context for this to make sense. Progress isn’t continuous throughout human history, there are setbacks. This is a chart by Ian Morris (a History Professor at Stanford) that considers social development (energy-consumption, record-keeping, organization and war-making) over long time, the West is Egypt and East, China. We can see two pronounced dips in output: Bronze Age Collapse around 1200 BCE and around the time of the Roman empire, there is then a jittery slow recovery in the middle ages (so-called dark ages). My point is the best technology in antiquity was being produced by the Minoan islands is very broadly comparable with just before the Age of Enlightenment in Britain, just before the industrial revolution actually occurred!OK, I appreciate this is a ‘big’ claim and it requires evidence to support it, this is also hampered by there being limited archaeology relating to this time, the Minoans had the first syllabary based writing system in Europe from around 1900 BCE called linear A, although it is thought they used papyrus none of these records survive unlike Egypt where they did. Nonetheless, they left us art that would suggest the Minoans are studying at least Astronomy and the Earth at a scientific level. I’m not going to go into great detail, suffice to say they are recording the magnetic declination from around 1900 BCE, their buildings are aligned to magnet North from this time (they are exploiting naturally occurring iron— magnetite in the Bronze age), they appear to have defined the Great year as a 26,000-year cycle (which was not done to this accuracy to around the age of the enlightenment), they have optical lenses (precision ground rock crystals) and were possibly exploring the properties of light, for those doubting Thomas’ see the link for the archaeology and studies to support this:Nick Deakin · 7moWhat can we not understand about Minoans?There is a lot we do not understand about the Minoans. The written language, Linear A, is not recognized as any known or similar to any archaic language. A few words are recognized (deities, placenames and commodities), we don’t understand the language (the wider picture) or candidly its origin, it is a lost language branch, possibly a hugely old one. We can identify a few of the dots from the archaeological record, but how all these connect is difficult to say. There are generally too few to make a meaningful assessment. One of the few words we commonly use today of Minoan origin is ‘purple,’ after the murex dye that they invented, but most think it is from Phoenicia. The Minoans didn’t give away their advantages, so we get little insight from other cultures other than the goods they imported and occasional records usually relating to trade. Then there is an abundance of highly concentrated dots from archaeology and we don’t know what they mean! An example is hand-made clay figurines purposeful smashed at peak sanctuaries, we have no idea why? It is not like other civilizations such as the Egyptian, Sumerian or Classical Greek world where there is a huge body of written work we can refer to which gives context, all their papyrus records are lost to time. In the case of the Minoans, insight is virtually all based on the archaeological record, it requires analysis (which may not necessarily be correct) and what is mostly found is bric-a-brac, the few fine pieces that are very rare, hint to a sophisticated (for the time) technologically highly progressive society. I would summarise the Minoan society as:
1) Organised
2) Scientific
3) Commercial
4) Creative and
5) Lawful What I have described are the characteristics of their deities, respectively: Mother Earth (1), daughter Moon (2), twin and son, the Sun (3), and his consort Venus (4). The lawgiver is Minos (not shown but associated with 3) and is likely the ultimate authority (even over their deities), the thumb(5)! The fingers of the hand!  The Minoans are a new way of thinking that was introduced into Cyclades culture around 2,800 BCE. Cyclades culture at least according to the material art(efacts), should perhaps be considered Mediterranean island art, it suggests the islands were trading tool materials in prehistory. Many would consider this a classic example of Cycladic art.  This piece is actually from Sardinia, Ozieri culture. I’ve purposefully included this as perhaps the early Mediterranean island cultures should be considered more collectively and at least alludes to trade networks, which places the later Minoan civilisation in context. This is Cycladic culture, but you can see they are stylistically similar. The figures don’t have mouths (male or female). Mom’s the word. They look so modern and inspired the modern-art movement, these artifacts are dated from 3,200 BCE, just before the Minoans. The Minoans introduced new practices from around 2800 BCE which define the start of the culture. There is rapid economic growth when Palaces (administration buildings) begin to be constructed, ca 2,000 BCE.  Before this, mariners are moving tool materials such as obsidian (later metals), between islands that are used for distribution to the mainland ports from around 4500 BCE. The founders of Minoan Crete according to myth are considered to be the Dactyls (the fingers), that guard the Idaean caves where according to the seal below metal ingots [metallic money] are kept, and their sisters the Hecaterides being the other hand - Priestess. The thumbs: Herakles (a possible Minos) and High Priestess the Leaders of this society. They see things in these terms, note they are using unusually base 10 numbers (also used for internal accountancy), this I suspect is also related to hexameter verse, used for epics such as Homeric poems and by the Delphic Oracle (likely of Minoan origin), the metered language of statecraft. This seal is important as it puts Minoan society in context. The Minos, top right, is the thumb and law-giver - the ultimate authority according to the seal, the four deities (fingers), top-left branch. The four houses of priestess are shown bottom right which likely have functional duties aligned to their deities, but note a Griffon is shown as a finger, in this way the high priestess upholds the sacred laws. The Minos likely responsible for external affairs and the High Priestess the internal affairs of the island. There is a level of speculation in this paragraph! Without doing so, it is difficult to make any progress into how this society is actually structured, which is my main point!  An aside, if we assume that The Eleusinian Mysteries: The Rites of Demeter are based on the Bees shown above (Mother Earth and Daughter Moon or in Greek terms Demeter and Persephone/Artemis), then it may explain why initiates had no fear of death after they learned the secret. The Griffon protects long-time (the Great Year, a 26,000-year cycle, as mother Earth wobbles backwards throughout the Ages due to precession of the equinox, what may be pole stars are often presented on the Griffons wing which changes with the Ages), the other deities represent a shorter period of time well within a human lifetime: Earth day, Lunar Month, Solar Year and five visibility cycles of Venus (eight-years plus one or two days, I had previously thought nine was shown using inclusive counting, however, further review would suggest a Venusian and lunisolar calendars are maintained concurrently). People fear the unknown, but the Minoans understand Astronomy, they seek to better understand the cycles of life, nature! There is nothing to fear, each generation is an integral part of this process (humanity collectively). Do you see a throne or a model of the workings of the (inner) solar system and how this is observed by (Mother) Earth? As this story unfolds the Minoan visual language to express abstract concepts will I hope become more clear. See if you can identify features that may represent, solstice and equinox, the angular tilt of Mother Earth and even her processional period, and specifically a nine-year term in office.  Fig. 27. Photomontage of the north wall of the Throne Room. Prepared by and courtesy of Ute Günkel-Maschek. THE POWER OF IMAGES: RE-EXAMINING THE WALL PAINTINGS FROM THE THRONE ROOM AT KNOSSOS My own view is this is the chair for the high priestess, in charge of the priestess and internal resources of the island. Many have commented that the shape of the seat is more suited to a female. N.B. The place is constructed to observe natural order, noting the reference to their deities. Credit: Calendar House.  The Minos is the law giver, defending the island and accumulating metal ingots from trade and tribute. Neither the Palace’s (magazines) or Caves of Minos (treasury) may represent personal wealth but rather the island's (public) treasury but under their control. There is a lot of evidence to suggest investment in public works, such as sophisticated engineering works to bring water into the city and take waste away (Minoan hydroengineering is considered to be comparable with 18th-century common-era Europe). The Minoans are secretive, they don’t give away their advantage. We can see some technology transfer that occurs around collapse events (Thera eruption 1628 BCE, Mycenaen invasion 1450 BCE and Bronze Age collapse 1200 BCE; likely when some left to set up new colonies). Let's assess each of the four pillars (fingers) and leaders (thumbs) of this society and what we don’t know about each. With a focus on the administrators, the priestess (shown bottom-right) which left more in the archaeology record.  1). Organisation - The Priestess of Mater Theia (Demeter), Mother Earth - Winter, North and Earth day: I-DA-MA-TE Internal affairs are managed by the Priestess (bottom-right, far right being the embodiment of Mother Earth: the Mother Superior) with likely corresponding roles to their deities (top-left, the second figure from the left is Demeter), each can express a cardinal direction (North in this case), seasons (winter) and time of day (midnight), so possibly priestess of each house had corresponding geographic, seasonal or workshift duties in this society. The Mother Superior is likely shown behind the altar and possibly partner to the Minos, this is unclear. The etymology of Demeter being interesting, I-DA-MA-TE in linear A. It is an agglutinative language (glued together), it references Mount Ida and mountain caves are where they kept the metallic metal ingots as shown above. Using Indo-European root etymologies -DA means to divide. -MA is Mother and -TE wheat, in effect, Mountain Mother storing the islands (winter) Grain which can be summarised as: I - Divide - Mother - Wheat (e.g thresh it at an individual level, or take a proportion of it (tax) in administrative terms), this is possibly a much older belief system orginating in Anatolia at the cusp of the agricultural revolution, in this context the main axis makes more sense: female votive (Earth Mother) are associated with (gathering) grain, a male deity hunting (son). Sky Father seem to be silent but represents the wider Universe. I would argue that astronomy is much old. The Minoans see things in terms of continuing the generations (those shown with upheld hands). This may have been no hereditary King Minos and Queen, but King Minos is referred to in some accounts but maybe how other cultures and city-states describe Minoan leaders, other cultures would not have a term to describe what may have been leaders appointed on talent (by trials) with a limited term in office at this time, somewhere between a Kreterocracy (the strong) and Kritarchy (judges). Even the word etymologies seem to refer to Crete! Later Greek myth hints to this, ‘Minos was last to leave the Arena’ and ‘went to the Caves (Ida) to consult with Zeus every nine years (to bring in new laws),’ note the nine Olives of victory on the seal, Minos means nine and likely represents a Sar (half a Saros of eighteen year - the period between a lunar and solar eclipse) and possibly a term in office for the War-chief (Minos) and High Priestess (Mother Superior), noting the nine Olives of Victory associated with Minos on the seal and the nine solar discs (ridges) on the back of Mother Superiors chair in the palace of Knossos. There is some evidence that may suggest this convention originated in Anatolia in prehistory (by example - nine snakes (years) are shown on t-pillars at Gobekli Tepe which terminate at an Auroch (bull) - the Master of (Domesticated) Animals being implied - possibly the term for the leader of the hunt and the law-giver of the local tribes which came to feast at the site). A snake’s ribs are sufficient in number to count the days in the year, it makes a logical sign to express a year or the datum of when this was counted from marking the beginning of a new year and its end. This may suggest leaders were selected by a series of trials, by talent (there is wider but somewhat limited iconography that supports a gauntlet of military trials and selection process), both the Minos and Mother Superior may need to jump the bull to obtain (public) office. Is this a bull-leaper or a potential Mother Superior in charge of the Priestess?  If the high priestess, likely to be confident and talented: ‘strong’ leaders of external (Minos) and internal affairs of state (Mother Superior) and would be the world’s first republic (although appointment by talent rather than vote), though how each might of been selected is not known, however, a silver cup shows the last fourth trials to be a knife fight. The art alludes to leaders being appointed by a series of trials, it does not concretely confirm it. I get a sense of equality between the sexes, however, each has a clear role. Challenges and life are generally shown to be addressed as a couple. The frescos from Thera (Santorini) tends to suggest each gender was schooled separately, the boys in defence (e.g. boxing) and trade, and girls in nature and organization. Each seems to excel at what they do. Minoan art and artefacts are well executed, they take pride in their white hulled ships and the priestess are well organized, they are to use a modern-term professional. There is an unusual passage in the London Medical Papyrus (found in Egypt but thought to be of Minoan origin), this describes an acolyte explaining how her master would quell and overthrow Southern Egypt if provoked (e.g. trade stopped), it uses the analogy of bull-leaping to explain this, the Master composing himself as the bull charges and uses a firm grip to grasp the horns and the bull bucking their head to somersault over the challenge, to become leaders in this society, would you mess with the lady shown above? Minoan accountancy records are reasonably well understood, the Palace set quota for farms (which implies that they survey fields to establish potential crop yields), variance is monitored and carry over balances to the next accounting period (harvest). There appears to be a system of credit/deposit used by at least the elites, which are calling down commodities from Palaces magazines (stores) using personal seals and settled presumably at harvest or on payday. Recall that the four deities also represent periods of time, the Minoans have Gold Palace tokens which are in use from around 1800 BCE. Rosettes are used to represent any one of the four deities but are context-specific, when items are shown at the periphery in art it can mean to divide by the number shown, it is employed as a fractional denominator. So 1/2 Lunar month, confirmed by the 14 Earth days on the header: the bees! Please note the Minoans are the first to articulate a seven-day week, a moon phase. The deities assist this society in practical matters of everyday life, days, month, years and a term in office for the leaders. Please note this is particular piece is dated to around 600 BCE, but tends to suggest that the Islands continue Minoan accounting practice to some extent, the conventions of Earth day, Lunar month and fractions in iconography can be attested to Minoan times which specifically use these signs and conventions.  Many examples exist showing gold tokens being issued (so-called roundels) and are found in quantity in hordes (many in Mycenae), they likely represent work done, a month's salary (see below). These tokens do seem to be carried on the person, however, are often presented as jewellery (note the armbands in frescos, they are worn by men and women, these also show filagree counts defining days or weeks), I think it likely they are used for payments for big-ticket or capital items or to set up a Palace account at another location, which day to day items can then be called down against using personal seals. Many will have worked away from their homes (Sailors and Priestess assigned to a peak sanctuary) so seem to carry their wealth (money) with them. An important aspect of this is, is that the economy is pegged to actual work done by professional classes and value is unwritten in gold bullion, this is a great basis to build an economy, the gold standard. How extensive the use of Palace currency was is difficult to say, however, seems to include the Priestess and possibly the elites, landed and merchant classes. This suggests Palace administration had a basis for converting a commodity into Palace currency (a measure of work done), they are trading in city-state surpluses and each needs metal (see trade, the seven dots in a circle are likely the seven metals of antiquity— metal ingots), you can also see the petal motif (rosette, shown below on the Phaistos Disc, the first example of printing). Archaeologists generally assume that accounting records show quantities for a commodity if we assume that they have a base currency some may be showing a table of equivalence for exchange. These tokens which feature silk moths, bees or rosettes, facilitate quick transactions or could have been used to purchase stock in port to trade at other ports or pay crew! It is a brilliant instrument of trade, no weighing, just count the tokens. No material tests are needed. It is also likely they had assaying tests as did the Egyptians for gold purity, but you don’t need them with these, they're issued by the Palace, a trusted source. What an idea, for all practical purposes: money!  We just don’t know how sophisticated these systems were but allude to banking functions, with some accounting records to suggest, seed-corn loans to set up farms in the next growing year, an organised economy which is modelled on a bee colony, the island their food source, the Palace administration being the hive. The Priestess of Demeter (Queen bee) are likely planning to store sufficient grain to get at least the Palace, but possibly the island through the barren winter months and growing year through to the next harvest. The harvest is likely gathered or overseen by the Priestess of Potnia Theron (also a reference to Autumn, worker bees), collectively the Bees. Shortfalls would need to be made up through trade (Summer) and seed sown (spring), which perhaps is how what appear to be the four houses of priestess may have been organised (keep this in mind as the story unfolds). Each deity can refer to a cardinal direction, season or period of time, context gives the intended meaning. N.B. The first acknowledged silver coinage is from Lydia, coins are issued by the Temple of Potnia Theron (or ‘worker’ bees in Minoan terms, which we’ll look at next). Continuing with the Queen Bees colony…. We can see one of many underground grain silos outside the palace of Knossos and ‘hidden’ underfloor storage for more precious things in banks of palace magazines (two shown, there are many). People will have paid their tax in either goods or produce. The priestess kept Sacred Groves where likely specialist plants were cultivated, in the introduction to the London Medical Papyrus suggests healers were from the House of Potnia Theron (eloquently expressed as: “the moonbeams illuminates all pages”) or reported into these priestesses (and not Apollo which is normally associated with healing and medicine in later Greek tradition, unless it is those of the Master (Apollo) that are the medical practitioners and those of Potnia Theron (Mistress) that are responsible for the medicine cabinet - sacred groves, which were likely, not dissimilar to Kew Gardens, that gather seeds and plants from around the known world and cultivate them and NO-ONE is allowed to harm them, they are sacred, it's the islands medicine cabinet). What is shown below is commodity storage (grain bulks) and more precious things would be stored in magazines (included hidden underneath: treasury), but they seem to value (exotic) growing things just as much, such as saffron, murex for dyes, sea silk, honey (some of the first beehives) and controversially opium poppies which are likely stored in the pots above. Another possibility is that the priestess of Potnia Theron that look after female patients (noting this deity gives and takes female life) while those of Apollo gives (treats) and takes male life, in later traditions. Like many things in the Minoan world it is not entirely clear how the Minoans organised themselves.  Artifacts and frescos suggest at least a very good understanding of Astronomy (the Minoans have already defined most of the periods used on the much later Antikythera mechanism which can be inferred by fresco borders, here is a quick example: 49 lunar months are shown in the two horizontal borders, a four year Olympiad when they add an intercalated 13th month to keep the solar and lunar calendar aligned, the month possibly referred to as Ophiuchus (the Snake bearer constellation). The 14 verticle devices are likely referring to years, collectively a Saros cycle of 18 years (when all the celestial bodies return to their original position, useful to predict eclipses, which other artifacts suggest they could do). Splitting these in two graphic devices using the Minoan convention implies to divide the total into two - 18/2= 9 years (a reoccurring theme: a nine-year Sar or half an eighteen year Saros). I believe this slightly unusual convention is to show when a 13th month is to be added in a given year, every 2nd, 4th and 7th year in a nine-year Sar cycle to keep the lunar and solar calendar aligned.  Ophiuchus (the snake bearer constellation) is likely represented by the so-called ‘snake goddess’. Would you call the month the Olympic games celebrated a goddess? It's likely a symbol representing this celebration and likely used as a navigational constellation also (the snake bearer's elbow is similar to Orion’s belt but on the opposite side of the night sky). One male the other female, the Minoan seem to have this balance between genders but with clearly defined roles.  In my opinion, the so-called Minoan snake goddess represents the constellation of Ophiuchus giving the 13th intercalated ‘leap’ month inserted each second, fourth and seven year in a nine-year Sar cycle, the fourth year period giving an Olympiad, so it may be these leap months when games took place. Similarly, the so-called Poppy goddess is also another symbol associated with I-DA-MA-TE (Demeter). This house of priestesses directs the colony to ensure a winter food supply - the Queen bee, they likely work out of Knossos (noting this is to the North of Crete). 2). Science/Technology (the art of Science) - Autumn, West, Sunset, Month - The Priestess of Potnia Theron (Artemis or Mistress of Wild Animals) There are certain things in the archaeological archive which allude to the study of nature (Physics), we don’t know how scientific this was? There are NO written documents that record astronomy. There are myths of Herakles (thumb) and his brother (the Dactyls: fingers) introducing running races to the mainland, but that is all. There is a story behind the games, it's based upon an improved understanding of time using this visual language (it's difficult to ignore once you know it exists, it is constantly being referred to in art but gets overlook because its pretty, it also contains technical information usually relating to the Minoan calendar). Astronomy is all shown in artwork and artifacts, so what they actually know about astronomy can’t easily be concretely confirmed, we just see the correct periods being shown in art, NOT how they worked this out. The artifacts suggest it may be very advanced for the time, Minoans have devices to calculate astronomical periods, including eclipses using Saros cycles with 94% accuracy, in the 16th century BCE. This is a casting stone to make many copies in likely bronze. The lunar device is shown on the right, noting the first recorded use of a seven-day week with it (a moon phase), the lunar month device (right) flip-flops before advancing a position on the solar device on the left (allowing a 29.5 day synodic lunar month to be maintained by adding an intercalated day every alternative month - e.g. when the device flops before advance a position), a full rotation of the lunar device (right) around the solar device (left) being a four year Olympiad, years being given at quarters. It’s nowhere near as complex as the Antikythera mechanism but one can see there on a trajectory to a more sophisticated device. Critically this would allow an Olympiad of 49 and alternatively 50 months to be maintained. One at least gets a sense of a regularized calendar to emulate the movement of the celestial bodies (their deities).  My gut feeling (which is entirely speculative, is they may have experimented with water computers, a machine constructed by Daedalus was said to run on mercury, which is 13.5 times denser than water, to sequence and perform work as a weight turn a spindle for example, there is nothing in the archaeological archive to support this but is hinted at in oral tradition as automatons, moving ‘life-like’ statues). I would not underestimate Minoan technical ability, the myth of Daedulus’ hang glider describes a cambered wing with a tapered leading edge and elliptical trailing edge (in planform) and a minimum gliding sink rate of 1:18 (5 degrees), this angle is unambiguously referred to using Orion’s sword (star M42!) How on earth do they know this! This sink rate is about right for a trainer glider. Aero-engineers (which I am) jaws will drop on reading the orginal account, it requires some interpretation as they lack the modern terms to describe these things, but it's all described, they must have at least built a hand-launched model to understand flight performance and if you think they didn’t have the materials to build one, think again, they had the finest linen (AKA aerolinen - that the first aircraft used to skin wings) - Icarus is accredited with the sail, the Minoans built ultralight Sheilds using wicker cores, had tree resins, even turpentine solvents (to seal but beeswax would do) and the best leatherworkers, this is all you actually need! The account is truly jaw-dropping what is described is way before its time. It is likely both solar and astronomical observations were made at peak sanctuaries and if you look carefully note the measuring devices. Poles to align astronomical targets (stars) and mark their passage for timekeeping (this method also being used in Egypt at this time). Peak sanctuaries have a commanding view of both the shipping lanes and farms which area could be measured to set quota (and tax) confirmed by records (the numbering system - called Aegean numerals and commodities are reasonably well understood in Linear A although the language is not). Geometry in its first form is the study (measurement) of land area. Candidly at least one of the function for Peak Sanctuaries must have included astronomical observation, in all the depictions metrology (measurement) and instrumentation are shown.  There is a sense that Minoans wanted to understand the underlying rules of nature. It's extraordinary what they seem to know, changes in magnetic declination are recorded by building orientation (this alludes to Earth Science), this is confirmed by oral tradition the Dactyls are accredited with discovering the lodestone (compass) but this is generally accredited to the Chinese and much later in history. Magnetite is available on the island of Skyros. There are 34 markings on the periphery, recall that they use a convention of fractional denominators to divide by the number shown, so 1/34 x 360 degrees is 10.6 degrees. This is the declination from magnetic North to true North when the Kernos is dated to around 1825 BCE    . The main marking is orientated West to indicate the direction to True North. There is a significant change around this time and likely why this was being monitored, to inform maritime high sea navigation. This is what we would call today, Earth Science and it's being studied in 1800 BCE! Were the Minoans purposefully orientating their building to monitor changes in magnetic declination from around 1900 BCE or just using compasses to orientate their buildings?  Inspection of the Bulgarian ARC shows a large and rapid declination amplitude swing of about 16, from ~ 1850 BC, Declination = +18.56 0 to ~1770 BC. Declination = +2.580 (Kovacheva et al, 1998). We can see why they might be doing so below, there is a large change in magnetic declination around this time. This seems to be recorded at two sites East and West of the Mediterranean with differing declinations, it occurred to me that if they used this for building orientation, it is likely they had devices on ships and taking a reading at midday using a shadow stick would give them an estimate of their passage West or East. Not a great deal of evidence for this but that that exists alludes to this application.  http://maajournal.com/Issues/2011/Vol11-1/2_Downey.pdf Update: another found, in Iberia (using cup and ring markers):  Minoans had optical instruments. These lenses were found in a mountaintop cave. Their understanding of physics (an example of Minoan optics shown below) may well be comparable to that of the time of Newton, I would argue it could have been better, they will have been considering the motion of the planets for many centuries, not a single lifetime. They preserve a hugely old tradition of astronomy first recorded by artifacts from Çatalhöyük founded in the seventh millennium BCE and Tepe, yes, this tradition is that old and they use some of the same symbols recorded on some of the oldest stone tablets found at this site too, which are present in Vinca symbols (split wood was used to record linear incisions which are very similar to Linear A and with some identical symbols) and used around the Balkans around 5000 BCE which may be the parent writing system to Linear A and Aegean numerals.  In any event, they have the most advanced theoretic model of the solar system of the time. This point can NOT be understated and is difficult to ignore, although a degree of interpretation is required in evaluating Minoan art (which seem to refer to precise astronomical periods), some appear to greater accuracy than in the classic Greek period and arguably is comparable to that of the time of the enlightenment in Newton’s time. Conventions such as a week (lunar phases) and hours all seem to be shown way before history records they are ‘first’ defined, not in this case by the written record but in Minoan art! The device below often features in fresco borders and on altars of peak sanctuaries, it summarises their observable solar model, it has 12 petals (hours) on each side, 24 hours in the day, the spirals represent solstices (top and bottom) and equinox (middle spiral), there are 12 marks (hours) at equinoxes. A careful review of Tell el-Daba fresco fragments alludes to further subdivision into 5. This precedes the conventionally attested dating of the “Egyptian 24-hour” established in 127 BCE and the minute attested to Ptolemy in the 2nd century . The Minoans have a visual language to express astronomical concepts defining time. There are no written works to confirm this, just what appears at first glance to be ‘pretty” borders.  I’ve just realised what this fresco is referring to, its an eight-year Octaeteris with five visibility cycles of Venus! Each whole device is a year with two equinoxes of equal length of twelve hours. I have been intreged by when Minoan might have leaped the bull, it seems to be when an intercalated month is added, it needs to be done three times each Sar to keep the lunar and solar calendar aligned, I think this may be on the second, fourth and seven year. This may well have been shown in this fresco but as you can see it is missing many areas. What did they think was keeping the celestial bodies in orbit? They hint to gravity in family relationships, one deity (celestial body) is bound to the other (in orbit), the maiden daughter Moon to mother Earth, consort Venus to the Sun. Note the deities are expressed backwards, they do this when referred to the deities as celestial bodies (the organized ones) which do rotate and orbit counterclockwise confirmed in the frieze spirals (outwards) above. You can only tell the story chronologically, mother Earth then daughter Moon (with bow), son (Sun) and his lady consort (Venus), aligned with myth of the founding of Delos and birth order of Artemis and Apollo. The artist usually give hints but if they want to, for example, refer to seasons they would place the deities in calendar order. There must have been entire codex of mathematics, the study of the celestial bodies and astronomy and we know next to NOTHING about. What we have is art that confirms the correct number counts for astronomical periods without written proof of how this was determined.  Mother Earth giving a DAY, daughter Moon giving a Lunar MONTH, son giving a Solar Year and consort an eight-year Octaeteris of Venus. I have been trying to find the earliest reference so these deities can be attested, I found a similar scene, it shows the Love Birds (Son/Master and Consort) and Bees (Mother and daughter), although individual deities may be shown before this time in Anatolia. Catalhoyuk: ca, 5750 BCE (just before this settlement was abandoned). It is perhaps not as sophisticated as the Minoan system but seems to be the basis of the latter belief system. After this, we seem to have references to the Master of Animals (Apollo) and Mistress of Animals (Artemis), the twins (giving sun and moonlight): its needed at this time to make the Astronomical Age: Gemini (6000–4000 BCE) which appear just before sunrise on the spring equinox. My gut feeling is those from Catalhoyuk may have migrated to around Vinca which is founded at this time - they use similar iconography and calendar conventions, they may have moved to access this new tool material - copper is mined in high quantity. My gut feeling was a group from Catalhoyuk when across the Black Sea in search of these new materials (copper) which is confirmed by DNA studies, the Vinca live along side the hunter and gatherers, have the same funeral practices and somewhat critical use similar symbolism and take signs with them that become Vinca script which seems to encapsurate Aegean numbers.  What is presented as the Minoan religion, is based on observation (good science) and their deities are practical and underpin society, their deities are (or become) associated with the celestial bodies and they are more regular than clockwork, they define time (keeping). Their belief system is possibly based on a hugely old one (shown above when fully articulated), but earlier symbols and conventions can be traced back to the first calendar used at Göbekli Tepe and better qualified by artifacts from Çatalhöyük, alluded to by symbols used for Mother Earth (shown on the blouse tapes in the Demeter Fresco, shown later) and ‘H’, serif ‘I’, that may represent solstice and equinox, sometimes shown as reversed parenthesis )(, endure to Minoan times and are presented herein, in Luwian, its meaning is thought to be ‘god’ but the original meaning may be more; ‘natural order’, the repeated and observable cycles of life (the celestial bodies defining time). Another example is the Labrys - Wikipedia, it could well be a symbol of Minoan power, but it looks like an instrument to me, one can trace the technology transfer to Phoenicia which becomes straight-edged and eventually led to the Jacob's staff (the first recognized marine sextant). The axe heads can slide on the shaft which as you can see below have markings. The original device is more useful it can signal (flat copper plates riveted together, gold in some cases for smaller devices). Many have postulated its use, it both reflects light and casts a shadow. It may have been used for timekeeping and navigation, as well as having ceremonial significance, my own view is it became culturally significant as it was a useful tool.  There is line-of-sight between peak sanctuaries, Labyrs likely did have many functions, not least providing navigational fire beacons at night for the small wooden boats (less than ten oars, see below, Minoan white hulled ships are likely produced by Palace-controlled workshops and licensed, plain wooden hulls (non-Minoan) would be easy to identify to potentially duty, levied on shipping coming through their territorial waters - those with plain wooden hulls). The later Greeks did have signalling systems  (by example the fall of Troy is communicated to Argos by island fire signals within hours) and these may have earlier origin using simple flashes from these reflective copper mirrors (that are substantially flat being gravity cast into a thin sheet, they would be hopeless if used as an actual axe).  Today, the association of Zeus with lightning bolts is one of myth, however in a Minoan context, possibly identifies a) a critical process: lightning striking magnetite from Skyros to make it magnetized, a lodestone (compass) - if you have one, you can find more! and b) possibly a reference to Minoan maritime practice, the peak sanctuaries had all the optical tools to identify plain hulls on the horizon and if they are flashing signals to Minoan vessels to intercept, board and secure a proportion of cargo (duty), it could explain the myth. Peak Sanctuaries have often over 200kms unobstructed line of sight to the horizon (and to other peak sanctuaries) from a ship's deck this is limited to around 4kms. If the boarded were given a token (with Zeus' mark) so duty is only levied once, it may explain why Zeus became so revered, if he is taxing everyone passing through territorial waters. Like lightning, a ship sees a flash of light from a peak, the next thing a white hull intercepts and there is the thunder of a boarding party inspecting the cargo (somewhat god-like power). Lightning can be read as star-axe. The etymology of Labrys alludes to this ‘narrow street’ a beam of (reflected) sunlight.  Signals over huge distances may seem to be advanced for the time but there are early written accounts of this [5]: Then the lovely goddess wrapped his head up in a golden cloud, so from him
a fiery light blazed out. Just like those times when smoke from a city stretches all the way to heaven, rising in the distance from an island under siege by an enemy, where men fight all day long in Ares' hateful war, struggling for their city then at sunset, they light fires one by one, beacons flaming upwards to attract attention from those on near-by islands, so their ships will come to save them from [the] destruction that's how the light blazed then from Achilles' head right up to heaven. Iliad Book 18 Aeschylus writes in Agamemnon that fire signals were used to send the message from Troy to the city Argos of the victory by the Greeks (1184 BC ?). Only after a few hours the message reached the c. 600 km distant city of Argos. Evidence of the use of fires outside peak sanctuaries is widely reported in the literature. Large labrys of 3m in height are found and could have been rested on so-called ‘horns of consecration’, wear and repair is present on the below example. The archaeology seems to confirm these early accounts of mirror signalling and fire beacons. This is what the military call today C4ISTAR and I recognize it as I’ve worked (as a contractor) for MOD labs.  This curious device once again ‘alludes’ to Labyrs being used as instruments as dots of light project through the device to illuminate the altar table shown at peak sanctuaries. Although I have not determined the exact function, we can see the use of 6 holes on the outside edge of one side, which could be counted on the front of the altar table, there are then 6 horizontal markers to the centre giving 12 dots on what I think is likely illuminating dots on the top of the table to midday, the other side giving 24 in total throughout the daylight hours in half-hour increments. This could be very clever and simply give the correct level of illuminated dots on the altar table (front and top) for any given day of the year. The difference to 24 could then be confirmed at night from the passage of reference stars to the horizon. Although there is a degree of speculation this seems plausible. If this is correct, it summarises the Minoan technology, it is elegantly simple but hugely capable. Simple is hard! The first example of a digital clock could well be this, count the illuminated dots on the altar table you have the time of day using sunlight! Experimental archaeology may give insight into the applications of these types of devices from peak sanctuaries.  Sunshine & Daylight Hours in Heraklion, Crete, Greece. The longest day of the year is 14:23 hours long and the shortest day is 9:36 hours long. The markings at least seem to confirm the longest day by 14 (hours) by the vertical chevrons in the middle. The 8 horizontal chevrons allude to the shortest day. Its function is hinted at but not sufficiently articulated to be easily understood (very Minoan).  It is NOT entirely clear what is being practised, peak sanctuaries markers seem to be constructed to measure. Monitoring coast approaches, surveying field areas to establish farm quota (tax) and astronomical observation are possibilities. This is likely one of their functions but how are they achieving this? One gets a sense of this from mythology: Rhea who lived on Crete is the wife to Chronos and her offspring was Zeus, bring in the age of the Olympians. They really did have gifts from the gods, they seem to be making them! 3). Trade and Commerce - Summer - The Master of Animals (Apollo, the Sun), Summer, midday, year. External affairs (such as trade and defence) are managed by the men in this society, this civilization imported raw materials from three continents (ivory from Africa, lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, obsidian, metals from all four corners) and produced high-value trade goods, that everyone desired. It is likely that the Priestess of the Master of Animals (Apollo) are coordinating the production of these goods in workshops, deliver to the port for exchange with city-states in the Aegean and wider Mediterranean. I’m a technologist and I get a sense of look at this and this (cool tech), in their frescos around this time, they are really going places. These ships are excellent (deployable freestanding masts, what may be devices that deflect in wind to give an indication of crosswinds).  The fleet is not hanging around, they drop off and pick-up goods in port (ideally islands, as evident in the islet port at the mouth of the Nile in Egypt), it is local merchants that likely organize the exchange with the mainland.  Token markers MAY have been used as a form of ticket for tradespeople or evidence of the fulfilment of contracts, there is evidence that Minoans were supplying engineers and architects for large projects (such as palaces) in the wider region, we can see some of these trades above (hammer - mason, set square - architect, saw - woodworker). Also perhaps used as a receipt when commodities were supplied to port for shipping and the suppliers account credited when the imprinted receipt was presented to the Palace (that is likely placing these orders and co-ordinating shipping manifests).  The issue is that no papyrus records survive to confirm the quantum of transactions, it is suspected significant Palace accounts existed on papyrus (the main writing medium), as clay nodules are found with multiple seal marks (sealing the palace transactional accounts), it is the equivalent of audited accounts, signed off by the administrators (priestess). There is evidence of shipping inventories with KU-RO (checksum) totals for the complete manifest. I find it interesting that the Papyrus symbol is also shown with magazines on the Phaistos disc, possible Knossos and Naxos where commodities were traded with warehousing and the transaction would need to be recorded. We really just have bits (dots) of the total picture. 4). Creation - workshops - Priestess of A-SA-SA-RA-ME (the ‘Lady’, Venus - consort to the Master) - Associated with Spring, sunrise, Octaeteris. Minoans are producing some of the best goods available at this time, masterly crafted, but even the everyday items are very well made. This is just a wonderfully simple product, nothing it doesn’t need and this embodies the previous Cycladic culture, representing the essence, removing the unnecessary. A perfect piece of product design.  The production of these may have been managed by the young priestess (acolytes, the little fingers), before progressing to the more senior ranks, the iconography would suggest that many left to have families. If they progress then they first learn how things are made (4), how to exchange them (3), how things work (2) and how to organize (1). The more sophisticated pieces are jaw-droppingly good, such as the Pylos Combat Agate - Wikipedia (calliper compass and 0.06mm milling bits are used to create this seal), it is the finest seal seen before the Enlightenment.  Mythology tells us that the dividing calliper (the geometric compass) was invented by Perdix/Talos (Daedelus’ nephew) which seems to be confirmed by archaeology. The creator is using reference marks and many are referencing the first joint of the thumb if the Minoans organized themselves into disciplines (fingers) and ranks (joints of the digits), the top job is likely being referred to! Wax will not reproduce this find detail, the clever-maker elects to not grind out these details which would only be known to the seal-holder when using a magnifying lens!  There are accounts of automatons (machines) but no examples survive, there is an interesting account of Palace doors which opened by fire (steam). The myth of Daedalus use of mercury is most interesting, mercury is 13.5 times denser than water to do substantially more work, that could both sequence timings, perform work and draw air through a whistle as the mercury escaped from a sealed container, which summarises what these automatons could according to accounts do. From what I have seen they didn’t have gears, they likely used pulleys and weights as a power source, but are possibly exploring the use of steam. None of these early machines survived, there are however mythical accounts of them. When one looks at the precision of the above seal, they have credibility.  We only see the artifacts that survive, largely those in stone and clay, we don’t know much at all of the goods that will have been crafted in wood, leather and cloth. In some cases, we can see that their clothing is hugely sophisticated for the time from frescos and it is now known they developed murex dyes (blue to red tones through purple, depending on how it is processed). Textile technologists have speculated that they may have ‘printed’ some of these more complex repeated patterns. The embodiment of Mother Earth (Demeter) is shown below. Look how good the textiles actually are. The fashion industry today recognizes it. I’ve just noticed this, I look all the time at Minoan art and I’ve missed this, they are using vail or gauze (semi-transparent on the outer edges of the flounced skirt, the very finest weave, erm, I’ve been wondering about the materials they had, wool for the masses, some linen and I think this is silk (from moths or seasilk are the likely sources, these were known in Cos around Minoan collapse, this is not unusual if Minoans find something new and useful they seem to cultivate it or import it), I can’t now think of a material known at this time that they didn’t have, this is not just silk, its the finest weave, Organza before 1628 BCE and the Chinese couldn’t dye it blue!  The Minoans are really good at all the creative pursuits and are excellent designers generally (and engineers, a topic on its own).  I find this jaw-dropping! The artifacts below are from Anatolia (over six millennia before the above fresco is made). Note the use of this symbol.  Linear A symbol 122 shown on the tape sections of the bodice above. See the bottom-left tablet (middle symbol), the same. The symbol on the right of this tablet is likely shown upside down, the ‘V’ is likely a reference to grain between years (shown by snakes - they have approximately this number of ribs as days in the year, a natural abacus). It also contains a Linear A syllabary sign for RE (upside down), possibly a reference to Rhea. These symbols are also shown on the body of the bodice above. This sign also appears in Vinča symbols (ca. 5000–4000 BCE) and there is a very good match for the symbols generally as well as Aegean numerals used in Linear A. Linear A signs are derived from slightly early Cretan hieroglyphs  (which seem to be based on early European protowriting), the idea for the syllabary is from Cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, it is likely the scribes some from overseas were tasked with creating an improved writing system (Linear A) but some of the signs it uses are hugely older. The Minoan belief system seems to be based on a hugely old one isolated on the islands! These symbols are not writing, but they do explain that ancient people had signs to express ideas and this is at the time of transition from hunting and gathering to farming. Update: the tablet on the right is showing grain, the snakes I think mean years, so this could be read as stored grain in-between years, specifically referring to I-DA-MA-TE: Demeter. These symbols are being used in the same contextual context. Further details here. This is shown on the sleave of Demeter's bodice in red. There aren’t many of these tablets found in Anatolia, but their use seems to continue and are used in old European proto-scripts too. These tablets are 6000 years old when the above fresco was made and they use the same symbols and critically in the same context. It's not writing (a few symbols) but may well have led to a proto-writing system a few millennia later and this it would appear does lead to Linear A!  Update: I found this recently on the internet, it proports to be from Gobekli Tepe.  The fourth cardinal direction is shown by Bull horns (South - these were used in prehistory to mark the position of a celestal body at a datum. This convention seems to be shown on a mammoth tusk from Ukraine (dated to ca 17,000 BCE). N.B. The bull's horns may be separated by a degree off south for solstice and equinox, see Analemma. A count of eight (an eight-year Octaeteris) plus ten, giving a Saros of eighteen years (the period between eclipse, note half this period a Sar between lunar and solar eclipses), these astronomical datum could be marked by bull horns. I do not pretend to fully understand it, but their descendants may have had trade contact with Anatolia across the Black Sea.  Compare this to a Minoan peak sanctuary, they are still being used to align celestial bodies defining datums…  Returning to Minoa, this is a rare example of a wooden table trapped in the pumice from Thera, it is Chippindale quality (some of the fidelity is lost in the plaster cast). It’s not found in a palace, it is from an everyday dwelling on Thera.  There is some evidence of batch production, a master craftsperson makes the former that the appendices could hammer to shape, silver cups illustrate the point. They are at the cusp of industrializing (but never quite got there, due to calamities, note the ladies with third legs (walking sticks) to climb up the mountains to peak-sanctuaries where they can observe the coastal approaches), the female hand supports the other and visa versa.  5). Minos - the lawgiver - the thumb There is so little that is known about the Minos and the little that is known is myth. There is an interesting linear A text which refers to the Minos, it is an accountancy record of his staff: three! Though to be a batman (cleans clothes), a stable master and a craftsman (Daedalus which I believe is a position, there is just too much invention for one man). Not many staff, the Minos may have been a job rather than an inherited title (royalty).  The panel to the top right may give some insight into how a Minos (law-giver) was appointed, four different events are shown possibly, the last is a knife fight (perhaps celebrated on the ninth year- Sar), Minos was said to be last to leave the arena and went to the caves to consult with Zues every nine-years to bring in new laws according to oral tradition! We can potentially see the dots, the question is if they are being joined up correctly?  What campaigns did the many Minos take on? What were the laws of the Sea and of Trade? What and where are their law treatise? We have no idea. They must have been quite good as a later Spartan lawgiver sent an emissary to learn how the Cretan (and Egyptians) govern when considering reform of the Spartan state.  I’ve tried to give a sense in this post of where the edges might be so the reader can see how little we actually know about the Minoans, compared to say Egypt and Sumer, which candidly we know much more about as there are entire libraries of documents, which include such things as their favourite recipes. Compared to the entire body of Linear A which can be reduced to 2 pages (at normal type size) and is undeciphered. We have to look at things like this and imagine what the recipe might be. One can hazard a guess and I would agree with you, but we can’t be entirely sure! My money is with you on something like meat in a flat pitta bread though (Souvlaki)!  What I do find remarkable, is the Minoans seem to have a knack for firsts, by example archaeologists, use white and black checked rulers to give the scale in pictures, look at the pictorial representation for a peak sanctuary (shown below) and there it is which suggests they were measuring in a scientific manner, they are shown to be using modern conventions and it alludes to a learned society and we know almost NOTHING of what they knew, which might be and likely was a substantial body of knowledge. Peak Minoan is before the Thera eruption (1628 BCE), they try to recover, but they never resume their dominant position in trade.  This summarises the Minoans for me, if they want to observe something they find a way, its as if they challenge the workshop and they seem to come up with the goods. They don’t have optical filters but want to observe the organise ones, the celestial bodies: including Venus passing in front of the Sun, so they use the gentle reflection from a water bowl to observe this, this is a simple effective technique. They know where the celestial bodies will be, but they seem to be constantly checking and measuring, just to make sure! Start with doubts and end in certainties, it's not the ‘scientific method’ of today but does seem to be highly aligned with it.  Did some of this knowledge survive by oral tradition after the bronze age collapse, did others write down the bits that could be remembered? Update: the Minoan Priestess’ Greatest Achievement I struggled to conclude this article and have just discovered this. I have suspected that the meaning of the Griffons in Minoan iconography was to symbolise the Great Year, a period which according to modern knowledge is a 25,772 year cycle as mother Earth wobbles backwards due to Axial precession. Which was hypothesized by Plato that predicted this to be 36,000 years and attested to 2nd-century-BC astronomer Hipparchus of not less than 1 degree each century. What I did not realise is they appear to have worked it out! I was looking for Aegean numerals! They're showing it symbolically (how Minoan). Each Griffon has two paws on the table 10 and 3 is marked on the griffon's wing, 13. There are two Griffons 26 (thousand) years. They are within 0.8% of the actual figure! N.B. Lions have 8 digits on their rear feet (4 claws per paw) which are usually shown planted on the ground, an Octaeteris, the other (main) long unit of time. The eagle is the master of the sky and the lion the Earth, the hybrid griffon protects the region that mother Earth wobbles back within throughout the ages.  This seems to be confirmed by the depiction of Demeter from Thera. Can you see it?  26 ‘V’ are shown on the Griffon's wing. Alluding to the Minoans being the first to reasonably accurately estimate the Great Year, 1400 years before Hipparchus and too far greater accuracy. This count is also confirmed on the collar of the Griffons shown in the so-called throne room at Knossos and in Minoan genius iconography also. This was not known to this accuracy until the time of Newton! The same count of 26 is shown on the collar of the Griffons flanking the Throne (room) at Knossos. A modern understanding of long astronomical periods hidden in plain view. The lady that measures got it right!My point being, the Priestess if sat with Newton and without a language barrier could not only understand his theories but possibly had a similar if not a better model of the inner solar system, Newton had a vague notion of Gravity, the Minoans did not. Unlike Netwon, this was being studied by many priestesses for millennia not a single lifetime! In terms of engineering, the Minoans had a similar level of technical capability to that around Newton time, amazingly the hydroengineering is compatible with that of 18th Century CE but is demonstrated from at least 1400 BCE if not before, hot and cold running copper water pipes go to the ‘Queen’s chamber bathroom’, venturi effect injectors are used in interlocking clay pipes, sewers, aqueducts, underfloor heating systems are all technically demonstrated. They had dividing callipers (that are attributed to Talos, Daeduleus’ nephew) and can be shown to be used on artifacts, dramatically improving engineering tolerances, which are as good as micro-milling bits of 60micron (0.06mm) diameter and tool placement precision of 0.015mm, their best engineering is exceptionally good and arguable better than at the time of Newton, accepting they had far fewer materials generally. Newton could split light, he didn’t reproduce a natural rainbow, see wedge crescent below….Some will say, you need a capitalist system for Industry. Although not well known, the Houses of Priestess of Potnia Theron (Artemis) and Mother Earth, (I-DA-MA-TE, Demeter); the Bees, had Gold Palace tokens which were used from around 1800 BCE. They are of a standard bullion weight and design. for all practical purpose money, each likely represent a month's salary for the professional classes: junior priestess or sailor. Arguable were withdrawn from the Palace and deposited at another palace to setup a new account or to facilitate trade transactions. Everyday items are called from Palace magazines using personal seals they had a very sophisticated system of accounting. Quota are defined for Farms, tax paid at harvest and balances roll over to the next accounting period. EVERYTHING is recorded. My point is this is also comparable with the time of Newton or at least the Age of Discovery.There are no surviving examples of Minoan machines, however, there are many accounts of them, in context, the later Antikythera mechanism is thought to be transported from Crete, the astronomical periods it encodes can be shown to be defined in Minoan times and we can see below a casting stone for a device that introduces the concept of interlocking gears but are not in themselves gears. ca. 1500 BCE. They do however show the Minoans use a week on the right lunar device (first use, a lunar phase), which flip-flops before advancing a position each alternative month (giving a reasonable accurate 29.5-day Synodic lunar month), a complete revolution, an Olympiad of 49-months. The device can predict Saros cycles when the celestial bodies return to their original position (for Eclipse prediction) with 94% accuracy. I firmly believe it is this earlier study of Astronomy that eventually leads to the mechanism, which is the most sophisticated known device in the ancient world.Oral tradition suggests, there were Automaton that entertained audiences with their lifelike appearance and movement, could sing (think whistles as water escapes through a sealed vessel drawing in air), tripod servers of Hephaostos that could enter a dining room, serve food and presumably withdraw, Daedulus’ machines were said to use Mercury which is 13.5 denser than water to do more work. I think they are using liquids as the power source, likely used for sequencing and driving a spindle (through weight) and pully systems. At some point, cogs were invented shown to be used on the Antikythera mechanism. I do not believe the Greeks invented early machines, rather this knowledge was preserved on the Greek islands and written down, it is the recollections of what could be remembered from this time. There is secondary evidence that boilers were employed in Minoan times to heat water and a Palace of Ba’al that Minoan engineers are thought to have constructed had doors that opened by fire (steam). This later curious bronze is from Samos is dated to 800 BCE.Man, woman and child the Minoans were nerds, they were fascinated by early machines! They had Palace organization that seeks to increase output, they have direct control of Palace workshops that can make the most extraordinary things for the time, it is as if the Priestess challenge them and they come up with (simple) technology! They had a merchant fleet importing raw materials from three continents and exporting high-value trade goods. These white-hulls are so vastly superior to anything that would be produced in the next three millennia! The ship Theseus returned in, was put on display in Athens for centuries as a prize, the Athenians couldn’t, however, make another, it was too advanced, they didn’t know where to start. A reconstruction team that made and sailed a half-scale reproduction Minoan ship used a timber frame with mortise and tenon joints, applied flax linen over the frame held in a composite matrix (likely linseed oil, tree resin and limestone powders), the reinforcement is shown inside and out, glass fibre was not invented until 1950’s CE, flax linen is about as strong in tension as glass fibre! They are lightweight, hydrodynamic and fast as!The Minoans are metal merchants (they are at least importing tin from as far afield as Cornwall and Afganistan) and transporting it around the Mediterranean making a huge profit. The technology is not just comparable with around the age of enlightenment, and importantly it is more the pace of technology innovation evident, that is very high, the Minoans have ALREADY had their own age of enlightenment! They have a model of the inner solar system, they are measuring at both a scientific level and accounting for economic activity to raise their standard of living generally. This is a peak sanctuary where solar and astronomical observations were likely made, the important thing to note is the devices to measure.One perceived such conventions as the 24-hour day being attributed to other later civilizations, the reality is they are shown in Minoan times. The middle spiral defining 12 hours of day or night at an equinox. Everything is being measured in a scientific way!This is where they are around the time of the Thera eruption (noting some examples shown above are later). They are going places, they have a murex dye technology, they produce the best textiles of the time and they are wanting to increase production outputs (there is a lot of evidence of industrial level dye production and batch production using formers to increase output), quality is dramatically improving. They are going considerable distances to secure sources of metal. Then Thera erupted in 1628 BCE! The merchant fleet was lost, the ash fallout resulted in global crop failure, the islanders starved others entered the lucrative metal trade space (once a monopoly for all practical purpose), Mycenae invaded and took control of Crete around 1425 BCE. It had a different philosophy, it was territorially expansionist, raiding and piracy replaced trading and production, the regional economy collapsed in Bronze Age Collapse, likely as a result of rivalries seeking control of lucrative metal trade. The world took a different course. The Minoans technology is almost scattered to the four winds around collapse events (three), the Sardinians and Atlas likely pickup the Atlantic silver/tin trade, the Mycenaeans and Luwans (Trojans) fight it out, the Minoan dye and navigation technology go to Phoenicia, the Egyptians buy up land in the Levant with the exchange of seven-years reserves of Grain after Thera. The world becomes smaller, the Minoans have to focus on their survival but do seem to attempt to set up colonies elsewhere (none endured) and largely give up their early fascination with machines that allude to being able to raise outputs significantly, IF they would have continued along this development path. The world doesn’t become globalized until the Age of Discovery. I am not suggesting the Minoan had an industrial revolution, rather they were on a trajectory towards one with rapid technical progress, trade and a desire to increase production outputs, they didn’t get there, Thera set them back significantly, they lost their trade monopoly, the world took a different course.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/s31gbcn7lqwiyj2v', 'title': 'How much earlier could the Industrial Revolution have begun on Earth under the right circumstances?', 'score': {'original': 0.81020454545455, 'ai': 0.18979545454545}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In my opinion, there is only one civilization that is on a course to industrialization before the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, it is Minoan Crete but didn’t quite get there due to a cataclysm.

None of the later civilizations investigated machines in any significant way, they had slave labour, there was no motivation to invest in expensive machines which require very significant development before they become efficient and economically attractive. This said, when they did, the hockey-stick rise in outputs did result and the modern world is entirely dependent on this huge rise in efficiency (see chart). I need to give you some context for this to make sense. Progress isn’t continuous throughout human history, there are setbacks. This is a chart by Ian Morris (a History Professor at Stanford) that considers social development (energy-consumption, record-keeping, organization and war-making) over long time, the West is Egypt and East, China. We can see two pronounced dips in output: Bronze Age Collapse around 1200 BCE and around the time of the Roman empire, there is then a jittery slow recovery in the middle ages (so-called dark ages). My point is the best technology in antiquity was being produced by the Minoan islands is very broadly comparable with just before the Age of Enlightenment in Britain, just before the industrial revolution actually occurred!OK, I appreciate this is a ‘big’ claim and it requires evidence to support it, this is also hampered by there being limited archaeology relating to this time, the Minoans had the first syllabary based writing system in Europe from around 1900 BCE called linear A, although it is thought they used papyrus none of these records survive unlike Egypt where they did. Nonetheless, they left us art that would suggest the Minoans are studying at least Astronomy and the Earth at a scientific level. I’m not going to go into great detail, suffice to say they are recording the magnetic declination from around 1900 BCE, their buildings are aligned to magnet North from this time (they are exploiting naturally occurring iron— magnetite in the Bronze age), they appear to have defined the Great year as a 26,000-year cycle (which was not done to this accuracy to around the age of the enlightenment), they have optical lenses (precision ground rock crystals) and were possibly exploring the properties of light, for those doubting Thomas’ see the link for the archaeology and studies to support this:Nick Deakin · 7moWhat can we not understand about Minoans?There is a lot we do not understand about the Minoans.

One of the few words we commonly use today of Minoan origin is ‘purple,’ after the murex dye that they invented, but most think it is from Phoenicia. The Minoans didn’t give away their advantages, so we get little insight from other cultures other than the goods they imported and occasional records usually relating to trade. Then there is an abundance of highly concentrated dots from archaeology and we don’t know what they mean! An example is hand-made clay figurines purposeful smashed at peak sanctuaries, we have no idea why? It is not like other civilizations such as the Egyptian, Sumerian or Classical Greek world where there is a huge body of written work we can refer to which gives context, all their papyrus records are lost to time. In the case of the Minoans, insight is virtually all based on the archaeological record, it requires analysis (which may not necessarily be correct) and what is mostly found is bric-a-brac, the few fine pieces that are very rare, hint to a sophisticated (for the time) technologically highly progressive society. I would summarise the Minoan society as:\n1) Organised\n2) Scientific\n3) Commercial\n4) Creative and\n5) Lawful What I have described are the characteristics of their deities, respectively: Mother Earth (1), daughter Moon (2), twin and son, the Sun (3), and his consort Venus (4). The lawgiver is Minos (not shown but associated with 3) and is likely the ultimate authority (even over their deities), the thumb(5)! The fingers of the hand!  The Minoans are a new way of thinking that was introduced into Cyclades culture around 2,800 BCE. Cyclades culture at least according to the material art(efacts), should perhaps be considered Mediterranean island art, it suggests the islands were trading tool materials in prehistory. Many would consider this a classic example of Cycladic art.  This piece is actually from Sardinia, Ozieri culture. I’ve purposefully included this as perhaps the early Mediterranean island cultures should be considered more collectively and at least alludes to trade networks, which places the later Minoan civilisation in context. This is Cycladic culture, but you can see they are stylistically similar. The figures don’t have mouths (male or female). Mom’s the word. They look so modern and inspired the modern-art movement, these artifacts are dated from 3,200 BCE, just before the Minoans. The Minoans introduced new practices from around 2800 BCE which define the start of the culture. There is rapid economic growth when Palaces (administration buildings) begin to be constructed, ca 2,000 BCE.  Before this, mariners are moving tool materials such as obsidian (later metals), between islands that are used for distribution to the mainland ports from around 4500 BCE. The founders of Minoan Crete according to myth are considered to be the Dactyls (the fingers), that guard the Idaean caves where according to the seal below metal ingots [metallic money] are kept, and their sisters the Hecaterides being the other hand - Priestess.

This seal is important as it puts Minoan society in context. The Minos, top right, is the thumb and law-giver - the ultimate authority according to the seal, the four deities (fingers), top-left branch. The four houses of priestess are shown bottom right which likely have functional duties aligned to their deities, but note a Griffon is shown as a finger, in this way the high priestess upholds the sacred laws. The Minos likely responsible for external affairs and the High Priestess the internal affairs of the island. There is a level of speculation in this paragraph! Without doing so, it is difficult to make any progress into how this society is actually structured, which is my main point!  An aside, if we assume that The Eleusinian Mysteries: The Rites of Demeter are based on the Bees shown above (Mother Earth and Daughter Moon or in Greek terms Demeter and Persephone/Artemis), then it may explain why initiates had no fear of death after they learned the secret. The Griffon protects long-time (the Great Year, a 26,000-year cycle, as mother Earth wobbles backwards throughout the Ages due to precession of the equinox, what may be pole stars are often presented on the Griffons wing which changes with the Ages), the other deities represent a shorter period of time well within a human lifetime: Earth day, Lunar Month, Solar Year and five visibility cycles of Venus (eight-years plus one or two days, I had previously thought nine was shown using inclusive counting, however, further review would suggest a Venusian and lunisolar calendars are maintained concurrently). People fear the unknown, but the Minoans understand Astronomy, they seek to better understand the cycles of life, nature! There is nothing to fear, each generation is an integral part of this process (humanity collectively). Do you see a throne or a model of the workings of the (inner) solar system and how this is observed by (Mother) Earth? As this story unfolds the Minoan visual language to express abstract concepts will I hope become more clear. See if you can identify features that may represent, solstice and equinox, the angular tilt of Mother Earth and even her processional period, and specifically a nine-year term in office.  Fig. 27.

There is a lot of evidence to suggest investment in public works, such as sophisticated engineering works to bring water into the city and take waste away (Minoan hydroengineering is considered to be comparable with 18th-century common-era Europe). The Minoans are secretive, they don’t give away their advantage. We can see some technology transfer that occurs around collapse events (Thera eruption 1628 BCE, Mycenaen invasion 1450 BCE and Bronze Age collapse 1200 BCE; likely when some left to set up new colonies). Let's assess each of the four pillars (fingers) and leaders (thumbs) of this society and what we don’t know about each. With a focus on the administrators, the priestess (shown bottom-right) which left more in the archaeology record.  1). Organisation - The Priestess of Mater Theia (Demeter), Mother Earth - Winter, North and Earth day: I-DA-MA-TE Internal affairs are managed by the Priestess (bottom-right, far right being the embodiment of Mother Earth: the Mother Superior) with likely corresponding roles to their deities (top-left, the second figure from the left is Demeter), each can express a cardinal direction (North in this case), seasons (winter) and time of day (midnight), so possibly priestess of each house had corresponding geographic, seasonal or workshift duties in this society. The Mother Superior is likely shown behind the altar and possibly partner to the Minos, this is unclear. The etymology of Demeter being interesting, I-DA-MA-TE in linear A. It is an agglutinative language (glued together), it references Mount Ida and mountain caves are where they kept the metallic metal ingots as shown above. Using Indo-European root etymologies -DA means to divide. -MA is Mother and -TE wheat, in effect, Mountain Mother storing the islands (winter) Grain which can be summarised as: I - Divide - Mother - Wheat (e.g thresh it at an individual level, or take a proportion of it (tax) in administrative terms), this is possibly a much older belief system orginating in Anatolia at the cusp of the agricultural revolution, in this context the main axis makes more sense: female votive (Earth Mother) are associated with (gathering) grain, a male deity hunting (son). Sky Father seem to be silent but represents the wider Universe. I would argue that astronomy is much old. The Minoans see things in terms of continuing the generations (those shown with upheld hands). This may have been no hereditary King Minos and Queen, but King Minos is referred to in some accounts but maybe how other cultures and city-states describe Minoan leaders, other cultures would not have a term to describe what may have been leaders appointed on talent (by trials) with a limited term in office at this time, somewhere between a Kreterocracy (the strong) and Kritarchy (judges).

There is some evidence that may suggest this convention originated in Anatolia in prehistory (by example - nine snakes (years) are shown on t-pillars at Gobekli Tepe which terminate at an Auroch (bull) - the Master of (Domesticated) Animals being implied - possibly the term for the leader of the hunt and the law-giver of the local tribes which came to feast at the site). A snake’s ribs are sufficient in number to count the days in the year, it makes a logical sign to express a year or the datum of when this was counted from marking the beginning of a new year and its end. This may suggest leaders were selected by a series of trials, by talent (there is wider but somewhat limited iconography that supports a gauntlet of military trials and selection process), both the Minos and Mother Superior may need to jump the bull to obtain (public) office. Is this a bull-leaper or a potential Mother Superior in charge of the Priestess?  If the high priestess, likely to be confident and talented: ‘strong’ leaders of external (Minos) and internal affairs of state (Mother Superior) and would be the world’s first republic (although appointment by talent rather than vote), though how each might of been selected is not known, however, a silver cup shows the last fourth trials to be a knife fight. The art alludes to leaders being appointed by a series of trials, it does not concretely confirm it. I get a sense of equality between the sexes, however, each has a clear role. Challenges and life are generally shown to be addressed as a couple. The frescos from Thera (Santorini) tends to suggest each gender was schooled separately, the boys in defence (e.g. boxing) and trade, and girls in nature and organization. Each seems to excel at what they do. Minoan art and artefacts are well executed, they take pride in their white hulled ships and the priestess are well organized, they are to use a modern-term professional. There is an unusual passage in the London Medical Papyrus (found in Egypt but thought to be of Minoan origin), this describes an acolyte explaining how her master would quell and overthrow Southern Egypt if provoked (e.g. trade stopped), it uses the analogy of bull-leaping to explain this, the Master composing himself as the bull charges and uses a firm grip to grasp the horns and the bull bucking their head to somersault over the challenge, to become leaders in', 'result': {'fake': 0.6517, 'real': 0.3483}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""this society, would you mess with the lady shown above? Minoan accountancy records are reasonably well understood, the Palace set quota for farms (which implies that they survey fields to establish potential crop yields), variance is monitored and carry over balances to the next accounting period (harvest). There appears to be a system of credit/deposit used by at least the elites, which are calling down commodities from Palaces magazines (stores) using personal seals and settled presumably at harvest or on payday. Recall that the four deities also represent periods of time, the Minoans have Gold Palace tokens which are in use from around 1800 BCE. Rosettes are used to represent any one of the four deities but are context-specific, when items are shown at the periphery in art it can mean to divide by the number shown, it is employed as a fractional denominator. So 1/2 Lunar month, confirmed by the 14 Earth days on the header: the bees! Please note the Minoans are the first to articulate a seven-day week, a moon phase. The deities assist this society in practical matters of everyday life, days, month, years and a term in office for the leaders. Please note this is particular piece is dated to around 600 BCE, but tends to suggest that the Islands continue Minoan accounting practice to some extent, the conventions of Earth day, Lunar month and fractions in iconography can be attested to Minoan times which specifically use these signs and conventions.  Many examples exist showing gold tokens being issued (so-called roundels) and are found in quantity in hordes (many in Mycenae), they likely represent work done, a month's salary (see below). These tokens do seem to be carried on the person, however, are often presented as jewellery (note the armbands in frescos, they are worn by men and women, these also show filagree counts defining days or weeks), I think it likely they are used for payments for big-ticket or capital items or to set up a Palace account at another location, which day to day items can then be called down against using personal seals. Many will have worked away from their homes (Sailors and Priestess assigned to a peak sanctuary) so seem to carry their wealth (money) with them. An important aspect of this is, is that the economy is pegged to actual work done by professional classes and value is unwritten in gold bullion, this is a great basis to build an economy, the gold standard. How extensive the use of Palace currency was is difficult to say, however, seems to include the Priestess and possibly the elites, landed and merchant classes. This suggests Palace administration had a basis for converting a commodity into Palace currency (a measure of work done), they are trading in city-state surpluses and each needs metal (see trade, the seven dots in a circle are likely the seven metals of antiquity— metal ingots), you can also see the petal motif (rosette, shown below on the Phaistos Disc, the first example of printing).

It is a brilliant instrument of trade, no weighing, just count the tokens. No material tests are needed. It is also likely they had assaying tests as did the Egyptians for gold purity, but you don’t need them with these, they're issued by the Palace, a trusted source. What an idea, for all practical purposes: money!  We just don’t know how sophisticated these systems were but allude to banking functions, with some accounting records to suggest, seed-corn loans to set up farms in the next growing year, an organised economy which is modelled on a bee colony, the island their food source, the Palace administration being the hive. The Priestess of Demeter (Queen bee) are likely planning to store sufficient grain to get at least the Palace, but possibly the island through the barren winter months and growing year through to the next harvest. The harvest is likely gathered or overseen by the Priestess of Potnia Theron (also a reference to Autumn, worker bees), collectively the Bees. Shortfalls would need to be made up through trade (Summer) and seed sown (spring), which perhaps is how what appear to be the four houses of priestess may have been organised (keep this in mind as the story unfolds). Each deity can refer to a cardinal direction, season or period of time, context gives the intended meaning. N.B. The first acknowledged silver coinage is from Lydia, coins are issued by the Temple of Potnia Theron (or ‘worker’ bees in Minoan terms, which we’ll look at next). Continuing with the Queen Bees colony…. We can see one of many underground grain silos outside the palace of Knossos and ‘hidden’ underfloor storage for more precious things in banks of palace magazines (two shown, there are many). People will have paid their tax in either goods or produce. The priestess kept Sacred Groves where likely specialist plants were cultivated, in the introduction to the London Medical Papyrus suggests healers were from the House of Potnia Theron (eloquently expressed as: “the moonbeams illuminates all pages”) or reported into these priestesses (and not Apollo which is normally associated with healing and medicine in later Greek tradition, unless it is those of the Master (Apollo) that are the medical practitioners and those of Potnia Theron (Mistress) that are responsible for the medicine cabinet - sacred groves, which were likely, not dissimilar to Kew Gardens, that gather seeds and plants from around the known world and cultivate them and NO-ONE is allowed to harm them, they are sacred, it's the islands medicine cabinet).

Another possibility is that the priestess of Potnia Theron that look after female patients (noting this deity gives and takes female life) while those of Apollo gives (treats) and takes male life, in later traditions. Like many things in the Minoan world it is not entirely clear how the Minoans organised themselves.  Artifacts and frescos suggest at least a very good understanding of Astronomy (the Minoans have already defined most of the periods used on the much later Antikythera mechanism which can be inferred by fresco borders, here is a quick example: 49 lunar months are shown in the two horizontal borders, a four year Olympiad when they add an intercalated 13th month to keep the solar and lunar calendar aligned, the month possibly referred to as Ophiuchus (the Snake bearer constellation). The 14 verticle devices are likely referring to years, collectively a Saros cycle of 18 years (when all the celestial bodies return to their original position, useful to predict eclipses, which other artifacts suggest they could do). Splitting these in two graphic devices using the Minoan convention implies to divide the total into two - 18/2= 9 years (a reoccurring theme: a nine-year Sar or half an eighteen year Saros). I believe this slightly unusual convention is to show when a 13th month is to be added in a given year, every 2nd, 4th and 7th year in a nine-year Sar cycle to keep the lunar and solar calendar aligned.  Ophiuchus (the snake bearer constellation) is likely represented by the so-called ‘snake goddess’. Would you call the month the Olympic games celebrated a goddess? It's likely a symbol representing this celebration and likely used as a navigational constellation also (the snake bearer's elbow is similar to Orion’s belt but on the opposite side of the night sky). One male the other female, the Minoan seem to have this balance between genders but with clearly defined roles.  In my opinion, the so-called Minoan snake goddess represents the constellation of Ophiuchus giving the 13th intercalated ‘leap’ month inserted each second, fourth and seven year in a nine-year Sar cycle, the fourth year period giving an Olympiad, so it may be these leap months when games took place. Similarly, the so-called Poppy goddess is also another symbol associated with I-DA-MA-TE (Demeter). This house of priestesses directs the colony to ensure a winter food supply - the Queen bee, they likely work out of Knossos (noting this is to the North of Crete). 2). Science/Technology (the art of Science) - Autumn, West, Sunset, Month - The Priestess of Potnia Theron (Artemis or Mistress of Wild Animals) There are certain things in the archaeological archive which allude to the study of nature (Physics), we don’t know how scientific this was?

There is a story behind the games, it's based upon an improved understanding of time using this visual language (it's difficult to ignore once you know it exists, it is constantly being referred to in art but gets overlook because its pretty, it also contains technical information usually relating to the Minoan calendar). Astronomy is all shown in artwork and artifacts, so what they actually know about astronomy can’t easily be concretely confirmed, we just see the correct periods being shown in art, NOT how they worked this out. The artifacts suggest it may be very advanced for the time, Minoans have devices to calculate astronomical periods, including eclipses using Saros cycles with 94% accuracy, in the 16th century BCE. This is a casting stone to make many copies in likely bronze. The lunar device is shown on the right, noting the first recorded use of a seven-day week with it (a moon phase), the lunar month device (right) flip-flops before advancing a position on the solar device on the left (allowing a 29.5 day synodic lunar month to be maintained by adding an intercalated day every alternative month - e.g. when the device flops before advance a position), a full rotation of the lunar device (right) around the solar device (left) being a four year Olympiad, years being given at quarters. It’s nowhere near as complex as the Antikythera mechanism but one can see there on a trajectory to a more sophisticated device. Critically this would allow an Olympiad of 49 and alternatively 50 months to be maintained. One at least gets a sense of a regularized calendar to emulate the movement of the celestial bodies (their deities).  My gut feeling (which is entirely speculative, is they may have experimented with water computers, a machine constructed by Daedalus was said to run on mercury, which is 13.5 times denser than water, to sequence and perform work as a weight turn a spindle for example, there is nothing in the archaeological archive to support this but is hinted at in oral tradition as automatons, moving ‘life-like’ statues). I would not underestimate Minoan technical ability, the myth of Daedulus’ hang glider describes a cambered wing with a tapered leading edge and elliptical trailing edge (in planform) and a minimum gliding sink rate of 1:18 (5 degrees), this angle is unambiguously referred to using Orion’s sword (star M42!) How on earth do they know this! This sink rate is about right for a trainer glider. Aero-engineers (which I am) jaws will drop on reading the orginal account, it requires some interpretation as they lack the modern terms to describe these things, but it's all described, they must have at least built a hand-launched model to understand flight performance and if you think they didn’t have the materials to build one, think again, they had the finest linen (AKA aerolinen - that the first aircraft used to skin wings) - Icarus is accredited with the sail, the Minoans built ultralight Sheilds using wicker cores, had tree resins, even turpentine solvents (to"", 'result': {'fake': 0.1989, 'real': 0.8011}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""seal but beeswax would do) and the best leatherworkers, this is all you actually need! The account is truly jaw-dropping what is described is way before its time. It is likely both solar and astronomical observations were made at peak sanctuaries and if you look carefully note the measuring devices. Poles to align astronomical targets (stars) and mark their passage for timekeeping (this method also being used in Egypt at this time). Peak sanctuaries have a commanding view of both the shipping lanes and farms which area could be measured to set quota (and tax) confirmed by records (the numbering system - called Aegean numerals and commodities are reasonably well understood in Linear A although the language is not). Geometry in its first form is the study (measurement) of land area. Candidly at least one of the function for Peak Sanctuaries must have included astronomical observation, in all the depictions metrology (measurement) and instrumentation are shown.  There is a sense that Minoans wanted to understand the underlying rules of nature. It's extraordinary what they seem to know, changes in magnetic declination are recorded by building orientation (this alludes to Earth Science), this is confirmed by oral tradition the Dactyls are accredited with discovering the lodestone (compass) but this is generally accredited to the Chinese and much later in history. Magnetite is available on the island of Skyros. There are 34 markings on the periphery, recall that they use a convention of fractional denominators to divide by the number shown, so 1/34 x 360 degrees is 10.6 degrees. This is the declination from magnetic North to true North when the Kernos is dated to around 1825 BCE    . The main marking is orientated West to indicate the direction to True North. There is a significant change around this time and likely why this was being monitored, to inform maritime high sea navigation. This is what we would call today, Earth Science and it's being studied in 1800 BCE! Were the Minoans purposefully orientating their building to monitor changes in magnetic declination from around 1900 BCE or just using compasses to orientate their buildings?  Inspection of the Bulgarian ARC shows a large and rapid declination amplitude swing of about 16, from ~ 1850 BC, Declination = +18.56 0 to ~1770 BC. Declination = +2.580 (Kovacheva et al, 1998). We can see why they might be doing so below, there is a large change in magnetic declination around this time. This seems to be recorded at two sites East and West of the Mediterranean with differing declinations, it occurred to me that if they used this for building orientation, it is likely they had devices on ships and taking a reading at midday using a shadow stick would give them an estimate of their passage West or East. Not a great deal of evidence for this but that that exists alludes to this application.  http://maajournal.com/Issues/2011/Vol11-1/2_Downey.pdf Update: another found, in Iberia (using cup and ring markers):  Minoans had optical instruments.

The device below often features in fresco borders and on altars of peak sanctuaries, it summarises their observable solar model, it has 12 petals (hours) on each side, 24 hours in the day, the spirals represent solstices (top and bottom) and equinox (middle spiral), there are 12 marks (hours) at equinoxes. A careful review of Tell el-Daba fresco fragments alludes to further subdivision into 5. This precedes the conventionally attested dating of the “Egyptian 24-hour” established in 127 BCE and the minute attested to Ptolemy in the 2nd century . The Minoans have a visual language to express astronomical concepts defining time. There are no written works to confirm this, just what appears at first glance to be ‘pretty” borders.  I’ve just realised what this fresco is referring to, its an eight-year Octaeteris with five visibility cycles of Venus! Each whole device is a year with two equinoxes of equal length of twelve hours. I have been intreged by when Minoan might have leaped the bull, it seems to be when an intercalated month is added, it needs to be done three times each Sar to keep the lunar and solar calendar aligned, I think this may be on the second, fourth and seven year. This may well have been shown in this fresco but as you can see it is missing many areas. What did they think was keeping the celestial bodies in orbit? They hint to gravity in family relationships, one deity (celestial body) is bound to the other (in orbit), the maiden daughter Moon to mother Earth, consort', 'result': {'fake': 0.1069, 'real': 0.8931}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'Venus to the Sun.

You can only tell the story chronologically, mother Earth then daughter Moon (with bow), son (Sun) and his lady consort (Venus), aligned with myth of the founding of Delos and birth order of Artemis and Apollo. The artist usually give hints but if they want to, for example, refer to seasons they would place the deities in calendar order. There must have been entire codex of mathematics, the study of the celestial bodies and astronomy and we know next to NOTHING about. What we have is art that confirms the correct number counts for astronomical periods without written proof of how this was determined.  Mother Earth giving a DAY, daughter Moon giving a Lunar MONTH, son giving a Solar Year and consort an eight-year Octaeteris of Venus. I have been trying to find the earliest reference so these deities can be attested, I found a similar scene, it shows the Love Birds (Son/Master and Consort) and Bees (Mother and daughter), although individual deities may be shown before this time in Anatolia. Catalhoyuk: ca, 5750 BCE (just before this settlement was abandoned). It is perhaps not as sophisticated as the Minoan system but seems to be the basis of the latter belief system. After this, we seem to have references to the Master of Animals (Apollo) and Mistress of Animals (Artemis), the twins (giving sun and moonlight): its needed at this time to make the Astronomical Age: Gemini (6000–4000 BCE) which appear just before sunrise on the spring equinox. My gut feeling is those from Catalhoyuk may have migrated to around Vinca which is founded at this time - they use similar iconography and calendar conventions, they may have moved to access this new tool material - copper is mined in high quantity. My gut feeling was a group from Catalhoyuk when across the Black Sea in search of these new materials (copper) which is confirmed by DNA studies, the Vinca live along side the hunter and gatherers, have the same funeral practices and somewhat critical use similar symbolism and take signs with them that become Vinca script which seems to encapsurate Aegean numbers.  What is presented as the Minoan religion, is based on observation (good science) and their deities are practical and underpin society, their deities are (or become) associated with the celestial bodies and they are more regular than clockwork, they define time (keeping). Their belief system is possibly based on a hugely old one (shown above when fully articulated), but earlier symbols and conventions can be traced back to the first calendar used at Göbekli Tepe and better qualified by artifacts from Çatalhöyük, alluded to by symbols used for Mother Earth (shown on the blouse tapes in the Demeter Fresco, shown later) and ‘H’, serif ‘I’, that may represent solstice and equinox, sometimes shown as reversed parenthesis )(, endure to Minoan', 'result': {'fake': 0.6383, 'real': 0.3617}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""times and are presented herein, in Luwian, its meaning is thought to be ‘god’ but the original meaning may be more; ‘natural order’, the repeated and observable cycles of life (the celestial bodies defining time). Another example is the Labrys - Wikipedia, it could well be a symbol of Minoan power, but it looks like an instrument to me, one can trace the technology transfer to Phoenicia which becomes straight-edged and eventually led to the Jacob's staff (the first recognized marine sextant). The axe heads can slide on the shaft which as you can see below have markings. The original device is more useful it can signal (flat copper plates riveted together, gold in some cases for smaller devices). Many have postulated its use, it both reflects light and casts a shadow. It may have been used for timekeeping and navigation, as well as having ceremonial significance, my own view is it became culturally significant as it was a useful tool.  There is line-of-sight between peak sanctuaries, Labyrs likely did have many functions, not least providing navigational fire beacons at night for the small wooden boats (less than ten oars, see below, Minoan white hulled ships are likely produced by Palace-controlled workshops and licensed, plain wooden hulls (non-Minoan) would be easy to identify to potentially duty, levied on shipping coming through their territorial waters - those with plain wooden hulls). The later Greeks did have signalling systems  (by example the fall of Troy is communicated to Argos by island fire signals within hours) and these may have earlier origin using simple flashes from these reflective copper mirrors (that are substantially flat being gravity cast into a thin sheet, they would be hopeless if used as an actual axe).  Today, the association of Zeus with lightning bolts is one of myth, however in a Minoan context, possibly identifies a) a critical process: lightning striking magnetite from Skyros to make it magnetized, a lodestone (compass) - if you have one, you can find more! and b) possibly a reference to Minoan maritime practice, the peak sanctuaries had all the optical tools to identify plain hulls on the horizon and if they are flashing signals to Minoan vessels to intercept, board and secure a proportion of cargo (duty), it could explain the myth. Peak Sanctuaries have often over 200kms unobstructed line of sight to the horizon (and to other peak sanctuaries) from a ship's deck this is limited to around 4kms. If the boarded were given a token (with Zeus' mark) so duty is only levied once, it may explain why Zeus became so revered, if he is taxing everyone passing through territorial waters. Like lightning, a ship sees a flash of light from a peak, the next thing a white hull intercepts and there is the thunder of a boarding party inspecting the cargo (somewhat god-like power). Lightning can be read as star-axe. The etymology of Labrys alludes to this ‘narrow street’ a beam of (reflected) sunlight.

Iliad Book 18 Aeschylus writes in Agamemnon that fire signals were used to send the message from Troy to the city Argos of the victory by the Greeks (1184 BC ?). Only after a few hours the message reached the c. 600 km distant city of Argos. Evidence of the use of fires outside peak sanctuaries is widely reported in the literature. Large labrys of 3m in height are found and could have been rested on so-called ‘horns of consecration’, wear and repair is present on the below example. The archaeology seems to confirm these early accounts of mirror signalling and fire beacons. This is what the military call today C4ISTAR and I recognize it as I’ve worked (as a contractor) for MOD labs.  This curious device once again ‘alludes’ to Labyrs being used as instruments as dots of light project through the device to illuminate the altar table shown at peak sanctuaries. Although I have not determined the exact function, we can see the use of 6 holes on the outside edge of one side, which could be counted on the front of the altar table, there are then 6 horizontal markers to the centre giving 12 dots on what I think is likely illuminating dots on the top of the table to midday, the other side giving 24 in total throughout the daylight hours in half-hour increments. This could be very clever and simply give the correct level of illuminated dots on the altar table (front and top) for any given day of the year. The difference to 24 could then be confirmed at night from the passage of reference stars to the horizon. Although there is a degree of speculation this seems plausible. If this is correct, it summarises the Minoan technology, it is elegantly simple but hugely capable. Simple is hard! The first example of a digital clock could well be this, count the illuminated dots on the altar table you have the time of day using sunlight! Experimental archaeology may give insight into the applications of these types of devices from peak sanctuaries.  Sunshine & Daylight Hours in Heraklion, Crete, Greece.

One gets a sense of this from mythology: Rhea who lived on Crete is the wife to Chronos and her offspring was Zeus, bring in the age of the Olympians. They really did have gifts from the gods, they seem to be making them! 3). Trade and Commerce - Summer - The Master of Animals (Apollo, the Sun), Summer, midday, year. External affairs (such as trade and defence) are managed by the men in this society, this civilization imported raw materials from three continents (ivory from Africa, lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, obsidian, metals from all four corners) and produced high-value trade goods, that everyone desired. It is likely that the Priestess of the Master of Animals (Apollo) are coordinating the production of these goods in workshops, deliver to the port for exchange with city-states in the Aegean and wider Mediterranean. I’m a technologist and I get a sense of look at this and this (cool tech), in their frescos around this time, they are really going places. These ships are excellent (deployable freestanding masts, what may be devices that deflect in wind to give an indication of crosswinds).  The fleet is not hanging around, they drop off and pick-up goods in port (ideally islands, as evident in the islet port at the mouth of the Nile in Egypt), it is local merchants that likely organize the exchange with the mainland.  Token markers MAY have been used as a form of ticket for tradespeople or evidence of the fulfilment of contracts, there is evidence that Minoans were supplying engineers and architects for large projects (such as palaces) in the wider region, we can see some of these trades above (hammer - mason, set square - architect, saw - woodworker). Also perhaps used as a receipt when commodities were supplied to port for shipping and the suppliers account credited when the imprinted receipt was presented to the Palace (that is likely placing these orders and co-ordinating shipping manifests).  The issue is that no papyrus records survive to confirm the quantum of transactions, it is suspected significant Palace accounts existed on papyrus (the main writing medium), as clay nodules are found with multiple seal marks (sealing the palace transactional accounts), it is the equivalent of audited accounts, signed off by the administrators (priestess). There is evidence of shipping inventories with KU-RO (checksum) totals for the complete manifest. I find it interesting that the Papyrus symbol is also shown with magazines on the Phaistos disc, possible Knossos and Naxos where commodities were traded with warehousing and the transaction would need to be recorded.

This is just a wonderfully simple product, nothing it doesn’t need and this embodies the previous Cycladic culture, representing the essence, removing the unnecessary. A perfect piece of product design.  The production of these may have been managed by the young priestess (acolytes, the little fingers), before progressing to the more senior ranks, the iconography would suggest that many left to have families. If they progress then they first learn how things are made (4), how to exchange them (3), how things work (2) and how to organize (1). The more sophisticated pieces are jaw-droppingly good, such as the Pylos Combat Agate - Wikipedia (calliper compass and 0.06mm milling bits are used to create this seal), it is the finest seal seen before the Enlightenment.  Mythology tells us that the dividing calliper (the geometric compass) was invented by Perdix/Talos (Daedelus’ nephew) which seems to be confirmed by archaeology. The creator is using reference marks and many are referencing the first joint of the thumb if the Minoans organized themselves into disciplines (fingers) and ranks (joints of the digits), the top job is likely being referred to! Wax will not reproduce this find detail, the clever-maker elects to not grind out these details which would only be known to the seal-holder when using a magnifying lens!  There are accounts of automatons (machines) but no examples survive, there is an interesting account of Palace doors which opened by fire (steam). The myth of Daedalus use of mercury is most interesting, mercury is 13.5 times denser than water to do substantially more work, that could both sequence timings, perform work and draw air through a whistle as the mercury escaped from a sealed container, which summarises what these automatons could according to accounts do. From what I have seen they didn’t have gears, they likely used pulleys and weights as a power source, but are possibly exploring the use of steam. None of these early machines survived, there are however mythical accounts of them. When one looks at the precision of the above seal, they have credibility.  We only see the artifacts that survive, largely those in stone and clay, we don’t know much at all of the goods that will have been crafted in wood, leather and cloth.

This sign also appears in Vinča symbols (ca. 5000–4000 BCE) and there is a very good match for the symbols generally as well as Aegean numerals used in Linear A. Linear A signs are derived from slightly early Cretan hieroglyphs  (which seem to be based on early European protowriting), the idea for the syllabary is from Cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, it is likely the scribes some from overseas were tasked with creating an improved writing system (Linear A) but some of the signs it uses are hugely older. The Minoan belief system seems to be based on a hugely old one isolated on the islands! These symbols are not writing, but they do explain that ancient people had signs to express ideas and this is at the time of transition from hunting and gathering to farming.

A count of eight (an eight-year Octaeteris) plus ten, giving a Saros of eighteen years (the period between eclipse, note half this period a Sar between lunar and solar eclipses), these astronomical datum could be marked by bull horns. I do not pretend to fully understand it, but their descendants may have had trade contact with Anatolia across the Black Sea.

Compared to the entire body of Linear A which can be reduced to 2 pages (at normal type size) and is undeciphered. We have to look at things like this and imagine what the recipe might be. One can hazard a guess and I would agree with you, but we can’t be entirely sure! My money is with you on something like meat in a flat pitta bread though (Souvlaki)!  What I do find remarkable, is the Minoans seem to have a knack for firsts, by example archaeologists, use white and black checked rulers to give the scale in pictures, look at the pictorial representation for a peak sanctuary (shown below) and there it is which suggests they were measuring in a scientific manner, they are shown to be using modern conventions and it alludes to a learned society and we know almost NOTHING of what they knew, which might be and likely was a substantial body of knowledge. Peak Minoan is before the Thera eruption (1628 BCE), they try to recover, but they never resume their dominant position in trade.  This summarises the Minoans for me, if they want to observe something they find a way, its as if they challenge the workshop and they seem to come up with the goods. They don’t have optical filters but want to observe the organise ones, the celestial bodies: including Venus passing in front of the Sun, so they use the gentle reflection from a water bowl to observe this, this is a simple effective technique. They know where the celestial bodies will be, but they seem to be constantly checking and measuring, just to make sure! Start with doubts and end in certainties, it's not the ‘scientific method’ of today but does seem to be highly aligned with it.

Which was hypothesized by Plato that predicted this to be 36,000 years and attested to 2nd-century-BC astronomer Hipparchus of not less than 1 degree each century.

Alluding to the Minoans being the first to reasonably accurately estimate the Great Year, 1400 years before Hipparchus and too far greater accuracy. This count is also confirmed on the collar of the Griffons shown in the so-called throne room at Knossos and in Minoan genius iconography also. This was not known to this accuracy until the time of Newton! The same count of 26 is shown on the collar of the Griffons flanking the Throne (room) at Knossos. A modern understanding of long astronomical periods hidden in plain view. The lady that measures got it right!My point being, the Priestess if sat with Newton and without a language barrier could not only understand his theories but possibly had a similar if not a better model of the inner solar system, Newton had a vague notion of Gravity, the Minoans did not. Unlike Netwon, this was being studied by many priestesses for millennia not a single lifetime! In terms of engineering, the Minoans had a similar level of technical capability to that around Newton time, amazingly the hydroengineering is compatible with that of 18th Century CE but is demonstrated from at least 1400 BCE if not before, hot and cold running copper water pipes go to the ‘Queen’s chamber bathroom’, venturi effect injectors are used in interlocking clay pipes, sewers, aqueducts, underfloor heating systems are all technically demonstrated. They had dividing callipers (that are attributed to Talos, Daeduleus’ nephew) and can be shown to be used on artifacts, dramatically improving engineering tolerances, which are as good as micro-milling bits of 60micron (0.06mm) diameter and tool placement precision of 0.015mm, their best engineering is exceptionally good and arguable better than at the time of Newton, accepting they had far fewer materials generally.

The device can predict Saros cycles when the celestial bodies return to their original position (for Eclipse prediction) with 94% accuracy. I firmly believe it is this earlier study of Astronomy that eventually leads to the mechanism, which is the most sophisticated known device in the ancient world.Oral tradition suggests, there were Automaton that entertained audiences with their lifelike appearance and movement, could sing (think whistles as water escapes through a sealed vessel drawing in air), tripod servers of Hephaostos that could enter a dining room, serve food and presumably withdraw, Daedulus’ machines were said to use Mercury which is 13.5 denser than water to do more work. I think they are using liquids as the power source, likely used for sequencing and driving a spindle (through weight) and pully systems. At some point, cogs were invented shown to be used on the Antikythera mechanism. I do not believe the Greeks invented early machines, rather this knowledge was preserved on the Greek islands and written down, it is the recollections of what could be remembered from this time.

The merchant fleet was lost, the ash fallout resulted in global crop failure, the islanders starved others entered the lucrative metal trade space (once a monopoly for all practical purpose), Mycenae invaded and took control of Crete around 1425 BCE. It had a different philosophy, it was territorially expansionist, raiding and piracy replaced trading and production, the regional economy collapsed in Bronze Age Collapse, likely as a result of rivalries seeking control of lucrative metal trade. The world took a different course. The Minoans technology is almost scattered to the four winds around collapse events (three), the Sardinians and Atlas likely pickup the Atlantic silver/tin trade, the Mycenaeans and Luwans (Trojans) fight it out, the Minoan dye and navigation technology go to Phoenicia, the Egyptians buy up land in the Levant with the exchange of seven-years reserves of Grain after Thera. The world becomes smaller, the Minoans have to focus on their survival but do seem to attempt to set up colonies elsewhere (none endured) and largely give up their early fascination with machines that allude to being able to raise outputs significantly, IF they would have continued along this development path. The world doesn’t become globalized until the Age of Discovery. I am not suggesting the Minoan had', 'result': {'fake': 0.201, 'real': 0.799}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'an industrial revolution, rather they were on a trajectory towards one with rapid technical progress, trade and a desire to increase production outputs, they didn’t get there, Thera set them back significantly, they lost their trade monopoly, the world took a different course.', 'result': {'fake': 0.303, 'real': 0.697}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 113, 'credits': 1993915, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""In my opinion, there is only one civilization that is on a course to industrialization before the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, it is Minoan Crete but didn’t quite get there due to a cataclysm. It is the pace and course of technical innovation demonstrated that makes them a potential candidate for industrialization sooner. None of the later civilizations investigated machines in any significant way, they had slave labour, there was no motivation to invest in expensive machines which require very significant development before they become efficient and economically attractive. This said, when they did, the hockey-stick rise in outputs did result and the modern world is entirely dependent on this huge rise in efficiency (see chart). I need to give you some context for this to make sense. Progress isn’t continuous throughout human history, there are setbacks. This is a chart by Ian Morris (a History Professor at Stanford) that considers social development (energy-consumption, record-keeping, organization and war-making) over long time, the West is Egypt and East, China. We can see two pronounced dips in output: Bronze Age Collapse around 1200 BCE and around the time of the Roman empire, there is then a jittery slow recovery in the middle ages (so-called dark ages). My point is the best technology in antiquity was being produced by the Minoan islands is very broadly comparable with just before the Age of Enlightenment in Britain, just before the industrial revolution actually occurred!OK, I appreciate this is a ‘big’ claim and it requires evidence to support it, this is also hampered by there being limited archaeology relating to this time, the Minoans had the first syllabary based writing system in Europe from around 1900 BCE called linear A, although it is thought they used papyrus none of these records survive unlike Egypt where they did. Nonetheless, they left us art that would suggest the Minoans are studying at least Astronomy and the Earth at a scientific level. I’m not going to go into great detail, suffice to say they are recording the magnetic declination from around 1900 BCE, their buildings are aligned to magnet North from this time (they are exploiting naturally occurring iron— magnetite in the Bronze age), they appear to have defined the Great year as a 26,000-year cycle (which was not done to this accuracy to around the age of the enlightenment), they have optical lenses (precision ground rock crystals) and were possibly exploring the properties of light, for those doubting Thomas’ see the link for the archaeology and studies to support this:Nick Deakin · 7moWhat can we not understand about Minoans?There is a lot we do not understand about the Minoans. The written language, Linear A, is not recognized as any known or similar to any archaic language. A few words are recognized (deities, placenames and commodities), we don’t understand the language (the wider picture) or candidly its origin, it is a lost language branch, possibly a hugely old one. We can identify a few of the dots from the archaeological record, but how all these connect is difficult to say. There are generally too few to make a meaningful assessment. One of the few words we commonly use today of Minoan origin is ‘purple,’ after the murex dye that they invented, but most think it is from Phoenicia. The Minoans didn’t give away their advantages, so we get little insight from other cultures other than the goods they imported and occasional records usually relating to trade. Then there is an abundance of highly concentrated dots from archaeology and we don’t know what they mean! An example is hand-made clay figurines purposeful smashed at peak sanctuaries, we have no idea why? It is not like other civilizations such as the Egyptian, Sumerian or Classical Greek world where there is a huge body of written work we can refer to which gives context, all their papyrus records are lost to time. In the case of the Minoans, insight is virtually all based on the archaeological record, it requires analysis (which may not necessarily be correct) and what is mostly found is bric-a-brac, the few fine pieces that are very rare, hint to a sophisticated (for the time) technologically highly progressive society. I would summarise the Minoan society as:\n1) Organised\n2) Scientific\n3) Commercial\n4) Creative and\n5) Lawful What I have described are the characteristics of their deities, respectively: Mother Earth (1), daughter Moon (2), twin and son, the Sun (3), and his consort Venus (4). The lawgiver is Minos (not shown but associated with 3) and is likely the ultimate authority (even over their deities), the thumb(5)! The fingers of the hand!  The Minoans are a new way of thinking that was introduced into Cyclades culture around 2,800 BCE. Cyclades culture at least according to the material art(efacts), should perhaps be considered Mediterranean island art, it suggests the islands were trading tool materials in prehistory. Many would consider this a classic example of Cycladic art.  This piece is actually from Sardinia, Ozieri culture. I’ve purposefully included this as perhaps the early Mediterranean island cultures should be considered more collectively and at least alludes to trade networks, which places the later Minoan civilisation in context. This is Cycladic culture, but you can see they are stylistically similar. The figures don’t have mouths (male or female). Mom’s the word. They look so modern and inspired the modern-art movement, these artifacts are dated from 3,200 BCE, just before the Minoans. The Minoans introduced new practices from around 2800 BCE which define the start of the culture. There is rapid economic growth when Palaces (administration buildings) begin to be constructed, ca 2,000 BCE.  Before this, mariners are moving tool materials such as obsidian (later metals), between islands that are used for distribution to the mainland ports from around 4500 BCE. The founders of Minoan Crete according to myth are considered to be the Dactyls (the fingers), that guard the Idaean caves where according to the seal below metal ingots [metallic money] are kept, and their sisters the Hecaterides being the other hand - Priestess. The thumbs: Herakles (a possible Minos) and High Priestess the Leaders of this society. They see things in these terms, note they are using unusually base 10 numbers (also used for internal accountancy), this I suspect is also related to hexameter verse, used for epics such as Homeric poems and by the Delphic Oracle (likely of Minoan origin), the metered language of statecraft. This seal is important as it puts Minoan society in context. The Minos, top right, is the thumb and law-giver - the ultimate authority according to the seal, the four deities (fingers), top-left branch. The four houses of priestess are shown bottom right which likely have functional duties aligned to their deities, but note a Griffon is shown as a finger, in this way the high priestess upholds the sacred laws. The Minos likely responsible for external affairs and the High Priestess the internal affairs of the island. There is a level of speculation in this paragraph! Without doing so, it is difficult to make any progress into how this society is actually structured, which is my main point!  An aside, if we assume that The Eleusinian Mysteries: The Rites of Demeter are based on the Bees shown above (Mother Earth and Daughter Moon or in Greek terms Demeter and Persephone/Artemis), then it may explain why initiates had no fear of death after they learned the secret. The Griffon protects long-time (the Great Year, a 26,000-year cycle, as mother Earth wobbles backwards throughout the Ages due to precession of the equinox, what may be pole stars are often presented on the Griffons wing which changes with the Ages), the other deities represent a shorter period of time well within a human lifetime: Earth day, Lunar Month, Solar Year and five visibility cycles of Venus (eight-years plus one or two days, I had previously thought nine was shown using inclusive counting, however, further review would suggest a Venusian and lunisolar calendars are maintained concurrently). People fear the unknown, but the Minoans understand Astronomy, they seek to better understand the cycles of life, nature! There is nothing to fear, each generation is an integral part of this process (humanity collectively). Do you see a throne or a model of the workings of the (inner) solar system and how this is observed by (Mother) Earth? As this story unfolds the Minoan visual language to express abstract concepts will I hope become more clear. See if you can identify features that may represent, solstice and equinox, the angular tilt of Mother Earth and even her processional period, and specifically a nine-year term in office.  Fig. 27. Photomontage of the north wall of the Throne Room. Prepared by and courtesy of Ute Günkel-Maschek. THE POWER OF IMAGES: RE-EXAMINING THE WALL PAINTINGS FROM THE THRONE ROOM AT KNOSSOS My own view is this is the chair for the high priestess, in charge of the priestess and internal resources of the island. Many have commented that the shape of the seat is more suited to a female. N.B. The place is constructed to observe natural order, noting the reference to their deities. Credit: Calendar House.  The Minos is the law giver, defending the island and accumulating metal ingots from trade and tribute. Neither the Palace’s (magazines) or Caves of Minos (treasury) may represent personal wealth but rather the island's (public) treasury but under their control. There is a lot of evidence to suggest investment in public works, such as sophisticated engineering works to bring water into the city and take waste away (Minoan hydroengineering is considered to be comparable with 18th-century common-era Europe). The Minoans are secretive, they don’t give away their advantage. We can see some technology transfer that occurs around collapse events (Thera eruption 1628 BCE, Mycenaen invasion 1450 BCE and Bronze Age collapse 1200 BCE; likely when some left to set up new colonies). Let's assess each of the four pillars (fingers) and leaders (thumbs) of this society and what we don’t know about each. With a focus on the administrators, the priestess (shown bottom-right) which left more in the archaeology record.  1). Organisation - The Priestess of Mater Theia (Demeter), Mother Earth - Winter, North and Earth day: I-DA-MA-TE Internal affairs are managed by the Priestess (bottom-right, far right being the embodiment of Mother Earth: the Mother Superior) with likely corresponding roles to their deities (top-left, the second figure from the left is Demeter), each can express a cardinal direction (North in this case), seasons (winter) and time of day (midnight), so possibly priestess of each house had corresponding geographic, seasonal or workshift duties in this society. The Mother Superior is likely shown behind the altar and possibly partner to the Minos, this is unclear. The etymology of Demeter being interesting, I-DA-MA-TE in linear A. It is an agglutinative language (glued together), it references Mount Ida and mountain caves are where they kept the metallic metal ingots as shown above. Using Indo-European root etymologies -DA means to divide. -MA is Mother and -TE wheat, in effect, Mountain Mother storing the islands (winter) Grain which can be summarised as: I - Divide - Mother - Wheat (e.g thresh it at an individual level, or take a proportion of it (tax) in administrative terms), this is possibly a much older belief system orginating in Anatolia at the cusp of the agricultural revolution, in this context the main axis makes more sense: female votive (Earth Mother) are associated with (gathering) grain, a male deity hunting (son). Sky Father seem to be silent but represents the wider Universe. I would argue that astronomy is much old. The Minoans see things in terms of continuing the generations (those shown with upheld hands). This may have been no hereditary King Minos and Queen, but King Minos is referred to in some accounts but maybe how other cultures and city-states describe Minoan leaders, other cultures would not have a term to describe what may have been leaders appointed on talent (by trials) with a limited term in office at this time, somewhere between a Kreterocracy (the strong) and Kritarchy (judges). Even the word etymologies seem to refer to Crete! Later Greek myth hints to this, ‘Minos was last to leave the Arena’ and ‘went to the Caves (Ida) to consult with Zeus every nine years (to bring in new laws),’ note the nine Olives of victory on the seal, Minos means nine and likely represents a Sar (half a Saros of eighteen year - the period between a lunar and solar eclipse) and possibly a term in office for the War-chief (Minos) and High Priestess (Mother Superior), noting the nine Olives of Victory associated with Minos on the seal and the nine solar discs (ridges) on the back of Mother Superiors chair in the palace of Knossos. There is some evidence that may suggest this convention originated in Anatolia in prehistory (by example - nine snakes (years) are shown on t-pillars at Gobekli Tepe which terminate at an Auroch (bull) - the Master of (Domesticated) Animals being implied - possibly the term for the leader of the hunt and the law-giver of the local tribes which came to feast at the site). A snake’s ribs are sufficient in number to count the days in the year, it makes a logical sign to express a year or the datum of when this was counted from marking the beginning of a new year and its end. This may suggest leaders were selected by a series of trials, by talent (there is wider but somewhat limited iconography that supports a gauntlet of military trials and selection process), both the Minos and Mother Superior may need to jump the bull to obtain (public) office. Is this a bull-leaper or a potential Mother Superior in charge of the Priestess?  If the high priestess, likely to be confident and talented: ‘strong’ leaders of external (Minos) and internal affairs of state (Mother Superior) and would be the world’s first republic (although appointment by talent rather than vote), though how each might of been selected is not known, however, a silver cup shows the last fourth trials to be a knife fight. The art alludes to leaders being appointed by a series of trials, it does not concretely confirm it. I get a sense of equality between the sexes, however, each has a clear role. Challenges and life are generally shown to be addressed as a couple. The frescos from Thera (Santorini) tends to suggest each gender was schooled separately, the boys in defence (e.g. boxing) and trade, and girls in nature and organization. Each seems to excel at what they do. Minoan art and artefacts are well executed, they take pride in their white hulled ships and the priestess are well organized, they are to use a modern-term professional. There is an unusual passage in the London Medical Papyrus (found in Egypt but thought to be of Minoan origin), this describes an acolyte explaining how her master would quell and overthrow Southern Egypt if provoked (e.g. trade stopped), it uses the analogy of bull-leaping to explain this, the Master composing himself as the bull charges and uses a firm grip to grasp the horns and the bull bucking their head to somersault over the challenge, to become leaders in this society, would you mess with the lady shown above? Minoan accountancy records are reasonably well understood, the Palace set quota for farms (which implies that they survey fields to establish potential crop yields), variance is monitored and carry over balances to the next accounting period (harvest). There appears to be a system of credit/deposit used by at least the elites, which are calling down commodities from Palaces magazines (stores) using personal seals and settled presumably at harvest or on payday. Recall that the four deities also represent periods of time, the Minoans have Gold Palace tokens which are in use from around 1800 BCE. Rosettes are used to represent any one of the four deities but are context-specific, when items are shown at the periphery in art it can mean to divide by the number shown, it is employed as a fractional denominator. So 1/2 Lunar month, confirmed by the 14 Earth days on the header: the bees! Please note the Minoans are the first to articulate a seven-day week, a moon phase. The deities assist this society in practical matters of everyday life, days, month, years and a term in office for the leaders. Please note this is particular piece is dated to around 600 BCE, but tends to suggest that the Islands continue Minoan accounting practice to some extent, the conventions of Earth day, Lunar month and fractions in iconography can be attested to Minoan times which specifically use these signs and conventions.  Many examples exist showing gold tokens being issued (so-called roundels) and are found in quantity in hordes (many in Mycenae), they likely represent work done, a month's salary (see below). These tokens do seem to be carried on the person, however, are often presented as jewellery (note the armbands in frescos, they are worn by men and women, these also show filagree counts defining days or weeks), I think it likely they are used for payments for big-ticket or capital items or to set up a Palace account at another location, which day to day items can then be called down against using personal seals. Many will have worked away from their homes (Sailors and Priestess assigned to a peak sanctuary) so seem to carry their wealth (money) with them. An important aspect of this is, is that the economy is pegged to actual work done by professional classes and value is unwritten in gold bullion, this is a great basis to build an economy, the gold standard. How extensive the use of Palace currency was is difficult to say, however, seems to include the Priestess and possibly the elites, landed and merchant classes. This suggests Palace administration had a basis for converting a commodity into Palace currency (a measure of work done), they are trading in city-state surpluses and each needs metal (see trade, the seven dots in a circle are likely the seven metals of antiquity— metal ingots), you can also see the petal motif (rosette, shown below on the Phaistos Disc, the first example of printing). Archaeologists generally assume that accounting records show quantities for a commodity if we assume that they have a base currency some may be showing a table of equivalence for exchange. These tokens which feature silk moths, bees or rosettes, facilitate quick transactions or could have been used to purchase stock in port to trade at other ports or pay crew! It is a brilliant instrument of trade, no weighing, just count the tokens. No material tests are needed. It is also likely they had assaying tests as did the Egyptians for gold purity, but you don’t need them with these, they're issued by the Palace, a trusted source. What an idea, for all practical purposes: money!  We just don’t know how sophisticated these systems were but allude to banking functions, with some accounting records to suggest, seed-corn loans to set up farms in the next growing year, an organised economy which is modelled on a bee colony, the island their food source, the Palace administration being the hive. The Priestess of Demeter (Queen bee) are likely planning to store sufficient grain to get at least the Palace, but possibly the island through the barren winter months and growing year through to the next harvest. The harvest is likely gathered or overseen by the Priestess of Potnia Theron (also a reference to Autumn, worker bees), collectively the Bees. Shortfalls would need to be made up through trade (Summer) and seed sown (spring), which perhaps is how what appear to be the four houses of priestess may have been organised (keep this in mind as the story unfolds). Each deity can refer to a cardinal direction, season or period of time, context gives the intended meaning. N.B. The first acknowledged silver coinage is from Lydia, coins are issued by the Temple of Potnia Theron (or ‘worker’ bees in Minoan terms, which we’ll look at next). Continuing with the Queen Bees colony…. We can see one of many underground grain silos outside the palace of Knossos and ‘hidden’ underfloor storage for more precious things in banks of palace magazines (two shown, there are many). People will have paid their tax in either goods or produce. The priestess kept Sacred Groves where likely specialist plants were cultivated, in the introduction to the London Medical Papyrus suggests healers were from the House of Potnia Theron (eloquently expressed as: “the moonbeams illuminates all pages”) or reported into these priestesses (and not Apollo which is normally associated with healing and medicine in later Greek tradition, unless it is those of the Master (Apollo) that are the medical practitioners and those of Potnia Theron (Mistress) that are responsible for the medicine cabinet - sacred groves, which were likely, not dissimilar to Kew Gardens, that gather seeds and plants from around the known world and cultivate them and NO-ONE is allowed to harm them, they are sacred, it's the islands medicine cabinet). What is shown below is commodity storage (grain bulks) and more precious things would be stored in magazines (included hidden underneath: treasury), but they seem to value (exotic) growing things just as much, such as saffron, murex for dyes, sea silk, honey (some of the first beehives) and controversially opium poppies which are likely stored in the pots above. Another possibility is that the priestess of Potnia Theron that look after female patients (noting this deity gives and takes female life) while those of Apollo gives (treats) and takes male life, in later traditions. Like many things in the Minoan world it is not entirely clear how the Minoans organised themselves.  Artifacts and frescos suggest at least a very good understanding of Astronomy (the Minoans have already defined most of the periods used on the much later Antikythera mechanism which can be inferred by fresco borders, here is a quick example: 49 lunar months are shown in the two horizontal borders, a four year Olympiad when they add an intercalated 13th month to keep the solar and lunar calendar aligned, the month possibly referred to as Ophiuchus (the Snake bearer constellation). The 14 verticle devices are likely referring to years, collectively a Saros cycle of 18 years (when all the celestial bodies return to their original position, useful to predict eclipses, which other artifacts suggest they could do). Splitting these in two graphic devices using the Minoan convention implies to divide the total into two - 18/2= 9 years (a reoccurring theme: a nine-year Sar or half an eighteen year Saros). I believe this slightly unusual convention is to show when a 13th month is to be added in a given year, every 2nd, 4th and 7th year in a nine-year Sar cycle to keep the lunar and solar calendar aligned.  Ophiuchus (the snake bearer constellation) is likely represented by the so-called ‘snake goddess’. Would you call the month the Olympic games celebrated a goddess? It's likely a symbol representing this celebration and likely used as a navigational constellation also (the snake bearer's elbow is similar to Orion’s belt but on the opposite side of the night sky). One male the other female, the Minoan seem to have this balance between genders but with clearly defined roles.  In my opinion, the so-called Minoan snake goddess represents the constellation of Ophiuchus giving the 13th intercalated ‘leap’ month inserted each second, fourth and seven year in a nine-year Sar cycle, the fourth year period giving an Olympiad, so it may be these leap months when games took place. Similarly, the so-called Poppy goddess is also another symbol associated with I-DA-MA-TE (Demeter). This house of priestesses directs the colony to ensure a winter food supply - the Queen bee, they likely work out of Knossos (noting this is to the North of Crete). 2). Science/Technology (the art of Science) - Autumn, West, Sunset, Month - The Priestess of Potnia Theron (Artemis or Mistress of Wild Animals) There are certain things in the archaeological archive which allude to the study of nature (Physics), we don’t know how scientific this was? There are NO written documents that record astronomy. There are myths of Herakles (thumb) and his brother (the Dactyls: fingers) introducing running races to the mainland, but that is all. There is a story behind the games, it's based upon an improved understanding of time using this visual language (it's difficult to ignore once you know it exists, it is constantly being referred to in art but gets overlook because its pretty, it also contains technical information usually relating to the Minoan calendar). Astronomy is all shown in artwork and artifacts, so what they actually know about astronomy can’t easily be concretely confirmed, we just see the correct periods being shown in art, NOT how they worked this out. The artifacts suggest it may be very advanced for the time, Minoans have devices to calculate astronomical periods, including eclipses using Saros cycles with 94% accuracy, in the 16th century BCE. This is a casting stone to make many copies in likely bronze. The lunar device is shown on the right, noting the first recorded use of a seven-day week with it (a moon phase), the lunar month device (right) flip-flops before advancing a position on the solar device on the left (allowing a 29.5 day synodic lunar month to be maintained by adding an intercalated day every alternative month - e.g. when the device flops before advance a position), a full rotation of the lunar device (right) around the solar device (left) being a four year Olympiad, years being given at quarters. It’s nowhere near as complex as the Antikythera mechanism but one can see there on a trajectory to a more sophisticated device. Critically this would allow an Olympiad of 49 and alternatively 50 months to be maintained. One at least gets a sense of a regularized calendar to emulate the movement of the celestial bodies (their deities).  My gut feeling (which is entirely speculative, is they may have experimented with water computers, a machine constructed by Daedalus was said to run on mercury, which is 13.5 times denser than water, to sequence and perform work as a weight turn a spindle for example, there is nothing in the archaeological archive to support this but is hinted at in oral tradition as automatons, moving ‘life-like’ statues). I would not underestimate Minoan technical ability, the myth of Daedulus’ hang glider describes a cambered wing with a tapered leading edge and elliptical trailing edge (in planform) and a minimum gliding sink rate of 1:18 (5 degrees), this angle is unambiguously referred to using Orion’s sword (star M42!) How on earth do they know this! This sink rate is about right for a trainer glider. Aero-engineers (which I am) jaws will drop on reading the orginal account, it requires some interpretation as they lack the modern terms to describe these things, but it's all described, they must have at least built a hand-launched model to understand flight performance and if you think they didn’t have the materials to build one, think again, they had the finest linen (AKA aerolinen - that the first aircraft used to skin wings) - Icarus is accredited with the sail, the Minoans built ultralight Sheilds using wicker cores, had tree resins, even turpentine solvents (to seal but beeswax would do) and the best leatherworkers, this is all you actually need! The account is truly jaw-dropping what is described is way before its time. It is likely both solar and astronomical observations were made at peak sanctuaries and if you look carefully note the measuring devices. Poles to align astronomical targets (stars) and mark their passage for timekeeping (this method also being used in Egypt at this time). Peak sanctuaries have a commanding view of both the shipping lanes and farms which area could be measured to set quota (and tax) confirmed by records (the numbering system - called Aegean numerals and commodities are reasonably well understood in Linear A although the language is not). Geometry in its first form is the study (measurement) of land area. Candidly at least one of the function for Peak Sanctuaries must have included astronomical observation, in all the depictions metrology (measurement) and instrumentation are shown.  There is a sense that Minoans wanted to understand the underlying rules of nature. It's extraordinary what they seem to know, changes in magnetic declination are recorded by building orientation (this alludes to Earth Science), this is confirmed by oral tradition the Dactyls are accredited with discovering the lodestone (compass) but this is generally accredited to the Chinese and much later in history. Magnetite is available on the island of Skyros. There are 34 markings on the periphery, recall that they use a convention of fractional denominators to divide by the number shown, so 1/34 x 360 degrees is 10.6 degrees. This is the declination from magnetic North to true North when the Kernos is dated to around 1825 BCE    . The main marking is orientated West to indicate the direction to True North. There is a significant change around this time and likely why this was being monitored, to inform maritime high sea navigation. This is what we would call today, Earth Science and it's being studied in 1800 BCE! Were the Minoans purposefully orientating their building to monitor changes in magnetic declination from around 1900 BCE or just using compasses to orientate their buildings?  Inspection of the Bulgarian ARC shows a large and rapid declination amplitude swing of about 16, from ~ 1850 BC, Declination = +18.56 0 to ~1770 BC. Declination = +2.580 (Kovacheva et al, 1998). We can see why they might be doing so below, there is a large change in magnetic declination around this time. This seems to be recorded at two sites East and West of the Mediterranean with differing declinations, it occurred to me that if they used this for building orientation, it is likely they had devices on ships and taking a reading at midday using a shadow stick would give them an estimate of their passage West or East. Not a great deal of evidence for this but that that exists alludes to this application.  http://maajournal.com/Issues/2011/Vol11-1/2_Downey.pdf Update: another found, in Iberia (using cup and ring markers):  Minoans had optical instruments. These lenses were found in a mountaintop cave. Their understanding of physics (an example of Minoan optics shown below) may well be comparable to that of the time of Newton, I would argue it could have been better, they will have been considering the motion of the planets for many centuries, not a single lifetime. They preserve a hugely old tradition of astronomy first recorded by artifacts from Çatalhöyük founded in the seventh millennium BCE and Tepe, yes, this tradition is that old and they use some of the same symbols recorded on some of the oldest stone tablets found at this site too, which are present in Vinca symbols (split wood was used to record linear incisions which are very similar to Linear A and with some identical symbols) and used around the Balkans around 5000 BCE which may be the parent writing system to Linear A and Aegean numerals.  In any event, they have the most advanced theoretic model of the solar system of the time. This point can NOT be understated and is difficult to ignore, although a degree of interpretation is required in evaluating Minoan art (which seem to refer to precise astronomical periods), some appear to greater accuracy than in the classic Greek period and arguably is comparable to that of the time of the enlightenment in Newton’s time. Conventions such as a week (lunar phases) and hours all seem to be shown way before history records they are ‘first’ defined, not in this case by the written record but in Minoan art! The device below often features in fresco borders and on altars of peak sanctuaries, it summarises their observable solar model, it has 12 petals (hours) on each side, 24 hours in the day, the spirals represent solstices (top and bottom) and equinox (middle spiral), there are 12 marks (hours) at equinoxes. A careful review of Tell el-Daba fresco fragments alludes to further subdivision into 5. This precedes the conventionally attested dating of the “Egyptian 24-hour” established in 127 BCE and the minute attested to Ptolemy in the 2nd century . The Minoans have a visual language to express astronomical concepts defining time. There are no written works to confirm this, just what appears at first glance to be ‘pretty” borders.  I’ve just realised what this fresco is referring to, its an eight-year Octaeteris with five visibility cycles of Venus! Each whole device is a year with two equinoxes of equal length of twelve hours. I have been intreged by when Minoan might have leaped the bull, it seems to be when an intercalated month is added, it needs to be done three times each Sar to keep the lunar and solar calendar aligned, I think this may be on the second, fourth and seven year. This may well have been shown in this fresco but as you can see it is missing many areas. What did they think was keeping the celestial bodies in orbit? They hint to gravity in family relationships, one deity (celestial body) is bound to the other (in orbit), the maiden daughter Moon to mother Earth, consort Venus to the Sun. Note the deities are expressed backwards, they do this when referred to the deities as celestial bodies (the organized ones) which do rotate and orbit counterclockwise confirmed in the frieze spirals (outwards) above. You can only tell the story chronologically, mother Earth then daughter Moon (with bow), son (Sun) and his lady consort (Venus), aligned with myth of the founding of Delos and birth order of Artemis and Apollo. The artist usually give hints but if they want to, for example, refer to seasons they would place the deities in calendar order. There must have been entire codex of mathematics, the study of the celestial bodies and astronomy and we know next to NOTHING about. What we have is art that confirms the correct number counts for astronomical periods without written proof of how this was determined.  Mother Earth giving a DAY, daughter Moon giving a Lunar MONTH, son giving a Solar Year and consort an eight-year Octaeteris of Venus. I have been trying to find the earliest reference so these deities can be attested, I found a similar scene, it shows the Love Birds (Son/Master and Consort) and Bees (Mother and daughter), although individual deities may be shown before this time in Anatolia. Catalhoyuk: ca, 5750 BCE (just before this settlement was abandoned). It is perhaps not as sophisticated as the Minoan system but seems to be the basis of the latter belief system. After this, we seem to have references to the Master of Animals (Apollo) and Mistress of Animals (Artemis), the twins (giving sun and moonlight): its needed at this time to make the Astronomical Age: Gemini (6000–4000 BCE) which appear just before sunrise on the spring equinox. My gut feeling is those from Catalhoyuk may have migrated to around Vinca which is founded at this time - they use similar iconography and calendar conventions, they may have moved to access this new tool material - copper is mined in high quantity. My gut feeling was a group from Catalhoyuk when across the Black Sea in search of these new materials (copper) which is confirmed by DNA studies, the Vinca live along side the hunter and gatherers, have the same funeral practices and somewhat critical use similar symbolism and take signs with them that become Vinca script which seems to encapsurate Aegean numbers.  What is presented as the Minoan religion, is based on observation (good science) and their deities are practical and underpin society, their deities are (or become) associated with the celestial bodies and they are more regular than clockwork, they define time (keeping). Their belief system is possibly based on a hugely old one (shown above when fully articulated), but earlier symbols and conventions can be traced back to the first calendar used at Göbekli Tepe and better qualified by artifacts from Çatalhöyük, alluded to by symbols used for Mother Earth (shown on the blouse tapes in the Demeter Fresco, shown later) and ‘H’, serif ‘I’, that may represent solstice and equinox, sometimes shown as reversed parenthesis )(, endure to Minoan times and are presented herein, in Luwian, its meaning is thought to be ‘god’ but the original meaning may be more; ‘natural order’, the repeated and observable cycles of life (the celestial bodies defining time). Another example is the Labrys - Wikipedia, it could well be a symbol of Minoan power, but it looks like an instrument to me, one can trace the technology transfer to Phoenicia which becomes straight-edged and eventually led to the Jacob's staff (the first recognized marine sextant). The axe heads can slide on the shaft which as you can see below have markings. The original device is more useful it can signal (flat copper plates riveted together, gold in some cases for smaller devices). Many have postulated its use, it both reflects light and casts a shadow. It may have been used for timekeeping and navigation, as well as having ceremonial significance, my own view is it became culturally significant as it was a useful tool.  There is line-of-sight between peak sanctuaries, Labyrs likely did have many functions, not least providing navigational fire beacons at night for the small wooden boats (less than ten oars, see below, Minoan white hulled ships are likely produced by Palace-controlled workshops and licensed, plain wooden hulls (non-Minoan) would be easy to identify to potentially duty, levied on shipping coming through their territorial waters - those with plain wooden hulls). The later Greeks did have signalling systems  (by example the fall of Troy is communicated to Argos by island fire signals within hours) and these may have earlier origin using simple flashes from these reflective copper mirrors (that are substantially flat being gravity cast into a thin sheet, they would be hopeless if used as an actual axe).  Today, the association of Zeus with lightning bolts is one of myth, however in a Minoan context, possibly identifies a) a critical process: lightning striking magnetite from Skyros to make it magnetized, a lodestone (compass) - if you have one, you can find more! and b) possibly a reference to Minoan maritime practice, the peak sanctuaries had all the optical tools to identify plain hulls on the horizon and if they are flashing signals to Minoan vessels to intercept, board and secure a proportion of cargo (duty), it could explain the myth. Peak Sanctuaries have often over 200kms unobstructed line of sight to the horizon (and to other peak sanctuaries) from a ship's deck this is limited to around 4kms. If the boarded were given a token (with Zeus' mark) so duty is only levied once, it may explain why Zeus became so revered, if he is taxing everyone passing through territorial waters. Like lightning, a ship sees a flash of light from a peak, the next thing a white hull intercepts and there is the thunder of a boarding party inspecting the cargo (somewhat god-like power). Lightning can be read as star-axe. The etymology of Labrys alludes to this ‘narrow street’ a beam of (reflected) sunlight.  Signals over huge distances may seem to be advanced for the time but there are early written accounts of this [5]: Then the lovely goddess wrapped his head up in a golden cloud, so from him\na fiery light blazed out. Just like those times when smoke from a city stretches all the way to heaven, rising in the distance from an island under siege by an enemy, where men fight all day long in Ares' hateful war, struggling for their city then at sunset, they light fires one by one, beacons flaming upwards to attract attention from those on near-by islands, so their ships will come to save them from [the] destruction that's how the light blazed then from Achilles' head right up to heaven. Iliad Book 18 Aeschylus writes in Agamemnon that fire signals were used to send the message from Troy to the city Argos of the victory by the Greeks (1184 BC ?). Only after a few hours the message reached the c. 600 km distant city of Argos. Evidence of the use of fires outside peak sanctuaries is widely reported in the literature. Large labrys of 3m in height are found and could have been rested on so-called ‘horns of consecration’, wear and repair is present on the below example. The archaeology seems to confirm these early accounts of mirror signalling and fire beacons. This is what the military call today C4ISTAR and I recognize it as I’ve worked (as a contractor) for MOD labs.  This curious device once again ‘alludes’ to Labyrs being used as instruments as dots of light project through the device to illuminate the altar table shown at peak sanctuaries. Although I have not determined the exact function, we can see the use of 6 holes on the outside edge of one side, which could be counted on the front of the altar table, there are then 6 horizontal markers to the centre giving 12 dots on what I think is likely illuminating dots on the top of the table to midday, the other side giving 24 in total throughout the daylight hours in half-hour increments. This could be very clever and simply give the correct level of illuminated dots on the altar table (front and top) for any given day of the year. The difference to 24 could then be confirmed at night from the passage of reference stars to the horizon. Although there is a degree of speculation this seems plausible. If this is correct, it summarises the Minoan technology, it is elegantly simple but hugely capable. Simple is hard! The first example of a digital clock could well be this, count the illuminated dots on the altar table you have the time of day using sunlight! Experimental archaeology may give insight into the applications of these types of devices from peak sanctuaries.  Sunshine & Daylight Hours in Heraklion, Crete, Greece. The longest day of the year is 14:23 hours long and the shortest day is 9:36 hours long. The markings at least seem to confirm the longest day by 14 (hours) by the vertical chevrons in the middle. The 8 horizontal chevrons allude to the shortest day. Its function is hinted at but not sufficiently articulated to be easily understood (very Minoan).  It is NOT entirely clear what is being practised, peak sanctuaries markers seem to be constructed to measure. Monitoring coast approaches, surveying field areas to establish farm quota (tax) and astronomical observation are possibilities. This is likely one of their functions but how are they achieving this? One gets a sense of this from mythology: Rhea who lived on Crete is the wife to Chronos and her offspring was Zeus, bring in the age of the Olympians. They really did have gifts from the gods, they seem to be making them! 3). Trade and Commerce - Summer - The Master of Animals (Apollo, the Sun), Summer, midday, year. External affairs (such as trade and defence) are managed by the men in this society, this civilization imported raw materials from three continents (ivory from Africa, lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, obsidian, metals from all four corners) and produced high-value trade goods, that everyone desired. It is likely that the Priestess of the Master of Animals (Apollo) are coordinating the production of these goods in workshops, deliver to the port for exchange with city-states in the Aegean and wider Mediterranean. I’m a technologist and I get a sense of look at this and this (cool tech), in their frescos around this time, they are really going places. These ships are excellent (deployable freestanding masts, what may be devices that deflect in wind to give an indication of crosswinds).  The fleet is not hanging around, they drop off and pick-up goods in port (ideally islands, as evident in the islet port at the mouth of the Nile in Egypt), it is local merchants that likely organize the exchange with the mainland.  Token markers MAY have been used as a form of ticket for tradespeople or evidence of the fulfilment of contracts, there is evidence that Minoans were supplying engineers and architects for large projects (such as palaces) in the wider region, we can see some of these trades above (hammer - mason, set square - architect, saw - woodworker). Also perhaps used as a receipt when commodities were supplied to port for shipping and the suppliers account credited when the imprinted receipt was presented to the Palace (that is likely placing these orders and co-ordinating shipping manifests).  The issue is that no papyrus records survive to confirm the quantum of transactions, it is suspected significant Palace accounts existed on papyrus (the main writing medium), as clay nodules are found with multiple seal marks (sealing the palace transactional accounts), it is the equivalent of audited accounts, signed off by the administrators (priestess). There is evidence of shipping inventories with KU-RO (checksum) totals for the complete manifest. I find it interesting that the Papyrus symbol is also shown with magazines on the Phaistos disc, possible Knossos and Naxos where commodities were traded with warehousing and the transaction would need to be recorded. We really just have bits (dots) of the total picture. 4). Creation - workshops - Priestess of A-SA-SA-RA-ME (the ‘Lady’, Venus - consort to the Master) - Associated with Spring, sunrise, Octaeteris. Minoans are producing some of the best goods available at this time, masterly crafted, but even the everyday items are very well made. This is just a wonderfully simple product, nothing it doesn’t need and this embodies the previous Cycladic culture, representing the essence, removing the unnecessary. A perfect piece of product design.  The production of these may have been managed by the young priestess (acolytes, the little fingers), before progressing to the more senior ranks, the iconography would suggest that many left to have families. If they progress then they first learn how things are made (4), how to exchange them (3), how things work (2) and how to organize (1). The more sophisticated pieces are jaw-droppingly good, such as the Pylos Combat Agate - Wikipedia (calliper compass and 0.06mm milling bits are used to create this seal), it is the finest seal seen before the Enlightenment.  Mythology tells us that the dividing calliper (the geometric compass) was invented by Perdix/Talos (Daedelus’ nephew) which seems to be confirmed by archaeology. The creator is using reference marks and many are referencing the first joint of the thumb if the Minoans organized themselves into disciplines (fingers) and ranks (joints of the digits), the top job is likely being referred to! Wax will not reproduce this find detail, the clever-maker elects to not grind out these details which would only be known to the seal-holder when using a magnifying lens!  There are accounts of automatons (machines) but no examples survive, there is an interesting account of Palace doors which opened by fire (steam). The myth of Daedalus use of mercury is most interesting, mercury is 13.5 times denser than water to do substantially more work, that could both sequence timings, perform work and draw air through a whistle as the mercury escaped from a sealed container, which summarises what these automatons could according to accounts do. From what I have seen they didn’t have gears, they likely used pulleys and weights as a power source, but are possibly exploring the use of steam. None of these early machines survived, there are however mythical accounts of them. When one looks at the precision of the above seal, they have credibility.  We only see the artifacts that survive, largely those in stone and clay, we don’t know much at all of the goods that will have been crafted in wood, leather and cloth. In some cases, we can see that their clothing is hugely sophisticated for the time from frescos and it is now known they developed murex dyes (blue to red tones through purple, depending on how it is processed). Textile technologists have speculated that they may have ‘printed’ some of these more complex repeated patterns. The embodiment of Mother Earth (Demeter) is shown below. Look how good the textiles actually are. The fashion industry today recognizes it. I’ve just noticed this, I look all the time at Minoan art and I’ve missed this, they are using vail or gauze (semi-transparent on the outer edges of the flounced skirt, the very finest weave, erm, I’ve been wondering about the materials they had, wool for the masses, some linen and I think this is silk (from moths or seasilk are the likely sources, these were known in Cos around Minoan collapse, this is not unusual if Minoans find something new and useful they seem to cultivate it or import it), I can’t now think of a material known at this time that they didn’t have, this is not just silk, its the finest weave, Organza before 1628 BCE and the Chinese couldn’t dye it blue!  The Minoans are really good at all the creative pursuits and are excellent designers generally (and engineers, a topic on its own).  I find this jaw-dropping! The artifacts below are from Anatolia (over six millennia before the above fresco is made). Note the use of this symbol.  Linear A symbol 122 shown on the tape sections of the bodice above. See the bottom-left tablet (middle symbol), the same. The symbol on the right of this tablet is likely shown upside down, the ‘V’ is likely a reference to grain between years (shown by snakes - they have approximately this number of ribs as days in the year, a natural abacus). It also contains a Linear A syllabary sign for RE (upside down), possibly a reference to Rhea. These symbols are also shown on the body of the bodice above. This sign also appears in Vinča symbols (ca. 5000–4000 BCE) and there is a very good match for the symbols generally as well as Aegean numerals used in Linear A. Linear A signs are derived from slightly early Cretan hieroglyphs  (which seem to be based on early European protowriting), the idea for the syllabary is from Cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, it is likely the scribes some from overseas were tasked with creating an improved writing system (Linear A) but some of the signs it uses are hugely older. The Minoan belief system seems to be based on a hugely old one isolated on the islands! These symbols are not writing, but they do explain that ancient people had signs to express ideas and this is at the time of transition from hunting and gathering to farming. Update: the tablet on the right is showing grain, the snakes I think mean years, so this could be read as stored grain in-between years, specifically referring to I-DA-MA-TE: Demeter. These symbols are being used in the same contextual context. Further details here. This is shown on the sleave of Demeter's bodice in red. There aren’t many of these tablets found in Anatolia, but their use seems to continue and are used in old European proto-scripts too. These tablets are 6000 years old when the above fresco was made and they use the same symbols and critically in the same context. It's not writing (a few symbols) but may well have led to a proto-writing system a few millennia later and this it would appear does lead to Linear A!  Update: I found this recently on the internet, it proports to be from Gobekli Tepe.  The fourth cardinal direction is shown by Bull horns (South - these were used in prehistory to mark the position of a celestal body at a datum. This convention seems to be shown on a mammoth tusk from Ukraine (dated to ca 17,000 BCE). N.B. The bull's horns may be separated by a degree off south for solstice and equinox, see Analemma. A count of eight (an eight-year Octaeteris) plus ten, giving a Saros of eighteen years (the period between eclipse, note half this period a Sar between lunar and solar eclipses), these astronomical datum could be marked by bull horns. I do not pretend to fully understand it, but their descendants may have had trade contact with Anatolia across the Black Sea.  Compare this to a Minoan peak sanctuary, they are still being used to align celestial bodies defining datums…  Returning to Minoa, this is a rare example of a wooden table trapped in the pumice from Thera, it is Chippindale quality (some of the fidelity is lost in the plaster cast). It’s not found in a palace, it is from an everyday dwelling on Thera.  There is some evidence of batch production, a master craftsperson makes the former that the appendices could hammer to shape, silver cups illustrate the point. They are at the cusp of industrializing (but never quite got there, due to calamities, note the ladies with third legs (walking sticks) to climb up the mountains to peak-sanctuaries where they can observe the coastal approaches), the female hand supports the other and visa versa.  5). Minos - the lawgiver - the thumb There is so little that is known about the Minos and the little that is known is myth. There is an interesting linear A text which refers to the Minos, it is an accountancy record of his staff: three! Though to be a batman (cleans clothes), a stable master and a craftsman (Daedalus which I believe is a position, there is just too much invention for one man). Not many staff, the Minos may have been a job rather than an inherited title (royalty).  The panel to the top right may give some insight into how a Minos (law-giver) was appointed, four different events are shown possibly, the last is a knife fight (perhaps celebrated on the ninth year- Sar), Minos was said to be last to leave the arena and went to the caves to consult with Zues every nine-years to bring in new laws according to oral tradition! We can potentially see the dots, the question is if they are being joined up correctly?  What campaigns did the many Minos take on? What were the laws of the Sea and of Trade? What and where are their law treatise? We have no idea. They must have been quite good as a later Spartan lawgiver sent an emissary to learn how the Cretan (and Egyptians) govern when considering reform of the Spartan state.  I’ve tried to give a sense in this post of where the edges might be so the reader can see how little we actually know about the Minoans, compared to say Egypt and Sumer, which candidly we know much more about as there are entire libraries of documents, which include such things as their favourite recipes. Compared to the entire body of Linear A which can be reduced to 2 pages (at normal type size) and is undeciphered. We have to look at things like this and imagine what the recipe might be. One can hazard a guess and I would agree with you, but we can’t be entirely sure! My money is with you on something like meat in a flat pitta bread though (Souvlaki)!  What I do find remarkable, is the Minoans seem to have a knack for firsts, by example archaeologists, use white and black checked rulers to give the scale in pictures, look at the pictorial representation for a peak sanctuary (shown below) and there it is which suggests they were measuring in a scientific manner, they are shown to be using modern conventions and it alludes to a learned society and we know almost NOTHING of what they knew, which might be and likely was a substantial body of knowledge. Peak Minoan is before the Thera eruption (1628 BCE), they try to recover, but they never resume their dominant position in trade.  This summarises the Minoans for me, if they want to observe something they find a way, its as if they challenge the workshop and they seem to come up with the goods. They don’t have optical filters but want to observe the organise ones, the celestial bodies: including Venus passing in front of the Sun, so they use the gentle reflection from a water bowl to observe this, this is a simple effective technique. They know where the celestial bodies will be, but they seem to be constantly checking and measuring, just to make sure! Start with doubts and end in certainties, it's not the ‘scientific method’ of today but does seem to be highly aligned with it.  Did some of this knowledge survive by oral tradition after the bronze age collapse, did others write down the bits that could be remembered? Update: the Minoan Priestess’ Greatest Achievement I struggled to conclude this article and have just discovered this. I have suspected that the meaning of the Griffons in Minoan iconography was to symbolise the Great Year, a period which according to modern knowledge is a 25,772 year cycle as mother Earth wobbles backwards due to Axial precession. Which was hypothesized by Plato that predicted this to be 36,000 years and attested to 2nd-century-BC astronomer Hipparchus of not less than 1 degree each century. What I did not realise is they appear to have worked it out! I was looking for Aegean numerals! They're showing it symbolically (how Minoan). Each Griffon has two paws on the table 10 and 3 is marked on the griffon's wing, 13. There are two Griffons 26 (thousand) years. They are within 0.8% of the actual figure! N.B. Lions have 8 digits on their rear feet (4 claws per paw) which are usually shown planted on the ground, an Octaeteris, the other (main) long unit of time. The eagle is the master of the sky and the lion the Earth, the hybrid griffon protects the region that mother Earth wobbles back within throughout the ages.  This seems to be confirmed by the depiction of Demeter from Thera. Can you see it?  26 ‘V’ are shown on the Griffon's wing. Alluding to the Minoans being the first to reasonably accurately estimate the Great Year, 1400 years before Hipparchus and too far greater accuracy. This count is also confirmed on the collar of the Griffons shown in the so-called throne room at Knossos and in Minoan genius iconography also. This was not known to this accuracy until the time of Newton! The same count of 26 is shown on the collar of the Griffons flanking the Throne (room) at Knossos. A modern understanding of long astronomical periods hidden in plain view. The lady that measures got it right!My point being, the Priestess if sat with Newton and without a language barrier could not only understand his theories but possibly had a similar if not a better model of the inner solar system, Newton had a vague notion of Gravity, the Minoans did not. Unlike Netwon, this was being studied by many priestesses for millennia not a single lifetime! In terms of engineering, the Minoans had a similar level of technical capability to that around Newton time, amazingly the hydroengineering is compatible with that of 18th Century CE but is demonstrated from at least 1400 BCE if not before, hot and cold running copper water pipes go to the ‘Queen’s chamber bathroom’, venturi effect injectors are used in interlocking clay pipes, sewers, aqueducts, underfloor heating systems are all technically demonstrated. They had dividing callipers (that are attributed to Talos, Daeduleus’ nephew) and can be shown to be used on artifacts, dramatically improving engineering tolerances, which are as good as micro-milling bits of 60micron (0.06mm) diameter and tool placement precision of 0.015mm, their best engineering is exceptionally good and arguable better than at the time of Newton, accepting they had far fewer materials generally. Newton could split light, he didn’t reproduce a natural rainbow, see wedge crescent below….Some will say, you need a capitalist system for Industry. Although not well known, the Houses of Priestess of Potnia Theron (Artemis) and Mother Earth, (I-DA-MA-TE, Demeter); the Bees, had Gold Palace tokens which were used from around 1800 BCE. They are of a standard bullion weight and design. for all practical purpose money, each likely represent a month's salary for the professional classes: junior priestess or sailor. Arguable were withdrawn from the Palace and deposited at another palace to setup a new account or to facilitate trade transactions. Everyday items are called from Palace magazines using personal seals they had a very sophisticated system of accounting. Quota are defined for Farms, tax paid at harvest and balances roll over to the next accounting period. EVERYTHING is recorded. My point is this is also comparable with the time of Newton or at least the Age of Discovery.There are no surviving examples of Minoan machines, however, there are many accounts of them, in context, the later Antikythera mechanism is thought to be transported from Crete, the astronomical periods it encodes can be shown to be defined in Minoan times and we can see below a casting stone for a device that introduces the concept of interlocking gears but are not in themselves gears. ca. 1500 BCE. They do however show the Minoans use a week on the right lunar device (first use, a lunar phase), which flip-flops before advancing a position each alternative month (giving a reasonable accurate 29.5-day Synodic lunar month), a complete revolution, an Olympiad of 49-months. The device can predict Saros cycles when the celestial bodies return to their original position (for Eclipse prediction) with 94% accuracy. I firmly believe it is this earlier study of Astronomy that eventually leads to the mechanism, which is the most sophisticated known device in the ancient world.Oral tradition suggests, there were Automaton that entertained audiences with their lifelike appearance and movement, could sing (think whistles as water escapes through a sealed vessel drawing in air), tripod servers of Hephaostos that could enter a dining room, serve food and presumably withdraw, Daedulus’ machines were said to use Mercury which is 13.5 denser than water to do more work. I think they are using liquids as the power source, likely used for sequencing and driving a spindle (through weight) and pully systems. At some point, cogs were invented shown to be used on the Antikythera mechanism. I do not believe the Greeks invented early machines, rather this knowledge was preserved on the Greek islands and written down, it is the recollections of what could be remembered from this time. There is secondary evidence that boilers were employed in Minoan times to heat water and a Palace of Ba’al that Minoan engineers are thought to have constructed had doors that opened by fire (steam). This later curious bronze is from Samos is dated to 800 BCE.Man, woman and child the Minoans were nerds, they were fascinated by early machines! They had Palace organization that seeks to increase output, they have direct control of Palace workshops that can make the most extraordinary things for the time, it is as if the Priestess challenge them and they come up with (simple) technology! They had a merchant fleet importing raw materials from three continents and exporting high-value trade goods. These white-hulls are so vastly superior to anything that would be produced in the next three millennia! The ship Theseus returned in, was put on display in Athens for centuries as a prize, the Athenians couldn’t, however, make another, it was too advanced, they didn’t know where to start. A reconstruction team that made and sailed a half-scale reproduction Minoan ship used a timber frame with mortise and tenon joints, applied flax linen over the frame held in a composite matrix (likely linseed oil, tree resin and limestone powders), the reinforcement is shown inside and out, glass fibre was not invented until 1950’s CE, flax linen is about as strong in tension as glass fibre! They are lightweight, hydrodynamic and fast as!The Minoans are metal merchants (they are at least importing tin from as far afield as Cornwall and Afganistan) and transporting it around the Mediterranean making a huge profit. The technology is not just comparable with around the age of enlightenment, and importantly it is more the pace of technology innovation evident, that is very high, the Minoans have ALREADY had their own age of enlightenment! They have a model of the inner solar system, they are measuring at both a scientific level and accounting for economic activity to raise their standard of living generally. This is a peak sanctuary where solar and astronomical observations were likely made, the important thing to note is the devices to measure.One perceived such conventions as the 24-hour day being attributed to other later civilizations, the reality is they are shown in Minoan times. The middle spiral defining 12 hours of day or night at an equinox. Everything is being measured in a scientific way!This is where they are around the time of the Thera eruption (noting some examples shown above are later). They are going places, they have a murex dye technology, they produce the best textiles of the time and they are wanting to increase production outputs (there is a lot of evidence of industrial level dye production and batch production using formers to increase output), quality is dramatically improving. They are going considerable distances to secure sources of metal. Then Thera erupted in 1628 BCE! The merchant fleet was lost, the ash fallout resulted in global crop failure, the islanders starved others entered the lucrative metal trade space (once a monopoly for all practical purpose), Mycenae invaded and took control of Crete around 1425 BCE. It had a different philosophy, it was territorially expansionist, raiding and piracy replaced trading and production, the regional economy collapsed in Bronze Age Collapse, likely as a result of rivalries seeking control of lucrative metal trade. The world took a different course. The Minoans technology is almost scattered to the four winds around collapse events (three), the Sardinians and Atlas likely pickup the Atlantic silver/tin trade, the Mycenaeans and Luwans (Trojans) fight it out, the Minoan dye and navigation technology go to Phoenicia, the Egyptians buy up land in the Levant with the exchange of seven-years reserves of Grain after Thera. The world becomes smaller, the Minoans have to focus on their survival but do seem to attempt to set up colonies elsewhere (none endured) and largely give up their early fascination with machines that allude to being able to raise outputs significantly, IF they would have continued along this development path. The world doesn’t become globalized until the Age of Discovery. I am not suggesting the Minoan had an industrial revolution, rather they were on a trajectory towards one with rapid technical progress, trade and a desire to increase production outputs, they didn’t get there, Thera set them back significantly, they lost their trade monopoly, the world took a different course."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.81020454545455
Manuel Morales,Updated 2y,What is the “next Einstein” working on right now?,"Albert Einstein spent his last 30 years searching for the Grand Unified Theory, otherwise known as the Theory of Everything
. In retrospect, what may prove to be his greatest legacy was his insistence that quantum mechanics is not a fundamental theory as currently practiced at CERN’s multi-billion dollar Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
. Einstein suspected that there were local hidden variables that still needed to be discovered in order to explain “Weird Actions at a Distance” and other physical phenomenon
.

Then came along this artist with no science degree who simply wanted to empirically confirm
 if the theory of destiny, i.e., predetermined events or series of events, was valid or not? Little did he realize at the time that by seeking an answer to this question that it would lead to conducting a twelve-year experiment and to the discovery of Albert Einstein’s nonlocal* hidden variables
. The very same variables necessary to conduct the LHC experiments as well as all other physical experiments. As revealed in a peer review article,
 by not taking into account these two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive nonlocal variables this error of omission would lead to false-positive and false-negative empirical data. The very same error of omission that was used as data for scientific discoveries such as the Higgs boson
 and LIGO
 discoveries.

*NOTE: Unambiguous empirical evidence has confirmed that although Albert Einstein was correct about his prediction of hidden variables, he was incorrect as to where to find them. Nonetheless, his prediction is duly credited.

The problem with the discovery of Einstein’s nonlocal hidden variables is that they challenge conventional logic, i.e., effects cause effects. So, in order to address this issue the next question needed to be asked was “How do we know what we think we know?
” The answer to this question lead to another discovery that the human mind uses two mutually exclusive first-order logic codes to perceive the outside world. In order to address this first-order paradox, another experiment was required. As objects of the natural world, all human beings qualify as test subjects to determine which first-order logic code matched our physical existence and which one does not. Hence, the Final Selection Experiment
.

Getting back to the Grand Unified Theory, after the conclusion of the twelve-year experiment in 2012 the artist wrote an article peer reviewed by over 150 colleagues and rated #1 by the public that addressed the unification of all physical phenomenon

So, you may be asking why has the discovery of Albert Einstein’s nonlocal hidden variables not widely known?

Anil Menon,3y,Did the scientific revolution happen outside of Europe?,"Yes, almost certainly.

It happened 5,000 or 6,000 years ago in Babylon, where the world’s first astronomers made sense of patterns in the sky they had observed and recorded for generations. The idea that these patterns in nature could be explained without resorting to supernatural explanations is the key idea behind science.
It happened on the subcontinent around 6th century BC, where a group of materialists and physicians began to advocate a mode of thinking that didn’t rely on supernatural explanations. Their opponents, who eventually persecuted them to extinction, called this materialist philosophy Lokayata.
It happened in China which evolved a way of doing science through artifacts. The Chinese represented their understanding of the world through complex artifacts. The full story is described in the (ongoing) collection Science and Civilisation in China, a project initiated by Sinologist Joseph Needham. When completed, this will consist of 27-volumes.
In the 10–14th centuries, the Arabs had a flourishing scientific and technological tradition. In fact, it was the Arabic tradition that eventually sparked the European scientific revolution.

The main difference between the European scientific revolution and the others is that it achieved “explanatory supremacy”, so to speak.

What is “explanatory supremacy”? In the past, scientific explanation was just one mode of explaining and controlling the world. But after the 16th century CE (that is, after Kepler, Newton, and that gang), science became the dominant explanatory mode. That is why on Quora we see questions like:

What is the science behind the astras in the Mahabharata?
What is the science behind jyotish shastra?
What is the science behind the Bhagvad Gita?

Whether people believe in their holy books or not, they want validation of their beliefs from science.

Aflah,1y,"How is scientific revolution done in various parts of the world like Latin America, East Asia, Middle East and Africa?","The scientific revolution, characterized by the development of modern science and the scientific method, has had a profound impact on the world and has been a driving force behind many of the technological and social advancements of the modern era. The scientific revolution has been done in various parts of the world, including Latin America, East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, in different ways and to varying degrees.

Latin America: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the scientific revolution in Latin America was largely influenced by European and North American models of scientific inquiry. Nevertheless, Latin America also has its own unique scientific traditions, such as the study of indigenous plants and animals, and the application of scientific knowledge to agriculture, medicine, and other areas of daily life. In recent decades, there has been a growing trend towards the establishment of indigenous science programs in the region, aimed at promoting a more equitable distribution of scientific knowledge and expertise.
East Asia: The scientific revolution in East Asia has been shaped by a combination of indigenous scientific traditions and foreign influences, particularly from Europe and the United States. In Japan, for example, the Meiji era saw a rapid modernization of the country and the establishment of a strong scientific community, which produced many important scientific breakthroughs in fields such as physics, chemistry, and medicine. In other countries in the region, such as China and South Korea, the scientific revolution has been more recent, with a focus on modernizing existing institutions and building up new ones, as well as promoting research in areas such as biotechnology, materials science, and information technology.
The Middle East: The scientific revolution in the Middle East has been hindered by political instability and conflict, which has made it difficult for the region to establish a thriving scientific community. Nevertheless, the region has a rich history of scientific inquiry, dating back to the Islamic Golden Age, when scholars from the region made important contributions to fields such as mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards the promotion of scientific education and research in the Middle East, and many countries in the region have established institutions dedicated to promoting scientific advancement.
Africa: The scientific revolution in Africa has been shaped by a combination of historical factors, including colonialism and the exploitation of resources, as well as more recent trends towards scientific education and research. Despite these challenges, many African countries have made significant progress in recent years, with many scientists and researchers from the continent making important contributions to fields such as physics, chemistry, and medicine.

In conclusion, the scientific revolution has been done in various parts of the world in different ways, shaped by a combination of cultural, political, and economic factors. Despite these differences, the scientific revolution has had a profound impact on the world and has helped to bring about many of the technological and social advancements of the modern era.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rk5630lxcvjy2ibs', 'title': 'How is scientific revolution done in various parts of the world like Latin America, East Asia, Middle East and Africa?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The scientific revolution, characterized by the development of modern science and the scientific method, has had a profound impact on the world and has been a driving force behind many of the technological and social advancements of the modern era.

Philippe Eyraud,3y,Is it possible to find a new Napoleon Bonaparte in our era?,"Yes and no .

No , nearly no chances for a French( man or woman) to take command of the french republic armies to conquer whole Europe for a starter…

First of all there are some H bombs around which may calm down the situation. Russia , UK by themselves, many other countries with NATO (made in US ).

Second if France was a giant on demographics in Europe 1789/1815 period(1St population of Europe after Russia) it not the case anymore…We are not a country of third even fourth age like Germany but we are not anymore with a boosting youth to put in the army. You know what? War is a matter of young people.

Third we don’t have got the raw materials needed for a prolonged war . Nearly no oil, few coal and iron( mines closed for economic reasons, Australian iron is cheaper ) , no alumine ( bauxite), few rare earth, few uranium etc… and all these are needed with many more for modern armies and production.

Fourth we have a fine living standard on the whole , may be one of the best with a good equilibrium between personnal life and work. French art de vivre you know . So what by the nine layers of hell why would you go to see us freeze your balls in Russia and eat some british food.

Yes , but not France.

A charismatic leader . A revolutionnary zeal background truly better than already existing. A military genius.

Napoleon was the son of the french revolution and not an XXth century ideological maniac . No racism or other kind of bullshit ( religion , communism, libertarians etc ) .

He approved the main goal of French revolution : equality before the law whatever your ligneage is. It is no legend that some of the french marshal were from very low social background . Not thinkable in some world area even today .

He didn’t care much about religion and race colour. He was a pragmatic .

So in a country with serious social problems getting to find out their own solution a very able leader may arise and if he is a military genius too something may happen.

However as New York is less than a day trip from Delhi or Beijinn, if such a leader emerge he may have to speak very quickly with the big five of UNO security counsel .","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wsjnvk2zgqedohbr', 'title': 'Is it possible to find a new Napoleon Bonaparte in our era?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes and no .\n\nNo , nearly no chances for a French( man or woman) to take command of the french republic armies to conquer whole Europe for a starter…\n\nFirst of all there are some H bombs around which may calm down the situation.

Serge Bourgaine,4y,How was knowledge attained before the scientific revolution?,"This might be a bit more than you want, but here goes. Paleontology and geology suggest that our species emerged on the planet some 200,000 years ago. So for most of our existence, there was no “science” in the modern use of the term. And there were no books or writing to transmit knowledge from generation to generation, or to spread knowledge over sizable distances. Whatever knowledge was gained tended to stay local, handed down verbally to members within a tribe.

For most of human history, the principal method of acquiring knowledge was trial-and-error. Plant a seed in some soil to see what happens. If it bears fruit, you record this fact, and you plant the next seed in similar soil. If not, you log this fact as well, but you sow the next seed elsewhere.

This is how knowledge was gained. Our ancestors discovered many things from the trial-and-error method. They observed that seeds sowed in one soil grow better than in another. That seeds planted where cattle grazed grow better still. That sharp-edged flints separate meat from hide. That salt preserves foods. That chips of lodestone, suspended so they can rotate, indicate north. That a hug soothes a sobbing infant. That alloys of tin and copper produce a metal stronger than copper alone. That mouldboard ploughs open more land to agriculture than scratch ploughs. That water wheels generate mechanical power to grind grains. That, in construction, knotted ropes calibrate right angles. That fired bricks are more durable than sun-dried bricks. That arches uphold greater weight than lintels. And that removing a portion of the skull relieves pressure on the brain, in some cases saving the life of the patient.

The trial-and-error method works, but it is slow. And it yields no deeper understanding of phenomena. In the case of seeds, for example, early peoples had no knowledge that genes reside within the nucleus of plant cells; that genes comprise sequences of nucleotides; or that the nucleotides, via a series of intermediate steps, determine the traits and growth of the plant. They likewise were were unaware that cells divide, communicate, respire and evolve. They were, in fact, unaware that cells exist. And no intelligence disclosed to them that scent compounds attract pollinators: that flowers emerge from meristems; that stomata facilitate gas exchange; that shade alters root structure; or that photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy. So yes, early people often were able to figure out “what works”, but had little or no idea ”why or how” things work.

They likewise were were unaware that cells divide, communicate, respire and evolve. They were, in fact, unaware that cells exist. And no intelligence disclosed to them that scent compounds attract pollinators: that flowers emerge from meristems; that stomata facilitate gas exchange; that shade alters root structure; or that photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy. So yes, early people often were able to figure out “what works”, but had little or no idea ”why or how” things work. For this, they had to wait for the arrival of science.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9995

Brett Alder,Updated 2y,"Why has Christianity been so successful in secular terms (Industrial Revolution, Scientific Revolution, etc.)?","It’s all very simple, really, if you apply the appropriate analysis model. Here we’ll apply the “Fairness Model” for judging Christianity, which asks two main questions:

Does the tradition (religion, culture, nation, etc.) have a robust definition of fairness?
When is it okay to be unfair?

Societies that rate high in the Fairness Model have a robust definition (like the Golden Rule) and also drastically limit the cases where unfairness is acceptable. Alternatively, societies that have a wishy washy definition (or no definition at all), or allow innumerable exceptions where unfairness is tolerated, would score poorly.

Merchants are also prime targets. Without titles of royalty or nobility, they amass fortunes and control the livelihoods of their workers.

The book Red Notice by Bill Browder catalogs the Russian government’s actions of fleecing foreign investors of their stock holdings. Thanks for the investment, we’ll take it from here!

So let’s get back to the Fairness Model for Christianity.

Does the Christian tradition have a robust definition of fairness?

Before answering that directly, let’s talk about what it means to be robust. It has to be a single, unifying definition. If the definition is relative to the situation or there are many different definitions of fairness depending on the status of a person or their caste, then clearly it dilutes its protective nature.

In the Christian tradition there is only one God, and believers are admonished, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Jesus taught, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” Not a lot of wiggle room there. It’s either their definition of fairness, or the highway. And what is their definition?

“Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself”. Well, there you have it. Treating others like you’d like to be treated, should be a pretty great definition since no one wants to be treated unfairly.

But having a robust definition is just a prerequisite and doesn’t really get us anywhere. It’s not nearly as important as the follow-on question:

When is it okay to be unfair?

This is where Christianity is almost insanely bizarre. Even today in modern day American society which can be generally considered “fair-minded” we have many exceptions that are commonly subscribed to on different sides of the political spectrum:

It’s okay to be unfair when…

…it’s good for the environment
…the majority of voters or legislators say so
…the person is a convicted criminal
…it’s only temporary (COVID)
…it involves illegal immigration
…someone has black/brown/white skin
…economists think it’s necessary

When is it okay to be unfair to someone within the Christian tradition? Let’s test out some different scenarios:

It’s okay to be unfair when…

…a person is weak and defenseless? Nope.
“Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.” (Isaiah 1:17)
…a person comes from a lower class or status? Nope.
“Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (Matthew 25:40)
…a person is a sinner, and female, and caught in the act? Nope.
“He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.” (John 8:7)

Okay, fine, seems like Jesus was a pretty decent guy, but surely we’ll find the chink in his armor. Time to bring in the big guns. Almost no tradition can withstand the following:

For sure, it’s okay to be unfair when…

…the person is a member of your outgroup? Definitely going to win with this one…wait, no? What?
“Then saith the woman of Samaria [hated by the Jews] unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.” (John 4:9)
“Thou shalt love … thy neighbour as thyself…And who is my neighbour?” The Samaritan is your neighbor. (Luke 10:27–37)
…the person is your sworn enemy, your oppressor! No? Come on!
“But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;” (Matthew 5:44)
…the person is a foreigner? Please, I need a win here…No? Rejected?
“But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.” (Leviticus 19:34)

Okay, but at least we can give privileges (a form of unfairness) to certain groups or people like…

…the rich and powerful? Nope.
“Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not…honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.” (Leviticus 19:15)
“My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.” You should not give favorable treatment to a rich man over a poor man. (James 2:1–4)
…at least family members? No? I’m exhausted, what is this, rope-a-dope?
“Then one said unto him [Jesus], Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.” (Matthew 12:47–50)
“Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.” (Luke 11:27–28)

Holy mackerel. The only way to get into the privileged class is by treating people fairly? Wah? I feel like I’m Foreman vs. Ali. I’ve punched myself out. It’s as if Christianity knew this Fairness Model was coming…

Was Galileo, as a European, more intelligent and curious than his Arabic, Indian, or Chinese cohorts? Did European merchants and capitalists have simply a higher business acumen than Africans and Native Americans? I thoroughly reject those assumptions. The Scientific and Industrial Revolutions could have happened anywhere, among any people, where fairness is widely preached and practiced.

We often focus on how the Catholic Church persecuted Galileo, and forced him to recant. But the Scientific Revolution didn’t happen in Christian nations because they persecuted scientists, it happened because within the Christian tradition, there was no excuse, no formally approved mechanism for depriving scientists of fair treatment. The same goes for merchants. As the analysis above shows, if anything, Christianity should have dissuaded the Pope from killing Galileo as he was wont to do as a political authority.

So to conclude, because Christianity stridently opposed any form of unfairness, any excuse for privilege, and any method of getting around its prescriptions of fairness, its teachings, even when followed imperfectly, created in secular terms a protective environment where emerging merchants and scientists could flourish without being persecuted or stamped out. #LongLiveJustice","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cumv1qfna3lz4bkh', 'title': 'Why has Christianity been so successful in secular terms (Industrial Revolution, Scientific Revolution, etc.)?', 'score': {'original': 0.99266666666667, 'ai': 0.0073333333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It’s all very simple, really, if you apply the appropriate analysis model.

Jeff Holmes,8mo,Can you create a table defining the significance of the different technology invented during the scientific revolution?,"Sure, I can provide a list of several important technological inventions during the Scientific Revolution (roughly the 16th to 18th centuries) and their significance. Please note that the Scientific Revolution was more about developments in scientific thought and methodology than technological inventions per se, but there were still technological advancements that either contributed to or were influenced by this shift in scientific thinking.

Telescope

Hans Lippershey (attributed)

The telescope allowed for a significant increase in astronomical observation capability. It was instrumental in the works of Galileo Galilei, who used it to observe celestial bodies and provide empirical evidence supporting the heliocentric theory.

Microscope

Zacharias Janssen (attributed)

The invention of the microscope opened up the world of microorganisms and cells, leading to a significant advancement in biology. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, using his improved microscopes, was able to describe bacteria, red blood cells, and more.

Thermometer

Galileo Galilei (attributed)

The thermometer was crucial for the scientific measurement of temperature. Its invention allowed for a greater understanding of heat and energy, helping in the development of thermodynamics.

Pendulum clock

Christiaan Huygens

The invention of the pendulum clock provided a more accurate measure of time, essential for navigation and increasing the precision of scientific experiments.

Air pump

Otto von Guericke

The air pump was used to create a vacuum, helping scientists to learn more about air pressure and the properties of gases, and leading to the development of pneumatics.

Calculus

Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

Not a technology, but a mathematical invention, calculus was crucial in expressing physical laws and phenomena in precise mathematical terms. It formed the bedrock for many physical theories and engineering designs in the centuries to come.

Printing press

Johannes Gutenberg (Before Scientific Revolution, but effects largely felt during)

While invented before the Scientific Revolution, the effects of the printing press were hugely significant during this period. It allowed for the widespread dissemination of scientific ideas, facilitating collaboration and the challenging of established doctrines.

It's worth noting that the Scientific Revolution was a time of accelerated scientific discovery and refinement of scientific methods.

Sumit Awana,7mo,"How did the Renaissance humanism, reformation, and scientific revolution change Western culture?","The Renaissance humanism, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution were pivotal periods in Western history that brought about significant changes in culture, thought, and society. These interconnected movements had profound and lasting effects on Western civilization, shaping its values, beliefs, and institutions.

The Renaissance, which began in Italy in the 14th century and spread throughout Europe, was a period characterized by a renewed interest in classical learning, human potential, and individualism. Humanism, a central intellectual movement of the Renaissance, emphasized the importance of human reason, individualism, and the pursuit of knowledge and virtue. It marked a departure from the dominance of religious thought in medieval society and paved the way for a more secular and human-centered worldview.

One of the key effects of Renaissance humanism was the rediscovery and translation of ancient Greek and Roman texts. Scholars, artists, and thinkers of the period immersed themselves in the works of ancient philosophers, poets, and historians, such as Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, and Virgil. This led to a revival of classical literature, art, and architecture, and a shift in focus from religious themes to humanistic subjects. The ideals of beauty, balance, and proportion derived from ancient sources influenced the artistic and architectural styles of the time, giving rise to the development of realistic perspective and naturalistic representation in painting and sculpture.

Moreover, Renaissance humanism placed a strong emphasis on education and the pursuit of knowledge. Humanist scholars believed that education should cultivate well-rounded individuals who could engage in critical thinking, eloquent speech, and moral action. The concept of a liberal arts education emerged during this period, encompassing a broad range of subjects including literature, history, philosophy, and the sciences. This emphasis on education fostered a more informed and intellectually curious society and laid the groundwork for the emergence of the modern university system.

The Reformation, which emerged in the 16th century, was a religious movement that challenged the authority and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Led by figures such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, the Reformation sparked a wave of religious, political, and social change across Europe. The reformers criticized the corruption and abuses within the Church, and sought to return to what they saw as the pure teachings of early Christianity.

The Reformation had profound effects on Western culture, primarily through its emphasis on individual faith and personal interpretation of scripture. One of the key ideas of the Reformation was the priesthood of all believers, which held that every individual had direct access to God and could interpret the Bible for themselves. This emphasis on individual conscience and religious freedom led to the proliferation of different Protestant denominations and the fragmentation of religious authority. It challenged the monolithic dominance of the Catholic Church, paving the way for religious pluralism and tolerance in Western society.

Furthermore, the Reformation had significant political implications. The Protestant movement led to the rise of nation-states and the reshaping of political structures in Europe. The religious divisions fueled conflicts such as the Thirty Years' War, which devastated the continent but also led to the recognition of the principle of religious toleration. The separation of church and state became an important idea, with political power gradually shifting away from the Church and towards secular rulers. This transformation laid the groundwork for the development of modern democracies and the idea of religious freedom as a fundamental human right.

The Scientific Revolution, which took place roughly between the 16th and 17th centuries, was a transformative period in the history of science, marked by significant advancements in the fields of physics, astronomy, biology, and chemistry. It was characterized by a shift from reliance on ancient authorities and religious dogma to empirical observation, experimentation, and the application of reason.

The Scientific Revolution brought about a fundamental change in the way people understood the natural world. Prominent figures such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton revolutionized our understanding of the universe, challenging the geocentric model of the cosmos and developing the heliocentric model. Their discoveries and mathematical formulations laid the foundation for modern astronomy and physics.

Moreover, the Scientific Revolution led to the development of the scientific method, a systematic approach to acquiring knowledge through observation, experimentation, and hypothesis testing. This emphasis on empirical evidence and rational inquiry transformed the way scientific knowledge was generated and validated, and it became the cornerstone of modern science.

The impact of the Scientific Revolution extended beyond the realms of science and academia. It had profound implications for Western culture as a whole. The focus on observation and experimentation encouraged a spirit of curiosity and inquiry, which fostered technological innovation, the development of new instruments, and the exploration of previously unknown territories. It laid the groundwork for the Enlightenment, an intellectual and cultural movement that promoted reason, skepticism, and individual rights.

The Enlightenment, which emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries, built upon the foundations laid by the Renaissance, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution. It emphasized the power of human reason, individual liberty, and the pursuit of knowledge. Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant challenged traditional sources of authority and advocated for concepts such as natural rights, separation of powers, and the social contract. These ideas formed the intellectual basis for the American and French Revolutions and influenced the development of modern democratic principles and human rights.

So, the Renaissance humanism, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution were transformative movements that changed Western culture in significant ways. Renaissance humanism brought about a renewed interest in classical learning, artistic expression, and education, shifting the focus from religious dogma to human-centered values. The Reformation challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, emphasizing individual faith and religious freedom, and had profound political implications, contributing to the rise of nation-states and the separation of church and state. The Scientific Revolution revolutionized our understanding of the natural world, fostering empirical observation, experimentation, and the scientific method as the basis for knowledge. Its impact extended beyond science, influencing the Enlightenment and shaping modern democratic principles. Collectively, these movements laid the foundation for a more secular, rational, and individualistic Western culture that continues to shape our society today.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/z461wk30m89opinr', 'title': 'How did the Renaissance humanism, reformation, and scientific revolution change Western culture?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The Renaissance humanism, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution were pivotal periods in Western history that brought about significant changes in culture, thought, and society.

Carmen Elizaga,2y,"How did the Renaissance influence the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment? Thank you","The simplest way to answer this is just to say that the Renaissance brought the Middle Ages to an end. The Middle Ages had seen the Church in more or less unchallenged authority over the entire civilization of Western Europe from the fall of the pagan Roman Empire on. What first ensued were the “Dark Ages” in which all aspects of culture inherited from Antiquity were lost. Slowly material culture recovered and the great architecture of Gothic cathedrals expressed a new kind of material sophistication, but it was not until awareness of the “humanism” of antiquity arose again, that people began to center their attention on secular life and secular thought. Asking questions to which the answer was humanity was a new experience from what had gone before. By historical convention, we look at the stonework tower of the Gothic cathedral as symbolic expression of the way everything had been turned upward, away from human life, towards a distant God and His power.

What happened then? In religion the idea that the worldly church could exercise power over all decisions and yet exempt itself from those questions fell into disarray with a new generation of critical theologians like Martin Luther. Then in the gathering of information and the formulation of closer observations of natural phenomena disrupted the foundation of established authority, and science was reborn. The discovery of the actual geometry and mathematics that guided the heavenly bodies was a huge shock to the judgments of the past, and proved its worth for the growing importance of sea travel. And the upshot of this constant remaking of ideas opened up the respect for reason as the measure of truth in the Enlightenment that undermined the inherently conservative weight of tradition yet further until the questions of human reason had to be directed at the authority of rationalism itself.

The era of romanticism marked a closure in the predominance of those questions to which the answer was always rational man. And yet the basis of humanism continued in altered forms till it produced the Nietzschean declaration that God was dead, and plunged into the twentieth century and the unleashed will and conflicts of power based on technology. What do we have now? The end of questions to which the answer would be a truth. That is already implicit in Martin Heidegger’s strange take on technology in his response to Ernst Jünger’s interest in ending the notion of its instrumentality. Heidegger observes that questioning is the piety of thinking — but thinking itself is not to be conflated with the action of the subject. That is why Heidegger turns definitively away from any last attempt to retrieve the humanist project. And here we are today. No project.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0mszb3c9dofu7gjh', 'title': 'How did the Renaissance influence the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment?

The Middle Ages had seen the Church in more or less unchallenged authority over the entire civilization of Western Europe from the fall of the pagan Roman Empire on. What first ensued were the “Dark Ages” in which all aspects of culture inherited from Antiquity were lost. Slowly material culture recovered and the great architecture of Gothic cathedrals expressed a new kind of material sophistication, but it was not until awareness of the “humanism” of antiquity arose again, that people began to center their attention on secular life and secular thought. Asking questions to which the answer was humanity was a new experience from what had gone before. By historical convention, we look at the stonework tower of the Gothic cathedral as symbolic expression of the way everything had been turned upward, away from human life, towards a distant God and His power.\n\nWhat happened then? In religion the idea that the worldly church could exercise power over all decisions and yet exempt itself from those questions fell into disarray with a new generation of critical theologians like Martin Luther. Then in the gathering of information and the formulation of closer observations of natural phenomena disrupted the foundation of established authority, and science was reborn. The discovery of the actual geometry and mathematics that guided the heavenly bodies was a huge shock to the judgments of the past, and proved its worth for the growing importance of sea travel. And the upshot of this constant remaking of ideas opened up the respect for reason as the measure of truth in the Enlightenment that undermined the inherently conservative weight of tradition yet further until the questions of human reason had to be directed at the authority of rationalism itself.\n\nThe era of romanticism marked a closure in the predominance of those questions to which the answer was always rational man. And yet the basis of humanism continued in altered forms till it produced the Nietzschean declaration that God was dead, and plunged into the twentieth century and the unleashed will and conflicts of power based on technology.

Ian Miller,1y,Is it possible that a scientific revolution might occur in this century? Something like relativity and quantum mechanics revolutions?,"It is possible because there is material there for it. We have no idea what dark matter or dark energy are, and to some extent even if they are. In my opinion, quantum field theory is seriously wrong. I say that because when you try to calculate the expansion rate of the Universe with the zero point energy you are out by 120 orders of magnitude, and on top of that, the calculations work simply by ignoring infinities. That, to me, is simply mathematically inexcusable.

Ah, you say, but quantum electrodynamics has predicted the g factor of an electron with extreme accuracy. Yes, it has, and it has done it twelve times, each time as the observational value was corrected. That does not look good to me, especially since calculations are so complicated we don’t see them, and they invariably include the fine structure constant but it is n ot clear, at least to me, why, apart from the fact it is small. With the latest version, it does not get the muon right. And there remains that pesky ignoring of infinities.

So in my opinion a revolution is possible, but who knows what it will be? Because if anyone could see what was wrong and what was right to replace it they would get on with it. Whether the rest would recognize it is another matter.

Robert Gauthier,4y,"How would you fight the widespread misconceptions about and reduce mistrust of science by explaining the key take-aways from Kuhn's ""Structure of Scientific Revolutions""?","A2A

Finally there is the problem of false perspective that has developed deep roots that affects the way people see science.

David Angell,2y,How did scientists approach problems during the scientific revolution? How was it different from the past?,"Michael Strevens, in his book The Knowledge Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern Science[1] addresses the question of what made the scientific revolution different from the past. In contrast with Kuhn’s belief that scientists were devoted to their paradigms or Popper’s theory that the main goal of scientists was falsification, Strevens argues that the key difference is what he calls the Iron Rule of Explanation. This rule is stated as:

Strive to settle all arguments by empirical testing.
To conduct an empirical test to decide between a pair of hypotheses, perform an experiment or measurement, one of whose possible outcomes can be explained by one hypothesis (and accompanying cohort [of assumptions]) but not the other.

This provides two important benefits: a framework for a continuing debate (in the context of the empirical evidence) and a continually increasing store of observations and measurements which become more accurate and precise over time. He points out that a scientist is never forced to give up their hypothesis just because the results of an experiment contradicted their prediction, but they must alter their hypothesis to account for the experimental results (or show the methodology or execution of the experiment to be flawed).

In other words, they can add epicycle after epicycle if they like — multiplying entities as Ockham would say — so long as their theory can be made to successfully post-dict all of the existing experimental results. Over time, the growing body of empirical evidence forces a consensus as competing theories fall by the wayside, unable to account for the whole range of relevant observed phenomena.

To me, this is the most persuasive explanation for the difference between the scientific revolution and all prior efforts towards empirical knowledge in human history.

John Harland,3y,"How is scientific revolution done in various parts of the world like Latin America, East Asia, Middle East and Africa?","“How is scientific revolution done in various parts of the world like Latin America, East Asia, Middle East and Africa?”

The idea of a “scientific revolution” lacks meaning, including in European history. A Change over centuries following the introduction of ideas from elsewhere is not a revolution. It is an evolution. The notion of the “Scientific Revolution” in Europe is a nonsensical description of the 150 years between the publication of Copernicus’ book of heliocentric theory and Newton’s Principia Mathematica.

It’s period when the latest in scientific method and Indo-Arabic mathematics were flowing into Europe and being advanced by European thinkers.

Copernicus’ book was not the beginnings of natural philosophy in Europe, nor was Newton’s work the completion of its evolution. Vitally important developments in scientific method happened long after Newton.

The “Scientific Revolution” is populist history by propagandists who understand little about science or its evolution but want to pretend that virtually all of the development of science happened in Europe.

I suspect the answer you are seeking is: How do we encourage the evolution of scientific thinking in the places you mention.

A key point to be made is that there is some very good science already done in all those places. The problems relate more to lack of funding and political manipulation of the directions of research.

As is evident in the starving of funding in the USA for atmospheric and ecological research on political grounds, the problem is not restricted to the areas you mention.

Nor is a lack of understanding of science restricted to the populations of those areas. Again, the USA is a standout for the low level of scientific understanding across its population but it is not as far behind other “Western” countries as many people imagine.

John Harland,3y,What were the scientific revolution's effects and cause?,"“What were the scientific revolution's effects and cause?”

What “Scientific Revolution”? The claimed “Scientific Revolution” in Europe in the Fifteenth and Sixteeenth centuries is ethnocentric propaganda, not reality.

Copernicus recycled the heliocentric theory of Aristarchus of Samos 1500 years earlier. Newton developed the new Indo-Arabic mathematics to allow the computation of the orbits of the planets. Roger and Francis Bacon, as well as Hooke and others, built on the scientific principles proposed by the Egyptian Ibn al-Haytham around 1000 CE .

However even at the end of that 150-year “revolution” (damned long for a revolution!) there was still a long way to go to get to modern scientific method.

The causes were largely the growth of trade over the previous couple of centuries, leading to transfer of knowledge between the various cultures, particularly of the Mediterranean region.

The wealthy trading cities were much less under the sway of the Church than the peasant communities across most of Europe. It was largely in the trading cities of Southern Europe that the (so-called) Renaissance happened and in the northern trading cities the new levels of communication and learning led to a more-direct confrontation with the authority of the Church in the form of the Reformation.

The “Scientific Revolution” and the “Renaissance” were aspects of the growth of secular learning made possible by the growth of economic power to rival that of the Medieval Church. That meant that learning was no longer primarily through the Church and no longer limited to what was approved by the Church.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7vrpi81qkhtnc64y', 'title': ""What were the scientific revolution's effects and cause?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""“What were the scientific revolution's effects and cause?”\n\nWhat “Scientific Revolution”?

Steve Wits,2y,"Which intellectual and social movements between the 14th-18th century, which reached and influenced Western countries, those advanced today (eg Germany, France, UK, US) didn't reach Greece then, and still haven't until today?","This comment by Alexandros Megas answers this question. Thank you for that.

Greek area under the Ottomans did miss out on the Enlightenment that was rooted at start had Italian Roman & Greek roots. Write down how many Fathers of Schools of Philosophy and Sciences in the West had a Greek “father” and you will realize that you talk in BSH.

(The migration waves of Byzantine Greek scholars
 and émigrés in the period following the Crusader
 sacking of Constantinople
 and the end of the Byzantine Empire
 in 1453 was a very welcome addition to the Latin texts scholars like Petrarch had found in monastic libraries for the revival of Greek
 literature and science via their greater familiarity with ancient Greek works. They included Gemistus Pletho
, George of Trebizond
, Theodorus Gaza
, and John Argyropoulos
.

The Italian humanism spread northward to France
, Germany
, the Low Countries
, Poland-Lithuania, Hungary and England
 with the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, and it became associated with the Reformation
. In France, pre-eminent humanist Guillaume Budé
 (1467–1540) applied the philological
 methods of Italian humanism to the study of antique coinage
 and to legal history
, composing a detailed commentary on Justinian's Code
. Budé was a royal absolutist
 (and not a republican
 like the early Italian umanisti) who was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat
 for François I
 and helping to found the Collège des Lecteurs Royaux
 (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, Marguerite de Navarre
, the sister of François I, was a poet
, novelist
, and religious mystic
 who gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including Clément Marot
, Pierre de Ronsard
, and François Rabelais
.

The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy describes the rationalism
 of ancient writings as having tremendous impact on Renaissance
 scholars:

Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity—with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities—was the center of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full s
tature.

In
 1417, for example, Poggio Bracciolini
 discovered the manuscript of Lucretius
, De rerum natura
, which had been lost for centuries and which contained an explanation of Epicurean doctrine
, though at the time this was not commented on much by Renaissance scholars, who confined themselves to remarks about Lucretius's grammar and syntax
.

Only in 1564 did French commentator Denys Lambin (1519–72) announce in the preface to the work that ""he regarded Lucretius's Epicurean ideas as 'fanciful, absurd, and opposed to Christianity'."" Lambin's preface remained standard until the nineteenth century. Epicurus's unacceptable doctrine that pleasure was the highest good ""ensured the unpopularity of his philosophy"". Lorenzo Valla
, however, puts a defense of epicureanism in the mouth of one of the interlocutors of one of his dialogues.

Epicureanism

Charles Trinkhaus regards Valla's ""epicureanism"" as a ploy, not seriously meant by Valla, but designed to refute Stoicism, which he regarded together with epicureanism as equally inferior to Christianity. Valla's defense, or adaptation, of Epicureanism was later taken up in The Epicurean by Erasmus
, the ""Prince of humanists:

""If people who live agreeably are Epicureans
, none are more truly Epicurean
 than the righteous and godly. And if it is names that bother us, no one better deserves the name of Epicurean than the revered founder and head of the Christian
 philosophy Christ
, for in Greek epikouros means ""helper"". He alone, when the law of Nature
 was all but blotted out by sins, when the law of Moses
 incited to lists rather than cured them, when Satan
 ruled in the world unchallenged, brought timely aid to perishing humanity. Completely mistaken, therefore, are those who talk in their foolish fashion about Christ's having been sad and gloomy in character and calling upon us to follow a dismal mode of life. On the contrary, he alone shows the most enjoyable life of all and the one most full of true pleasure.

This passage exemplifies the way in which the humanists saw pagan
 classical works
, such as the philosophy of Epicurus
, as being in harmony with their interpretation of Christianity
. Neo-Platonism Renaissance Neo-Platonists
 such as Marsilio Ficino
 (whose translations of Plato's works into Latin were still used into the 19th century) attempted to reconcile Platonism
 with Christianity, according to the suggestions of early Church Fathers
 Lactantius
 and Saint Augustine
. In this spirit, Pico della Mirandola
 attempted to construct a syncretism
 of religions and philosophies with Christianity, but his work did not win favor with the church authorities, who rejected it because of his views on magic).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lgr8jb51zif30ote', 'title': ""Which intellectual and social movements between the 14th-18th century, which reached and influenced Western countries, those advanced today (eg Germany, France, UK, US) didn't reach Greece then, and still haven't until today?"", 'score': {'original': 0.95355, 'ai': 0.04645}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This comment by Alexandros Megas answers this question.

Lambin\'s preface remained standard until the nineteenth century. Epicurus\'s unacceptable doctrine that pleasure was the highest good ""ensured the unpopularity of his philosophy"". Lorenzo Valla\n, however, puts a defense of epicureanism in the mouth of one of the interlocutors of one of his dialogues.\n\nEpicureanism\n\nCharles Trinkhaus regards Valla\'s ""epicureanism"" as a ploy, not seriously meant by Valla, but designed to refute Stoicism, which he regarded together with epicureanism as equally inferior to Christianity. Valla\'s defense, or adaptation, of Epicureanism was later taken up in The Epicurean by Erasmus\n, the ""Prince of humanists:\n\n""If people who live agreeably are Epicureans\n, none are more truly Epicurean\n than the righteous and godly. And if it is names that bother us, no one better deserves the name of Epicurean than the revered founder and head of the Christian\n philosophy Christ\n, for in Greek epikouros means ""helper"". He alone, when the law of Nature\n was all but blotted out by sins, when the law of Moses\n incited to lists rather than cured them, when Satan\n ruled in the world unchallenged, brought timely aid to perishing humanity. Completely mistaken, therefore, are those who talk in their foolish fashion about Christ\'s having been sad and gloomy in character and calling upon us to follow a dismal mode of life. On the contrary, he alone shows the most enjoyable life of all and the one most full of true pleasure.\n\nThis passage exemplifies the way in which the humanists saw pagan\n classical works\n, such as the philosophy of Epicurus\n, as being in harmony with their interpretation of Christianity\n. Neo-Platonism Renaissance Neo-Platonists\n such as Marsilio Ficino\n (whose translations of Plato\'s works into Latin were still used into the 19th century) attempted to reconcile Platonism\n with Christianity, according to the suggestions of early Church Fathers\n Lactantius\n and Saint Augustine\n. In this spirit, Pico della Mirandola\n attempted to construct a syncretism\n of religions and philosophies with Christianity, but his work did not win favor with the church authorities, who rejected it because of his views on magic).', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.95355
Suresh Kumar S,3y,What was the significance of magic in the relationship to the Scientific Revolution?,"Good thought. Yes the supernatural and magic are thought t b poles apart from science.

But there are connecting roots,if we go through the lives,philosophies and writings of luminaries like Paracelsus,Newton etc,Bacon,Bruno etc.

Clearly, ‘science’ and ‘magic’ cannot be viewed as two separate practices in the early modern period. The ‘scientific’ elements of Bacon’s philosophy — his rejection of scholasticism and Aristotelian logic, his emphasis on empiricism and experiment — bore a striking relation to the role of the magus as perceived by della Porta. Bruno’s defence and development of the Copernican system was deeply influenced by his magical, animistic understanding of the cosmos which held that the stars and the planets had souls. The most striking example of the role of magic in Renaissance thought is perhaps found in the work of Paracelsus, whose supposedly ‘scientific’ advancements were products of a magically informed understanding of the universe and a desire to achieve spiritual reconciliation between man and God.

A close reading of Paracelsus’ work also reveals that he did not perceive the spiritual relationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm as a means via which to develop better ‘science’, or even better medicine per se. The ultimate aim was to bring the heavens and the earth into balance and thus reconcile man and God. Paracelsus stated ‘It is the concordance’ of heaven and Earth ‘which makes man whole, from which he derives knowledge of the world and hence of himself’. Paracelsus was pursuing a spiritual goal; in knowing himself, the individual could know his maker, ‘For God, who is in heaven, is in man.’ In conceptualising the role of the physician as one who harnessed astral influences to bring microcosm and macrocosm into alignment, Paracelsus was working within a decidedly magical tradition and pursuing magical aims, rather than practising ‘science’.

What is less remarked upon is the extent to which Paracelsus’ achievements were rooted in his sense of himself as a magus, working with ‘supra-material forces.’ It’s important to state that the early modern magician, or ‘magus’, didn’t turn up at parties with a pack of cards and a rabbit in a hat. ‘Natural magic’ was a branch of natural philosophy, a rigorous and intellectual discipline which could help the practitioner to know his Creator, and the world that God had created for mankind. Paracelsus’ understanding of the cosmos was certainly a spiritual one; he conceived it, in his own words, to be composed of ‘two bodies, an eternal and a corporeal, enclosed in one’. Paracelsus understood medicine in terms of a spiritual relationship between the ‘eternal’ body, or universe, which he called the ‘macrocosm’, and the ‘corporeal’, human body, the ‘microcosm’. The physician’s job was to bring the astral influences of the macrocosm (the universe) to bear upon the microcosm, (the body of the patient). Paracelsus argued ‘it must be understood that the substances received [from the macrocosm] are transmuted by the natural power of the members [body parts].’ The ‘novel sense of specificity’ he developed, a ‘scientific’ advancement for which Paracelsus is often praised, was born from ‘stressing the importance… of the parts of the body and of the influences upon them’. His seemingly ‘scientific’ ideas were informed by a magical, astrological understanding of the cosmos.

We can see similar trends in the work of Giordano Bruno, remembered as a scientific martyr who was burnt for heresy by the Roman Inquisition in 1600. Bruno is praised for the defence and development of the Copernican system, which denied that the earth was at the centre of the universe. In his philosophical tract, ‘The Ash Wednesday Supper’, Bruno argued that ‘it is useless to search for the centre or circumference of the universal world’, because ‘all natural motion tends to be circular, either about its own centre or about some other centre.’ From a modern standpoint, these statements seem ‘scientific’. Yet closer reading indicates that Bruno, like Paracelsus, was deeply influenced by a magical, animist philosophy, which held that celestial objects possessed a ‘soul’. As historian Francis Yates argues in her seminal article, ‘The Hermetic Tradition in Renaissance Science’, Bruno was nurtured on the theological texts of Hermes Trismegistus, thought to be a pagan sage and contemporary of Moses. The Hermetic tradition, argues Yates, led Bruno to interpret the cosmos as ‘an infinite universe ruled by the laws of magical animism.’ Bruno justified his cosmology on the grounds that that ‘the earth and the other stars move according to the peculiar local differences of their intrinsic principle, which is their own soul’. These ‘souls,’ he continued, are ‘[not] only sensitive… but also intellective.’ Bruno’s denouncement of geocentricism (the notion that the earth is at the centre of the universe) was deeply indebted to a magical, animist thought system which would not be considered ‘scientific’ in today’s terms.

The influence of magical discourse can also be seen in Bacon’s attack on Aristotelian deduction, the traditional means of making knowledge in which theories or ‘axioms’ form the start point, rather than the end point, of intellectual enquiry. One way to think about this is to consider deduction as ‘top-down’ logic. Bacon proposed a reversal of this model, arguing that deduction should be replaced by induction, or ‘bottom-up’ logic. The natural philosopher should start with experiments or ‘particulars’, moving ‘step by step’ towards ‘the most general axioms’. The cornerstone of this ‘inductive’ or ‘bottom-up’ methodology was the use of practical experiment; and it is perhaps in this sense that Bacon’s philosophy most keenly reflected the writings of della Porta. Della Porta argued that the natural philosopher ‘must be a skilful workman, both by natural gifts, and also by the practice of his own hands: for knowledge without practice and workmanship… [is] nothing worth’. Bacon’s arguments were strikingly similar; ‘For the subtlety of experiments is far greater than that of the senses… we speak of experiments which have been devised and applied specifically for the question under investigation with skill and good technique.’

Bacon’s experimental method, which looks ‘scientific’ from a modern standpoint, was clearly influenced by magical traditions. This is not to suggest that Bacon saw himself as a magus; in fact he denounced the traditional esotericism, or exclusivity, of natural magic. Yet his experimental, empirical methodology both embraced and rejected magic, and in both instances was a response to it.

Artemis,2y,Why didn't China/India undergo a scientific revolution as in the West?,"Many people believe that the scientific revolution did not occur in China because of China’s large population and lack of resources.I think these are secondary reasons. In my opinion, the reasons for China's lack of scientific revolution can be considered from both political and philosophical perspectives.

First, China's political system emphasizes the emperor's monopoly on knowledge.Beginning in the Spring and Autumn Period（春秋时期）, the academic institutions that were monopolized by the Western Zhou Dynasty(西周）gradually declined, and many academic ideas spread to the folks, which promoted the development of folk academics. During this period, non-governmental academic institutions have the freedom to be independent of political power, and non-governmental academic leaders can even evaluate princes and emperors. However, with the establishment of the Qin Dynasty（秦朝）, which advocated legalism, this academic freedom soon disappeared. Legalists（法家） believe that the emperor is the source of all knowledge and has the power to control and educate intellectuals. Any knowledge must be obtained through official schools, and private schools are not allowed.

Therefore, there are two kinds of knowledge in ancient Chinese society, one is the knowledge of Confucianism（士大夫之学）, and the other is the rule of the emperor（帝王之学）. The rule of literati requires a good understanding of Confucianism, and acts in accordance with the teachings of Confucian sages. The emperor does not need to verify from Confucian classics, because the principles of the emperor are higher than those of the literati. The most important thing is that the rules of the emperor are beyond the understanding and insight of others. The Confucian classic ""The Book of Rites""（礼记） believes that the emperor should kill the makers of magic weapons and those who make false statements, and refuse to accept the argument:

Using licentious music; strange garments; wonderful contrivances and extraordinary implements, thus raising doubts among the multitudes: all who used or formed such things were put to death. Those who were persistent in hypocritical conduct and disputatious in hypocritical speeches; who studied what was wrong, and went on to do so more and more, and whoever increasingly followed what was wrong so as to bewilder the multitudes: these were put to death. Those who gave false reports about (appearances of) spirits, about seasons and days, about consultings of the tortoise-shell and stalks, so as to perplex the multitudes: these were put to death. These four classes were taken off, and no defence listened to.

作淫声、异服、奇技、奇器以疑众，杀。行伪而坚，言伪而辩，学非而博，顺非而泽，以疑众，杀。假于鬼神、时日、卜筮以疑众，杀。此四诛者，不以听。

Obviously, such an environment cannot generate new ideas and technologies. In ancient Greece, knowledge was produced in a democracy like Athens, not a city-state like Sparta.

The second reason is the inherent flaws of Chinese philosophy. For more than two thousand years, Chinese philosophy has been difficult to reach a consensus on basic issues such as ""heaven""（天）, ""good""（善） and ""evil""（恶）, and there is no real theoretical breakthrough.

Compared with ancient Greek philosophy, Chinese philosophy lacked the habit of defining and distinguishing concepts from the very beginning, which caused the discussion of many issues in Chinese philosophy to stay at a very low level.

For example, Chinese philosophy always uses the idea of ""yin and yang""（阴阳） to understand nature. Yin and yang is something that is grasped by feeling rather than thinking. Chinese philosophy does not distinguish between phenomenon and essence, but directly equates phenomenon with essence. This makes it impossible for Chinese thinkers to establish scientific theories about nature, because the premise for the establishment of scientific theories is that people realize that there is an unchanging essence behind the phenomenon of change. Aristotle said in ""Metaphysics"":

Again, we do not regard any of the senses as Wisdom; yet surely these give the most authoritative knowledge of particulars. But they do not tell us the 'why' of anything-e.g. why fire is hot; they only say that it is hot……

Of the first philosophers, then, most thought the principles which were of the nature of matter were the only principles of all things. That of which all things that are consist, the first from which they come to be, the last into which they are resolved (the substance remaining, but changing in its modifications), this they say is the element and this the principle of things, and therefore they think nothing is either generated or destroyed, since this sort of entity is always conserved, as we say Socrates neither comes to be absolutely when he comes to be beautiful or musical, nor ceases to be when loses these characteristics, because the substratum, Socrates himself remains. just so they say nothing else comes to be or ceases to be; for there must be some entity-either one or more than one-from which all other things come to be, it being conserved.

This passage can be seen as a precise criticism of Chinese philosophy.

In my opinion, the reasons for China\'s lack of scientific revolution can be considered from both political and philosophical perspectives.\n\nFirst, China\'s political system emphasizes the emperor\'s monopoly on knowledge.Beginning in the Spring and Autumn Period（春秋时期）, the academic institutions that were monopolized by the Western Zhou Dynasty(西周）gradually declined, and many academic ideas spread to the folks, which promoted the development of folk academics. During this period, non-governmental academic institutions have the freedom to be independent of political power, and non-governmental academic leaders can even evaluate princes and emperors. However, with the establishment of the Qin Dynasty（秦朝）, which advocated legalism, this academic freedom soon disappeared. Legalists（法家） believe that the emperor is the source of all knowledge and has the power to control and educate intellectuals. Any knowledge must be obtained through official schools, and private schools are not allowed.\n\nTherefore, there are two kinds of knowledge in ancient Chinese society, one is the knowledge of Confucianism（士大夫之学）, and the other is the rule of the emperor（帝王之学）. The rule of literati requires a good understanding of Confucianism, and acts in accordance with the teachings of Confucian sages. The emperor does not need to verify from Confucian classics, because the principles of the emperor are higher than those of the literati. The most important thing is that the rules of the emperor are beyond the understanding and insight of others. The Confucian classic ""The Book of Rites""（礼记） believes that the emperor should kill the makers of magic weapons and those who make false statements, and refuse to accept the argument:\n\nUsing licentious music; strange garments; wonderful contrivances and extraordinary implements, thus raising doubts among the multitudes: all who used or formed such things were put to death. Those who were persistent in hypocritical conduct and disputatious in hypocritical speeches; who studied what was wrong, and went on to do so more and more, and whoever increasingly followed what was wrong so as to bewilder the multitudes: these were put to death. Those who gave false reports about (appearances of) spirits, about seasons and days, about consultings of the tortoise-shell and stalks, so as to perplex the multitudes: these were put to death. These four classes were taken off, and no defence listened to.\n\n作淫声、异服、奇技、奇器以疑众，杀。行伪而坚，言伪而辩，学非而博，顺非而泽，以疑众，杀。假于鬼神、时日、卜筮以疑众，杀。此四诛者，不以听。\n\nObviously, such an environment cannot generate new ideas and technologies. In ancient Greece, knowledge was produced in a democracy like Athens, not a city-state like Sparta.\n\nThe second reason is the inherent flaws of Chinese philosophy. For more than two thousand years, Chinese philosophy has been difficult to reach a consensus on basic issues such as ""heaven""（天）, ""good""（善） and ""evil""（恶）, and there is no real theoretical breakthrough.\n\nCompared with ancient Greek philosophy, Chinese philosophy lacked the habit of defining and distinguishing concepts from the very beginning, which caused the discussion of many issues in Chinese philosophy to stay at a very low level.\n\nFor example, Chinese philosophy always uses the idea of ""yin and yang""（阴阳） to understand nature. Yin and yang is something that is grasped by feeling rather than thinking. Chinese philosophy does not distinguish between phenomenon and essence, but directly equates phenomenon with essence. This makes it impossible for Chinese thinkers to establish scientific theories about nature, because the premise for the establishment of scientific theories is that people realize that there is an unchanging essence behind the phenomenon of change. Aristotle said in ""Metaphysics"":\n\nAgain, we do not regard any of the senses as Wisdom; yet surely these give the most authoritative knowledge of particulars. But they do not tell us the \'why\' of anything-e.g. why fire is hot; they only say that it is hot……\n\nOf the first philosophers, then, most thought the principles which were of the nature of matter were the only principles of all things. That of which all things that are consist, the first from which they come to be, the last into which they are resolved (the substance remaining, but changing in its modifications), this they say is the element and this the principle of things, and therefore they think nothing is either generated or destroyed, since this sort of entity is always conserved, as we say Socrates neither comes to be absolutely when he comes to be beautiful or musical, nor ceases to be when loses these characteristics, because the substratum, Socrates himself remains. just so they say nothing else comes to be or ceases to be; for there must be some entity-either one or more than one-from which all other things come to be, it being conserved.\n\nThis passage can be seen as a precise criticism of Chinese philosophy.\n\nReferences:\n\nAristotle, A., & Aristotle.

Shawn Xuande Li,2y,Why didn't China have a scientific revolution considering its early scientific accomplishments?,"Because not only China’s “early scientific accomplishments” are not true, but traditional Chinese thoughts of ontology and epistemology are incompatible with science. These so-called “early scientific accomplishments” are a collective misrepresentation of science, which is firstly and systemically made by Joseph Needham 
in his Science and Civilisation in China
 (SACIC).

Needham’s work has done a contribution in introducing ancient Chinese thoughts and technical works to the world, yet it has also done great harm to the apprehension of science and traditional Chinese thoughts by Chinese and non-Chinese by confusing them about what both are. This harm is gravely damning to the progress of Chinese culture by trapping people in pseudo-science, especially, in today’s China where the single-ruling party is promoting the counter-scientific ideology and non-scientific traditional thoughts for nationalism.

Needham’s SACIC has so far published in seven volumes, probably, in twenty books. It’ll take a great deal of work to bring up all arguments to illustrate my point. So, I’ll try to keep my elaboration as brief as possible to go over the following arguments: (1) Science is not created as a definite consequence of social development that should and will be created everywhere with time. (2) What science is about. (3) What and how Needham gets his SACIC wrong. (4) Why ancient Chinese ontology and epistemology are incompatible with science. (5) Why the CCP’s ideology is counter-scientific.

(1) “In my opinion, one has not to be astonished that the Chinese sages have not made these steps.” —- A. Einstein

The above quote of Einstein is first revealed by the then Stanford professor and sinologist Arthur F. Wright 
in his 1957 Review of Vol 2, SACIC
 published in 1956. Needham published the first volume (Introductory Orientations) of SACIC in 1954 and the second volume is devoted to History of Scientific Thought. The letter by Albert Einstein (below, a copy of the typed transcript of the letter from Albert Einstein Archives, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem) is Einstein’s reply to one of Wright’s students who wrote a letter to Einstein and asked him why China didn’t create science.

Besides briefly speaking on the origin of science by quoting Einstein’s view, Wright wrote on SACIC: “I shall not be concerned with Sinological ‘mistakes’ but with the author's approach, his assumptions, and his methods.”

Wright also quoted George Sarton 
that “The history of science should not be used as an instrument to defend any kind of social or philosophic theory; it should be used only for its purpose, to illustrate impartially the working of reason against unreason, the gradual unfolding of truth, in all its forms, whether pleasant or unpleasant, useful or useless, welcome or unwelcome (A History of Science, p. xiv).“

And he concluded that “Despite the charm of this book, its genuine erudition and flashes of insight, the author's enthusiasm for his subject, and his aesthetic feeling for many facets of Chinese culture, the flaws in its edifice of method and interpretation seem to me gravely to impair its value both for the specialist and the general reader.”

I’ll examine some examples in (3) to see what Wright meant.

(2) What is science and how does it work?

If we understand what science is, it’ll be easier to understand what requires to create science and whether Needham’s analyses are within the frame. Unfortunately, as a comprehensive research project of the history of science and civilization in China, the entire SACIC has no place for the definition of science. Needham and his assistants have the unrestrained freedom to fly.

To me, science is a cognitive system that has four pillars as what it is and how it works:

—-The faith in truth, only in one truth that is searchable. So, science can’t be created in the thoughts that believe in multiple truths because it makes truth-seeking meaningless, or not believe truth is searchable, or believe seeking other values such as ethic values should be above truth-seeking. And, most importantly, the believer in science understands that we may never reach the absolute truth but we can, and can only, approach closer to it.

—-The methodology that applies in truth-seeking. Since there is one truth for all, the method for truth-seeking has to be the same every time and applicable by all. A simple yet very easy to understand principle is Galileo’s “Measure what can be measured, and make measurable what cannot be measured.” (Galileo’s thought sets the ground for Karl Popper
’s philosophy of science.) So, the objects for the research of science must be measurable, and the results of the research must be transformable to measurements, i.e., mathematical models are the language to represent the findings from scientific research (Galileo).

—-The knowledge that is collected through truth-seeking using the scientific methodology. All the findings from doing science are collectively gathered as the scientific knowledge that is relatively closer to the truth but does not represent the absolute truth. So, all findings from scientific work are subject to criticism and ready to be modified even replaced by new scientific findings.

—-The language that is supported by a well developed writing system capable of recording scientific thinking.

Only when all the above conditions and means have converged into one place, it becomes possible to nurture the birth of science. It explains why modern science was only born in one place of human civilization because the convergence had only naturally happened.

Now, let’s take a look at Needham’s approach in his SACIC to bring up his case.

(3) Examples of how Needham gets his SACIC wrong

I’ll take several examples from Needham’s SACIC to discuss the question and the reader can do his reading to draw his conclusion.

A. Where is truth?

Needham takes over 80 Chinese characters to demonstrate scientific thoughts embedded in those characters. Probably no single character is more important than character 眞/zhen (or chen, see below), since scientific thought has to start from thinking about truth-seeking.

Needham gives his Remarks to 眞 as “Seal form of uncertain representational significance, but (as we know from all the related derivative words) almost surely imply ‘full, filled up, solid’. Hence the derived meaning of truth is as opposed to ‘empty, unreal’. The drawing of a full sack standing on a stool, if that is what it is, would thus be an abstract concept symbol.” (SACIC, Vol. 2, History of Scientific Thought, p 223, Cambridge University Press 1956)

I have to say his interpretation is not only a wild guess but a reflection of not following scientific methodology because his analysis does not even bother looking at the history of the character which is very well documented and recognized. The renowned Chinese philologist, the first one of the modern era Chinese scholars who had learned and applied inductive reasoning to study Chinese languages and traditional thoughts, Duan Yucai
, had spent 30 years examining Shuowen Jiezi 
(a and b, below) and published a new version of it with detailed notes of the origin of each of the ~10,000 characters collected in the dictionary (c, below, 1807).

Until this day, Duan’s explanations of the construction of the characters, which is based on studies of ancient literature and records, are still regarded as the most authoritative ones by all Chinese scholars and Sinologists (see photos below of Chinese dictionaries by Chinese scholars across Taiwan strait). Xu Shen
, the author of Shuowen Jiezi, noted 眞/zhen as “A man transformed celestial being has climbed in the heaven.” Duan noted that Xu’s explanation is the original meaning the ideographic character is constructed to express. He added that the ancient classics only speak being truthful (honest, subjectively true) but not being factually/objectively truthful. So, although the character had been created, 眞/zhen only began to show in the works of the Hundred Schools of Thoughts
 Duan concluded.

Later on, other scholars pointed out that “There is not a single 眞/zhen in the Six Classics.” (六經無眞字). The Six Classics are thought the work organized by Confucius. Nevertheless, the Analects by Confucius does not have the character 眞/zhen, either. An example of being truthful recorded in the Analects is the following conversation (excerpted from Book 13, Analects, translated by James Legge):

The Duke of She told Confucius: “In my land, there are righteous men. If a father steals a sheep, the son will testify against him.”

Confucius said, “The righteous men in my land are different from this. The father conceals the wrongs of his son, and the son conceals the wrongs of his father. This is the correct way!”

B. Where is the axiom proof system and what do they ask?

As Einstein pointed out, “the invention of the formal logical system (in Euclidian geometry) by the Greek philosophers” is one of such “two great achievements” that “The astonishing thing is that those discoveries were made at all.”

In his Vol 3, Mathematics and the Science of the Heaven and the Earth, SACIC, Needham failed to point out the fundamental difference between Greek geometry and Chinese mathematics.

Euclidean geometry
 has five axioms, to begin with. The entire ancient Chinese mathematics has none. The Chinese thoughts focused on resolving/calculating mathematical questions not asking questions.

The top world-class mathematician Professor Shing-Tung Yau
 at Harvard gave a speech, Brief History of Math, on Dec. 28, 2019, 
at the University of Science and Technology of China. Yau was first invited to China in 1980 to give academic advice. Now, 40 years later, he enlisted 80 examples written in both Chinese and English to reveal the history of mathematics starting from Thales (c.624/623 BC–c.548/545 BC) to the year 2000. The reader can use Google translate to read his Introduction which is only recorded in Chinese. I’ll quote a part of his Introduction:

“Over the past few decades, I hope that Chinese scholars can find the main direction of mathematics and provide important problems in mathematics, but the trend of Chinese scholars has always been problem-solving, not out of the form of the college entrance examination or the Olympiad! I guess the reason is that Chinese scholars lack macro-thinking, and it is an important defect that the origin of mathematics is not clear enough (to them).

“Most Chinese mathematicians are very concerned about the history of mathematics. Mathematical historians focus on archaeology, and they study the broken paper and fragments of ancient Chinese mathematics. The treatment of ancient documents is not as rigorous as that of ordinary historians. The trend (of math development) is not clear, and the contribution of ancient China is often exaggerated.”

I have not found any recorded comments by Lau on Needham’s thinking of ancient Chinese mathematics. As to Chinese astronomy, Needham quoted Ferdinand de Saussure
 that “As has been well said, 'While, among the Greeks, the astronomer was a private person, a philosopher, a lover of the truth (as Ptolemy said of Hipparchus), as often as not on uncertain terms with the priests of his city; in China, on the contrary, he was intimately connected with the sovereign pontificate of the Son of Heaven, part of an official government service, and ritually accommodated within the very walls of the imperial palace.'”

But, he ignored the truth behind the fact de Saussure pointed out that all detailed observations made by imperial astronomers were used to interpret the will of heaven and then took their interpretation to tell the emperors what the mandate of heaven was meant at the time.

C. Where are the numbers?

Vol 5 of SACIC is for Chemistry and Chemical Technology, and part 7 of it is for Military Technology; the Gunpowder Epic.

Below is one example of Needham’s findings (Vol 5, p 225), “the weapon which is important for us here, however, is a fire-lance, namely a long pole with a cylinder at its end from which issue flames that shoot forward. They do not go upward like a torch, as if there were no pressure behind them, but rather blaze forwards as if from a flamethrower containing rocket composition —- which was exactly the fire-lance was.”

Many Chinese scholars simply disagree with his postulation.

Another picture Needham put in the same book is a large fire-lance on a frame (ibid, p 265). Had Needham ever questioned why one of the basic theories used in military weapon development the ballistics had never been developed in China? Just by looking at the picture one would ask how far the cannon shoots.

D. The thinking behind Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

TCM is the topic in Vol 6 of SACIC (1984–2015) and “the possible integration” of TCM and “modern-Western Medicine” is discussed (below, pp 65–66, part 6, Vol 6 of SACIC, 2000).

Needham passed away six years ago in 1994 before the following was published in 2000:

Needham’s successors smeared the difference between modern medicine and traditional medicine, the latter is not based on biological science as indicated by the authors. Yet, they also used “medieval” and “modern” to distinguish the difference between TCM and modern medicine that has moved away from and replaced Traditional Western Medicine. However, modern medicine does not claim it has all the answers to the issues of human health, nor it’s a Western ideal vs. Eastern ideal as the authors suggested.

Wu Lien-teh
 (1879–1960) is a Malaysia born Chinese and UK-trained physician who led the fight to end the Manchurian plague
 (1910–1911) during the last years of the Qing dynasty. The plague claimed 60,000 lives (below) while Wu-led effort was the first time to put a plague to an end in China based on scientific understanding of the disease.

According to Li Shizhen
 (1518 – 1593), the most well-known TCM acupuncturist, herbalist, naturalist, pharmacologist, physician, and writer of the Compendium of Materia Medica
, such an epidemic can be stopped by steaming in-early-state patient’s clothes in a steaming pot that will protect the entire family from being infected. (Below, Li’s prescription excerpted from his COMM. His reasoning is skipped.)

This is not to say everything recorded in COMM is useless. Physical therapy such as acupuncture and massage are empirically useful, but both their understanding and application are not science-based. Although the finding of Artemisinin by Tu Youyou
 is a great contribution, it does not change the fact that TCM is a part of the old culture with thousands of years of history. If the culture had never nurtured science, how could it be possible that TCM is scientific?

(4) Why are ancient Chinese ontology and epistemology incompatible with science?

Protagoras
 believes: “Man is the measure of all things: of the things that are, that they are, of the things that are not, that they are not.”

Laozi
 believes “Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is it’s being what it is.” ”Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great, and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe, there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. (Excerpt from Tao Te Ching, translated by James Legge.)

So, the classic Chinese thoughts personify nature and design wills to different objects of nature. And Tao is there and the ultimate answer for all. Then, because the sages (and kings) are also great, their existence itself is the mandate of heaven and they must have the power/authority to tell what Tao is. Yet, the process of becoming a king equals heaven’s mandating. So, the entire argument is circular, nonscientific at all. It explains why ancient Chinese astronomy became astrology, and why a scholar’s job is to answer a question that could be any observation of nature, instead of asking questions as professor Yau has been criticizing lacking.

One of the many conditions converging to nurture science but often ignored is the writing system of the language, one of the pillars of science. Without such a powerful thought recording system, it’s simply impossible to carry out a continuous development of thinking and reasoning.

Below is an example showing what it was like when geometry, algebra, and calculus were first translated into the Chinese language altogether as one book.

Li Shanlan (1810 – 1882)
 is the first modern-era Chinese mathematician and the co-translator of Elements of Analytical Geometry and the Differential and Integral Calculus by Elias Loomis (1850, a, below).

Li worked with Britain missionary Alexander Wylie 
(Chinese name 偉烈亞力, c, below, lower right corner) to published so-called The First Calculus Textbook in East Asia (see 東亞第一本微積分課本
, b and c, below, published in 1852–1856).

The Chinese name of the translation means: Algebra, Differential Calculus, and Integral Calculus Step by Step.

If you look at the beginning two paragraphs (c, left side), the writing is up-down and right-left, there are no spaces to separate characters to distinguish word from word. And, the Chinese words that Li and Wylie had created were new to Chinese students, yet, each element of the new words is a word. The following is the rewritten of the translation Li and Wylie did 165 years ago:

In comparison, the original English version was written as below, and the information is carried through in a much more logical way to explain the topic.

Li’s translation was recently put on the internet and surprised many netizens who are shocked by the ineligibility of the text. But, most of them don’t know it’s the same problem even 100 years ago to its readers, including Liang Qichao
 who was 63 years younger than Li, as an incomprehensible book. Would there have been the problem in ancient time a generous Chinese mathematician might have trouble writing down with the characters what he thought? Or, to others that the scripts of a mathematician were incomprehensible? Keep in mind the Chinese writing system has been improved dramatically in the past century, it is very different than Li’s time as to how thoughts are recorded.

Needham didn’t conclude in SACIC that the Chinese developed calculus, but， now, even a mathematician may argue that “we think it is reasonable to say that the reason why modern mathematics has developed to this day is mainly due to Chinese mathematics, not Greek mathematics, and it is mainly Chinese mathematics, not Greek mathematics, that determines the historical development of mathematics. “ (Wu Wenjun
: 中国古代数学对世界文化的伟大贡献
. Wu believes in communism.)

I don’t think Li Shanlan would agree with Wu since he had studied all ancient Chinese thoughts and even attended the local level Imperial examination
 (but failed). He knew what he had to study, and there was nothing compatible with the seven liberal arts (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music theory, grammar, logic, and rhetoric) in his studies for imperial examination. He loved mathematics but it’s neither taught in his education nor required in the imperial examination.

(5) Why is the CCP ideology counter-scientific?

Because, as presented in (2), scientific truth is relatively true and ready to take critics and make changes according to new findings. The CCP bans criticism against it and takes people’s free speech away.

So, it’s not a surprise that the Nobel laureate Henri Bergson
 wrote Open Society and the philosopher of science Karl Popper
 wrote The Open Society and Its Enemies.

And, it’s not a surprise that professor Lau found his students are now even asking fewer questions. Asking questions is the beginning of critical thinking.

Finally, no matter where science has originated or shaped up firstly, it’s a part of the entire human civilization, everyone can learn it, and nobody has an advantage or disadvantage since birth to learn it. So, we can be not counter-scientific.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2i1ft6juc4ngqd0o', 'title': ""Why didn't China have a scientific revolution considering its early scientific accomplishments?"", 'score': {'original': 0.70468571428571, 'ai': 0.29531428571429}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Because not only China’s “early scientific accomplishments” are not true, but traditional Chinese thoughts of ontology and epistemology are incompatible with science.

The Chinese thoughts focused on resolving/calculating mathematical questions not asking questions.\n\nThe top world-class mathematician Professor Shing-Tung Yau\n at Harvard gave a speech, Brief History of Math, on Dec. 28, 2019, \nat the University of Science and Technology of China. Yau was first invited to China in 1980 to give academic advice. Now, 40 years later, he enlisted 80 examples written', 'result': {'fake': 0.1059, 'real': 0.8941}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""in both Chinese and English to reveal the history of mathematics starting from Thales (c.624/623 BC–c.548/545 BC) to the year 2000. The reader can use Google translate to read his Introduction which is only recorded in Chinese. I’ll quote a part of his Introduction:\n\n“Over the past few decades, I hope that Chinese scholars can find the main direction of mathematics and provide important problems in mathematics, but the trend of Chinese scholars has always been problem-solving, not out of the form of the college entrance examination or the Olympiad! I guess the reason is that Chinese scholars lack macro-thinking, and it is an important defect that the origin of mathematics is not clear enough (to them).\n\n“Most Chinese mathematicians are very concerned about the history of mathematics. Mathematical historians focus on archaeology, and they study the broken paper and fragments of ancient Chinese mathematics. The treatment of ancient documents is not as rigorous as that of ordinary historians. The trend (of math development) is not clear, and the contribution of ancient China is often exaggerated.”\n\nI have not found any recorded comments by Lau on Needham’s thinking of ancient Chinese mathematics. As to Chinese astronomy, Needham quoted Ferdinand de Saussure\n that “As has been well said, 'While, among the Greeks, the astronomer was a private person, a philosopher, a lover of the truth (as Ptolemy said of Hipparchus), as often as not on uncertain terms with the priests of his city; in China, on the contrary, he was intimately connected with the sovereign pontificate of the Son of Heaven, part of an official government service, and ritually accommodated within the very walls of the imperial palace.'”\n\nBut, he ignored the truth behind the fact de Saussure pointed out that all detailed observations made by imperial astronomers were used to interpret the will of heaven and then took their interpretation to tell the emperors what the mandate of heaven was meant at the time.\n\nC. Where are the numbers?\n\nVol 5 of SACIC is for Chemistry and Chemical Technology, and part 7 of it is for Military Technology; the Gunpowder Epic.\n\nBelow is one example of Needham’s findings (Vol 5, p 225), “the weapon which is important for us here, however, is a fire-lance, namely a long pole with a cylinder at its end from which issue flames that shoot forward. They do not go upward like a torch, as if there were no pressure behind them, but rather blaze forwards as if from a flamethrower containing rocket composition —- which was exactly the fire-lance was.”\n\nMany Chinese scholars simply disagree with his postulation.\n\nAnother picture Needham put in the same book is a large fire-lance on a frame (ibid, p 265). Had Needham ever questioned why one of the basic theories used in military weapon development the ballistics had never been developed in China? Just by looking at the picture one would ask how far the cannon shoots.\n\nD. The thinking behind Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)\n\nTCM is the topic in Vol 6 of SACIC (1984–2015) and “the possible integration” of TCM and “modern-Western Medicine” is discussed (below, pp 65–66, part 6,"", 'result': {'fake': 0.8666, 'real': 0.1334}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'Vol 6 of SACIC, 2000).\n\nNeedham passed away six years ago in 1994 before the following was published in 2000:\n\nNeedham’s successors smeared the difference between modern medicine and traditional medicine, the latter is not based on biological science as indicated by the authors. Yet, they also used “medieval” and “modern” to distinguish the difference between TCM and modern medicine that has moved away from and replaced Traditional Western Medicine. However, modern medicine does not claim it has all the answers to the issues of human health, nor it’s a Western ideal vs. Eastern ideal as the authors suggested.\n\nWu Lien-teh\n (1879–1960) is a Malaysia born Chinese and UK-trained physician who led the fight to end the Manchurian plague\n (1910–1911) during the last years of the Qing dynasty. The plague claimed 60,000 lives (below) while Wu-led effort was the first time to put a plague to an end in China based on scientific understanding of the disease.\n\nAccording to Li Shizhen\n (1518 – 1593), the most well-known TCM acupuncturist, herbalist, naturalist, pharmacologist, physician, and writer of the Compendium of Materia Medica\n, such an epidemic can be stopped by steaming in-early-state patient’s clothes in a steaming pot that will protect the entire family from being infected. (Below, Li’s prescription excerpted from his COMM. His reasoning is skipped.)\n\nThis is not to say everything recorded in COMM is useless. Physical therapy such as acupuncture and massage are empirically useful, but both their understanding and application are not science-based. Although the finding of Artemisinin by Tu Youyou\n is a great contribution, it does not change the fact that TCM is a part of the old culture with thousands of years of history. If the culture had never nurtured science, how could it be possible that TCM is scientific?\n\n(4) Why are ancient Chinese ontology and epistemology incompatible with science?\n\nProtagoras\n believes: “Man is the measure of all things: of the things that are, that they are, of the things that are not, that they are not.”\n\nLaozi\n believes “Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is it’s being what it is.” ”Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great, and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe, there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. (Excerpt from Tao Te Ching, translated by James Legge.)\n\nSo, the classic Chinese thoughts personify nature and design wills to different objects of nature. And Tao is there and the ultimate answer for all. Then, because the sages (and kings) are also great, their existence itself is the mandate of heaven and they must have the power/authority to tell what Tao is. Yet, the process of becoming a king equals heaven’s mandating. So, the entire argument is circular, nonscientific at all. It explains why ancient Chinese astronomy became astrology, and why a scholar’s job is to answer a question that could be any observation of nature, instead of asking questions as professor Yau has been criticizing lacking.\n\nOne of the', 'result': {'fake': 0.1893, 'real': 0.8107}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'many conditions converging to nurture science but often ignored is the writing system of the language, one of the pillars of science. Without such a powerful thought recording system, it’s simply impossible to carry out a continuous development of thinking and reasoning.\n\nBelow is an example showing what it was like when geometry, algebra, and calculus were first translated into the Chinese language altogether as one book.\n\nLi Shanlan (1810 – 1882)\n is the first modern-era Chinese mathematician and the co-translator of Elements of Analytical Geometry and the Differential and Integral Calculus by Elias Loomis (1850, a, below).\n\nLi worked with Britain missionary Alexander Wylie \n(Chinese name 偉烈亞力, c, below, lower right corner) to published so-called The First Calculus Textbook in East Asia (see 東亞第一本微積分課本\n, b and c, below, published in 1852–1856).\n\nThe Chinese name of the translation means: Algebra, Differential Calculus, and Integral Calculus Step by Step.\n\nIf you look at the beginning two paragraphs (c, left side), the writing is up-down and right-left, there are no spaces to separate characters to distinguish word from word. And, the Chinese words that Li and Wylie had created were new to Chinese students, yet, each element of the new words is a word. The following is the rewritten of the translation Li and Wylie did 165 years ago:\n\nIn comparison, the original English version was written as below, and the information is carried through in a much more logical way to explain the topic.\n\nLi’s translation was recently put on the internet and surprised many netizens who are shocked by the ineligibility of the text. But, most of them don’t know it’s the same problem even 100 years ago to its readers, including Liang Qichao\n who was 63 years younger than Li, as an incomprehensible book. Would there have been the problem in ancient time a generous Chinese mathematician might have trouble writing down with the characters what he thought? Or, to others that the scripts of a mathematician were incomprehensible? Keep in mind the Chinese writing system has been improved dramatically in the past century, it is very different than Li’s time as to how thoughts are recorded.\n\nNeedham didn’t conclude in SACIC that the Chinese developed calculus, but， now, even a mathematician may argue that “we think it is reasonable to say that the reason why modern mathematics has developed to this day is mainly due to Chinese mathematics, not Greek mathematics, and it is mainly Chinese mathematics, not Greek mathematics, that determines the historical development of mathematics. “ (Wu Wenjun\n: 中国古代数学对世界文化的伟大贡献\n. Wu believes in communism.)\n\nI don’t think Li Shanlan would agree with Wu since he had studied all ancient Chinese thoughts and even attended the local level Imperial examination\n (but failed). He knew what he had to study, and there was nothing compatible with the seven liberal arts (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music theory, grammar, logic, and rhetoric) in his studies for imperial examination. He loved mathematics but it’s neither taught in his education nor required in the imperial examination.\n\n(5) Why is the CCP ideology counter-scientific?\n\nBecause, as presented in (2), scientific truth is relatively true and ready to take', 'result': {'fake': 0.0075, 'real': 0.9925}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'critics and make changes according to new findings.

Asking questions is the beginning of critical thinking.\n\nFinally, no matter where science has originated or shaped up firstly, it’s a part of the entire human civilization, everyone can learn it, and nobody has an advantage or disadvantage since birth to learn it.

These so-called “early scientific accomplishments” are a collective misrepresentation of science, which is firstly and systemically made by Joseph Needham \nin his Science and Civilisation in China\n (SACIC).\n\nNeedham’s work has done a contribution in introducing ancient Chinese thoughts and technical works to the world, yet it has also done great harm to the apprehension of science and traditional Chinese thoughts by Chinese and non-Chinese by confusing them about what both are. This harm is gravely damning to the progress of Chinese culture by trapping people in pseudo-science, especially, in today’s China where the single-ruling party is promoting the counter-scientific ideology and non-scientific traditional thoughts for nationalism.\n\nNeedham’s SACIC has so far published in seven volumes, probably, in twenty books. It’ll take a great deal of work to bring up all arguments to illustrate my point. So, I’ll try to keep my elaboration as brief as possible to go over the following arguments: (1) Science is not created as a definite consequence of social development that should and will be created everywhere with time. (2) What science is about. (3) What and how Needham gets his SACIC wrong. (4) Why ancient Chinese ontology and epistemology are incompatible with science. (5) Why the CCP’s ideology is counter-scientific.\n\n(1) “In my opinion, one has not to be astonished that the Chinese sages have not made these steps.” —- A. Einstein\n\nThe above quote of Einstein is first revealed by the then Stanford professor and sinologist Arthur F. Wright \nin his 1957 Review of Vol 2, SACIC\n published in 1956. Needham published the first volume (Introductory Orientations) of SACIC in 1954 and the second volume is devoted to History of Scientific Thought. The letter by Albert Einstein (below, a copy of the typed transcript of the letter from Albert Einstein Archives, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem) is Einstein’s reply to one of Wright’s students who wrote a letter to Einstein and asked him why China didn’t create science.\n\nBesides briefly speaking on the origin of science by quoting Einstein’s view, Wright wrote on SACIC: “I shall not be concerned with Sinological ‘mistakes’ but with the author's approach, his assumptions, and his methods.”\n\nWright also quoted George Sarton \nthat “The history of science should not be used as an instrument to defend any kind of social or philosophic theory; it should be used only for its purpose, to illustrate impartially the working of reason against unreason, the gradual unfolding of truth, in all its forms, whether pleasant or unpleasant, useful or useless, welcome or unwelcome (A History of Science, p. xiv).“\n\nAnd he concluded that “Despite the charm of this book, its genuine erudition and flashes of insight, the author's enthusiasm for his subject, and his aesthetic feeling for many facets of Chinese culture, the flaws in its edifice of method and interpretation seem to me gravely to impair its value both for the specialist and the general reader.”\n\nI’ll examine some examples in (3) to see what Wright meant.\n\n(2) What is science and how does it work?\n\nIf we understand what science is, it’ll be easier to understand what requires to create science and whether Needham’s analyses are within the frame. Unfortunately, as a comprehensive research project of the history of science and civilization in China, the entire SACIC has no place for the definition of science. Needham and his assistants have the unrestrained freedom to fly.\n\nTo me, science is a cognitive system that has four pillars as what it is and how it works:\n\n—-The faith in truth, only in one truth that is searchable. So, science can’t be created in the thoughts that believe in multiple truths because it makes truth-seeking meaningless, or not believe truth is searchable, or believe seeking other values such as ethic values should be above truth-seeking. And, most importantly, the believer in science understands that we may never reach the absolute truth but we can, and can only, approach closer to it.\n\n—-The methodology that applies in truth-seeking. Since there is one truth for all, the method for truth-seeking has to be the same every time and applicable by all. A simple yet very easy to understand principle is Galileo’s “Measure what can be measured, and make measurable what cannot be measured.” (Galileo’s thought sets the ground for Karl Popper\n’s philosophy of science.) So, the objects for the research of science must be measurable, and the results of the research must be transformable to measurements, i.e., mathematical models are the language to represent the findings from scientific research (Galileo).\n\n—-The knowledge that is collected through truth-seeking using the scientific methodology. All the findings from doing science are collectively gathered as the scientific knowledge that is relatively closer to the truth but does not represent the absolute truth. So, all findings from scientific work are subject to criticism and ready to be modified even replaced by new scientific findings.\n\n—-The language that is supported by a well developed writing system capable of recording scientific thinking.\n\nOnly when all the above conditions and means have converged into one place, it becomes possible to nurture the birth of science. It explains why modern science was only born in one place of human civilization because the convergence had only naturally happened.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at Needham’s approach in his SACIC to bring up his case.\n\n(3) Examples of how Needham gets his SACIC wrong\n\nI’ll take several examples from Needham’s SACIC to discuss the question and the reader can do his reading to draw his conclusion.\n\nA. Where is truth?\n\nNeedham takes over 80 Chinese characters to demonstrate scientific thoughts embedded in those characters. Probably no single character is more important than character 眞/zhen (or chen, see below), since scientific thought has to start from thinking about truth-seeking.\n\nNeedham gives his Remarks to 眞 as “Seal form of uncertain representational significance, but (as we know from all the related derivative words) almost surely imply ‘full, filled up, solid’. Hence the derived meaning of truth is as opposed to ‘empty, unreal’. The drawing of a full sack standing on a stool, if that is what it is, would thus be an abstract concept symbol.” (SACIC, Vol. 2, History of Scientific Thought, p 223, Cambridge University Press 1956)\n\nI have to say his interpretation is not only a wild guess but a reflection of not following scientific methodology because his analysis does not even bother looking at the history of the character which is very well documented and recognized. The renowned Chinese philologist, the first one of the modern era Chinese scholars who had learned and applied inductive reasoning to study Chinese languages and traditional thoughts, Duan Yucai\n, had spent 30 years examining Shuowen Jiezi \n(a and b, below) and published a new version of it with detailed notes of the origin of each of the ~10,000 characters collected in the dictionary (c, below, 1807).\n\nUntil this day, Duan’s explanations of the construction of the characters, which is based on studies of ancient literature and records, are still regarded as the most authoritative ones by all Chinese scholars and Sinologists (see photos below of Chinese dictionaries by Chinese scholars across Taiwan strait). Xu Shen\n, the author of Shuowen Jiezi, noted 眞/zhen as “A man transformed celestial being has climbed in the heaven.” Duan noted that Xu’s explanation is the original meaning the ideographic character is constructed to express. He added that the ancient classics only speak being truthful (honest, subjectively true) but not being factually/objectively truthful. So, although the character had been created, 眞/zhen only began to show in the works of the Hundred Schools of Thoughts\n Duan concluded.\n\nLater on, other scholars pointed out that “There is not a single 眞/zhen in the Six Classics.” (六經無眞字). The Six Classics are thought the work organized by Confucius. Nevertheless, the Analects by Confucius does not have the character 眞/zhen, either. An example of being truthful recorded in the Analects is the following conversation (excerpted from Book 13, Analects, translated by James Legge):\n\nThe Duke of She told Confucius: “In my land, there are righteous men. If a father steals a sheep, the son will testify against him.”\n\nConfucius said, “The righteous men in my land are different from this. The father conceals the wrongs of his son, and the son conceals the wrongs of his father. This is the correct way!”\n\nB. Where is the axiom proof system and what do they ask?\n\nAs Einstein pointed out, “the invention of the formal logical system (in Euclidian geometry) by the Greek philosophers” is one of such “two great achievements” that “The astonishing thing is that those discoveries were made at all.”\n\nIn his Vol 3, Mathematics and the Science of the Heaven and the Earth, SACIC, Needham failed to point out the fundamental difference between Greek geometry and Chinese mathematics.\n\nEuclidean geometry\n has five axioms, to begin with. The entire ancient Chinese mathematics has none. The Chinese thoughts focused on resolving/calculating mathematical questions not asking questions.\n\nThe top world-class mathematician Professor Shing-Tung Yau\n at Harvard gave a speech, Brief History of Math, on Dec. 28, 2019, \nat the University of Science and Technology of China. Yau was first invited to China in 1980 to give academic advice. Now, 40 years later, he enlisted 80 examples written in both Chinese and English to reveal the history of mathematics starting from Thales (c.624/623 BC–c.548/545 BC) to the year 2000. The reader can use Google translate to read his Introduction which is only recorded in Chinese. I’ll quote a part of his Introduction:\n\n“Over the past few decades, I hope that Chinese scholars can find the main direction of mathematics and provide important problems in mathematics, but the trend of Chinese scholars has always been problem-solving, not out of the form of the college entrance examination or the Olympiad!

They do not go upward like a torch, as if there were no pressure behind them, but rather blaze forwards as if from a flamethrower containing rocket composition —- which was exactly the fire-lance was.”\n\nMany Chinese scholars simply disagree with his postulation.\n\nAnother picture Needham put in the same book is a large fire-lance on a frame (ibid, p 265).

Vaf-Thrudnir,1y,What scientific discoveries were made during the Scientific Revolution?,"Well that is a long list and quite a bit of time to go over but here we go…..

Heliotropic Universe (1543) - Nicolaus Copernicus theorized that the universe is heliocentric. Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Universe. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center.
inertia (1600) - Galileo Galilei discovered the principle of inertia. This laid the foundation for understanding motion.
magnetic poles (1600) - William Gilbert discovered that the Earth has magnetic poles.
planetary motion (1609) - Johannes Keplers first two laws of planetary motion reveal that planets move in an oval path around the sun instead of a circular path.
logarithms (1610) - John Napier published logarithm tables that could be used to speed up complex calculations.
scientific method (1620) - Sir Francis Bacon created the scientific method.
light refraction (1621) - Willebrord Snell identified the law of light refraction, which is referred to as Snellscientific law.
lymphatic system (1652) - Physician and mathematician Thomas Bartholin greatly advances knowledge of the human body by discovering the lymphatic system.
red blood cells (1658) - Jan Swammerdam further unlocks the mysteries of the human body by discovering red blood cells.
microorganisms (1674) - Naturalist Antony Van Leeuwenhoek discovered the existence of microorganisms.
speed of light (1676) - Ole Christensen Roemer captured the first measurement of the speed of light.
gravity and motion (1687) - Sir Isaac Newton released the book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica
, which advanced the understanding of physics, including gravity and motion.

Tom Billings,1y,What is the impact of the scientific revolution and industrialism in the world system?,"The larger impact on how humans live in the world is described in the competent definition of the continuing industrial revolution:

“When a society moves from allocating resources by custom and tradition (moderns read here, by politics) to allocating resources by markets, they may be said to have undergone an industrial revolution” Arnold Toynbee-1884

This massive change in human relationships, from political hierarchies to market networks allocating resources is the predominant change in human relationships over the last 250 years. The rise in productive economic activity from that change has lifted incomes so that where, in 1800, the levels of extreme poverty were around 60%, (extreme poverty defined as < $1.92/day income), the level is now around 6%.

The scientific revolution of the last 400 years has both enabled the continuing industrial revolution, and been enabled by it. Science contributed to the navigational instruments and knowledge that opened the Southern Ocean to navigation, making it impossible for governments to declare monopolies on long-range sea trading. By 1850, the industrial revolution had progressed enough that the accuracy of scientific instruments soared, making far more accurate models of how the universe works possible.

Meanwhile, the waves of reaction against market network allocation of resources continue to inhibit the benefits of both revolutions, in substituting other foci of attention (race, class, pollution, climate change, scriptural literalism, etc.) and have continued in attempts to mimic the traditions of pre-industrial agrarian society hierarchies.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zxn4qhw3jso8vcua', 'title': 'What is the impact of the scientific revolution and industrialism in the world system?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The larger impact on how humans live in the world is described in the competent definition of the continuing industrial revolution:\n\n“When a society moves from allocating resources by custom and tradition (moderns read here, by politics) to allocating resources by markets, they may be said to have undergone an industrial revolution” Arnold Toynbee-1884\n\nThis massive change in human relationships, from political hierarchies to market networks allocating resources is the predominant change in human relationships over the last 250 years.

A) Liber Abaci Italy 1202

Liber Abaci was the first Western books to describe the Hindu -arabic numeral system and to use symbols resembling modern ""Arabic numerals
"". By addressing the applications of both commercial tradesmen and mathematicians, it promoted the superiority of the system, and the use of these glyphs.

B) Larte de labbacho' de labbacho - Italy Treviso 1478-

The earliest mathematics book ever printed in Western culture ( one copy Columbia University USA and one copy Treviso Italy museum )

C) Ars Magna Italy 1543–1545

It is considered one of the three greatest scientific treatises of the early Renaissance
, together with Copernicus
' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium
 and Vesalius
' De humani corporis fabrica
. The first editions of these three books were published within a two-year span (1543–1545

The cultural, intellectual and artistic movement of the Renaissance, which saw a resurgence of learning based on classical sources ( Romans and Greek ), began in Italy around the 14th Century, and gradually spread across most of Europe over the next 3 centuries.

Science and art were still very much interconnected and intermingled at this time, as exemplified by the work of artist/scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci ( one of the best mathematicians in his time…. not only an artist.. ), and it is no surprise that, just as in art, revolutionary work in the fields of philosophy and science was soon taking place.
In the Renaissance Italy of the early 16th Century, Bologna University and Padua University ( James Gregory was taught mathematic in Padua for 4 years ) were famed for theirs intense public mathematics competitions.

It was in just such a competion that the unlikely figure of the young, self-taught Tartaglia Nicolò revealed to the world the formula for solving first one type, and later all types, of cubic equations, an achievement hitherto considered impossible and which had stumped the best mathematicians of China, India and Islamic world for more than 3000 years.

Don’t forget that quadratic formula was known since ancient Babylonians time

Italian renaissance mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano ( complex numbers, discovery of cubic formula equations together with Tartaglia ) Raphael Bombelli, Del Ferro, were responsible for the most important developments in algebra since Babylonians ( Indians invented decimal number but their ""algebra"" was, in some way, inferior to Archimedes's mathematics.. ..who was able to find the formula of parabolic area using Romans number and geometry ).

Zarah Ahuja,3y,How Solar energy will lead to a revolution?,"World-leading research in the Department of Physics the University of Oxford looks set to deliver low-cost, high-efficiency photovoltaic technology that could finally rival energy generation from fossil fuels.

The market for solar photovoltaics (PV) has expanded greatly in recent years, but its contribution to world energy is still small and the technology more expensive than fossil fuels. Silicon, used in virtually all commercial solar cells, is cheap and abundant, but it is costly and energy-intensive to produce it in the pure crystalline form required for PV. For solar power to really replace fossil fuels across the globe, the technology needs to become even cheaper, probably about ¼ of the current price, and more efficient still.

Cutting-edge research led by Professor Henry Snaith at the University of Oxford looks set to deliver exactly this: low-cost, high-efficiency PV technology, based on a crystalline material called perovskite synthesized from earth-abundant precursors, which began to be investigated in 2009 as a material to replace the dye in “dye-sensitized” solar cells. However, a dramatic breakthrough came in 2012 when the Snaith group demonstrated that perovskite was, by itself, an excellent semiconductor. This unexpected result meant that PV cells could be built with a simple stack of thin layers, and this had the potential to simplify manufacture enormously, and deliver much enhanced efficiency.

By 2014, cells made by the group had achieved efficiencies of over 17%, approaching that of commercial silicon modules, and now single junction perovskite cells have surpassed 22%. Commentators described this rapid progress as ‘unprecedented’.

Lily Jackson,Feb 3,What are the inventions of the scientific revolution? Why are they important?,"The scientific revolution, which took place between the 16th and 18th centuries, brought about a significant shift in the way people thought about the world and the universe. During this time, many groundbreaking inventions and discoveries were made that laid the foundation for modern science and technology.

One of the most important inventions of the scientific revolution was the telescope, which allowed scientists to observe and study the stars and planets in greater detail. This led to the development of the heliocentric model of the solar system, which replaced the previously accepted geocentric model and revolutionized our understanding of the universe.

Another significant invention was the microscope, which allowed scientists to see and study microscopic organisms for the first time. This led to major advancements in the fields of biology and medicine, as well as the discovery of new species and the concept of cells.

Other notable inventions of the scientific revolution include the thermometer, the barometer, and the air pump, which all played crucial roles in the development of modern physics and our understanding of the natural world.

These inventions are important because they not only advanced scientific knowledge and understanding, but also paved the way for many other inventions and advancements in various fields.

Michael Munson,4y,Why did the scientific revolution take so long for humanity to get to?,"“Why did the scientific revolution take so long for humanity to get to?”

I want to suggest an entirely different kind of answer to this, because I think it will be very useful in dispelling myths.

My answer starts with…there’s no such thing as “humanity,” in terms of the way that term is used in this question…

…and there was no “scientific revolution.”

First “humanity.” It doesn’t exist, in the sense that this term is too often used. There has never been any consciously even semi-organized and united entity that could be referred to by a single word like that. Believing there has been such, sets a would be investigator/observer up to draw false conclusions about what really happened on the planet over the millennia. What we can logically refer to as “humanity,” is just the vague collective mish mash of recognized humans, who have never collectively behaved in any unified way, other than as the fuzzy critters that they have always been.

Now back to “scientific revolution.” I suspect that this is a complete myth, almost identical to a lot of popular myths, in that the idea that science was a “revolution” is so appealing to many people, that they leap to accept that it actually happened, because of all the fun side stories they can fantasize about once they start playing along.

I only gradually came to be suspicious of this, and other common historical trope, as I continuously studied human behavior through the discipline of Historical investigation, as well as personal and professional adventures and observations.

Mostly, after many years of being told over and over that people were behaving in surprising ways of a sudden through time, and discovering case after case of supposed anomalies to the standard historic narratives supporting that appraisal, I began to actively look, not for revolutions and grand advances by humans, and instead to look much more calmly for the consistencies and continuities that humans display, even at times when it appears that they are overturning absolutely everything.

I saw a film back in 1976, starring Robert De Niro, called Taxi Driver. It crystalized things for me very well. In case you haven’t seen it, it’s the story of a man struggling mightily to make sense of a very unpleasant world, wherein he tries again and again to find a sense of personal freedom, accomplishment, love, and personal value. He has many very unpleasant minnie adventures, gradually sinking further and further into depression and delusion, until he finally decides that the thing to do to make the world a better place and prove his worth, is to assassinate a charismatic politician.

He is thwarted in his attempt, but escapes, and ends up across town, conducting a one-man assault on a prostitution and drug ring, accidentally becoming a national hero.

It was a VERY well made film, and showed clearly that De Niro’s character actually never changed from what he was, from beginning to end. The story that the fictional society he inhabited was dramatically changed from what it might have been, by who he chanced to end up viciously shooting down in his fury, but he himself remained who he was throughout. It was the CONTINUITY that caught my attention.

The same is true, I think, when it comes to “humanities” dealings with “science.” It is one continuous long story, from the earliest hints of prehistory we have, all the way to the present. It’s a straightforward story of humans trying to figure out how to have a better time of things, by working out what causes what, and then applying those deductions and discoveries to trying to get ahead of the game.

There is zero difference between the formulation of any religion, and the efforts to formulate a scientific view of the universe. None at all. The only “revolutions” that took place, were minor, as in turn, various people became impatient with the shortcomings of the previous generations deductions, or decided that they could advance their own goals more by following a slightly different “god.”

The so-called scientific revolution was neither rapid, nor complete. To this day, large numbers of people are convinced that science is a sham, a trick used to distract them or fool them into giving up things they treasure, and that their instinctive personal desires and wishful thinking is the true path to enlightenment and pleasure. That’s why the political movement to ignore climate change, among other challenges, has been so successful.

Back to the core question here: why did it take so long for what we call “science” to take the lead over religion in many places? That’s easier to answer in light of the above: it took a long time, and is STILL in the process of happening, for the very simple reason that being rational, logical, and scientific, is a LOT harder to do than simply believing prevailing myths, and using them to gain personal advantage.

The so-called “scientific revolution” (which would be better described as an evolution) only occurred after enough accidental side elements necessary to it were firmly in place; such as relatively rapid communications systems, the ability to write things down and retain records; political leadership that recognized the value of scientific discoveries to their desire to retain power; and so on. This is why we can find so many “anomalous” examples of very ancient scientific advances which were not followed up on.

Finally, the historic LABEL of “scientific revolution,” is essentially a propaganda term, chosen and promulgated again, because powerful people found it advantageous to say that it happened. Not because it actually did happen. It allows those who used advances in technology and scientific discovery to gain advantage and power, to proclaim themselves heroes, instead of villains, for overturning the lives of many other people.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fhe87nixjg0k5a1q', 'title': 'Why did the scientific revolution take so long for humanity to get to?', 'score': {'original': 0.6791, 'ai': 0.3209}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“Why did the scientific revolution take so long for humanity to get to?”\n\nI want to suggest an entirely different kind of answer to this, because I think it will be very useful in dispelling myths.\n\nMy answer starts with…there’s no such thing as “humanity,” in terms of the way that term is used in this question…\n\n…and there was no “scientific revolution.”\n\nFirst “humanity.” It doesn’t exist, in the sense that this term is too often used.

Keith McLennan,2y,Why didn't China have a scientific revolution considering its early scientific accomplishments?,"Historically, China had many technical accomplishments, and in many of them - such as ceramics, metallurgy, silk-making or aspects of architecture - it led the world. China also had a long history of study and scholarship. However, applied knowledge in practical fields is not by itself enough to launch a scientific revolution. Nor is studiousness on its own enough. What is needed for a scientific revolution is the scientific method, and what is needed for that is an intellectual culture that looks at things as they are and tries to explain them, not by reference to authority, but by empirical observation and deduction.

The problem that Chinese intellectuals faced in this regard may be illustrated from the early life of the philosopher Wang Yangming (1472–1529), who was a contemporary of Leonardo Da Vinci (1452–1519). As a teenager, Wang was intellectually curious and had a thirst for knowledge. The intellectual tradition of his time and place was Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism, and he determined to master it - a highly ambitious goal for one so young, because many Confucian scholars had spent their whole lives pursuing it.

Zhu Xi, the master of Neo-Confucianism in the Song Dynasty, had advocated “finding the heavenly principle through investigating material things.” According to his teaching, a scholar should begin to study one material thing, then study another, and another. After accumulating the theories of several specific things, he might be suddenly enlightened and recognise the “heavenly principle” in everything.

In accordance with this teaching, Wang Yangming decided to investigate the bamboo in the back garden of his father’s government office. Like a monk, he settled down to contemplate the bamboo in front of him, feeling and observing every changing detail. For seven days, he neither ate nor slept as he waited for the sudden awakening. But in the end, the bamboo no longer seemed to be the same grove he had first looked at. His head began to spin, and he fell down ill.

Wang Yangming was an original thinker and he had the desire to understand the world. But to investigate the bamboo, he didn’t cut it open, try to grow new plants, conduct experiments on it, or even touch it. He simply contemplated it, waiting for a revelation to come to him as it had come to Buddha beneath the Bodhi Tree. He had inherited a tradition of an ascetic and semi-religious approach to inquiry, and he could not step outside it.

The teachings of past sages were all-important in traditional China. After his encounter with the bamboo, Wang went on, like his father before him, to prepare for the Imperial Examination by studying the ancient Four Books and Five Classics, as synthesised by the aforementioned Xu Shi three centuries before. The weight of this intellectual legacy was too great to escape, even for a highly intelligent man like Wang Yangming.

Poetry could prosper in such an intellectual climate, but the scientific method could not.

Tom Billings,4y,What are the four causes of scientific revolution?,"1.) The invention of the printing press, which made possible cheap replication of texts, including texts of regular publications circulating between members of societies interested in the natural world, so that conclusions of work done by investigators could be more quickly replicated to be dis-proven or confirmed.

2.) The inclusion in the Eurasian worldview of an entirely new area of knowledge about geography in the “New World”. This let far more people believe that “the ancients” were not the core source of all knowledge. That meant that new knowledge could be acquired with work, and spread.

3.) The extension worldwide of market networks at far higher rates of travel than in the past, revealing the knowledge of other peoples and other places, and expanding industrial society’s worldwide intellectual networks at the same time.

4.) The freedom to speak about new concepts that were not backed by some politically powerful group within society.

Dan Vasii,Updated 2y,"How did the scientific revolution happen? What is its relevance in the history of science, technology, and society?","The scientific revolution happened in Europe - and that not because Europeans are in no way more intelligent than the rest of humanity, but due to certain circumstances specific to them.

Scientific revolution started when Greeks, after contacts with Egyptians and Mesopotamian, started to approach knowledge in a SYSTEMATIC way. This way was never approached, neither by Indians, nor Chinese - the two other great civilizations contemporaneous with the Greeks.

Practically, even if the Greeks did not invent philosophy, they did something else - they systematized the other side of it. Philosophy has two different sides: one deals with what man is and how he should think and behave in the best/proper way; and the other side deals with the relationship of man with the Universe that surrounds him.

So they invented what was called in the Middle Age ”natural philosophy”, the systematic study of nature and its laws. While this study was done with great success by both Indians and Chinese, the way these two civilizations approached it was purely empirical. The Greeks slowly systematized the natural philosophy and the first two figures that started the scientific revolution were Socrates (with his not so famous aphorism ”I know that I do know nothing” and Aristotle (Alexander’s tutor) that tried to systematize the entire human knowledge he had access to. He was so successful that even in the Middle Age he was the magister from “Magister dixit”(the Master/Teacher said). Of course a lot were wrong things or conclusions, but that is how epistemology was founded (the theory of knowledge).

The maximum development of scientific revolution made by ancient Greek civilization is visible in the achievements of Hellenistic period: the circumference of Earth, distance to Moon and Sun, were measured with a great degree of accuracy, the first computer was invented - Antikythera mechanism: the first steam engine - Aeolipile; and many others (Archimedes was another prominent scientist of this age).

After the Romans took over, the scientific revolution took a break - they were pragmatic people, not interested in theories. Most of the great discoveries of this era were made in the famous Library of Alexandria. When the Christianity took over the Roman Empire, the scientific revolution was slowed (it continued with the Byzantines).

The Greek knowledge kept in the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms (Middle East: Syria, Levant and Egypt) was made accessible to the Arabs by translations. The result was formidable - advancements in science made by Arab and Persian mathematicians are more than worthy to mention. Baghdad was the center of learning in this Golden Age of Islam - which ended with the Mongol invasion.

Before Mongol invasion, the contacts between Arabs and Europeans (that started to recoup the knowledge lost in this period of Late Antiquity/Early Middle Age) were made in the South of Italy (Arabs conquered for a while Sicily) and Spain mostly - Cordoba was one of these centers of learning where European scientists came to study. Due to the fact that Greek knowledge (math, philosophy) was now available in Arab language turned this language into the scientific idiom of that age.

The next step was Renaissance - a period of very high complexity. Many factors got into play: the Byzantine Empire collapsed and a lot of its scientists went to Italy (Venice was having many dominions in the area, Crete for example); the contacts with Arab scientific development; the invention of printing press that democratized knowledge; the Reform, that, together with the Great Plague, undermined the power of the Church; the emergence of a merchant rich class that, just like in the Ancient Greece, had the time and penchant for knowledge as both play and way to solve problems. This is the major and decisive stage in triggering the scientific revolution.

The next two stages were Enlightenment and Modern Age. The scientific revolution was developing in a natural way - Europe already took over the oceans in the Age of Discoveries and most of the land in the Colonial Age, all these due to the scientific advancement achieved neither by India (a colony itself), nor China (that missed the scientific revolution due to the fact that Mandarins and not Eunuchs took over the Chinese Empire after the Mongol conquest, forbidding sea travel - while Europe just started the exploration of the world). This set the stage for what Chinese call The Century of Humiliation (1850–1950), during which China was unable to oppose Europeans and had to accept all their requests.

Scientific revolution was a very specific phenomenon, with major social factors and social implications - and it happened in Europe, as its history shows.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xvzr9cdmtkup6s7w', 'title': 'How did the scientific revolution happen?
