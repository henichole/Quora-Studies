Lokesh Dubey,Updated 7y,What are the best examples of a really good design?,"Rumble Strips

These have been there for so long but I didn’t realize that they are literally lifesavers until recently. I actually never knew what they were there for.

So I was driving down from New York,NY to Raleigh,NC recently and I was driving solo. As I was coming here for the first time I had to get a lot of addresses, directions from Google. I was alone so I decided I’ll type one character and then look back on road again for safety. Well it didn’t work out and an auto correction took too much of my attention and suddenly I heard an alarming sound and my car started to vibrate. Not too much but like how it would if my car would be a cellphone. So yeah I was about to go into a ditch if these strips wouldn’t have shook me and said ‘Bzzzzz Eyes on the road buddy!!’. There can be various reasons to steer off the road people may get tired and doze off etc.

So yes in my opinion its very ordinary thing in first impression but very well thought off and I’ll consider it as a really good design to save lives.

Edit: Proceed and read for some elucidation, if required.

I appreciate all for the great reception. However, based on some of the comments, I would like to clarify a few things. This by ‘no means’, is and ever would be an inherent suggestion to take this for granted. My answer is specifically talking about how well thought and simple the design is which I’m sure, and you’d all agree, saves a lot of lives.

As far as my own personal interaction with this specific incidence is concerned, other than the mentioned ‘light bulb’ moment I also got back to my senses to not use my phone anymore while driving. I’m typically a good and responsible driver as its implicit by how keen and vigilant I am on the roadways to observe all the gory details. So yes I indeed stopped after that every now and then if I had to use my phone and I was stopping anyway to take breaks because it was nearly a 12–13 hours drive for me (including stoppages).

Which brings me to my next response on some comments where it’s mentioned that its very bad for cyclists. In my opinion its not rather it’s relative. First of all I was driving on Interstate Highways where typical speed of a vehicle was 75 mph. At this speed I don’t think its safe for any cyclist to be on the shoulder as they’ll really get sucked into the traffic with the low pressure created. Believe me its really really strong. Remember tractor trailer usually drive on the right most lane, go figure :). Irrespective of that right shoulders are not supposed to be that small (the pic is nothing but first image I found on google). According to Interstate Highway standards
 they are supposed to be at least 3.0 m / 10 Feet. If it’s not then that is one odd highway with a lot of space crunch or if its a road in a city then nowadays they mostly have dedicated bike routes along the way and they possess the right of way.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hmws7l15u6qpbote', 'title': 'What are the best examples of a really good design?', 'score': {'original': 0.46945, 'ai': 0.53055}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Rumble Strips\n\nThese have been there for so long but I didn’t realize that they are literally lifesavers until recently.

Peniel Jacobson,Updated 6y,What are the best Google Chrome extensions that give better user experience?,"Be Limitless
Founded by Dr. Balaji Viswanathan (பாலாஜி விஸ்வநாதன்), Anup Gosavi, Arvind Devaraj and Manju Balaji.

It is an extension/app that helps you be productive if you're going to be on the internet for a long time - even set reminders for tasks you need to do.

We know why that is required. Distraction(s)!
The best way to avoid them is having self-control.
Let us say there was a way of exerting control where something nudges you to look back at your actions, remind you that you are accountable to yourself, motivate you and do other cool things.
Wouldn't that be beneficial?
There happens to be one such tool in a domain well known to distract us (the Internet) which exists as an extension to Google Chrome.

When you open Google Chrome, the browser, this is what you would probably see:

Firstly : Functionality
The interface is very good - rich, stylish, slick. The size is < 19MB and I feel I'm using a different browser. Whenever you open a new tab you can see its functions :

You can set :
Goal for the day - the purpose you have opened Chrome for.
Reminder for additional tasks at different times in the day
Goal for the year- just as a note, or with a countdown timer which you can set up.
As an additional feature, it even reminds you to have lunch when you're too engrossed <- This function helped me a lot as I do not get to look at the time when I'm immersed in work.
Make immediate notes. There is a notepad which automatically saves what you type in it. Just click on the icon to activate the notepad, and click outside it to save the content. Even when you switch tabs and open notepad, the content remains. And you can seamlessly send those notes through your Gmail!
The amount of time you spend on each site is timed, and used to plot a graph with the statistics : to see how you have spent your time on the internet. Thus showing if you have been visiting productive sites or wasting your time on the internet - wasting would be the right word for professionals at work. You get to see the stats and identify where you've gone wrong to rewire yourself and function more efficiently.
Oh, and as a plugin - it can be used offline too. Yes, it is free.

Second, Visual appeal
This works best when you are serious and open a new tab. The random motivational quotes which appear before vibrant sceneries and other soothing images refresh your eyes and jolt your brain. The first time I saw that felt like I was staring at something which appeared out of nowhere and present at about 140 centimeters away from my face. That feeling of AWE you get, that is awesome (the word which has been overrated from a few years).

Third, Transitions
Assuming your computer is not lagging behind, it is quick while toggling between its functions. Good fonts with a professional appeal.

In my opinion, little more tweaks and it can become the best extension I am
really grateful to - the other extension I like (and is useful to every person using the internet) is ADBLOCK. ADBLOCK prevents irritating moments while browsing, while this enhances the browsing session.

Remember - You need to open a new tab to see its functions.
It is a browser extension, not your personal assistant with a popup feature.

Personally, I find these 2 functions very useful :
1. BEING ONLINE, WHAT DID I DO TODAY? This.

I would consider spending too much time on Quora is also a distraction ;)

2. Have I achieved what I had started out to do?

Nope, time was being wasted here.

Nitish Jalan,Updated 7y,Did you ever find your lost phone?,"Google Photos helped me. :)

I lost my mobile almost 4 months back. It was actually stolen from my room. I tried calling etc. etc. but then just lost hope and gave up.

But, I had my contacts, photos etc all synced with my Google Account hence it was not a concern and I have already bought a new phone.

A month later I found some random pics/selfies of the flat's caretaker on my Google Photos. I thought he might have mistakenly shared it on my whatsapp or something. When I checked everywhere there was no possible source except my old phone's auto sync.

I checked the image details and found the pic’s device details to be my old phone and location near to my rented flat. I called up the caretaker and threatened him by showing pics and that I will tell the owner etc. Then he agreed that he picked it from my room and gave it back to me.

To my luck he was not literate enough to format the phone and logout the apps.

Nishanth Jayram,3y,What features would make Quora better?,"I’ve given this some fair thought during my years on this site, and here are some of the changes I would like to see Quora implement:

Bring back the old serif font.
I don’t know about you, but I much preferred that typeface—it gave a Quora distinct look and feel, while the current font is just too plain. Sans serif is just… blegh.
Introduce a rewards system.
Back before it was overrun by slug fetishists
 and preganancies
, Yahoo! Answers used a points/level system to incentivize its userbase to contribute, and it was surprisingly effective. Implementing something similar in Quora might encourage more people to write and ask questions, unlike the disastrous QPP program; plus, at no cost.
Fix. This.
I’m not even sure how to explain this, but it’s killing my eyes.
Give people a “second chance” in answering questions.
I love that Quora gives us the ability to edit our answers post-publication, but the fact that we can’t delete and start over is a bit disheartening—especially when it becomes a gamble on which question to post to, in order to gain the most traction. Giving people a chance to “reset” their traction and start over seems like a justifiable change; after all, the process of writing something complete usually doesn’t end with just a single version.
Bring back the feature to search and add images in the editor.
The image feature isn’t perfect at the moment (see above), but it does work pretty well. Still, it would be nice to bring back the convenience of searching for images within Quora’s editor. (This is especially applicable to those who include stock images as clickbait in their answers… you all know who you are.)
Give more complexity to formatting.
I get it, Quora is a question-and-answer site; but it’s clear that some answers warrant a higher level of organization. Plus, it just looks nice! I think the following additions would be nice—if not for answers, then at least for space posts:
Markdown text (underline and strikethrough, specifically)
Titles, subtitles, sections, and subsections
A table of contents (this follows from above)
(Foot/end)notes (we have these for citations, but not for general use)
Include a word counter in the editor.
This is something I especially would use; gosh knows I need to know when my answer’s crossed 900 words and it’s time for me to shut up.
A more sophisticated edit log system.
The edit log is yet another Quora feature which I can really appreciate, but it’s definitely not without its fair share of problems: it’s a glitchy page; the edit log is essentially viewable by anyone; and there is no good way to filter through it, so good luck if you’ve done thousands of them.

A sophisticated system would enable people to easily filter through the stuff they’ve written, as well as access answers they might have deleted a long time back, just in case they want to restore them.
Give users the ability to customize their profiles.
Though you don’t want people changing things willy-nilly with their profiles, I think it would be nice if we were allowed a bit more leeway in terms of personalization: allow them to customize the profile tab, give them a bit of freedom in modifying the look and feel of their page, etc.

So, those are some ideas! Though there’s a lot more where this came from, so I’ll probably end up updating this down the line.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j932vd0i4m6h8obn', 'title': 'What features would make Quora better?', 'score': {'original': 0.49945, 'ai': 0.50055}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I’ve given this some fair thought during my years on this site, and here are some of the changes I would like to see Quora implement:\n\nBring back the old serif font.\nI don’t know about you, but I much preferred that typeface—it gave a Quora distinct look and feel, while the current font is just too plain.

Russ Wetmore,4y,"Who came up with the concepts of “home folder”, “applications folder”, “document folder”, or “downloads folder”? They don’t seem intuitive to some non-tech people.","I am responsible for some of this. At Apple during the early 1990’s, I led the team responsible for integrating the software division’s current Mac OS releases onto new Macs from the hardware division.

Apple Computer, at the time, was only interested in selling computers to businesses. When it came time to produce the first consumer Macs, as part of the skunkworks project that ultimately yielded the Macintosh Performa, we analyzed what we could do to make it easier for consumers to use.

Through user feedback and focus groups, we learned that people were struggling with where to put applications and documents on their hard disks. (They also didn’t understand the difference between on-board memory and hard disk storage, but that’s another topic.) There was no organization at all. Hard disk sizes were growing quickly. The Mac file dialog would default to the last location specified by the user. People didn’t think about where that was on a hard disk and just chose to install apps there. The same applied to documents; they would go wherever the file dialog pointed when they saved them.

Some apps tried to mitigate the issue by forcing those locations on their own, but it wasn’t universally implemented.

For the disk organization issue, I created the original Applications and Documents folders. This was back in the time of Mac OS System 7. I had my team create the folders. They also modified the code for the file dialog to place apps in the right place. When people saved files, it would default to the Documents folder first. People seemed to get it, or at least complained less about not being able to find their files. That system also included a dock as a default for the first time. I'd like to think this is one of the reasons that the Performas were initially successful, making them easier to use. But, I'm biased.

When I explain this to my non-tech friends and family, it’s simple. Apps go in the Applications folder. Documents go in the Documents folder. When you download anything from the Internet or from an app, it goes in the Downloads folder. “Home” folders are the hardest to explain—I usually just set up their Macs to default to one user and just explain that the Home folder is a special location that they probably don’t need to worry about.

Joshua Parin,3y,What features would make Quora better?,"I’ll try to keep away from ones I’ve already seen to refrain from reiterating what basically everyone has said.

Except Dark Mode. We need that.

Actual human content review.

I’m pretty sure Quora is a small team, but would it hurt to actually review the content that’s getting mass reported. You don’t need to scour the entirety of the site picking apart every detail about people’s speech, but can you review the reports on answers at the very least?

Ethan James is getting collapsed like a paraplegic on a waxed floor and at this point he’s going from collapsed to slipping and I’d like for him to remain relatively sane for us.

Trending answers.

In specific topics, it’d be pretty cool to read trending answers in a page similar to digest. The thing with digest is it’s pretty cool, but fairly unpopular answers that I don’t really enjoy make it to digest. Including my own low quality ones. There should be a trending list for answers to really gain traction.

Some answers have more fire than Australia and California combined, they should be noticed.

Profile search bars.

Ever try to search for something on your own profile and it’s not there?

Search bar

Ever try to find that one embarrassing post that you want to delete but can’t find.

Search bar.

Trying to stalk someone?

Search bar.

Why wouldn’t we want one?

A limit on the emojis in answers.

🤢

🤮

Every time I read an answer and I see the color yellow in text that’s an instant click off.

We can agree that emojis in writing is just a no.

Don’t do it.

I’m warning you.

A reasonable limit would probably be about 10.

Other small quality of life things such as dark mode, removal the the open app/leave page bar would be cool.

Franklin Veaux,1y,Why do websites make you scroll through 100 paragraphs before showing you the recipe?,"Two reasons, one a quirk of copyright law and one because of how search engines work.

Quirk of copyright law

You can’t legally copyright a recipe
. So if you publish a website full of recipes, anyone who wants to can come along, steal all your work, put up their own site just like yours with all your recipes, and there’s not jack you can do about it.

You can, however, legally copyright a recipe that’s accompanied by “significant literary expression,” like a story or a travel adventure or blah blah blah whatever.

So recipes (whether in books or on the web) usually come with a whole lotta “blah blah blah whatever.”

Search engines

Okay, why not put the recipe first on the page, and the blah blah blah whatever underneath?

Because if you do it that way, the Google snippet might have the important bits of the recipe, and then people who are Googling the recipe have no need to go to your site.

That's why you'll see lots of applications out there that are only for iPhone or only for Android. However, the benefits of having a responsive strategy are numerous. Not only will your customers feel included, but Google appreciates it as well. They take your responsive design into account when deciding where to place you on the search rankings for the day. Responsive web design techniques are being used successfully with the most accessed sites today, and you can make it happen for your company too. Of course, it will require some effort on your part. See the top practices before you implement your web design strategy.

1. Smaller Is Better

Everyone in the world may not have a smartphone or tablet, but sometimes it feels like they do. If you're working on responsive design for devices of all types, you'll want to start with your smallest screen size available and then scale out. Resources are best used when concentrated on the smaller platforms first, but you have to keep branching out after that. Whether you're on a 20"" laptop or a standard smartphone, the information needs to be easily acceptable. You'll also want to use liquid layouts as much as possible, meaning you're doing one design for several screens as opposed to working individually on each type of machinery and size scale.

2. A Flexible Cityscape in Disguise

Grids make up our world, whether it's in an apartment building or a neighborhood, and they help us figure out where to go and where we are. In web design, it was common to use a fixed-grid method. It meant that websites were given a set parameter, regardless of the screen resolution. It caused the layout to be the same size, but the quality was inconsistent. Now you can use fluid grids which eliminate the need to manually adjust the dimensions, due to their automatic resizing in scale with the browser specifications. The grids actually use percentages rather than fixed data input, so it does a better job of ensuring each image is clear.

3. Using Media Queries

These are already available to you if you're using the CSS3 language, and they work to give the website the exact properties of each browser it interacts with. In order to determine the size of the screen, type of device and orientation of the images, you'll need to effectively use these queries. When text or format looks awkward on different devices, this is referred to as a breakpoint on the layout itself. If your site has features to it that are difficult or awkward to read (like narrow columns or panels), then your media queries need to define where these breakpoints are so the queries themselves can adjust and fix as needed.

4. Simplifying the Process

Having excellent content is one of your best ways to be favored by search engine algorithms and your customers. The more unique content you have that connects with the reader, the more you're likely to be shared and favored. However, having too much content can make your site difficult to load. Creating content specifically for desktop viewers will only complicate your mobile presence. You can tag any component with a .not_mobile if you really want to keep the content on the site. However, it may be a smarter idea to just start paring down the content altogether so you can focus on that which can be loaded across all screens.

5. Menus and Buttons

We all know what it's like to find a website that makes things difficult to find. The actions are clear to whoever developed the platform, but that doesn't mean anything to the user. People are much more comfortable with obvious menus and buttons that leave little room for confusion. A horizontal menu that can be swiped gives the visitor a good indication of what the site has to offer, and reduces the amount of time spent trying to navigate it. Make your biggest draw the largest portion on your screen, and give people large (scaled) buttons to click upon to get more information. Make them specific, and don't try to confuse readers with arrows that point your readers toward advertisements.

6. Headers and Paragraphs

Responsive design needs to have headings and text that look balanced. Too large and it will break up the text so much that reading will be annoying, but too small and you risk the readers having to squint to make out the information. The newest mobile designs make it easier for you to see due to better resolutions which actually should make it easier on you to pick the right sizing for your website. Typically, the optimal amount of characters in a single line will be between 60 to 75 characters. The eyes can follow certain layouts better, so aim for your text or photos to comprise about 500 to 700 pixels.

7. Optimizing the Content

It's one thing to fit the content onto a screen, it's another thing to actually consider yourself from a visitor standpoint. The more information you have up on your site, the more likely it is you can determine what customers are looking for and how easy it will be for them to find. Before you start finalizing your layout decisions, you need to figure out the most important information on the site and which people will want to access it at what times. You can't account for every given situation, but you can put yourself in the readers shoes as much as possible. For example, visitors on your mobile site may not solely be looking for the directions to your business. They may instead just want to know more about what you can do for them. Put the most important information at the top of the page regardless of how customers are accessing content. They used to call this putting the important parts above the fold, but this is really just saving people from having to scroll to find anything.

8. Content Blocks

Your mobile site is composed of content blocks, and unfortunately you'll have to sacrifice certain pieces to make the site easy to follow. You can change the order of things around, so the eye is drawn to different parts of the screen on a desktop rather than a small phone screen. While mobile viewers are looking at the top, desktop viewers are absorbing the site as a whole. If your images are more relevant than your text, then you can manipulate to show one over the other for smaller screens. For a desktop image, you can simply place one beside the other.

9. Foregoing Image Quality

Pictures can really draw a user into a site, and they can make them sit up and take notice about your offers. However, images take a while to load, and they can pose problems to the performance of the page itself. You need to be ready to take out whatever slows down your site, and you may want to think about compromising on the quality of the pictures you do have. If you have any type of animated content or moving designs, then that may just be too many scripts for the device to run. Even if you're a design company, you still need to be able to impress those who may not have the most advanced gadget. Your customers will be far more interested in seeing what you have to offer rather than getting annoyed a slowly loading page.

10. You Can't Win 'Em All

Unfortunately, there are far too many types of technology available for you to figure it all out without investing an often inappropriate amount of resources. Instead of cursing people for using out-of-date machinery, you have to remember that eventually it won't be a problem anymore. People will eventually upgrade and can then start enjoying the fruits of your labor. With the advancements of technology, you know nothing stays the same. The best you can do is try to take into account as much as you can, so you can bring as many customers onboard with the new features.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4vt81czpqlh7g6m0', 'title': 'What are the best practices for responsive web design?', 'score': {'original': 0.75473333333333, 'ai': 0.24526666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'You already know you want a responsive web design, so your customers can easily engage and interact with not just your advanced technology but your specific company efforts as well.

Fatima Khan,27-Sep,How do you think Reddit's decision to pay its top contributors will affect the overall user experience on the platform?,"Reddit's decision to pay its top contributors is a significant and potentially transformative move that has the potential to affect the overall user experience on the platform in several ways:

Quality Content: Paying top contributors can incentivize them to create high-quality content consistently. This can lead to more informative, engaging, and well-researched posts, which can enhance the overall user experience by providing valuable and interesting discussions and information.
Diverse Perspectives: By compensating contributors, Reddit may attract a more diverse range of voices and perspectives. This can lead to a richer and more inclusive community where different viewpoints are represented, fostering meaningful and enlightening discussions.
Increased Engagement: The prospect of earning income from their contributions could motivate users to become more active on the platform. This could result in increased engagement, more discussions, and a wider variety of content, making Reddit a livelier and more dynamic space.
Content Creators' Welfare: Paying contributors can help support content creators financially. This is especially relevant for those who invest significant time and effort in producing content for the platform. It can be seen as a form of recognition for their contributions.
Community Building: Reddit communities, known as subreddits, might become more organized and active as a result of this change. Subreddit moderators and active users may be more invested in maintaining and growing their communities, fostering a sense of belonging and collaboration.
Quality Control: As more users aspire to become top contributors, there may be increased self-regulation in terms of content quality and adherence to community guidelines. Users may be more inclined to report rule violations, leading to a cleaner and more positive environment.
Monetization and Advertising: Paying top contributors could also have implications for Reddit's revenue model. It might reduce the platform's reliance on traditional advertising by creating an ecosystem where content creators and the platform share in the value generated.

However, there are also potential challenges and concerns:

Competition and Tension: Increased competition for compensation could lead to tension among users, with some feeling that their contributions are undervalued or that it's harder to gain recognition.
Quality vs. Quantity: There may be a risk of prioritizing quantity over quality as users strive to maximize their earnings, potentially flooding the platform with low-effort content.
Inequality: Pay structures and criteria for compensation may inadvertently exacerbate inequalities, favoring certain types of content or contributors over others.
Commercialization: Some users may be concerned that this move could lead to the commercialization of Reddit and dilute its culture of organic, user-driven content.

In conclusion, Reddit's decision to pay top contributors has the potential to positively impact the platform by incentivizing high-quality content and fostering a more diverse and engaged community. However, it also raises questions about competition, inequality, and the evolving nature of the platform's culture. The actual effects will depend on how Reddit implements and manages this compensation system and how users adapt to these changes over time.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zmclsrjpfvne9q0b', 'title': ""How do you think Reddit's decision to pay its top contributors will affect the overall user experience on the platform?"", 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Reddit's decision to pay its top contributors is a significant and potentially transformative move that has the potential to affect the overall user experience on the platform in several ways:\n\nQuality Content: Paying top contributors can incentivize them to create high-quality content consistently.

Shefali Naidu,6y,"What is something you get wrong, every single time you try to do it right?","Trying to translate from Hindi to Tamil.

Some of you wont get it but for me translating sentences from Hindi to Tamil has always landed me in soup.

I know Tamil because my father was a Tamilian and I often used to speak with him in it. But like the mixture of cultures in our house my so called Tamil was also a blend of English and Hindi.

Only when I got married did I start attempting pure Tamil which had hilarious result.

Once while shopping in Chennai I asked my husband if we could buy one earring I liked.

“Ithu earring etukkalam aa?”

My literal translation from Hindi made the sentence sound as if I wanted to steal it. The shopkeeper looked at my husband who cleared the confusion by saying what I meant.

I once even asked my mother-in-law if she wanted to have liquor with me. With the same literal translation, I made my small-town-mother-in-law look at me in shock. I realised the next moment I have said something wrong. I mean who has a slang for water as liquor?

An another instance is when during a checklist to invite people for a party I wanted to ask,

Should we take the ‘X’ person out and put ‘Y’?

And its literal meaning became I wanted to murder the person.

James Jordan,Updated 5y,Do some employees follow some white people around in some stores in the United States?,"Long ago in the early ’80s, I worked in Loss Prevention for Target. The guy who trained me and I had the highest apprehension rates in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, one topping the other for a month or two, and the other pulling ahead. Until I came on board, he always had the most arrests, and I was the first person he'd trained. So it was obvious his methods worked.

My trainer taught me to look at each person for something out of the ordinary, if they looked nervous or shady, and how they were dressed, specifically their shoes. Race didn't enter into the evaluation. Most of the people we arrested were white, but that was because the area was predominantly white. When I was moved to a store in a black community, most arrests were black people. But at that store I'd also follow people because they were white (out of the ordinary for that store). Many of the white people would steal there because they thought they wouldn't get caught. And they were wrong! The black employees took it personally, and often notified me if they saw a white person shoplifting.

I enjoyed the work and was good at it. I would often sit in a booth in the snack bar where I could see the front doors and pick up on suspicious people as soon as they walked in, no matter what their race was. If they had ratty old shoes and headed right to the shoe department, I'd catch them trying on new shoes and then walking out with them on. If a shady couple came in and immediately split up, I'd follow the one heading to the higher value merchandise locations.

Hayleigh,2y,What features would make Quora better?,"Bringing back the most viewed writer features on topics
well, sure. It’s not that much of a big deal but it’s fun competing and watching yourself get a most-viewed rank
Besides, most people complain when it got removed but probably because that's a fun feature that motivates people to write more
Bring back the suggested edits feature
Sure, spam, trolling, and vandalization are common in this feature but at the end of the day, the author gets to decide whether to publish it or not.
Fix the share upvotes
It's frustrating seeing how shares get more upvotes than an answer, imagine writing a good long paragraph, getting a few upvotes, and then a share gets more upvotes than your answer when they didn't even do anything than just share
Honestly, I think the share upvotes should get an automatic upvote to the answer itself
Unless they would put in a “quote share” or something where they would caption the share and also get separate upvotes (you know, like Twitter)
remove Anonymous questions
There are a LOT of troll questions on Quora, and most of them hide behind an anonymous feature.
Quora mods to review the account of the person reported
Since most reports are automatic, quora mods should review the account being reported before banning the account
Because people have the literal audacity to make alt accounts just to ban one account that did nothing wrong just for the sake of it, that's why.

But Tiktok also has a ‘Following’ page, so you can view videos from only people you follow.

Alexander L,1y,Are there any successful products with bad/ugly design?,"One of the greatest and most powerful things that Apple sells is this software called Logic Pro. It is a digital audio workstation (DAW) used by many professional music producers, composers, and even audio engineers (although Pro Tools is generally more preferred among the latter group). Logic Pro is a fantastic piece of software that is relatively easy to learn to use, has a beautiful interface*, and is one of the most stable DAWs on the market.

*But… there is one thing, one exception to that.

It’s this fucking eyesore:

This is ES2. It’s a synthesizer that has a reputation for being one of the best default synths in a DAW (usually the default stuff is crap, so you often have to import third-party plugins). It is tremendously powerful; almost every Logic Pro producer worth their salt knows this synth like the back of their hand.

But holy crap is it ugly.

If you’re not a producer or composer, you might not know what any of these dials or sliders do, but for the sake of this answer, you don’t need to.

Just look at this for comparison:

This is MaiTai. It’s the default synth in Studio One (another DAW) that basically does everything ES2 does, but obviously it looks like it was made by a sober designer who hails from planet Earth.

The interface is way cleaner, way more organized; the typography is consistent and UI elements are spaced well.

Presonus, the company behind Studio One, is not a small business, but they are dwarfed by Apple. It’s shocking to me how a company as big and wealthy as Apple can’t be bothered to delegate even one designer to clean up ES2 and make it look not so alien.

Look, I know ES2 was not originally designed by Apple. Logic Pro, after all, was acquired by Apple from a much smaller software company— but Jesus Christ guys, it’s been 20 fucking years!

Tim Mensch,4y,How important is placing comments on code for professional programmers?,"Judging by answers, there are a lot of very divergent opinions on this topic.

All the way from “comments are useless” to “I'll fire any developer who doesn't comment code.”

Both positions are very misguided in my judgment, at least at that level of detail.

Commenting APIs is critical. It's gross malpractice to suggest that people “read the code” to determine how to use an API. When I'm using an API, I want to be able to treat the code as a black box. The only reason I will open it is if it doesn't work.

And I'm really good at reading code. I'm not a beginner. I just don't want to waste my time digging though code when someone can say, in a few words, how something is intended to be used.

Your dislike of writing docs doesn't justify your lack of comments. It's a poor excuse, and really just reads as “I would rather be lazy than write and update a couple sentences for each entry point for my library.” Don't be that person.

Within the body of a function, however, documentation really should only exist when the code is surprising. Documenting every for loop, or every if statement, is a waste of time if you're just saying what the code is doing. Worse, overly verbose documentation will almost always get out of sync with the code. And keeping it in sync will be a waste of programmer time on both ends.

Don't explain what's obvious. If you have a line of code that increments a variable, only comment it if there's something unusual about it, like it's being done at exactly that location because that's where the count needs to increment. Or if you're doing something weird, then you could add a comment to explain why.

Otherwise, yes, the code itself should be self-explanatory.

Comments shouldn't exist to teach beginners what the code does. But they should be added at any point where someone with experience is likely to think that the code could be refactored in a manner that will actually, surprisingly, break it.

Comments should complement the code and document the API. That's all.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kbwivtdy2qmh04e8', 'title': 'How important is placing comments on code for professional programmers?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Judging by answers, there are a lot of very divergent opinions on this topic.\n\nAll the way from “comments are useless” to “I'll fire any developer who doesn't comment code.”\n\nBoth positions are very misguided in my judgment, at least at that level of detail.\n\nCommenting APIs is critical.

Dana Jandhyala,6y,What are the best examples of a really good design?,"This!

A library that opened up in China recently.

Here are some fun facts about this uniquely designed architectural marvel:

It has been given the shape of an eye, both outside as well as inside.
Look from outside, and it would seem like an eye is staring at you through the building’s glazed facade.
Get inside and it will feel like you are literally walking inside an eyeball; exactly the reason why the atrium of the building has a giant spherical structure in the center, you guessed it, like a pupil.
The five-story building has a row-like design from floor to ceiling to look like a continuous book shelf, where books exists till the 2nd floor only. Rest of the rows have image of books printed on them; maybe to ensure visitors have their attention glued to the books instead of marveling the design of this magnificent architecture. Subtle!
The continuous bookshelf design was initially planned to make every row accessible - floor-to-ceiling. Not kidding! The plan was dropped to fast-track construction.

For a world that was presumably moving to ebooks and online reading, this library redefines book reading.

Ritvik Chaturvedi,Updated 5y,What are the best examples of a really good design?,"The ‘swan neck flask’ is a fabulous example…

…when compared to the standard round-bottom flask:

For over two thousand years, scientists believed in the spontaneous generation of life. The ‘spontaneitists’ believed that life suddenly sprang from abiotic matter. If spores were left unattended, fleas and germs would spontaneously rise from them. That meant, a flask filled with sugar solution would suddenly spring with life and turn milky as long as it came in contact with oxygen (shown in the photo below). When they looked at this cloudy solution under the microscope, they saw microorganisms floating in it and they claimed that life had spontaneously generated.

The young French scientist Louis Pasteur was not convinced. He believed that the ‘life’ they saw in the flask actually came from microbes in the atmosphere. The flask went cloudy when those microbes settled in the sugar solution and multiplied there. In order to prove the ‘spontaneitists’ were wrong, he came up with a simple design, that of the swan neck flask pictured above.

The swan neck flask allows the sterile broth to come in contact with oxygen, but prevents the dust particles from coming in contact with the sterile, abiotic sugar solution. If the solution turns cloudy, then it means that life, quite literally, springs out of thin air. But if it does not, it means the ‘new life’ we see comes from microbes. And as we can see in the picture below, the swan-neck flask remains clear.

It looks like a simple design, but it proved instrumental for modern healthcare and science as it taught the world the important of keeping hospitals sterile and led to the development of antiseptics.

Harshit Paul,5y,What are some UX tips and tricks to create high-performing landing pages?,"With the amount of competition available in the market, you need to have a website as attractive as possible for staying a cut above with comparison to your competitors.
Here is an informative insight for designing a successful landing page.

Source:- Top 17 UI Design Mistakes That Leads to Failure of Your Website

→ Subtle Sale Is An Art form – One That Is Difficult To Master

Persuasive design is the latest trend in the UX world, which intrigues the end user in thinking what is next and compels him to navigate further in the website. We will give you an important UI design tip. Never overuse this strategy. If the end user gets annoyed, they will not think twice before moving on to a different site.

→ Color Scheme Makes All The Difference

While planning the design of your website, use a proper color code for fonts, headings as well as backgrounds. Study the color theory properly to find out which color looks good on which background. UI design tips provided by experts state that a well-coordinated color planning will work better in attracting a client rather than using animations. Here is one of the examples of a great color choice. You can refer to source for more trendy web color palettes.

→ Non Responsive Web Design

Today, all organizations are following the mobile first approach. It is ideal that you must think alike your competitors and develop a website that adheres to the best UI practices related to responsive design, works properly on all devices without any horizontal scrolling and has passed all cross-browser testing strategies for mobile as well as desktop browsers.

→ Website not being cross-browser compatible

Today, with so many browsers available on the internet, with their usage share varying across different demographics and devices, we shall give you one of the best UI design tips before you release your website. Perform proper cross-browser testing and make sure that your website runs properly on all the targeted browsers. Here is an example of a div that looks different in every browser
.

The above image is a demonstration of the unique div on LambdaTest platform. You can notice how the appearance is differing from Google Chrome to Mozilla Firefox. LambdaTest
 is a cross browser testing tool that allows you to test your website’s RWD(Responsive Web Design) among 2000+browsers and their assorted versions running on real operating systems.

→ Improper font-size

Keeping a consistent font-size and font-family is very important when you are following the best UI practices. Bold and big typographies are accepted, but it is improper if there is a 4:1 ratio between the font size of a heading and a paragraph.

→ Badly Designed CTAs

CTAs hold the power to command a user to take an action. From color to the font, everything about them should ask a user to “click”. CTAs that are too attention-grabbing compels a user to move away, while CTAs that are too simple, is simply ignored. Keep a balance of color, shadows and a nice font in your CTAs to make them noticeable and clickable.

→ Text, Typography, and Presentation

Nowadays, most website users do not go through the content entirely. If you want to express your idea in terms of content, you should keep a good balance of text content along with images and rich media elements like audio or video. Too much text content will only compel the user to ignore them and in that way, ignoring some important information that you are trying to convey.

→ Designing Mandatory and Lengthy Forms

Forms are an important part of your website, especially in one that requires the user to register. Having a lengthy form with lots of data will only complicate the user and he may miss some important information while filling it up, especially on mobile. One of the best UI design practices is to keep a simple form that is easier to fill up and has as little information as possible. Also, keep a note that you don’t put too many mandatory fields for a user. The more mandatory fields you keep, the higher bounce rate you will experience.

→ Content Is The King, Ads Aren’t!

Ads are a good way of generating revenue for your site. But using too many ads is not at all among the best UI practices. The users get annoyed when they find more ads than useful contents.

→ Complicated Navigation Confuses The User

One of the best UI practices for designing a unique user experience is to create a simplified navigation. This will help the user to navigate to the content which he requires without any complication. A complex navigation bar with too many links and buttons will not only confuse the user but will also make the layout clustered which our objective is to avoid.

→ Website Lacking Contrast

If the design has proper color contrasts, it makes the content readable and an ease to the eye of a user. If the design has a bad color contrast among the fonts, images, and background, the user will easily get frustrated and move to another site.

→ Using Reverse Psychology

Ask a user not to click on a button! Yes, you heard that right. Reverse psychology can be an effective way to persuade users in doing stuff they don’t want to.

→ Let Your CTAs Do The Work For You

Start the naming with a verb like Sign or Register or Download. This guides the user to perform the necessary action.

→ Catchy Hovering

Have a style for your buttons to display more information or attractive animation when the user hovers over them. You can even show additional information on popup or tooltip form to show the user what the CTA is intended for. This is particularly important when the action is complicated and you do not have enough words to name the CTA.

→ Use fewer Links and More CTAs

Replace important hyperlinks with CTAs, but remember not to overcrowd the page. The user should not feel like you are using only CTA’s to persuade the user to purchase your products.

→ Exit CTA Should Leave a Lasting Impression

Exit CTAs are often important, yet ignored. Displaying a CTA whenever a user is closing a webpage, that offers a discount or something exciting is an important CTA design tip to boost the conversion rate. Let’s take a look at the Exit CTA of Skullcandy.

Good luck,

Murali Krishnan,Updated 9y,What features would make Quora better?,"'Ask to Verify' - A2V feature.


Just like A2A requests, Quora users should be able to send A2V requests to verify an answer is factually correct or not.

Take for example, someone mentioned about a quick remedy for a health ailment in his answer. The answer also gets lots of upvotes. Before you try the remedy yourself, you want to verify if the facts provided in the answer are correct.
What should you do?

You see someone posting a controversial answer about NASA Space research. You are not sure whether the facts provided are correct. You know an expert in this topic (yes, Robert Frost!). You want to seek his opinion if the answer is factually correct or not. What should you do?

What are the existing options?

You can check if this answer is upvoted by experts (when the experts related to that field upvote the answer, their names show up in bold in the list of upvoters).


This may not work. Why? Even if one of the experts has upvoted the answer, that doesn't necessarily mean that he agrees to the opinions expressed. The upvoting criteria is subjective. Courtesy: What are some different voting philosophies on Quora?. Even worse, you see no upvotes from any expert. Now, what next?


You can request any expert on this topic through personal message. Else, you may even comment on the answer mentioning the @expert seeking his opinion.


This may not work. Why? First, many users don't entertain and respond to PM unless they are familiar with the sender. Some experts may not even entertain mentioning their @ names in comments seeking opinions. Because if they start responding to individual 'free' requests, they will have trouble managing bulky notifications. After all, what are they going to get in return? (unlike A2A, they don't get credits for their contribution). Now what?


You can directly interact with the answerer through comments and seek proof.


Again, this may not work. The answerer may find this behavior rude as you're challenging his/her belief and hence he/she may not be willing to open up for conversation. In some cases, the answerer may not be able to provide the proof or he/she may again quote a source which you're not convinced of. Then, what next?


You can A2A the expert to answer the question.


This also may not work. The expert may write an answer sharing his own views without touching upon the views already expressed by the answerer. In such case, you will not succeed in verifying the already written answer. Even worse, if the question is something like ""What are some mind blowing facts....?"", the expert may write an answer with a completely different story. How do you verify the existing answer?


You can Google and verify the facts yourself.


This is not easy. Then, why should you use Quora?


Let's have an A2V feature!

To summarize, I believe this A2V feature will be very helpful for many users in almost all topics such as Medicine and Healthcare, History, Legal Issues and Law in Everyday Life, Entrepreneurship, Parenting, Quora (product), Safety, Space Exploration etc. (except for personal stories). Quora can deduct credits from users for every A2V request (just like A2A requests).

Emily Payton,3y,What do people think of Quora's new default avatar?,"Frankly, Quora, I'm disappointed.

No, not in the avatar. In us.

Where is our imagination? Where is our creativity? I thought we were meant to be a talented community, Quora! What has happened to us?

We have viewed this new avatar as an avatar, when we should have been viewing it as an opportunity.

A half-pointy, half-sweeping human thing? Nay! That's what you may see, but I see beyond. Art is all in how you interpret it.

I see…

This excited dog. How could one fail to relate and sympathise with such a cheerful creature?

Or maybe…

This surprised rooster. Perhaps it is scared. Aren't we all better represented by a startled domesticated bird? It's a metaphor, Quora.

Or, in fact…

This enraged, large-chinned gentleman, strangling a helpless woman.

Okay, if you relate to that one, I suppose you do have a few problems.

But what about this…

A shark chasing a small boat, bathed in the off-white beam of a nearby lighthouse. Convoluted, you say? Pish. There's no reason to assume this wasn't what the Quora design team were thinking of when they released the avatar.

This is not a silhouette of a man. This is a Rorschach test. The Quora-bots have given us an opportunity to peer into ourselves, to see what we want to see, what we need to see; and I, for one, am grateful.

Fahad Cheema,Updated 3y,What are the best examples of a really good design?,"Sometimes the value of good design can be so impactful that it can actually save lives.

I came across one such example a couple of years ago when I read in an article that a town in the Netherlands called Bodegraven has installed LED light strips on the sidewalk that synchronize with traffic signals and turn red or green at pedestrian crossings.

This was an ingenious yet simple solution to a problem that could actually take human lives.

What’s that problem?

As anyone who lives in a city knows, public sidewalks these days are a free-for-all of pedestrians staggering along, zombie-like, staring intently at the screens of their phones. As well as infuriating other pedestrians, there’s some evidence that this behavior increases our chances of being hit by a car.

Solution?

To prevent that from happening, this Dutch town put traffic lights where everyone is already looking. Because of this people can’t miss them even if their eyes are cast down toward their smartphone screens.

—

Now, this is called designing for the user by studying their behavior.

This is when I actually understood the importance of good design and I was fascinated by the fact that sometimes the solutions can be so simple.

After all, design is a process of problem-solving and not just making things visually appealing.

Key features of Reddit include:

1. Voting System: Users can upvote or downvote content, determining its visibility on the platform. Popular content rises to the top of a subreddit or the site as a whole.

2. Subreddits: Subreddits are individual communities dedicated to specific topics, ranging from technology and news to hobbies, entertainment, and niche interests.

3. Posts and Comments: Users can create posts within subreddits, and other users can comment on those posts, fostering discussion and interaction.

4. Karma: Users earn ""karma"" points based on the upvotes their content receives. While karma doesn't have a practical impact, it serves as a rough indicator of a user's contribution and popularity on the platform.

5. Moderation: Each subreddit is moderated by a team of individuals who enforce the community's rules and guidelines.

6. Reddit Gold and Premium: Reddit offers premium membership (Reddit Premium) that provides additional features and removes ads. Users can also give each other ""Reddit Gold"" as a virtual gift for particularly noteworthy content or comments.

Roffin Mhd T,Updated 5y,Did you ever find your lost phone?,"Yes, I had a memorable experience of getting back the lost phone. I was travelling from Kolkata to Cochin and the flight was scheduled at 4 AM. I reached the airport by 12 AM and was very sleepy. After dozing off for a while in the chairs, I went to the wash room when I had nature’s call. I kept the phone somewhere in the wash room and left back to sleep once i was done.

After 30 minutes or so, I suddenly woke up and realized that phone is missing. I searched near where I was sitting but no hope. I also rushed to the washroom and checked whether the phone is still there or not. But unfortunately, it was taken by someone else. When I was searching the phone, I met a very old sweeper and told him that I have lost my phone. He called to my number from his phone. Yes It was ringing !. But nobody attends the call :( . We tried for at least 20 times. But it did not help. The phone was recently purchased and I felt sad :( . However, I went back to the seat and accepted the fate. After 30–40 minutes, the old sweeper came running to me saying that the somebody picked his call. The phone was taken by another sweeper who left the airport after his shift. Later he was asked by the airport manager to come back to the airport and return the phone by the and I got my phone back :) .

What amazed me is the way I have got my phone back. That old sweeper’s virtue of calling to my number even after I have left, helped me. I profusely thanked him and offered him some money. But he refused. I felt respect for him.

Jonny Robb,11y,How does one move from being a web designer to a UI/UX designer?,"I studied BSc Multimedia at uni and worked as a designer and front end developer for a major web design agency for 3 years, then gradually realised that actually my passion lay in UI/UX design. I made that transition and now work very happily as a freelance User Experience Architect for big and small London agencies and major brands.

How did I make the transition?

My position was somewhat unique due to my timing entering the industry from uni, UX was just becoming truly and widely understood and valued by major brands and while my agency was at the top of it's game and regarded as one of the best in the UK and the world (particularly for Flash sites) it did not have a user centred design process and made superficial use of formal UX in its design and sales. I started off doing the odd sitemap, I taught myself and read a lot about IA because I was genuinely interested, and started pushing the business to take it more seriously and not treat it as an after thought. Sitemaps led to basic wireframes and I found I was generally doing more of this and less front end dev. Then one day I had an epiphany - I realised that even though I was at the cutting edge of front end dev I didn't care if I did another day of it if it meant I could do UXD full time. I told my company and they gave me my big break - they changed my job title and set me the challenge of creating a formal UCD process for the company and integrating it from the sales process to the studio floor. I would describe the process and being thrown in at the absolute deep and generally flying by the seat of my pants! But I learnt a lot and I learnt fast and it has changed my career prospects and the projects/brands I've worked on beyond all recognition.

My advice based on my experiences

I appreciate I was lucky with my circumstances however there are definitely things I did/learnt to make it happen:

It takes all sorts - The good thing is that you don't need a degree to be a successful UEA/IA, yes there are people out there with HCI degrees etc however UEAs/IAs come from all walks of life - I have brought massive experience to my work based on the fact I used to build UIs and sites for a living. Likewise someone as unusual as a librarian may make for an awesome IA due to their experience at understanding and structuring library databases and large and complex sets of information.
Learn the basics - One day I was a front end dev doing a bit of UX the next day I was tasked with creating a UCD process for a global company, to say I had a lot of catching up to do was an understatement. I read just about every book I could get my hands on from the basic principles to creating good UX documentation. There's loads of brilliant books out there and some excellent websites and UX communities.
Don't just design something cool learn to truly walk in other people's shoes - Being a UEA is the mastery of balancing the users' needs and goals and the businesses objectives. You'll need to practise the skill of really putting yourself in other people shoes - as a UEA I've been a wine merchant, a gambler, a young mother with a sick child, a football fan, a smoker trying to quit - the list is endless. That's what makes it interesting and fascinating - what makes these people tick? what are their fears? concerns? motivators? goals and tasks?

It's all about the narrative - User experience is all about telling a story and telling it well. In my early days I found that if I simply rocked up to a presentation and said tadaaa! and presented my work people would be like ""Is that it?"" with a look of 'so what have you been doing for 3 days?' on their face - so what's going on? It's my job to make things beautifully simple - so simple that some clients forget the scale of the problem! But to make things that simple often takes a massive about of thought, effort, trial and error and I quickly learnt that I needed to take the client on a journey of how I dealt with the problem and created a solution. For this you need to be good at creating a narrative to tell a convincing story, it also takes good, confident presentation skills.

Ask to do more of it - If you work for a company or agency be frank with your boss and tell them you want to do more UX work. UX is really valuable to businesses and UXDs are expensive to hire - your boss if they have any sense should be more than happy to bend your job role. If you're a freelance web designer start to take a more strategic UX design approach to your work where before you might have jumped straight in with design. Try selling this in as extra to your clients.
Walk the walk and talk the talk - Sometimes people don't get UX or it's value - you need to be able to live and breath its benefit and be able to explain it's various facets clearly and succinctly. What I did was take every tool in UXD - from personas to wireframes to user research and created a single paragraph that describes each (what it looks like. its purpose, its benefit, what the deliverable is), I committed these to memory which gave me an arsenal of tools I could draw on explain to people be it in sales pitches or in the design studio.

Start to externalise - Unlike front end dev where my work lived on my computer, UXD is a very public affair, it works best when it lives on post it notes on walls around which to have discussions. We use post it notes A LOT! If you're not used to it already, learn to be happy about printing things out, putting your work on the office walls, getting people to review your work.
UEAs/IAs are not lone rangers - It's easy to fall into the waterfall trap of UXD > Design > Development where work is passed from one team to the other. Generally it pisses people off, designers don't like to colour in wireframes and developers don't like to be mere code monkeys. The best projects are based on a collaborative approach between everyone - although with the very nature of UX it's usually the UEA that is the coordinator and facilitator.


Finally when you think you're more of a UEA/IA than a web designer make the move. Collect all the examples where you have done UX/UI/IA work and create a portfolio. You'll need to demonstrate that while you were a web designer you are now a UEA and that you have the portfolio to prove it. You can look at full time jobs - working in a large agencies like LBi, Sapient or AKQA can be an excellent training ground, while you may go in on the bottom rung you will get to see and learn some great UXD principles and processes.

Simply knocking at their door as a fresh 'newly qualified' UEA might be tricky to land a job though. So another strategy is to freelance right away - you'll need to be very confident in your new found abilities but if you price your day rates competitively you'll be very attractive to small but cool agencies. Although you might not gain the hands on experience of working in big teams of UEAs you'll clock up some cool projects and brands that'll give you the experience the big guys turned you away for not having the the previous year.

In my experience big agencies are awesome for learning UX (process, strategy, documentation, collaboration, presentation etc) but you'll generally be a small cog in a big slow moving wheel. In small boutique agencies you'll generally be the only UX resource so no one to learn from, they'll also often expect the moon on a stick by yesterday, but on the flip side you'll be the 'lead UEA' by default with loads of responsibility on what are often very agile, fast moving and exciting projects.

Hope that helps.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dhfreot9gksz02xp', 'title': 'How does one move from being a web designer to a UI/UX designer?', 'score': {'original': 0.5872, 'ai': 0.4128}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I studied BSc Multimedia at uni and worked as a designer and front end developer for a major web design agency for 3 years, then gradually realised that actually my passion lay in UI/UX design.

I made that transition and now work very happily as a freelance User Experience Architect for big and small London agencies and major brands.\n\nHow did I make the transition?\n\nMy position was somewhat unique due to my timing entering the industry from uni, UX was just becoming truly and widely understood and valued by major brands and while my agency was at the top of it\'s game and regarded as one of the best in the UK and the world (particularly for Flash sites) it did not have a user centred design process and made superficial use of formal UX in its design and sales. I started off doing the odd sitemap, I taught myself and read a lot about IA because I was genuinely interested, and started pushing the business to take it more seriously and not treat it as an after thought. Sitemaps led to basic wireframes and I found I was generally doing more of this and less front end dev. Then one day I had an epiphany - I realised that even though I was at the cutting edge of front end dev I didn\'t care if I did another day of it if it meant I could do UXD full time. I told my company and they gave me my big break - they changed my job title and set me the challenge of creating a formal UCD process for the company and integrating it from the sales process to the studio floor. I would describe the process and being thrown in at the absolute deep and generally flying by the seat of my pants! But I learnt a lot and I learnt fast and it has changed my career prospects and the projects/brands I\'ve worked on beyond all recognition.\n\nMy advice based on my experiences\n\nI appreciate I was lucky with my circumstances however there are definitely things I did/learnt to make it happen:\n\nIt takes all sorts - The good thing is that you don\'t need a degree to be a successful UEA/IA, yes there are people out there with HCI degrees etc however UEAs/IAs come from all walks of life - I have brought massive experience to my work based on the fact I used to build UIs and sites for a living. Likewise someone as unusual as a librarian may make for an awesome IA due to their experience at understanding and structuring library databases and large and complex sets of information.\nLearn the basics - One day I was a front end dev doing a bit of UX the next day I was tasked with creating a UCD process for a global company, to say I had a lot of catching up to do was an understatement. I read just about every book I could get my hands on from the basic principles to creating good UX documentation. There\'s loads of brilliant books out there and some excellent websites and UX communities.\nDon\'t just design something cool learn to truly walk in other people\'s shoes - Being a UEA is the mastery of balancing the users\' needs and goals and the businesses objectives. You\'ll need to practise the skill of really putting yourself in other people shoes - as a UEA I\'ve been a wine merchant, a gambler, a young mother with a sick child, a football fan, a smoker trying to quit - the list is endless. That\'s what makes it interesting and fascinating - what makes these people tick? what are their fears? concerns? motivators? goals and tasks?\n\nIt\'s all about the narrative - User experience is all about telling a story and telling it well. In my early days I found that if I simply rocked up to a presentation and said tadaaa! and presented my work people would be like ""Is that it?"" with a look of \'so what have you been doing for 3 days?\' on their face - so what\'s going on? It\'s my job to make things beautifully simple - so simple that some clients forget the scale of the problem! But to make things that simple often takes a massive about of thought, effort, trial and error and I quickly learnt that I needed to take the client on a journey of how I dealt with the problem and created a solution. For this you need to be good at creating a narrative to tell a convincing story, it also takes good, confident presentation skills.\n\nAsk to do more of it - If you work for a company or agency be frank with your boss and tell them you want to do more UX work. UX is really valuable to businesses and UXDs are expensive to hire - your boss if they have any sense should be more than happy to bend your job role. If you\'re a freelance web designer start to take a more strategic UX design approach to your work where before you might have jumped straight in with design. Try selling this in as extra to your clients.\nWalk the walk and talk the talk - Sometimes people don\'t get UX or it\'s value - you need to be able to live and breath its benefit and be able to explain it\'s various facets clearly and succinctly. What I did was take every tool in UXD - from personas to wireframes to user research and created a single paragraph that describes each (what it looks like. its purpose, its benefit, what the deliverable is), I committed these to memory which gave me an arsenal of tools I could draw on explain to people be it in sales pitches or in the design studio.\n\nStart to externalise - Unlike front end dev where my work lived on my computer, UXD is a very public affair, it works best when it lives on post it notes on walls around which to have discussions. We use post it notes A LOT! If you\'re not used to it already, learn to be happy about printing things out, putting your work on the office walls, getting people to review your work.\nUEAs/IAs are not lone rangers - It\'s easy to fall into the waterfall trap of UXD > Design > Development where work is passed from one team to the other. Generally it pisses people off, designers don\'t like to colour in wireframes and developers don\'t like to be mere code monkeys. The best projects are based on a collaborative approach between everyone - although with the very nature of UX it\'s usually the UEA that is the coordinator and facilitator.\n\n\nFinally when you think you\'re more of a UEA/IA than a web designer make the move. Collect all the examples where you have done UX/UI/IA work and create a portfolio. You\'ll need to demonstrate that while you were a web designer you are now a UEA and that you have the portfolio to prove it. You can look at full time jobs - working in a large agencies like LBi, Sapient or AKQA can be an excellent training ground, while you may go in on the bottom rung you will get to see and learn some great UXD principles and processes.\n\nSimply knocking at their door as a fresh \'newly qualified\' UEA might be tricky to land a job though. So another strategy is to freelance right away - you\'ll need to be very confident in your new found abilities but if you price your day rates competitively you\'ll be very attractive to small but cool agencies. Although you might not gain the hands on experience of working in big teams of UEAs you\'ll clock up some cool projects and brands that\'ll give you the experience the big guys turned you away for not having the the previous year.\n\nIn my experience big agencies are awesome for learning UX (process, strategy, documentation, collaboration, presentation etc) but you\'ll generally be a small cog in a big slow moving wheel.

Jean-Marie Valheur,16-Oct,What features would make Quora better?,"Quora would be massively improved if moderation started taking known foreign influence campaigns seriously.

This is something that has bothered me for a while and I think we need to be aware of the issue of Chinese state-sponsored propaganda on Quora. It’s not a secret, mind you — it’s very much out in the open. In 2018, the People’s Daily wrote about it already.[1] People’s Daily being the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. This is huge. And it doesn’t appear the site’s moderation took any steps even after attempts to mass-influence the site were blatantly admitted in print.

The People’s Daily went on to explain to its leaders exactly how Quora’s algorithms work. What makes it to the front page, and what doesn’t. Which answers are promoted most, how to engage with people, and how to influence them. How to make sure that their pro-China sound comes out on top, and gets the most exposure. And how to get rid and push down more popular answers written by people critical of the Chinese Communist Party. It’s… terrifying. But even more infuriating is the complete lack of any concrete actions against abuse of the site by foreign political influence campaigns.

As I write this, China is actively seeking out tech-savvy people with a high awareness of ‘memes’ and internet culture. They seek these people, and pay them well, for the purpose of “guiding debate” regarding China in a ‘pro-China direction’, as well as for the purpose of promoting the country, and silencing dissent online in sneaky ways. One such ways is mass-downvoting and reporting an answer. Coordinated campaigns get rid of ‘bad content’… not bad as in, actually bad… but “bad for China”.

There’s been a long-standing joke about the “Fifty Cent Army”, the Wumaos, people being paid by the CCP to ‘troll online’ and promote the country’s government through thick and thin… it’s often dismissed by pro-CCP folks as “Western propaganda”. But it isn’t. Because the People’s Daily literally admitted to it. You can’t really blame them too much, I mean they have to hide an actual, ongoing genocide[2] , no wonder they’re desperate for some good press. But this isn’t the way.

Frequently, way too frequently in fact, people write factual, well-written and well-researched answers such as Alan Gould’s beautiful step-by-step analysis and history of the Uyghur Genocide, full of sources, reading material and hard-hitting counter arguments to China’s claims — an answer that has since been deleted from Quora altogether, along with Alan’s entire account, might I add, it can only be found now on his Medium:

They wrote these answers. These essays, I should say, as they go beyond your run-of-the-mill Quora answer. And they’re collapsed. Collapsed, because they are mass-downvoted, mass-reported. There is no ground for them to be collapsed. No rules were broken. Not one. But they’re collapsed, nonetheless. Forcing the author to appeal the decision, perhaps go into some back-and-forth with moderation. By the time the answer is reinstated, it’s lost steam, lost momentum. It’s not right. It’s an abuse of site features and no one among those running the site seems all too keen to stop these abuses.

It’s one thing to actually spread propaganda. I mean, go ahead, knock yourself out, spread some propaganda if it makes you happy! But mass-downvoting campaigns aimed at silencing opposing views? Coordinated reporting of perfectly fine answers for bullshit reasons in the hopes of Quora’s (automated?) moderation collapsing or deleting the answer? That’s not okay. Not even remotely okay. It’s gone on for too long, and lately Russia seem to be getting in on the ‘fun’ as well. Enough already. This is not how you maintain a friendly writing environment. This is how you actively drive good people away from an otherwise wonderful platform.

Time to spread a little awareness, right now. This website is compromised. There are mass-downvoting campaigns going on to hinder the growth of China-critical content, sort of ‘nip them in the bud’, and some of the site’s members are literally paid propagandists. This is public knowledge, and Quora’s moderation staff has yet to take any concrete steps against this blatant and out-in-the-open abuse of what ought to be a good-faith, user-friendly question & answer site.

Alan Kay,Updated 5y,Why did Alan Kay choose rectangular shaped Windowing as the initial style of GUI? What were the considerations and impracticality of differently shaped windowing approach?,"The 4 answers already given are pretty good.

First, one of the earliest — if not the earliest — example of a windowed display with general clipping was that of Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad (ca 1962) which windowed a very large virtual display surface that could be continuously panned and zoomed in real-time controlled by some of the many sensor knobs on the machine below the display. This immediately brought up the problem of clipping lines that were not completely in the window — and arcs too because Ivan also used circular arcs as primitive elements.

The dynamic bridge that Ivan Sutherland is building in 1962 is on a larger virtual display than the physical display, and is therefore shown clipped

On the heels of Sketchpad was “Sketchpad III” which used much of the Sketchpad code and added 3D and multiple views of the object to provide the normal 4 views used in drafting (3D, plan, elevation, etc.).

In the mid-60s Ivan decided to invent “virtual reality” using a Perkin-Elmer heads-up-display originally made for helicopter pilots. This required the “virtual world” to be thought through — which resulted in the general notion of a kind of telescope or camera, one end of which — the window — was in the virtual world, and the other was on the display device — the viewport. (Note that that this terminology didn’t last because it was difficult not to think of the thing on the display as “a window”.)

How to do fast clipping on calligraphic “line-drawing” displays was worried about, because the displays after Sketchpad were told to draw a whole line (the Sketchpad display on TX-2 just drew points). What is called “the mid-point” algorithm was independently invented by Danny Cohen (with Ivan) and Ed Cheadle (with whom I was working on the Flex Machine, which also had multiple windowing).

So multiple clipping rectangular windows were around in the 60s before Parc.

The 3D work — mostly at Utah, but in a few other places — had shifted to trying to generate “continuous tone” images rather than wire frames, and this resulted in searches for efficient ways to determine what color each pixel should have.

This was not done in real-time back then for a variety of reasons.

When I thought about the Dynabook in 1968, I posited a single bit per pixel using an LCD screen (like those starting to be invented by George Heilmier at RCA and Peter Brody at Westinghouse).

I could calculate that one needed about 1 million pixels for being able to do most things somewhat reasonably. This was about 128K bytes — which was much more than I was hoping for the whole machine! — so I also posited that the LCD would have some kind of memory built in, but would still be fast enough to do 10–12 frames of animation.

This is still not much of a display with reasonable resolution of about 100 pixels per inch, especially with regard to visual angle.

It occurred to me that windows on a pixelated display could be easily made to seem overlapped, and that refreshing a window that seemed to be occluded would seem to bring it up to the surface — and that this would be really great on such a small display because it would effective magnify the display surface available without introducing modes.

A few years later at Parc we got to do an “Interim Dynabook” (the Alto, mostly designed by Chuck Thacker), and in 1972–73 we could only afford 128K bytes for the whole machine, but wanted to do a pixelated display not just for the future flat screens but because even with 1-bit per pixel you wind up with a general display — like paper — on which you can display anything.

So we sucked it up and decided to have the Alto display be about 1/2 the million pixels needed: 808 x 606, and using about half the available memory. (Many tricks were used via the Alto’s display list to not have to use all of them all the time!)

Two of the many kinds of graphical objects introduced in Smalltalk were “run-length bit-maps” and “two-bit bit-maps”. Both of these allowed arbitrary shapes to be composited on the screen (i.e. “images” for desk-top publishing are just windows with no boundaries showing, and with the effect of transparent surrounds).

Meanwhile, back at the ranch … (I don’t have room here to say much about “display languages” so will just point …)

We were all of a mathematical turn of mind, and earlier — while many of us were at Utah in the midst of many kinds of graphics that were fomented by Ivan bringing his grad students from Harvard out to “Happy Valley”, and this because John Warnock at Utah had invented the first really efficient way to do CT graphics — the desire to mathematise graphics was intense. The VR HMD used a home-built matrix multiplier, and — so sweetly — the matrices composed, so you could turn a whole chain of transformations into a single matrix if the math had been thought through and prepped.

At Utah and then Evans & Sutherland, and then Parc, and then Adobe, John Warnock and a few others “refined the math” with a few intermediate languages to eventually produce Postscript. Among many good things, PS also introduced the ideas of masking and extruding, which provide a kind of generalized clipping.

If Postscript could be run fast enough, it would be a great replacement for “bit-blt”. A first try at this was on the NeWS UI
 for the Andrew system at CMU, which just barely worked, but was the right idea. The Nile system by Dan Amelang is a recent beautiful and comprehensive way to produce graphical images and their compositions.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/57rqicmyd4tukgnw', 'title': 'Why did Alan Kay choose rectangular shaped Windowing as the initial style of GUI?

This immediately brought up the problem of clipping lines that were not completely in the window — and arcs too because Ivan also used circular arcs as primitive elements.\n\nThe dynamic bridge that Ivan Sutherland is building in 1962 is on a larger virtual display than the physical display, and is therefore shown clipped\n\nOn the heels of Sketchpad was “Sketchpad III” which used much of the Sketchpad code and added 3D and multiple views of the object to provide the normal 4 views used in drafting (3D, plan, elevation, etc.).\n\nIn the mid-60s Ivan decided to invent “virtual reality” using a Perkin-Elmer heads-up-display originally made for helicopter pilots.

Jowita Emberton,Updated 9y,What are the biggest web design trends of 2014?,"CSS Shapes


Support for CSS shapes 
allows designers to flow content around any shape they like - not just rectangular DIVs.



Expect this to become very fashionable once browser support is in place (you can enable this now
, if you want).


CSS animation

Effeckt.css

The gap between web pages and mobile apps is closing. We're moving towards iOS / Android-like transitions between pages, smoothly animated UI components and more. See the short video above for examples.


Websites with video backgrounds

Coulee Creative

As bandwidth increases, and with HTML5 video all but standard, video is being used for full width backgrounds. They certainly have a wow factor, although they're not very suitable for mobile yet.


3D CSS


It's now possible to create interactive 3D models entirely in CSS.
 Expect to see this for product previews and more.


Flat design


Flat design continues to be the #1 design trend recently, with big companies such as Microsoft
 or Apple
 setting the standard. It's not likely to go away in 2014.

Advanced scrolling websites

Robby Leonardi

We've all seen parallax scrolling, but now we have horizontal scrolling, column-based scrolling, infinite scrolling and far more bizarre concepts besides.

Christine,8y,Is simple always better in UX design? Are there good examples where more complexity is necessary?,"Great question! In my opinion, the answer is that simple is not always better (if by simplicity, you mean minimalism). My mission as a UX designer is not necessarily to reduce the complexity of a process, but to reduce the feeling that something is complicated. These two goals can overlap, but they are not the same thing.


Complex = lots of moving parts
Complicated = feels burdensome or confusing

There are lots of cases where simplicity is desirable, but you'll also find that this idea of simplicity actually hinders progress in some special circumstances. For instance, think of an airplane cockpit. It's not exactly the model of simplicity, is it?


Yet the design of airplane cockpits is actually one of the most heavily-researched areas of UX because the consequence of pilot error is so significant. Although it appears complicated to the untrained eye, there is actually a lot of order built into it, and that is the key component of this design. Would it be helpful to hide some of the available options from the pilots and try to optimize a few specific workflows? Maybe, but let's say that you have an in-flight emergency where the pilot needs really quick access to buttons or switches that aren't part of their standard workflow. Burying these features is actually going to hinder them in an emergency, and it may have catastrophic results.

One other example that comes to mind is when I designed an interface for a call center. This call center was unique, in that we didn't want people to think that they were talking to someone in a call center. We wanted to provide more personalized service that felt like the employees were intimately familiar with all of our customer accounts - thousands of them! It was all part of an elaborate illusion to boost our level of customer service. We didn't want to have awkward gaps in the conversation where the employee was waiting for a page of information to load (because that would kill the illusion of expertise!). So that was a pretty tall order for me as a designer. Furthermore, when a call came in, the call center employees never knew which direction the call was going to go, or what the caller would be asking about -- and in many cases, the caller would jump from topic to topic without warning. So basically, we had to provide the employees with instant access to everything (account information, company policies, pricing information and availability, maps and directions, neighborhood information, etc). This created a tricky information architecture problem because you can't really break it down into a traditional hierarchy. Nesting and hiding items would actually hinder the employee's ability to instantly respond to the caller's needs. Instead, the hierarchy needed to be very wide and very flat.

It was the right thing for that situation. In fact, you'll find many more stories like this when you start looking into systems designed for complex processes like accounting, engineering, or medicine.

Now, if I may wax philosophical for a moment... In my mind, UX isn't really about a specific set of rules. People who trumpet the ""always make it simpler"" mantra forget that context is king.

Zach Schnell,9y,How do I create an easy to use and beautifully designed app with no experience?,"
Iterate. Iterate. Iterate. I had the same ambitious goal as you did. When I sat down to build my first iOS app, I envisioned something packed with features and beautiful animations and a unique design. This wasn't a helpful mindset, and furthermore it ultimately wasn't reflected in version 1 or version 2 by any means.

You're just getting started with programming. Good for you! That's terrific, and it's great that you're adamant to jump right into the ocean. But the ocean is big and overwhelming; getting started, just stick your toe in to test the water (I promise I won't use that analogy any more, just stay with me here).

I dove right in. And at the end of my first app I learned nothing. More than that, I got deterred by how much I felt like I needed to do and learn. Programming cannot be rushed like this, I don't think. I completely get wanting to build a beautiful app right off the bat, and I think that's doable. But how?



1. Start simple. Simple doesn't mean a ""hello world"" app, which is unrewarding. Now I completely understand how it's near impossible to grasp what's easily doable and what's not when you're new to programming. So the best thing you can do is limit yourself in screens and features. Can your app function with just three core features? Here are two app ideas. The first, you will see, doesn't follow the aforementioned rule of three. The second one, however, is doable and I'll explain how to develop a similarly basic app.
(1) Say I want to build an app that lets you chat with people nearby. To function, it would need:


To determine your location from the device
To store your location and everyone else's in the cloud
A server in the cloud to store chat messages
An interface to select and partake in nearby chats

Boooooo–too many required features!

(2) But say I want to build an app called ""Today I Learned."" Version 1 only needs three things:


An interface that lets you enter something you've learned
A method of storing each thing you've learned
A way to display all of the stored things you've learned

Sold! Let's roll.



2. Build. Alright so you have the idea. That's not the hard part; you don't need to understand programming to have ideas. So now what? For now, let's not think about beautiful design. All we should focus on is getting aquatinted with our tools. I do not want to delve into the technical details but instead point you to Stack Overflow
, a corner of the internet full of brilliant technologically savvy minds that love answering specific programming questions. If you're programming for Apple, make sure you have a copy of Xcode
 and know that you'll be programming in the language Objective-C.

Again, at this phase don't get caught up in the design. Instead, learn what the different files represent. Learn how to navigate interface builder. Learn about strings (""all of these are strings:"", ""I am 10 years old"", ""cat's food"") versus integers (-10, 19, 203) versus floats (-9/4, 1.1, 93.02). Learn about arrays ([""this list"", ""between brackets"", ""is an array""]). Learn about if statements and while loops that will be the basis of your apps. And ask questions when you don't know the answer. Searching Stack Overflow for how to store user's data in objective c, as is necessary in our app, should lead you to the right path (spoiler: you should use NSUserDefaults).

It's easy to get caught up in the details and hung on the little things. But stay focused. That's why the first step is so imperative. Remind yourself what few features you truly need. Remember not to drown in all of the programmatic possibilities and how bitterly cold the water is (sorry, I had to go back to the analogy). The app may look gross without any design, but if you can get an iteration working, you're doing awesome and are on track to having a beautiful app. Remember: as long as an app lacks proper foundation, any effort you put into design is nullified.


3. Design. Now once you have a working app, you can begin designing. Keep it simple. ""Easy to use"" should come with the app being simple, and ""beautifully designed"" comes now and in a similarly inherited fashion. It's your first app; your goal is to learn as much as possible in the time you dedicate to the app. I recommend utilizing flat design. Make your app beautiful with its color scheme and use of space, but no need to be unique with never-before-seen gestures (that by definition won't be easy to use) or animations. Your time is better spent iterating, finding better ways to implement current features and adding new ones). In our app's case, maybe you can learn how to notify the user if she hasn't saved something she's learned by 8:00 at night. Or let you edit certain things you've learned.

Boom. There's an app.

It's all about getting off on the right foot. It's about picking the right idea when starting simple. It's about not getting caught up on design until you have a functioning app. And it's about staying focused, not getting off track by the (appealing) possibilities brought forth by complexity. Constantly iterate. Constantly learn. Constantly ask questions. And have fun <--- I never got that advice. Coding always had a serious undertone for me, so it felt incredibly professional from day one. It's so easy to pay someone else to program it for you as some have suggested. But then down the line it'll only be harder to:


add features,
make changes,
or develop future ideas and be independent.


So enjoy and learn at your own pace!

Gunjita,05-Feb,What features would make Quora better?,"“Hey, Gunjita. I love your answers. Most of all, I like the way you portray your stories. Especially the metro ones.” A message that converted my Quora DMs from 225 to 226.

“Thank you so much for appreciating. It means a lot and made me smile wide. Keep supporting. Lots of blessings.” I replied.

“Do you know me?” The next message popped up instantly.

“I don't know you. But I remember your name from the sweet replies by you in the comment section of my answers. Thanks for commenting on every answer of mine. And that too, such sweet comments.” I replied.

“You're welcome. I've been reading you for a long time. Admiring would be a small word for that feeling.”

“That's so sweet of you.”

“Don’t you think the Quora messaging sucks?” He asked next.

“Finally someone said it. It doesn't only suck. It is terrible. Horrible, to be precise.”

“Are you this innocent in real life or are you acting?”

“Wait, what? What do you mean?”

“When I asked about your review of Quora messaging, it wasn't because my ears wanted to hear about it being terrible. Everyone on Quora knows about it. I asked for your socials indirectly.” His message made my brows rise to a new height.

“Oh. I thought you were genuinely talking about it. And, sorry I'm not on any other social media.” I replied.

“Not Telegram?”

“It was nice talking to you.” I replied and closed the chat.

“You weren't even that important. Fuck off.” His next message popped up and I backed off the message box without seeing it.

Coming to the question, What features would make Quora better?

Dear Adam D'Angelo, I request you to look into the messaging of this site.

Try it with someone. For once. And, you will easily find out the reason behind me writing this answer.

I need people to stop using it as an easy option to ask others about their social media accounts.

But, if you are going to look into this matter one day, keep one thing in mind. You've done a great job by not allowing the people to know whether their message is unseen or seen & not replied to. I appreciate you a lot for this. And, I know many writers here (including boys) would agree to it.

Still, there are some people who are genuinely sweet and they send me messages I’ll be forever grateful for.

Happy reading:)

Clare Lou,4y,What are some video editing apps/software that are user friendly?,"One user-friendly software I’d recommend checking out is Write-on Video by Kdan Mobile. First of all, it’s very easy to use, yet you still get professional looking videos, and the tools available at your disposal include a video trimmer for fast editing and deleting of your clips, you can add captions and stickers to make your videos pop - customize color, size and font and add stickers that are both static and animated. You can also add transitions to smooth the change between scenes, and there are also several different filters available to suit the mood of your video. Controlling the speed, aspect ratio and background blur/color makes your videos more professional looking, and with an addition of music or other audio, it’s possible to create something beautiful in no time. If you’re thinking of exporting and sharing your videos with someone, direct exporting to YouTube, Vimeo and Twitter will help you with that.
This is a nice, easy app to use with useful tools and an easy way to export and share your creations.

Jake Williams,6y,How different is Quora from when you joined it and now?,"Ask most users now who the biggest users are. You'll get answers such as Nope, Kittie Rayborn, Jordan Yates, Asher Cloud, Brooke Schwartz, Sean Kernan, and possibly even myself. It's even possible to see newer users, even these guys are starting to become old news.

When I joined, all of these people were nowhere to be found. The users everyone would think of were Dan Bradbury, Craig Good, Franklin Veaux, Robert Frost, Katie Anne Holton, and a handful of others. I couldn't name any popular teens back then, which even led to me claiming to be older in the hope of not being dismissed.

The questions were better, significantly so. I suppose because it was easier to be original when asking, but also because you had access to as much room for question details as you wanted. Topics related to sexuality, trans people, science, atheism, and ethics seemed more popular and also more intellectual. The tone of Quora was much more serious, with jokes being kept to a bare minimum (to the point that many of my own answers were highly controversial once I started to gain popularity). There was also more of a, I don't know, feeling as though that which was unusual was to be celebrated, everyone wanted to follow someone who was talking about something nobody knew much about; it is in this that I believe my being a furry is one of the main reasons for my sudden growth in popularity, alongside my previous anonymity.

Speaking of anonymity, all the trolls shared the name 'anonymous' (ironic, if you're familiar with 4chan). There were no bots, and it was rare to find someone spewing out bollocks and attaching their name to it.

Also speaking of furries, I was pretty much it. The topic had something like 60 questions, and only a hundred or so followers.

Quora was much more liberal. I can't recall any popular conservative writers from back then.

There was a time, a little later on, where there were a million questions with the name 'Jake Williams' attached. This became somewhat of a meme, and several times a day I would receive notifications asking me what I thought of pretty much anything. After a while I stopped responding to these questions and they started to die, though every week or so I still see a new one.

All in all, Quora was apples and oranges then and now. Everything, from the people using it and what they wrote on it, to the general tone, to the behaviour of moderation was hugely different.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b8ltz1mh6kepdrxg', 'title': 'How different is Quora from when you joined it and now?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Ask most users now who the biggest users are.
