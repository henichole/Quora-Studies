We Are Here (WAH),Updated 2y,Which screenshot can get views?,"When I gave birth to my first child on September 3rd, I was excited, feeling her small and warm body between my arms.

But after 24 hours, my baby girl Mila failed her first test. She was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect.

After hearing that I cried so hard, and I couldn't breathe.

It's something no mother should experience.

Her body wasn’t getting the oxygenated blood it needs, her heart functions are all missed up, and blood flow in the wrong directions, and they also found a hole in her heart.

Her first week of life has been lots of poking, blood drawing, and test after test, and it was very hard for me to see that every time, I couldn't eat even after being exhausted from the surgery.

The only thing I wanted to hear is the doctor saying your daughter is gonna be okay.

To fix these defects, she had open-heart surgery and was in surgery for around 5 hours.

She needs to stay for 3-4 weeks, for more testing and surveillance, meaning more expense, until we can take her home for the first time, and hope she can have a normal life.

Please, we really need all of the support we can get whether it's a donation, prayer, or share, I'll appreciate every help.

Please I'm begging you for any support, that can help my baby. Please.

. This is how the site looks like:

ARGH! My eyes!

While it may be one of the ugliest websites in existence, it is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant ideas ever conceived.

In 2005, in order to raise money for his university education, Alex Tew launched a website consisting of a million pixels arranged in a 1000 × 1000 pixel grid.

The image-based links on it were sold for $1 per pixel in 10 × 10 blocks. The purchasers of these pixel blocks provided tiny images to be displayed on them, a URL to which the images were linked, and a slogan to be displayed when hovering a cursor over the link.

The aim of the website was to sell all of the pixels in the image, thus generating a million dollars of income for the creator.

And he succeeded.

He even managed to auction the last 1,000 pixels on eBay, which closed with a winning bid of $38,100, bringing a total of $1,037,100 to Alex.

Today, Alex is the co-founder and co-CEO of Calm, a meditation app valued at $250 million dollars

I was alone so I decided I’ll type one character and then look back on road again for safety. Well it didn’t work out and an auto correction took too much of my attention and suddenly I heard an alarming sound and my car started to vibrate. Not too much but like how it would if my car would be a cellphone. So yeah I was about to go into a ditch if these strips wouldn’t have shook me and said ‘Bzzzzz Eyes on the road buddy!!’. There can be various reasons to steer off the road people may get tired and doze off etc.

So yes in my opinion its very ordinary thing in first impression but very well thought off and I’ll consider it as a really good design to save lives.

Edit: Proceed and read for some elucidation, if required.

I appreciate all for the great reception. However, based on some of the comments, I would like to clarify a few things. This by ‘no means’, is and ever would be an inherent suggestion to take this for granted. My answer is specifically talking about how well thought and simple the design is which I’m sure, and you’d all agree, saves a lot of lives.

As far as my own personal interaction with this specific incidence is concerned, other than the mentioned ‘light bulb’ moment I also got back to my senses to not use my phone anymore while driving. I’m typically a good and responsible driver as its implicit by how keen and vigilant I am on the roadways to observe all the gory details. So yes I indeed stopped after that every now and then if I had to use my phone and I was stopping anyway to take breaks because it was nearly a 12–13 hours drive for me (including stoppages).

Which brings me to my next response on some comments where it’s mentioned that its very bad for cyclists. In my opinion its not rather it’s relative. First of all I was driving on Interstate Highways where typical speed of a vehicle was 75 mph. At this speed I don’t think its safe for any cyclist to be on the shoulder as they’ll really get sucked into the traffic with the low pressure created. Believe me its really really strong. Remember tractor trailer usually drive on the right most lane, go figure :). Irrespective of that right shoulders are not supposed to be that small (the pic is nothing but first image I found on google). According to Interstate Highway standards
 they are supposed to be at least 3.0 m / 10 Feet. If it’s not then that is one odd highway with a lot of space crunch or if its a road in a city then nowadays they mostly have dedicated bike routes along the way and they possess the right of way.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hkq7at4sr93w8opj', 'title': 'What are the best examples of a really good design?', 'score': {'original': 0.46945, 'ai': 0.53055}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Rumble Strips\n\nThese have been there for so long but I didn’t realize that they are literally lifesavers until recently.

Håkon Hapnes Strand,1y,What keeps back-end developers from calling themselves full stack developers? Don't most of them know some front-end techniques?,"I learned the basics of HTML and developed my first websites with Java applets and JavaScript 1.0 back in the mid-90s.

When I started pursuing software development as a career much later, I touched on jQuery and Backbone briefly, before learning Angular and TypeScript. In my previous job, we used Vue, and now I’m using React.

I’ve been around the block, but I still wouldn’t call myself a full stack developer, for a few reasons:

I have great respect for the developers who are really good on the frontend. They often work in the intersection of development and UI/UX design. With that skillset, they can really make a website pop. I can hack away to make the frontend do what I want, but a frontend specialist can do it faster and better.
I generally don’t like frontend work. Problems on the backend are often difficult to solve conceptually and easy to implement in code. On the frontend, the opposite is true. I’d much rather work on an interesting backend system that involves complicated logic and/or machine learning rather than making a UI look pretty. I don’t want to advertise that I could do something when I really don’t want to.
By calling myself “full stack”, I could ironically be underselling myself. When people hear full stack, they usually think of a standard web application with a CRUD backend, an SQL database and an SPA frontend. But I have worked on projects that involved so much more. I have worked on distributed systems with crazy requirements for scalability, reliability and performance. I have designed IoT platforms from scratch, MLOps platforms and AI engines.

Dawn Budge,11y,Why are front end developers so high in demand at startups if front end development is relatively easier than other fields of engineering?,"If you are just starting out in front-end, I think you are on the verge of discovering what the phrase 'wicked hard' means. Here's why 1) what Nicholas Zakas calls 'the most hostile development environment in the world'.  There are many browsers.  They have different bugs.  They implement the same features in different ways.  You do not control the upgrade cycle.  Take a look at PPK's compatibility tables and caniuse.com to get an idea of how big this is.   When I developed both server-side and front-end dev, I found the server-side much more liberating in terms of not having to test the same thing over and over. There are many devices.  They have different input methods (mouse, keyboard, touch) and different outputs to consider (large screen, mobile, tablet, retina display, screenreader, assistive technology), and your end user can adapt the output (e.g. enlarging text, changing the colour settings, switching off CSS) 2) Then there's the less cut and dried stuff, and this is usually where techies less experienced in front end dev fail: SEO, accessibility, usability.  SEO because it is based on hints and whispers, and because you need to ensure that your content can still be accessed without JavaScript for the bot to be able to scrape it, accessibility and usability because the level of acceptable performance is subjective.  There is also a disconnect between the WCAG 2 guidelines and how you practically implement a site that will conform to the guidelines.  Let's just say, look at the length of the quickref on http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/ and you'll get an idea. 3) So much more work is being required of the client-side, so you can't get away with procedural javascript code anymore.  Architecting your solution is a necessity.  OO, modular JavaScript often using an MVC pattern is gaining increasing traction, as is testing with tools like QUnit and Jasmine.  If you are interested in learning more about this, I'd suggest looking up Addi Osmani, Stephan Stoyanov, Douglas Crockford, Christian Heilmann.  This is where more junior developers struggle, because JavaScript has a steep learning curve. 4) CSS is painful to work with once your site gets big.  It is very static.  You have to hold a lot in your head and develop strategies for regression testing effectively so you don't go round in circles to see if you've broken something.  5) Between new devices emerging and new standards and features being developed along with a fast pace for implementation in some browsers (but not others), there's constantly new things to learn. 6) Sometimes you find yourself working with graphic designs that are hard to impossible to implement with the above constraints/challenges.  Finally, time spent learning the above the hard way, because nobody teaching can cope with the pace of change.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cv2z1mlo7athkwxn', 'title': 'Why are front end developers so high in demand at startups if front end development is relatively easier than other fields of engineering?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""If you are just starting out in front-end, I think you are on the verge of discovering what the phrase 'wicked hard' means.

Architecting your solution is a necessity.  OO, modular JavaScript often using an MVC pattern is gaining increasing traction, as is testing with tools like QUnit and Jasmine.  If you are interested in learning more about this, I'd suggest looking up Addi Osmani, Stephan Stoyanov, Douglas Crockford, Christian Heilmann.  This is where more junior developers struggle, because JavaScript has a steep learning curve. 4) CSS is painful to work with once your site gets big.  It is very static.  You have to hold a lot in your head and develop strategies for regression testing effectively so you don't go round in circles to see if you've broken something.  5) Between new devices emerging and new standards and features being developed along with a fast pace for implementation in some browsers (but not others), there's constantly new things to learn. 6) Sometimes you find yourself working with graphic designs that are hard to impossible to implement with the above constraints/challenges.  Finally, time spent learning the above the hard way, because nobody teaching can cope with the pace of change."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9994
Neha Ahuja,4y,What are the coolest projects you have made using Django?,"I built a bookstore using Django:

Its an e-commerce store, although not fully functional it has the ability to add a new book with the cover image, book title, author name.

It also has a detail page which displays details of each specific book.

Meaning, you can add a book, delete a book, view a book and update the book as well.

This means that it covers all the basics CRUD, CREATE,READ, UPDATE & DELETE operations which are fundamental to any web application.

Once you learn how to perform these, half of the things are done and you can pretty much build any sort of web application.

Technologies used:

Back end: Django and SQLite

Image server: Local

Front end: HTML, CSS & Bootstrap 3

Django was one of my first backend framework which I learned.

Prior to this I had no previous experience learning anything related to server side web development and hence it took me a while to understand terminologies like authentication, URL routing, API and models.

To be honest it was tough, took me about 2 weeks of continuous learning to get the basics right and a lot of self study and practice to make the project, but I was very happy on completion.

I still continue to learn Django to this day and now I learn more important concepts like Authentication and Authorisation.

Amit Ashwini,Updated 6y,What are the best practices for responsive web design?,"You already know you want a responsive web design, so your customers can easily engage and interact with not just your advanced technology but your specific company efforts as well. With the machinery on the market today, it can be hard to conform design practices that will be compatible with each one. That's why you'll see lots of applications out there that are only for iPhone or only for Android. However, the benefits of having a responsive strategy are numerous. Not only will your customers feel included, but Google appreciates it as well. They take your responsive design into account when deciding where to place you on the search rankings for the day. Responsive web design techniques are being used successfully with the most accessed sites today, and you can make it happen for your company too. Of course, it will require some effort on your part. See the top practices before you implement your web design strategy.

1. Smaller Is Better

Everyone in the world may not have a smartphone or tablet, but sometimes it feels like they do. If you're working on responsive design for devices of all types, you'll want to start with your smallest screen size available and then scale out. Resources are best used when concentrated on the smaller platforms first, but you have to keep branching out after that. Whether you're on a 20"" laptop or a standard smartphone, the information needs to be easily acceptable. You'll also want to use liquid layouts as much as possible, meaning you're doing one design for several screens as opposed to working individually on each type of machinery and size scale.

2. A Flexible Cityscape in Disguise

Grids make up our world, whether it's in an apartment building or a neighborhood, and they help us figure out where to go and where we are. In web design, it was common to use a fixed-grid method. It meant that websites were given a set parameter, regardless of the screen resolution. It caused the layout to be the same size, but the quality was inconsistent. Now you can use fluid grids which eliminate the need to manually adjust the dimensions, due to their automatic resizing in scale with the browser specifications. The grids actually use percentages rather than fixed data input, so it does a better job of ensuring each image is clear.

3. Using Media Queries

These are already available to you if you're using the CSS3 language, and they work to give the website the exact properties of each browser it interacts with. In order to determine the size of the screen, type of device and orientation of the images, you'll need to effectively use these queries. When text or format looks awkward on different devices, this is referred to as a breakpoint on the layout itself. If your site has features to it that are difficult or awkward to read (like narrow columns or panels), then your media queries need to define where these breakpoints are so the queries themselves can adjust and fix as needed.

4. Simplifying the Process

Having excellent content is one of your best ways to be favored by search engine algorithms and your customers. The more unique content you have that connects with the reader, the more you're likely to be shared and favored. However, having too much content can make your site difficult to load. Creating content specifically for desktop viewers will only complicate your mobile presence. You can tag any component with a .not_mobile if you really want to keep the content on the site. However, it may be a smarter idea to just start paring down the content altogether so you can focus on that which can be loaded across all screens.

5. Menus and Buttons

We all know what it's like to find a website that makes things difficult to find. The actions are clear to whoever developed the platform, but that doesn't mean anything to the user. People are much more comfortable with obvious menus and buttons that leave little room for confusion. A horizontal menu that can be swiped gives the visitor a good indication of what the site has to offer, and reduces the amount of time spent trying to navigate it. Make your biggest draw the largest portion on your screen, and give people large (scaled) buttons to click upon to get more information. Make them specific, and don't try to confuse readers with arrows that point your readers toward advertisements.

6. Headers and Paragraphs

Responsive design needs to have headings and text that look balanced. Too large and it will break up the text so much that reading will be annoying, but too small and you risk the readers having to squint to make out the information. The newest mobile designs make it easier for you to see due to better resolutions which actually should make it easier on you to pick the right sizing for your website. Typically, the optimal amount of characters in a single line will be between 60 to 75 characters. The eyes can follow certain layouts better, so aim for your text or photos to comprise about 500 to 700 pixels.

7. Optimizing the Content

It's one thing to fit the content onto a screen, it's another thing to actually consider yourself from a visitor standpoint. The more information you have up on your site, the more likely it is you can determine what customers are looking for and how easy it will be for them to find. Before you start finalizing your layout decisions, you need to figure out the most important information on the site and which people will want to access it at what times. You can't account for every given situation, but you can put yourself in the readers shoes as much as possible. For example, visitors on your mobile site may not solely be looking for the directions to your business. They may instead just want to know more about what you can do for them. Put the most important information at the top of the page regardless of how customers are accessing content. They used to call this putting the important parts above the fold, but this is really just saving people from having to scroll to find anything.

8. Content Blocks

Your mobile site is composed of content blocks, and unfortunately you'll have to sacrifice certain pieces to make the site easy to follow. You can change the order of things around, so the eye is drawn to different parts of the screen on a desktop rather than a small phone screen. While mobile viewers are looking at the top, desktop viewers are absorbing the site as a whole. If your images are more relevant than your text, then you can manipulate to show one over the other for smaller screens. For a desktop image, you can simply place one beside the other.

9. Foregoing Image Quality

Pictures can really draw a user into a site, and they can make them sit up and take notice about your offers. However, images take a while to load, and they can pose problems to the performance of the page itself. You need to be ready to take out whatever slows down your site, and you may want to think about compromising on the quality of the pictures you do have. If you have any type of animated content or moving designs, then that may just be too many scripts for the device to run. Even if you're a design company, you still need to be able to impress those who may not have the most advanced gadget. Your customers will be far more interested in seeing what you have to offer rather than getting annoyed a slowly loading page.

10. You Can't Win 'Em All

Unfortunately, there are far too many types of technology available for you to figure it all out without investing an often inappropriate amount of resources. Instead of cursing people for using out-of-date machinery, you have to remember that eventually it won't be a problem anymore. People will eventually upgrade and can then start enjoying the fruits of your labor. With the advancements of technology, you know nothing stays the same. The best you can do is try to take into account as much as you can, so you can bring as many customers onboard with the new features.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/acwen9buhitpo3yl', 'title': 'What are the best practices for responsive web design?', 'score': {'original': 0.75473333333333, 'ai': 0.24526666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'You already know you want a responsive web design, so your customers can easily engage and interact with not just your advanced technology but your specific company efforts as well.

Harshit Paul,5y,What is a responsive website?,"A responsive website is one where content gets rendered in a flexible yet intended manner on the basis of the devices & OS on which it gets summoned.

With the speed at which technology has improvised, the end users are having the flexibility of surfing the internet conveniently through mobile devices. Therefore, a responsive website is the need of the hour as it is important for a website to be optimized in such a manner that it gets rendered properly in various mobile devices. Even if you are creating a new website, instead of developing a separate one for mobile users it is ideal to create a responsive website that fits properly in all kinds of devices.

Some tips to keep in mind for a Responsive website -

* Use a Single Website - It is ideal to redesign your existing website using a dynamic layout that is rendered properly in both desktop and mobile devices. After all, a website with a uniform URL is easier and less expensive to maintain than having multiple.
* Make Sure the Site is Scalable - While designing, you have to keep in mind that the screen of a mobile is smaller than a desktop. The elements should be arranged in a way that the user does not face any problem while exploring the site.
* Size of Hyperlinks and Buttons - Keep large-sized buttons and do proper usability testing to make sure that all the hyperlinks and buttons are easily clickable on the mobile screen.
* Testing mobile friendliness - Google has developed a tool to test whether...

Harshit Paul,5y,Why is it important for every business to have a mobile friendly website design?,"Digital discovery is being more mobile-centric. The era of the ‘Heads down’ generation is upon us. Ever wondered how much time you spend on your smartphone? According to StatCounter, there has been a noticeable incline in mobile and tablet users. By April 2014, 30% of web traffic was incoming through mobile users and the percentage has been elevating ever since.

In today’s competitive world where digital discovery is being more mobile-centric, responsiveness comes as a requisite.

InVision quoted in one of their blogs:

”Responsive design is no longer a luxury, but a necessity.”

This is why a mobile-friendly website is important for all business!

By delivering a mobile-friendly website you are aiming for:

Exceeding search visibility
Enhancing your brand value
Enhancing User Experience as well as User Interface
Elevation in lead nurturing
On April 21, 2015, Google revolutionized SEO, by releasing a new mobile-friendly ranking algorithm. This algorithm gave preferences to mobile-optimized websites and came to know by many names such as Mobilegeddon, mobocalypse, mobilepocalyse. So if your website is not providing a quality mobile UX, then brace yourself for the fall in SERPs.
On November 04, 2016, Google Webmaster posted came out with the concept of Mobile-first Indexing. Here, they stated:
“Although our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps, our algorithms will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results.”.
Faster Download Speed - Mobile websites are specifically designed for mobile standards and optimal download speed, which means less waiting and more browsing.
Better Engagement - A mobile website helps a user to engage better with the product with various CTAs.
Easy Accessibility - As mentioned earlier, the number of mobile users is on the rise. This means chances of accessing your website on the phone is higher than that on a computer. But, if you do not create a mobile-friendly website, you will lose out on your users.
Integrating Social Media - Even the biggest of brands are paying more attention to social media. And since Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn, to name a few, are easily accessible through the phone. External links are more likely to be accessed over a phone. In addition, it affects your social media reputation as well. Imagine reading a negative review for not having a responsive website. Disappointing, isn’t it? These are major motivators for any brand to make a mobile-friendly website.

Isn’t that 37 storey tall building amazing or beautifully designed ?!

But you are wrong! This is an example of bad design even today!

This building, nicknamed the Walkie Talkie Skyscraper, in London is currently said to be the twelfth largest building in Greater London.

Are you surprised to hear that this building once melted the plastic trim of a Jaguar car located just opposite to the building?! The architect, Rafael Viñoly, failed to realise the danger of constructing a concave surface on the front of the building.

[Image credit: Daniel Lester/Mail Online
]

That’s how the building reflects the light when it falls on it! Interestingly, the light is so sharp that is concentrated on a very small surface area. One of the local journalists proved that reflected heat from the building is enough to fry an egg by doing it practically!

Spot temperature readings at street-level including up to 91 °C (196 °F) and 117 °C (243 °F) were observed during summer 2013[1]

[Photo credit: Leon Neal, AFP/Getty Images]

It was almost six times the ordinary temperature.

There were complaints received by the City of London Corporation regarding a wind tunnel effect around the building.

Back in 2015, this building won the Carbuncle Cup, awarded by Building Design magazine to the ugliest building built in the UK that year. Many criticised by stating it has Worst Disaster constructed skyscraper ever.

But the irony is, This building was sold for £1.3B to Lee Kum Kee Group based on Hong Kong food company.

Håkon Hapnes Strand,Updated 6y,"How difficult is it to build a website like Quora? Elementally speaking, what operational part or parts of the site are the most difficult and time consuming to design and implement?","It’s not especially difficult to build the “shell” of the Quora website. That is, it’s not difficult to build a website that displays content such as questions and answers.

I mean, it’s not super easy either. One mediocre programmer couldn’t do it alone. But with a team of experienced engineers, the implementation is relatively straightforward. A properly designed database structure in a relational database will go a long way in easing the development of the basic building blocks of the site.

However, building the back end that supports the entire Quora experience is actually very, very hard, for two reasons.

Quora needs to be massively scalable. The site has more than 100 million monthly users and is looking to expand further. At that scale, everything becomes incredibly difficult. Just consider the search bar’s instant search feature. That’s an engineering nightmare (or dream, depending on your inclinations) when your site is as large as Quora.
Quora has a world-class recommendation engine. The way Quora promotes personalized content through its various recommendation algorithms is state-of-the-art. The recommendations are excellent. Some people may say that they’re not, but they really are. Quora has a large team of some of the brightest data scientists and machine learning engineers in Silicon Valley working daily on making the user experience the best it can possibly be. Implementing Quora’s recommender system requires expert knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing.

1. Bootstrap

Twitter Bootstrap is used by almost 4% of the websites on the entire internet and among 25% of the top ranked websites. It is the perfect solution if you want to create responsive web pages and with the built-in grid system and lots of other UI components, it is the most reliable CSS3 framework that is worth using.

2. Foundation

Foundation is a mobile-first framework. Although its functionality is the same as Bootstrap, there are some minor differences. Used by 5% among the 10000 top ranked websites. It provides a base for creating a responsive website with more advanced components like a flex grid and typography.

3. UIKit

With a little planning and using less resource, users can create dynamic responsive websites using UIKit. This framework offers a lot of interactive components by using CSS3, Less.js and Sass that make web designing easier and fun-filled.

4. LESS (Leaner Style Sheets)

Alexis Sellier designed LESS, a dynamic language that can be compiled into CSS and rendered to a server as well as client side. It is popular among developers because it requires less line of codes and has a block formatting syntax just like CSS.

5. SCSS (Sassy CSS)

It is a superset of CSS3 which introduced lesser lines of codes and more usage of mixins. Applications developed using SCSS have reusable components which are faster to load and hence, popular among applications that involve Advanced JavaScript frameworks.

6. Toast

Another CSS3 frameworks ideal for creating responsive web pages. Just like Bootstrap, a 12-column responsive grid is used whereby efficient usage of box-sizing, borders, and paddings can be dynamically added to the grid.

7. Ingrid

This is a fluid CSS layout system that is lightweight that comes with the objective of reducing classes that are applied to individual components. This feature makes it more intrusive and fun to create responsive layouts.

8. Bulma

Built with Sass and integrating flex, Bulma is an open source framework. Also, the user base is small, it is easier to use it, especially for the fact that applications developed by the framework are cross-browser compatible [ https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=Quora&utm_medium=Ans&utm_campaign=HP-131118-3&utm_term=Harshit ].

9. Semantic UI

This framework is developed with the objective of providing developers with a shared resource. Apart from providing a CSS library, it also provides modularized components that can be customized according to the developer’s choice before implementing in their project.

10. Mini.css

Mini.css is more like a micro framework. It involves compressing a very large CSS file into a file as small as 7kb. In the advanced age of interconnected devices, the requirement of a light and fast website with rich UI elements is higher. This is where mini.css comes into play.

11. Material

Material is a combination of Google’s Material Design along with Bootstrap. Using it, developers can create responsive ...

If combination of author’s name and title comes out to this(Brown Kids are Weird) maybe you should change the format a little bit. To this I only want to say “No we are not”.

A London skyscraper 20 Fenchurch Street also known as Walkie Talkie because of its shape acts as a concave mirror and focuses light onto the streets to the south. It has been nicknamed as the 'Walkie Scorchie' and ""Fryscraper"" by those who work nearby and the media.

Spot temperature readings at street-level including up to 91 °C (196 °F) and 117 °C (243 °F) were observed during summer 2013.

This immense heat has caused many problems in the past.

The seat of a bicycle parked near the building was damaged by the blinding rays.

The damage caused to a black Jaguar XJ parked in Eastcheap.

The barber’s shop's carpet has a burn mark on it. It was reported that the carpet was set alight from sunlight reflected by the building.

Someone tried to get something good out of the situation.

An egg is fried in intense sunlight reflected from the building.

In May 2014, it was announced that a permanent awning would be installed on the south side of the higher floors of the tower to stop more damage being done.

In July 2015 it was reported that the building has had an unexpected impact on wind strength at street-level. The City of London Corporation received an increased number of complaints about draughts around 20 Fenchurch Street following its completion. The Corporation's head of design, Gwyn Richards, said: ""The wind outcome at the street level experienced post-construction on a number of projects differs somewhat to the conditions we were expecting from the one outlined in the planning application wind assessments"".

The building won 2015 Carbuncle Cup by Building Design (BD) magazine for the worst building of the year.

TC,Updated 5y,What are some examples of bad design?,"This idea right here

Back in 2016, McDonalds let customers in New Zealand create their own burger online as a way to celebrate the restaurant’s new in-store touch screen. After one created their burger they could vote for it in an online contest. The idea went well at first with thoughtful creations such as this…

But eventually things went downhill. Way downhill, with creations like this…

And this…

Talk about food porn!

After all this McDonalds finally decided to pull the plug and get rid of the not so brilliant idea. But it goes to show that you should never ask the internet to help promote your company.

As part of a contract in which I'm helping to redesign a company's website, I researched the effectiveness of carousels and found a plethora of research showing carousels (1) result in visitors missing the site's messages and (2) make sites harder to use. Below, I've detailed the specific findings that back these claims up and included sources for the related research/studies.

(1) Visitors miss your messages:




* Research shows that users miss messages in moving carousels — not only the hidden 2nd, 3rd, 4th messages, but also very first message.In this study, a user missed the main message (which was in huge font in the center of the homepage) because it was in a moving carousel. [source [ http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/ ]]
* “Banner Blindness” - users can ignore messages in carousels because they can look like an ad when highly styled or moving. [source [ http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/ ]] [source 2 [ http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/ ]]
* Studies show that users don't click on carousels. In this study, around 1% of homepage visitors clicked on the carousel at all; of those who did click, 89% clicked the first image, meaning that they missed seeing the following images. [source [ http://weedygarden.net/2013/07/carousel-interaction-stats/ ]]
* With one message highlighted at a time, relevant content can be hidden under a stack of carousel images and users may never see them. For example, if you have 4 carousel slides targeting the 4 customer segments, the homepage will alienate a large portion of users when they first land on the site. If...

Tyler Chen,5y,What are some examples of bad design?,"This is the MD-80:

Personally, one of my favorite airplanes. Around 1200 of these were built until 1999, and it is considered one of the safest aircraft in the sky. Sadly, however, airlines are quickly retiring these jets citing the more efficient 737, but I digress.

This is the cockpit of the MD-80:

And on the dashboard of the cockpit panel, you see this:

Two mirrors are placed on top of the dashboard.

Why? Well it almost seems like that when McDonnell Douglas was creating and designing this plane, and more specifically the cockpit, they forgot one very important thing to add. the Compass. So instead of putting the compass in somewhere visually accessible, like on top of this dashboard or on the actual cockpit panel as well with all the other instruments, McDonnell Douglas decided to put the compass behind the copilot’s seat, and put these two mirrors on the dashboard, one for the pilot and the other for the copilot, for the pilot and copilot to angle to catch the reflection of the compass.

Here’s a closer up picture of the compass:

And the mirror directly reflecting to make the compass visible to the pilot:

Clever way of resolving this issue, but still bad cockpit design.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dz6lhy0o1s7u5rbn', 'title': 'What are some examples of bad design?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This is the MD-80:\n\nPersonally, one of my favorite airplanes.

(Taken from Google Images; not my original work)

This is what it looks like now :

So if you were making an item whose main function was to contain items that are, or have very recently been on fire, what would you choose?

Plastic?!

Surely they tested these things first…

What I also suspect is some people have continued to use it since it caught fire and melted away… Pretty bold…

And notice a used tissue that someone has recently discarded, to add extra fuel - you know, in case it might catch alight again…

Chris Nash,1y,Does a developer own the code?,"It depends.

On your own personal projects? School projects? Absolutely. In fact, it’s a law. As soon as you write something, you own the copyright.

The company pays you and in return, you provide programming solutions and give ownership of the code you created to them. This includes copyright and other things like liability.

This can be overridden by specific contracts, of course. But in most cases, the employer or other entity you write code for owns the code you write for hire.

Jesus Path,Updated 2y,What are some screenshots that deserve 75k+ upvotes?,"Born the 3rd of September 2021. Mila’s body isn’t getting the oxygenated blood it needs, the heart functions are all missed up, and blood flow in the wrong directions.

They also found a hole in her heart, something probably painful and hard for a newborn physically and the parents mentally.

Her first week of life has been lots of poking, blood drawing, and test after test, a painful sight for the couple.

She had surgery, and her recovery time will be 3-4 weeks, with lots more testing and surveillance, meaning more expense, until she can come home for the first time.

Sickness and diseases are ways that God use to test how we react. To see If we will save each other. To see if we are worthy to be called people of God.

We are Christians! and we made it, to where we are now by supporting each other Our lord sacrificed himself for us, this is how Christianity became the biggest community.

The parents need the support of the true Jesus army that can make any miracle into reality, to get over their crisis, and so Mila can restart her journey in this life.

No matter how rich we become or how much money we spend we can’t maintain that fake happiness.

Only true happiness and love can be given by God. As our Lord said:

“But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.” (1 John 3:17-18)

And

“Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also”. (Luke 12:33-34)

Bad design: Bike's rear mud guard.

Sadly, our much beloved Amazon (which is by the way, famous for its fabulous customer support) takes a place here.

So, this is the brand selection menu in Amazon. Okay, so it has got checkboxes to select multiple brands. But, I want to select more, so I click on ""+See More""

Now, this is what I get:

I get the whole list of brands. But wait. No checkboxes! So, I select the brand I want. Then it goes to products list and to select multiple brands I've to again click on ""+See more"" and repeat the whole stuff again and again.

Com'on Amazon, we people aren't 'for' loops to do the same steps again and again!

Hey, but there's more! This is not constant throughout the site!

We also get this 'much favored' checkbox brand selection menu. But, there's one more annoying thing! When you select a particular brand, the whole page loads again every time!

Aarjith Nandakumar,Updated 8y,What are some examples of bad design?,"Quora has fair share of bad designs.

Lack of button to go to feed. (Android App)

You are reading an answer. You reached bottom of the page. You saw an interesting question in related questions. Say this repeats like for 5-6 questions, until you feel to go back to the feed. How would you do that? Press the back button 5-6 times. Yeah.

The write answer toolbar (Android App)

The 3 dot button is quite ubiquitous in Quora, for a menu. It works in mobile app as well as a menu, but not here. Any guesses what it does?

It inserts a horizontal line. Dotted button which looks like menu for horizontal line. Strange thing here is there is no horizontal line button in desktop editor. Oh and H is for heading, I guess.

100+ ANSWERS (Android App, Desktop)

Quora is not designed to handle questions with lot of answers. I'm not even sure why it shows 100+ answers. It does this in desktop as well, so it seems to be a thing. How do you see actual number of answers? Do a search for the question. Or get into answer of a user.

So it's 1320 answers. Technically you could say that as 100+.

Quora is not designed to handle questions with lot of answers part two - There is no option to filter or sort answers. I wanted to check if a recent incident in news has been posted, like 2 days back, so rather than having a filter or sorting by most recent, I would need to go through 1320 answers (if the app/browser didn't die already).

More from anonymous? (Desktop)

If you are viewing an answer, it shows some panels at the bottom with users other answers. For anonymous users? It shows a huge blank space. Well it's more of a bug maybe, rather than a bad design?

I love Quora as a platform, but these are somethings which take away the immersive experience.

Hope Rogers,Updated 2y,What does it take to build a website like Coursera? And what should l learn for it?,"Depending on many features you wish to implement the factors affecting the choice of building a website like Coursera are

· Size of the target market

· Service location

· Basic and advanced features to be implemented

· Number of courses

· Monetization model

Depending on the above-mentioned features you would need to decide the best suitable method of development as there are various ways through which an e-learning platform can be developed.

You can check out the detailed guide to custom e-learning websites and app development like Coursera at webcluesinfotech.com/create-an-elearning-app-like-coursera

1. Using CMS

One of the simple and easy methods to develop a small-sized e-learning platform is through using a CMS like WordPress or Joomla. To achieve a better platform a CMS can be used with plugins for LMS. With the help of useful plugins, it is easy to develop an e-learning platform as you just need to customize the text as per your requirements.

An e-learning platform developed with the use of CMS requires a little technical knowledge of development. But be sure that the requirement is quite small as it is not advisable to use a CMS for large use platforms.

2. Using Clone Script

Clone script is a readymade e-learning solution containing built-in features of existing successful e-learning platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Khan Academy, edx, etc.

One thing to keep in mind before using a clone script for development is that a clone script is made of codes whose quality is not up to the mark to the platform whose clone it is. Clone script is mostly used to launch the platform in just a few days to test the market depth and success probability of such apps.

3. Customized solution

To develop a customized e-learning platform is not a one man’s job as you would require a team of experienced developers. To get a step-by-step insight on the complete customized e-learning solution development, check out the article mentioned at the top.

Franklin Veaux,1y,"What does ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"" mean, and why is it used as text in web development?","Contrary to popular belief, it does actually mean something.

The most commonly used lorem ipsum text reads:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

It’s placeholder text that’s been used as filler text for a very long time, because it looks like real text (so it will give you a sense of what a finished design looks like) but it doesn’t mean anything.

But where does it come from?

It’s not random. It’s actually a corruption of a piece of text written by the famous Roman author Cicero in the first century or so BC.

Cicero, the man himself.

It’s garbled and begins in the middle of a word. (The first word should be dolorem, not lorem.)

Here’s the original:

Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem, quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt, neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci[ng] velit, sed quia non numquam [do] eius modi tempora inci[di]dunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum[d] exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? [D]Quis autem vel eum i[r]ure reprehenderit, qui in ea voluptate velit esse, quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum, qui dolorem eum fugiat, quo voluptas nulla pariatur? At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus, qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti, quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint, obcaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa, qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

It starts mid-word and bits have been left out, but it definitely comes from genuine Latin text.

Translated, it reads:

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

In this, Cicero is dead wrong. There are people who love and pursue pain because it is pain. My girlfriend Maxine is one of them. :)

In a sense, lorem ipsum is the memetic equivalent of an inactive endogenous retrovirus, garbled and effectively inert but still reproduced in the context of a host language it has parasitized.

Fascinating how closely memes map onto genes sometimes.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lfh4kg1iq56myzpn', 'title': 'What does ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"" mean, and why is it used as text in web development?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Contrary to popular belief, it does actually mean something.\n\nThe most commonly used lorem ipsum text reads:\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Larry Johnson,1y,Can I become a Web developer without a degree?,"Yes, nowadays degree is not necessary to become a professional at anything. There are many free sources to learn, MOOC (Massive online open courses) are available, and online courses are available. Becoming a web developer without a degree is possible. You just need to know the right path to learn, then you can be a web developer too.

Skills to become a web developer:

Technical skills that should be known to become a web developer are, coding, responsive design, technical SEO, version control, and visual design.

The first step is to learn basic HTML and Java Script, after that you will have a little bit of knowledge of front-end development. After that learn some basic cascading sheet styles (CSS). After completing CSS move to the back-end development. Learn Nodejs programming language and learn Mongo DB and Express. These are the basics of becoming a web developer.

The free source, massive online open courses, and online courses have their own pros and cons. Let us see it.

FREE SOURCES:

Free online books, Youtube tutorials, Blogs, Reddit, and even Twitter teach you web development. In the above-said things, you can learn web development with enough motivation. They are a great source to learn it has everything you need to know about web development.

Free online books:
Open library
Pdfdrive

2. Youtube tutorials:

TheNewBoston.
Edureka.

There are certain drawbacks to choosing free sources. Some of them are outdated, you will not have any program outline, you need to complete the subject matters from various places, and you will not get any career guidance.

MOOC:

Massive online open courses are the hot talk of the internet when it comes to learning for free. These websites have their own courses launched in their own websites. They provide web development courses free of cost.

Here are some of them:

Free code camp:
Code Academy:
MIT Courseware:

There are drawbacks to the MOOC option too. Unlike free sources, MOOC offers a program outline to learn. MOOCs don’t provide any job assistance for the candidates, they won’t provide any certification, and you won’t get any real-world projects to do.

ONLINE COURSE PROVIDERS:

When it comes to the online course, the benefits of online course surpasses both MOOC and free sources. They provide you, with job assistance, career guidance, guaranteed interview calls, projects on hand, and industry exposure. So far, the best way to learn web development is to learn it from Online course providers. Going with the right online course provider you will reap more benefits.

Franklin Veaux,1y,Does minifying HTML and CSS codes increase web page speed?,"Yes, but…

Let’s take Bootstrap as an example. Bootstrap might reasonably be called a…err, rather heavyweight framework. It’s chonky.

Artist’s impression of Bootstrap

The ‘normal’ Bootstrap 4 CSS file is 187KB. The minified version is 147KB, for a savings of 21%.

Sounds nice, right? That should mean 21% faster load times, right?

Well, no, because (a) most of the page isn’t in the Bootstrap framework, it’s in the HTML and images and such, and (b) more importantly, the Bootstrap CSS file only downloads once, and is called up from the cache as you browse the site.

So it’ll increase the download speed of the Bootstrap CSS file, not the entire page, by 21%, the first time you look at a page on that site, and from then on, the time savings is exactly zero because the file is cached by your browser.

So yes, but really no, because the savings is quite marginal—in this case, 20kb of download saved one time on the first page view.

There are more effective ways to increase speed. The two biggest are to make sure you’re using a fast database server with an efficient database if you’re using a DB site, and optimize images, which typically are going to be much larger than the HTML/CSS size of the site. (For example, don’t use 3000-pixel-wide images that you display 400 pixels wide in your HTML, okay?)

You’ll also likely get a lot further by removing unused elements from your CSS and Javascript than by minifying them, if you really want to shave off file size.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6wixfgaqs3nyj8z0', 'title': 'Does minifying HTML and CSS codes increase web page speed?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes, but…\n\nLet’s take Bootstrap as an example.

Tim Mensch,4y,How important is placing comments on code for professional programmers?,"Judging by answers, there are a lot of very divergent opinions on this topic.

All the way from “comments are useless” to “I'll fire any developer who doesn't comment code.”

Both positions are very misguided in my judgment, at least at that level of detail.

Commenting APIs is critical. It's gross malpractice to suggest that people “read the code” to determine how to use an API. When I'm using an API, I want to be able to treat the code as a black box. The only reason I will open it is if it doesn't work.

And I'm really good at reading code. I'm not a beginner. I just don't want to waste my time digging though code when someone can say, in a few words, how something is intended to be used.

Your dislike of writing docs doesn't justify your lack of comments. It's a poor excuse, and really just reads as “I would rather be lazy than write and update a couple sentences for each entry point for my library.” Don't be that person.

Within the body of a function, however, documentation really should only exist when the code is surprising. Documenting every for loop, or every if statement, is a waste of time if you're just saying what the code is doing. Worse, overly verbose documentation will almost always get out of sync with the code. And keeping it in sync will be a waste of programmer time on both ends.

Don't explain what's obvious. If you have a line of code that increments a variable, only comment it if there's something unusual about it, like it's being done at exactly that location because that's where the count needs to increment. Or if you're doing something weird, then you could add a comment to explain why.

Otherwise, yes, the code itself should be self-explanatory.

Comments shouldn't exist to teach beginners what the code does. But they should be added at any point where someone with experience is likely to think that the code could be refactored in a manner that will actually, surprisingly, break it.

Comments should complement the code and document the API. That's all.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8u6nm5ek1p42tjbs', 'title': 'How important is placing comments on code for professional programmers?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Judging by answers, there are a lot of very divergent opinions on this topic.\n\nAll the way from “comments are useless” to “I'll fire any developer who doesn't comment code.”\n\nBoth positions are very misguided in my judgment, at least at that level of detail.\n\nCommenting APIs is critical.

Harshit Paul,5y,Which tool would allow me to test and debug my HTML and CSS online across multiple browsers?,"Great question!

Most of the developers often skip out on testing their web development thoroughly and it is not surprising considering the effort required in testing a web-application. However, testing is highly tool dependent process and with the right tool you can test and develop effortlessly!

Since you are using the term multiple browsers I believe you want to perform cross browser testing. At LambdaTest
, you can perform live-interactive testing on cloud across 2000+ browsers and their assorted versions running on real OS. You can also perform debugging with the inbuilt developer tools provided for Virtual Machines deployed according to user requirements.

The best part is you won’t have to a pay a penny! All you have to do is a free sign-up!

HTML Issues in Browsers

If you are willing to figure out the HTML issues, then the first and foremost thing to do is to check for the DOCTYPE. Have you used it?

And once you verify this, you need to make sure that you’re not using any of the third party code. Many times when you use a third party code, you might find that the HTML generated by the third party app may be using class ID or Name that you’re using for a different purpose in your code. Hence that might a big problem and becomes hard to debug as it will not show any error however you’ll find the difference in the rendering of HTML causing cross browser issues.

Many older versions of Internet Explorer browser do not support HTML elements like:

Video element
Audio element
Search input type
Form validation
Multiple file selection
Offline web applications

Unsupported CSS Elements in Browsers

Older versions of Internet Explorer, one of still the most used browsers don’t support many CSS elements some of which are:

CSS3 selectors
CSS Counters
CSS3 Box-sizing
CSS font-stretch
CSS namespaces
CSS3 Colors

Similarly, some older Google Chrome versions don’t support the following CSS elements:

CSS overscroll-behavior
CSS display: contents
CSS Paint API
CSSOM Scroll-behavior
CSS Scroll snap points
CSS Conical Gradients
CSS font-size-adjust

Hope this would be useful.

Harshit Paul,5y,What are the new trends in web design for 2018?,"We are heading towards the end of 2018. But the question still holds relevance with respect to the speed at which the software industry is evolving. We are witnessing revolutionary changes every year! Bringing in a lot of technologies to dwell upon.
In my opinion, I find the below web design and trends to be emerging at a rapid pace & continuously evolving in 2018 in the software industry:

PWA - Progressive Web Apps
 - Ahh! The primary reason overshadowing the popularity of Native applications in recent years. PWA application provides a UI and UX similar to a native application but you don’t have to download or install them into your device storage. They are fully accessible on the internet by typing respective URL in the browser.
Motion UI - A technology that spread in the web design industry like wildfire due to its simplistic deployment and flexible customization. Drawing motion UI has been very helpful in drawing an end user attention to the content on your website.
Responsive Web Design(RWD)
 - A method of allowing your web pages to render through multiple devices or screen sizes without compromising the overall functionality. Devices could be a tablet, desktop, notebook or a smartphone. There are tools
 available to help you with an effective way of testing responsiveness of any website through various screen sizes.
Chatbots - You must have noticed a chat window on modern websites. This chatbot serves the purpose of helping your website visitors with any question through instant messaging. But it still poses a challenge for many websites, as having someone available to answer those questions in real time is not feasible for many businesses.
Microinteractions - The present age demands for user engagement and micro-interactions are the trendy web design element to aid you with it. If you notice a website changing when you mouse over a particular spot, or an animation that’s triggered by scrolling down. That right there is a micro-interaction.
Hamburger Menus - Provides a clean design with fewer elements on each page but also keeping the essential navigation items needed by website visitors. Hamburger menus also remove the list of pages in your main menu from all the pages of your website and put them behind the hamburger icon.
Webviews 
- Meant to ease the 3rd party application promotion through an in-app browser. Now you don’t get pushed onto another 3rd party application, rather an in-app browser pulls the content from the web for you. With the convenience of staying in the intended application. Take Instagram for an instance, where you need to swipe up in some stories and you are redirected to a webpage through an in-app browser, rather than opening the content in chrome, safari, firefox or any other browser. You can navigate the content freely on the redirected webpage by scrolling up/down, zooming in/out or searching for a text.
VR/ AR - Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality - We all heard the buzz of pokemon game where people were out on streets for real to catch a pokemon.
Voice Assistance - With Google voice assistant, Mac’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa the voice assistance is up in the buzz of research topics.
AI and Machine Learning - The main principle on which Voice assistance revolves around. It is not just the voice but there are many areas where the scope of AI and Machine learning is still being evaluated and implemented. If you are new to the concept of machine learning then the below video will be very helpful in providing you with information on an abstract level.
User Behaviour Tracking - With modern web browsers providing more and more features to attract users towards them. Their behaviour tracking is very important to drive better conversions to any web product.

Dana Jandhyala,6y,What are the best examples of a really good design?,"This!

A library that opened up in China recently.

Here are some fun facts about this uniquely designed architectural marvel:

It has been given the shape of an eye, both outside as well as inside.
Look from outside, and it would seem like an eye is staring at you through the building’s glazed facade.
Get inside and it will feel like you are literally walking inside an eyeball; exactly the reason why the atrium of the building has a giant spherical structure in the center, you guessed it, like a pupil.
The five-story building has a row-like design from floor to ceiling to look like a continuous book shelf, where books exists till the 2nd floor only. Rest of the rows have image of books printed on them; maybe to ensure visitors have their attention glued to the books instead of marveling the design of this magnificent architecture. Subtle!
The continuous bookshelf design was initially planned to make every row accessible - floor-to-ceiling. Not kidding! The plan was dropped to fast-track construction.

For a world that was presumably moving to ebooks and online reading, this library redefines book reading.

Deepak Harish,Updated 5y,What are some of the best designed websites online?,"IRCTC- Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation

Yes!!! You heard me right. The website has been redesigned. Which makes it more easy to use and user-friendly.

First the landing page: Previously it was full with the ad but now it looks more elegant and fluid with no distractions.

The old website with full of ads and useless mess

New website which is more fluid With materialistic design.

So, there is no need to Login every time to see trains list. One has to simple enter the basic yet important details like from, to, date of journey.

Also after login, the trains list and home screen is also very pleasant to see even in the hurry of booking. The contents and other necessary options such as booked history and other options are neatly organised in a drop down menu.

The displaying of details of the trains is also bold and big so, that an ordinary elder person can also view them easily with out straining their eyes.

At last it is great to see the Irctc website a redesigned and it is really the best thing the railways has done.

Hope India is changing.

Also the Caption of Indian Railways: Safety | Security | Punctuality

Comes true ;p

Edit:

The background picture changes every time you login :) Really Impressed with it.

(Compare yesterday’s Image and today’s Image)

Few More:

It looks refreshing every time when I visit this page. Instead of boring and cumbersome ADs.

Zach,Updated 6y,What are some examples of bad design?,"I would like to show you… manufacturer’s secret weapon- clamshell packages!

When it takes you longer to actually get the cube out of the packaging than to learn how to solve one of these things, there’s a problem. Why they make these so hard to open I'll never know.

Scissors don't really cut through it. I guess you're supposed to use a knife, provided you don't cut yourself.

My aunt almost cut her finger off trying to open one of these things with a knife. I like her with 5 fingers on each hand, and it definitely makes life easier to have all of your fingers.

So that leaves one option… a chainsaw, and hoping at the same time I don’t cut any body parts off in the process. I like myself in its full state. I don’t like severed pieces of myself, and if we could avoid that then that would be great.

Even this is better because you can just rip it from the cardboard, no scissors required.

But when the entire thing is covered in this hard plastic, I have no clue how you get it off.

These companies are basically begging us to sue them. They’re trying to either kill us or cut off pieces of our limbs. It’s also difficult to solve a Rubik’s cube with one hand. I can’t do it, and I would prefer to not be forced to do it.

Justin Franco,Updated 5y,What are some examples of bad design?,"This corner in my kitchen is just full of fail.

My house was built in the late 1980s, when builders were sandwiching as many cabinets and drawers as possible into kitchens and bragging about all the “storage space.” The resulting push for places to store crap led to this example of idiocy.

If it’s not already apparent, the design flaw becomes painfully obvious when you open the drawer here:

The drawers are so perfectly (or rather, imperfectly) built that the edge of one drawer grazes the knob of the other just enough that you have to jiggle it out of the way or risk further scuffing the edge.

What’s worse is that this is no extraneous drawer. Oh, no. It’s not like we could designate this some sort of “junk drawer” and fill it with batteries and Chinese take-out menus. This drawer is prime storage real estate—nestled between the stove top and the sink. We need these drawers for vital cooking utensils!

To make the situation even more annoying, there is a floor vent in that same corner. Again, this is primo kitchen space with lots of foot traffic. We’re talking cutting boards, paper towel holder, knife block—the works. It’s not uncommon for someone to stand in this precise location to peel potatoes, slice them up, and fry them all without leaving this spot. Having to straddle a floor vent adds a laughably unnecessary obstacle to the process, and you can see where we’ve bent and broken it already. And if you’re standing there in anything loose when the air kicks on, you’re in for a Marilyn Monroe moment.

All I wanted was some French fries!

This corner isn’t just awful design; it’s an accident waiting to happen.

I can see it now: one day, a spatula emergency arises and, darting over to this corner, I accidentally plant my foot incorrectly, snapping the cheap plastic floor vent and spraining my ankle. As my body folds back on itself, I yank the fail-drawer open and catch the edge of one drawer on the knob of the other, the force of which flings tongs and wooden spoons out onto my crumpled form on the stone tile.

Then the air kicks on and my skirt flies up.

This is a very real fear for me.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/21md93ui6vjrk85h', 'title': 'What are some examples of bad design?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This corner in my kitchen is just full of fail.\n\nMy house was built in the late 1980s, when builders were sandwiching as many cabinets and drawers as possible into kitchens and bragging about all the “storage space.” The resulting push for places to store crap led to this example of idiocy.\n\nIf it’s not already apparent, the design flaw becomes painfully obvious when you open the drawer here:\n\nThe drawers are so perfectly (or rather, imperfectly) built that the edge of one drawer grazes the knob of the other just enough that you have to jiggle it out of the way or risk further scuffing the edge.\n\nWhat’s worse is that this is no extraneous drawer.

Shubham Saxena,5y,What are some latest web design trends?,"A good design can make or break your web business. It’s the face of your company and its important that it keeps up with the trends.

In this world of innovation, people love trendy things, be it food, fashion, or web design. While developing a web page, every developer puts his heart and soul into it. To get the best results out of that effort, all you would have to do is to just do a little research and incorporate latest design trends in your design to make it appear fresh.

So we did a little bit of digging into this and here we have compiled a list of latest design trends in website design that must be kept in mind in 2018 while deciding the look and feel of your web page.

Geometrical figures and shapes: This is something that we studied in middle school and it hasn’t left following us yet. When it comes to design, people love implementing these to make the designs more simple and impressive. There are hundreds of Geometrical shapes available over the internet. Choose. Grab. Apply. They still includes flat designs and 2D design which can make your website more catchy and appealing.
Graphical Design Patterns: Graphic Designers always think how to make the most out of the images so as to make the web pages more attractive and impressive. Normal Photoshop designers edit the images with the slight modification from the available templates which can make a bad impression on the user. With the help of Graphic designing you can create perfect Line-Arts which can help in grabbing more attention to your web page. You may have seen Line-arts on some websites like Medium. When we use Line-Art icons in a web page they improve the user’s visual experience.
Make your Design Mobile Friendly: According to Google, more than 50 % search queries are performed from the mobile http://devices.So
 developers tighten up your seat belts and get ready to move to the new era of Technology. Also you would be surprised to know that Google has mentioned Mobile First Indexing on the top of his priority list. So I would suggest to all the web developers out there, to make your website more Mobile Friendly. You can ensure mobile friendly behaviour of your website with LambdaTest’s emulators and simulators.
SVG/Cinemagraphs: In the HD world, no one likes to see blurred images on the websites. So, it’s the time to make your images more clear and Use more & more visualization in your websites.to
 make your images more interesting, you should start using SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics).The benefit of using SVG images in your web pages is that your images’ pixels won’t get degraded when zoomed. Cinemagraphs are also a kind of image which create an illusion to the user as they are watching an animation or video. Cinemagraphs improves the visual performance and are used in most of websites now a days. The best thing about Cinemagraphs is that they are available in all formats like HD/SD/4K etc.
Variegated Typography: Variegated means using different colors. Typography is also an important part. It might seem like they are not considered as that important but designers should be very careful & cautious while choosing the right font size and typeface. It should be considered crucial to the website design. The exact Typography will help in expressing the message that you want to convey or show. Your font size should be big enough as it better utilizes the white spaces and also it’s very catchy to the eyes. Talking about the typeface, you should not use the regular fonts as they are limited and show repetition.Go and use some customization in your font size.
NLP & Machine Learning: It’s getting very trendy these days to use voice Search in your Future home of website.ai
 & ML are working mainstream together like they are used in some apps for Voice search like Siri. It’s going to change the way we look at websites in 2018 & in many years to come.
Grid Formation & Layouts: Developers are always trying to find some ways which can make their work easier. Grid Layout is a similar kind of approach which helps in placing multiple elements on the page as there are multiple columns in the grid layout. A responsive Grid view layout has often 12 columns which adjusts according to the browser.
Scrolling Effects: One thing that refuses to go out of reach from the trends is the Parallax Effect. This effect makes your scrolling effect as of it is on 3D when you move your page up/down.One thing that should be avoided is Long Scrolling. Scrolling tells you how much interactive your content is. It adjusts your pace.
Micro-Interactions: Well, now let’s talk about how you express your feelings via Emojis. Without actually texting someone, you can explain what you are trying to say or express.You might have observed like when you long press the “Like” button on FB then it shows some Emojis waving around on your screen. It feels good to see some of the emoticons on your screen. These micro-interactions are now getting popular and became a trend in websites.
ChatBots: People now are looking to make their chatting and support process over the internet, more interactive and intelligent. For that web developers are using highly personalized and intelligent Chatbots that would respond to your request of service over the website. Next time when you hear a pleasant voice in a website, That’s a Chatbot. You may think that you are chatting with the real guy but you are not. But advantage of using Chatbots is that they make your website more responsive and interactive and also they return results faster comparatively.

To get the best results out of that effort, all you would have to do is to just do a little research and incorporate latest design trends in your design to make it appear fresh.\n\nSo we did a little bit of digging into this and here we have compiled a list of latest design trends in website design that must be kept in mind in 2018 while deciding the look and feel of your web page.\n\nGeometrical figures and shapes: This is something that we studied in middle school and it hasn’t left following us yet. When it comes to design, people love implementing these to make the designs more simple and impressive. There are hundreds of Geometrical shapes available over the internet. Choose. Grab. Apply. They still includes flat designs and 2D design which can make your website more catchy and appealing.\nGraphical Design Patterns: Graphic Designers always think how to make the most out of the images so as to make the web pages more attractive and impressive. Normal Photoshop designers edit the images with the slight modification from the available templates which can make a bad impression on the user. With the help of Graphic designing you can create perfect Line-Arts which can help in grabbing more attention to your web page. You may have seen Line-arts on some websites like Medium. When we use Line-Art icons in a web page they improve the user’s visual experience.\nMake your Design Mobile Friendly: According to Google, more than 50 % search queries are performed from the mobile http://devices.So\n developers tighten up your seat belts and get ready to move to the new era of Technology. Also you would be surprised to know that Google has mentioned Mobile First Indexing on the top of his priority list. So I would suggest to all the web developers out there, to make your website more Mobile Friendly. You can ensure mobile friendly behaviour of your website with LambdaTest’s emulators and simulators.\nSVG/Cinemagraphs: In the HD world, no one likes to see blurred images on the websites. So, it’s the time to make your images more clear and Use more & more visualization in your websites.to\n make your images more interesting, you should start using SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics).The benefit of using SVG images in your web pages is that your images’ pixels won’t get degraded when zoomed. Cinemagraphs are also a kind of image which create an illusion to the user as they are watching an animation or video. Cinemagraphs improves the visual performance and are used in most of websites now a days. The best thing about Cinemagraphs is that they are available in all formats like HD/SD/4K etc.\nVariegated Typography: Variegated means using different colors. Typography is also an important part. It might seem like they are not considered as that important but designers should be very careful & cautious while choosing the right font size and typeface. It should be considered crucial to the website design. The exact Typography will help in expressing the message that you want to convey or show. Your font size should be big enough as it better utilizes the white spaces and also it’s very catchy to the eyes. Talking about the typeface, you should not use the regular fonts as they are limited and show repetition.Go and use some customization in your font size.\nNLP & Machine Learning: It’s getting very trendy these days to use voice Search in your Future home of website.ai\n & ML are working mainstream together like they are used in some apps for Voice search like Siri. It’s going to change the way we look at websites in 2018 & in many years to come.\nGrid Formation & Layouts: Developers are always trying to find some ways which can make their work easier. Grid Layout is a similar kind of approach which helps in placing multiple elements on the page as there are multiple columns in the grid layout. A responsive Grid view layout has often 12 columns which adjusts according to the browser.\nScrolling Effects: One thing that refuses to go out of reach from the trends is the Parallax Effect. This effect makes your scrolling effect as of it is on 3D when you move your page up/down.One thing that should be avoided is Long Scrolling. Scrolling tells you how much interactive your content is. It adjusts your pace.\nMicro-Interactions: Well, now let’s talk about how you express your feelings via Emojis. Without actually texting someone, you can explain what you are trying to say or express.You might have observed like when you long press the “Like” button on FB then it shows some Emojis waving around on your screen. It feels good to see some of the emoticons on your screen. These micro-interactions are now getting popular and became a trend in websites.\nChatBots: People now are looking to make their chatting and support process over the internet, more interactive and intelligent. For that web developers are using highly personalized and intelligent Chatbots that would respond to your request of service over the website. Next time when you hear a pleasant voice in a website, That’s a Chatbot. You may think that you are chatting with the real guy but you are not. But advantage of using Chatbots is that they make your website more responsive and interactive and also they return results faster comparatively.\n\nFor reference check out these 50 Awesome Websites with Extraordinary Geometry Elements\n by awwwards\n.For reference check out these 50 Awesome Websites with Extraordinary Geometry Elements\n by awwwards\n.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9966

Amanda Kevin,03-Feb,How much would it cost to build a website like AirBnB or Reddit?,"Building a website like Airbnb or Reddit is a complex undertaking that involves a significant amount of time, expertise, and resources.

It's not something that can be done on the cheap, and anyone who tells you otherwise is likely trying to sell you something.

To start, both Airbnb and Reddit have massive scale and offer a wide range of features, from user authentication and payment processing to content management and data analytics.

Developing a website with similar capabilities would require a team of experienced developers, designers, and product managers, all of whom command competitive salaries.

Additionally, both Airbnb and Reddit have spent years refining their platforms and addressing the myriad challenges that come with operating at scale.

This includes everything from handling legal and regulatory issues to managing user-generated content and ensuring data security.

So, how much would it cost to build a website like Airbnb or Reddit?

Ritvik Chaturvedi,Updated 5y,What are the best examples of a really good design?,"The ‘swan neck flask’ is a fabulous example…

…when compared to the standard round-bottom flask:

For over two thousand years, scientists believed in the spontaneous generation of life. The ‘spontaneitists’ believed that life suddenly sprang from abiotic matter. If spores were left unattended, fleas and germs would spontaneously rise from them. That meant, a flask filled with sugar solution would suddenly spring with life and turn milky as long as it came in contact with oxygen (shown in the photo below). When they looked at this cloudy solution under the microscope, they saw microorganisms floating in it and they claimed that life had spontaneously generated.

The young French scientist Louis Pasteur was not convinced. He believed that the ‘life’ they saw in the flask actually came from microbes in the atmosphere. The flask went cloudy when those microbes settled in the sugar solution and multiplied there. In order to prove the ‘spontaneitists’ were wrong, he came up with a simple design, that of the swan neck flask pictured above.

The swan neck flask allows the sterile broth to come in contact with oxygen, but prevents the dust particles from coming in contact with the sterile, abiotic sugar solution. If the solution turns cloudy, then it means that life, quite literally, springs out of thin air. But if it does not, it means the ‘new life’ we see comes from microbes. And as we can see in the picture below, the swan-neck flask remains clear.

It looks like a simple design, but it proved instrumental for modern healthcare and science as it taught the world the important of keeping hospitals sterile and led to the development of antiseptics.

Alisha Talks,4y,What are some examples of bad design?,"The tilt in the Leaning Tower of Pisa is due to poor engineering and construction.

The tower was built upon unstable soil consisting of clay, sand and shells. The soil, which was only 3 meters thick, was too unstable to support such a heavy tower.

Once the construction of the third level began, the tower began to lean, resulting in the building sinking by at least a yard.

It is estimated that the building is moving at a rate of 0.05 inches per year.[1]

Harshit Paul,5y,What are some UX tips and tricks to create high-performing landing pages?,"With the amount of competition available in the market, you need to have a website as attractive as possible for staying a cut above with comparison to your competitors.
Here is an informative insight for designing a successful landing page.

Source:- Top 17 UI Design Mistakes That Leads to Failure of Your Website

→ Subtle Sale Is An Art form – One That Is Difficult To Master

Persuasive design is the latest trend in the UX world, which intrigues the end user in thinking what is next and compels him to navigate further in the website. We will give you an important UI design tip. Never overuse this strategy. If the end user gets annoyed, they will not think twice before moving on to a different site.

→ Color Scheme Makes All The Difference

While planning the design of your website, use a proper color code for fonts, headings as well as backgrounds. Study the color theory properly to find out which color looks good on which background. UI design tips provided by experts state that a well-coordinated color planning will work better in attracting a client rather than using animations. Here is one of the examples of a great color choice. You can refer to source for more trendy web color palettes.

→ Non Responsive Web Design

Today, all organizations are following the mobile first approach. It is ideal that you must think alike your competitors and develop a website that adheres to the best UI practices related to responsive design, works properly on all devices without any horizontal scrolling and has passed all cross-browser testing strategies for mobile as well as desktop browsers.

→ Website not being cross-browser compatible

Today, with so many browsers available on the internet, with their usage share varying across different demographics and devices, we shall give you one of the best UI design tips before you release your website. Perform proper cross-browser testing and make sure that your website runs properly on all the targeted browsers. Here is an example of a div that looks different in every browser
.

The above image is a demonstration of the unique div on LambdaTest platform. You can notice how the appearance is differing from Google Chrome to Mozilla Firefox. LambdaTest
 is a cross browser testing tool that allows you to test your website’s RWD(Responsive Web Design) among 2000+browsers and their assorted versions running on real operating systems.

→ Improper font-size

Keeping a consistent font-size and font-family is very important when you are following the best UI practices. Bold and big typographies are accepted, but it is improper if there is a 4:1 ratio between the font size of a heading and a paragraph.

→ Badly Designed CTAs

CTAs hold the power to command a user to take an action. From color to the font, everything about them should ask a user to “click”. CTAs that are too attention-grabbing compels a user to move away, while CTAs that are too simple, is simply ignored. Keep a balance of color, shadows and a nice font in your CTAs to make them noticeable and clickable.

→ Text, Typography, and Presentation

Nowadays, most website users do not go through the content entirely. If you want to express your idea in terms of content, you should keep a good balance of text content along with images and rich media elements like audio or video. Too much text content will only compel the user to ignore them and in that way, ignoring some important information that you are trying to convey.

→ Designing Mandatory and Lengthy Forms

Forms are an important part of your website, especially in one that requires the user to register. Having a lengthy form with lots of data will only complicate the user and he may miss some important information while filling it up, especially on mobile. One of the best UI design practices is to keep a simple form that is easier to fill up and has as little information as possible. Also, keep a note that you don’t put too many mandatory fields for a user. The more mandatory fields you keep, the higher bounce rate you will experience.

→ Content Is The King, Ads Aren’t!

Ads are a good way of generating revenue for your site. But using too many ads is not at all among the best UI practices. The users get annoyed when they find more ads than useful contents.

→ Complicated Navigation Confuses The User

One of the best UI practices for designing a unique user experience is to create a simplified navigation. This will help the user to navigate to the content which he requires without any complication. A complex navigation bar with too many links and buttons will not only confuse the user but will also make the layout clustered which our objective is to avoid.

→ Website Lacking Contrast

If the design has proper color contrasts, it makes the content readable and an ease to the eye of a user. If the design has a bad color contrast among the fonts, images, and background, the user will easily get frustrated and move to another site.

→ Using Reverse Psychology

Ask a user not to click on a button! Yes, you heard that right. Reverse psychology can be an effective way to persuade users in doing stuff they don’t want to.

→ Let Your CTAs Do The Work For You

Start the naming with a verb like Sign or Register or Download. This guides the user to perform the necessary action.

→ Catchy Hovering

Have a style for your buttons to display more information or attractive animation when the user hovers over them. You can even show additional information on popup or tooltip form to show the user what the CTA is intended for. This is particularly important when the action is complicated and you do not have enough words to name the CTA.

→ Use fewer Links and More CTAs

Replace important hyperlinks with CTAs, but remember not to overcrowd the page. The user should not feel like you are using only CTA’s to persuade the user to purchase your products.

→ Exit CTA Should Leave a Lasting Impression

Exit CTAs are often important, yet ignored. Displaying a CTA whenever a user is closing a webpage, that offers a discount or something exciting is an important CTA design tip to boost the conversion rate. Let’s take a look at the Exit CTA of Skullcandy.

Good luck,

Harshit Paul,5y,What are a few tips for designing a mobile-friendly website?,"The world is moving to mobile first digital discovery. It is why the web developers from big enterprises as well as small businesses, make a note of optimizing a website as mobile-friendly as possible. It is important for a website to be optimized in such a manner that it gets rendered properly in various mobile devices.

Tips for designing a mobile-friendly website
 -

Size of hyperlinks and buttons - If the size of links and buttons are kept small, it will become difficult for the user to click on them for navigation or other purposes. Keep large-sized buttons and do proper usability testing to make sure that all the hyperlinks and buttons are easily clickable on the mobile screen.
Use a single website - Even if you are creating a new website, instead of developing a separate one for mobile users it is ideal to create a responsive website that fits properly in all kinds of devices. This is cost effective as well.
Testing mobile friendliness - Google has developed a tool to test whether your website is mobile friendly or not. To check, you need to visit https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly
 and enter your site’s URL and hit the test button. The tool automatically checks whether your website satisfies all the guidelines required.
Media elements should be playable - Once your website is developed, test it on real devices to make sure that all the media elements are working properly.
Cross Browser Testing - You must ensure that all the features of your website work properly in those browsers and there are no breakage or rendering issues. Test your website runs seamlessly across all major browsers using cloud-based testing platforms.
Scalability is an important feature when it comes to a responsive website. While designing, you have to keep in mind that the screen of a mobile is smaller than a desktop. The elements should be arranged in a way that the user does not face any problem while exploring the site.
User Feedback - Concentrate on each and every feedback and no matter how minor the issue is, fix it immediately. Usability testing is a key factor behind a website’s success. So, always pay heed to the suggestions provided by end users.

Happy Designing,

Alex Cooper,4y,Which is the ugliest website you have ever visited?,"They say that art is subjective, and if that’s the case, then the Space Jam
 website is either the worst, or the best website in existence.

What it is without a doubt, though, is the most 90’s thing that ever graced the internet (and my heart).

Who am I kidding? It’s a bloody masterpiece; a time capsule of utter magnificence, for future earthlings to look back upon in wonderment. A place where UX went to die.

Let’s take a look at the homepage:

It was a simpler time. It was a better time. It was a Jammier time.

My interest is well and truly piqued. So many wondrous avenues to explore.

Jam Central sounds like the place to be—let’s check it out.

Oh my. That font colour was a bold choice. Not so much “user-friendly” as “user-homicidal-ragey”.

Hmm, yes, I think I’d like to check out the trailer.

Well, those are some bold claims. It better be “the jammiest two minutes of trailer time” or I want my money back.

Life isn’t fair.

Well that was a let down.

Let’s scoot on over to Planet B-Ball; sounds like a hip and happening place.

Well yes, of course I like basketball and I like to jam, ancient-website-that’s-also-a-mind-reader.

A slammin, jammin game? Well golly gosh, mister, why didn’t ya say so to start with?? That sounds just swell.

I think I’ll check out the player bios. The colour scheme is a real winner so far so I don’t see how they can possibly outdo themselves.

Ah. Now, I am colourblind, but I think this website made me even more colourblind, somehow.

I’m glad they told me that the actors played basketball, though. I thought Michael Jordan was best-known for obscure French arthouse movies.

I won’t include screenshots of all the pages. Suffice to say they’re all equally cancer-inducing.

There’s just too much fun to be had here. That’s the trouble with the Space Jam website—you come for a cheap laugh but you end up spending weeks in this maze of enchantment.

Do you want to send a Space Jam electronic postcard to someone you love? I know I do.

Click on the thumbnail of the card you want to send, and absolutely nothing will happen.

I’ve just got to find one thing. Something that made 5-year-old Alex’s pee-pee very confused in a way that next door’s pet rabbit had never managed.

Where the hell is that fiery temptress?

Looney Tunes bios? That must be the page, surely.

For f*ck’s sake.

I never forgot you, Lola, even if the website did.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/df2v98r14alc7jhb', 'title': 'Which is the ugliest website you have ever visited?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'They say that art is subjective, and if that’s the case, then the Space Jam\n website is either the worst, or the best website in existence.\n\nWhat it is without a doubt, though, is the most 90’s thing that ever graced the internet (and my heart).\n\nWho am I kidding?

I used GoDaddy for many years. I’ve never used them to buy a domain name, because they’re very very (very very very) expensive, and there’s no point wasting money.

I did use them for hosting until some years back. When GoDaddy got bought out in 2011, their customer service and reliability plummeted.

Today, GoDaddy is a distinctly third-tier Web hosting company. Their database services in particular are especially bad; they’re very slow, meaning if you’re using a database site like WordPress you’ll have poor performance.

On top of that, they got rid of most of their abuse team when they were bought out, so today they are overrun with spammers, malware, scams, and fraud.
