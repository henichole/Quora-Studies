Burkhard Paul,10mo,How is Naga broker?,"Well, I believe there could be a short answer to this, as well as a long answer, as to what kind of a platform NAGA broker is.

But, sure, let's take the high road and go with the long answer first.

In order to do that, I would say let's analyze what kind of benefits and perks you can get out from it as a customer.

And I don't mind using a random order here. So, let's start with the trading platforms.

NAGA offers multiple choices when it comes to the platform softwares you are eligible to use. And the choices consist of;

- MetaTrader 4

- MetaTrader 5

- NAGA Web App

- NAGA iOS App

- NAGA Android App

So, regardless of what sort of a device or operating system you have, NAGA has your back. That's one on the books.

If we have a look at what kind of financial securities you are eligible to have access to and trade on NAGA:

- More than 200 Stock Contracts-for-Difference (You don't own the actual asset, you just profit from price fluctuations)

- More than 350 Real Stocks (Not CFDs, you actually own the assets)

- 30 Cryptocurrencies

- More than 10 Stock Market Indices

- More than 15 Exchange Traded Funds

- 5 Commodities

- Almost 50 Foreign Exchange Pairs

- More than 15 Futures Contracts

Needless to say, that, thats more than enough even for some of the most hungry profit hunters out there.That's makes it two.

NAGA offers 6 VIP levels in terms of the accounts, which all have different and better perks, kickbacks and advantages than the previous one.

The list goes like Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Crystal.

What's more is that, your level is not limited to how much money you have to deposit. How good of a trader can also have an influence on your level of power at this platform.

Sure, depositing large amounts of money can get you the status you desire, but if you don't have those sums, and you are still a hell of a trader, worry no more. Your profits, along with your deposits can also get you your dream account with tons of perks and sophisticated advantages. But if you happen to have couple of unfortunate sessions and lose money, your status does not get affected by a downgrade. I'd say that's three.

So how do you become a good trader that makes those profits and gets those status upgrades? Well, NAGA thinks of your education too. The platform offers webinars, e-books, a whole encyclopedia, and tons of educational resources under an e-academy called the NAGA learn. You learn, you get better at trading. Knowledge is everything in this. That's four.

And the lucky number 5 is, the ultimate choice.

NAGA offers the ability to hit two birds with one stone. Under the umbrella of the same company, you can trade your own money, or you can let other people trade for you. Yes, I mean the copytrading. And the profits you can have goes up with your status too.

That was the long answer. If you still want the short answer: I'd say NAGA is a very good broker.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vfoxmj785de0l39h', 'title': 'How is Naga broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.316, 'ai': 0.684}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Well, I believe there could be a short answer to this, as well as a long answer, as to what kind of a platform NAGA broker is.\n\nBut, sure, let's take the high road and go with the long answer first.\n\nIn order to do that, I would say let's analyze what kind of benefits and perks you can get out from it as a customer.\n\nAnd I don't mind using a random order here.

Nick Fredko,10mo,How is Naga broker?,"This is quite an interesting question because NAGA broker has many peculiarities. I am afraid that can take much time, so I will try to briefly describe all features of the company. The broker provides trading on financial markets and related services. Let us start from the very beginning and then gradually go to the broker's overview.

First of all, NAGA provides a pack of trading software for clients. There are many functional platforms for any taste. These are the following:

1) Metatrader 4. I guess every trader is familiar with this platform. Some people call it ""the industry standard"". And there are reasons for that. Software is time-proven and has many features that are appreciated by users. It is a very effective tool for traders to operate on the financial markets. There is a mobile application for Android and iOS operational systems.

2) Metatrader 5. This is also a very popular trading platform from the same developers. It has many updates and additional features like different timeframes and other functions. Mobile application is also available. It is a nice solution for those traders who always trade on the go.

3) NAGA branded trading platform. This is a proprietary developed software of the company. The platform is browser-based, so it can be comfortable for traders who work from different spots. For example, you can trade from home and from work. The only thing you need is a standard computer and an internet browser. The platform is designed well and has a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation. This software also has a mobile application that is perfectly optimized, so there are no delays and pauses in trading.

As you can see, there are many technical solutions for clients to choose. The majority of traders like Metatrader 4, but other platforms also have nice features and are appreciated by the trading community. Some traders like browser-based software more and find them much more effective.

The next point is assets available to trade. There are many products to trade here:

1) Stocks. This is where you can trade stocks of the most popular companies like Tesla, Coca-Cola, AMD, Amazon, Boeing and many more.

2) Indices. Here you can trade the indicators of the economy of the whole country or economy sectors. Such indices like S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, Nikkei 225 and many others are available.

3) Futures. This market is very volatile, so you would better place your stop orders. Here you can trade futures on different assets like indices, coffee and many other assets.

4) Crypto. This market has been increasingly growing last few years. You can operate Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies.

5) ETFs. Here you can invest in the whole directions of the economy and business. For example, if you want to invest in real estate, so you don't need to search for the stocks of the related companies and simply buy a real estate ETF like iShares US real estate.

There are more assets that I haven't mentioned here, so I guess anybody can find some assets that will suit them. Products are classified by different types, so there is room for many strategies to create.

Another benefit of the company is the support service. The broker provides several methods of contact, such as e-mail, telephone calls and live chat. It is always friendly and will solve your problem as fast as possible.

There are many other services provided by the company, like the educational sector, official blog and even bank cards to make payments such as NAGA PAY

I am afraid that can take much time, so I will try to briefly describe all features of the company. The broker provides trading on financial markets and related services. Let us start from the very beginning and then gradually go to the broker\'s overview.\n\nFirst of all, NAGA provides a pack of trading software for clients. There are many functional platforms for any taste. These are the following:\n\n1) Metatrader 4. I guess every trader is familiar with this platform. Some people call it ""the industry standard"". And there are reasons for that. Software is time-proven and has many features that are appreciated by users. It is a very effective tool for traders to operate on the financial markets. There is a mobile application for Android and iOS operational systems.\n\n2) Metatrader 5. This is also a very popular trading platform from the same developers. It has many updates and additional features like different timeframes and other functions. Mobile application is also available. It is a nice solution for those traders who always trade on the go.\n\n3) NAGA branded trading platform. This is a proprietary developed software of the company. The platform is browser-based, so it can be comfortable for traders who work from different spots. For example, you can trade from home and from work. The only thing you need is a standard computer and an internet browser. The platform is designed well and has a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation. This software also has a mobile application that is perfectly optimized, so there are no delays and pauses in trading.\n\nAs you can see, there are many technical solutions for clients to choose. The majority of traders like Metatrader 4, but other platforms also have nice features and are appreciated by the trading community. Some traders like browser-based software more and find them much more effective.\n\nThe next point is assets available to trade. There are many products to trade here:\n\n1) Stocks. This is where you can trade stocks of the most popular companies like Tesla, Coca-Cola, AMD, Amazon, Boeing and many more.\n\n2) Indices. Here you can trade the indicators of the economy of the whole country or economy sectors. Such indices like S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, Nikkei 225 and many others are available.\n\n3) Futures. This market is very volatile, so you would better place your stop orders. Here you can trade futures on different assets like indices, coffee and many other assets.\n\n4) Crypto. This market has been increasingly growing last few years. You can operate Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n5) ETFs. Here you can invest in the whole directions of the economy and business. For example, if you want to invest in real estate, so you don\'t need to search for the stocks of the related companies and simply buy a real estate ETF like iShares US real estate.\n\nThere are more assets that I haven\'t mentioned here, so I guess anybody can find some assets that will suit them. Products are classified by different types, so there is room for many strategies to create.\n\nAnother benefit of the company is the support service. The broker provides several methods of contact, such as e-mail, telephone calls and live chat.

Nakul Chaudhary,7mo,How is Naga broker?,"Naga broker is cool; what else? =)

Jokes aside, I just think you needed to expand your question, at least because it's difficult to answer it, as I don't understand what particular features and functions this company has are interesting to you.

Well... Had it coming xD

I'm going to provide you as many details about this broker mainly not to raise side questions in the thread.

First things first, Naga Broker is a reputable and respected company in the trading circles, at least because it possesses a unique number of licenses. I wonder how many jurisdictions exist where it doesn't supply financial services. Probably, it's a very small number as NAGA has licenses to provide services under CySEC and ESMA regulations; thus, it's operating in the European Market. It also has some regulations for working on the global market and so on. For sure, it's impressive cause it grants access to trading to many people around the globe.

Secondly, I should mention trading conditions and their quality, as apparently, they matter more for a vast majority of traders who are in search of a proper brokerage.

To be honest and short, you can find everything here. A brilliant account types diversification, several trading platforms, including the ones NAGA representatives have developed on their own, the opportunity to become a real shareholder alongside daytrading, an adjustable system of depositing and withdrawal as you can choose the preferred method based on your location.

Account types diversification includes several VIP levels, as the company calls them, where such parameters as min. depo, one-to-one tutoring, the size of the withdrawal fee and others vary. The more funds you are ready to invest in your future, the better conditions you gain. I believe, it's the optimal system, and it's a decent one.

Copy trading is something that I didn't mention, but it doesn't mean it's a weak side of the company or something like that. On the opposite, copy trading is one of the main things NAGA broker is famous for. The infrastructure fully prepossesses you to earn money via automated trading. There is a separate section where you can find traders to follow, scrutinize their performance and make a choice.

As for trading platforms, then, as I said, there's an appealing quintessence of renowned software for trading and tailor-made solution for the company. NAGA App is as fast as MetaTrader, and I tested it on my own.

Finally, another remarkable characteristic of the broker - client support. It's multilingual and available for reaching out 24/5. You can choose the country where you are going to call from and contact the customer support team, which will dot all the i's. It's remarkable because they once helped me to sort out stuff about copy trading service. I've understood everything with a half-word; they are experts at conveying information with one-syllable words.

So, here's my rather brief, but I hope, an exhaustive overview of something Naga broker offers.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4nav5x18hetw6b7p', 'title': 'How is Naga broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Naga broker is cool; what else? =)\n\nJokes aside, I just think you needed to expand your question, at least because it's difficult to answer it, as I don't understand what particular features and functions this company has are interesting to you.\n\nWell...

Ciprian Niculescu,6mo,How is Naga broker?,"Naga broker is doing just fine! Thank you for asking, they say hi back to you 😀

All kidding aside, Naga is one of the best companies out there providing all-around brokerage services.

Through one convenient platform, you can access CFD trading, invest in company shares, or get involved in social trading. Whatever your preferences are, there is an option for you.

And with this general question, I don’t know what you have in mind more specifically. You know, when choosing a broker it’s recommended to know first your trading style and trading strategy and only then compare if the broker you are considering would suit your preferences.

However, as I mentioned before, Naga broker is an all-around player. Their amazing and futuristic platform, tools, tradeable instruments and so on, make it suitable for almost every trader’s profile.

Naga is kind of a unique broker offering many advantages over the others in the industry. Allow me to underline some of their features that I see as their advantages.

One fact that I highly appreciate about Naga is their order execution. They have adopted a no-dealing desk order execution type, and with the combination of its cutting-edge systems, the speed is like no other place. The price you see on the chart will be the same as the price of execution. No slippages, no delays. The order is processed in the blink of your eye. The investment in high technologies that assure the best trading experience is evident.

Another thing is the range of tradeable instruments. Naga offers over 1000 tradable instruments. I noticed some instruments that I have never heard before. Trading here would never get boring. The opportunities are literally endless. With this impressive range of offerings, I'm sure every trader can find their favourite instruments.

Even though I am not using the real shares offering, it must be concluded that this option is very rare compared to other online trading brokers. Investing in real shares in companies was usually done through specialized brokers with access to the world's stock markets, and was more complicated than online trading. By introducing this option, Naga has made investing much simpler and accessible to anyone interested.

For customer care. Perhaps for many not a very important part of the process of choosing a broker, but for Naga it is evident that it is an important aspect. The support team is always available, pleasant and professional. Мoreover, the trading community of Naga is like nowhere else. We support each other here and share opinions, trading ideas and experiences.

And finally, if you are not experienced in trading you can still join Naga and make decent profits. There are two ways, first is to educate yourself through their educational centre and get the knowledge and skills needed for trading. Or there is a short way too. It’s a copy trading platform. It’s one of the best platforms out there for social trading.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qd6co3wj91kb5g4y', 'title': 'How is Naga broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.9984, 'ai': 0.0016}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Naga broker is doing just fine!

Linh Nguyen,Updated 1y,What is the best brokerage for beginners?,"There are those that invest in order to generate money, while others invest in order to build or protect their financial security. Prioritize your financial needs and make sure the brokerage you choose can meet those demands.

Malik Krishnamurthy,8mo,How is Naga broker?,"In order to understand how is NAGA broker it is necessary to consider the basic services provided by this company.

You can describe the services of this broker in different ways. But in general, the company has three services:

1) Trading.

2) Investing.

3) Copying trades.

Describing each of these services, I will write a NAGA review that will give an answer to this question.

1) Trading.

Broker has created the conditions for CFD trading on several financial markets.

The trading is carried out through several platforms. The trader can choose the platform which is more convenient for him to use.

Platforms:

- MetaTrader4

- MetaTrader5

- NAGA Web App

- NAGA iOS App

- NAGA Android App

There are two mobile applications among these platforms, and MetaTrader platforms also have mobile versions. Therefore, in addition to desktop computer or laptop versions of the platforms, you can use mobile platforms.

The number of assets that can be traded at this broker is large. As I have already written, several financial markets are available:

- Forex

- Stocks

- Crypto

- Indices

- ETFs

- Commodities

- Futures

2) Investing. If you go to the official broker's website and find information about financial markets, you will notice that the Stocks are mentioned twice. As Stock CFD and as Real Stocks.

Real Stocks is an investment service.

The company provides traders the opportunity to buy shares of more than 500 companies.

Thus, traders who want to start investing in shares of large companies can do it with the help of brokerage services.

Trading of real stocks is carried out on the MetaTrader5 and NAGA platforms. Therefore, such trading does not differ much from CFD trading. The only difference is in some trading conditions. But it is obvious.

3) Copy trades.

Copy trading is one of the popular ways to make a profit from trading in financial markets.

And NAGA provides all the necessary conditions for such trading.

This service is called NAGA Autocopy. And it works quite simply.

All you need to do is choose a trader on a special panel from the list of successful traders whose trades you want to copy. Then you have to choose the type of copying and set the amount of funds you are willing to use. You can set individual risk limiters in the form of stop loss and take profit, and that's it.

With this, I've finished describing the services NAGA broker offers its clients. And I believe that now it's clear what NAGA is.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ziqk2dv07ayrxwlu', 'title': 'How is Naga broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.9713, 'ai': 0.0287}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""In order to understand how is NAGA broker it is necessary to consider the basic services provided by this company.\n\nYou can describe the services of this broker in different ways.

Ayden Gusikowski,10mo,How is Naga broker?,"It’s a great question. Simple and yet very meaningful I would say.

On the one hand this question can be answered in the same simple way. NAGA broker
 is so good, and that’s it. But I believe I should put a little bit more effort into it to elaborate on my previous thought. Why is NAGA broker so good? And what makes it good?

The first thing that makes a forex broker good is its trustworthiness. Because we can endlessly argue about which trading conditions are better, but the trading community has a consensus about the safety and reliability of the brokers.

This can include multiple factors, like regulation, reputation, transparency and so on and so forth. All these factors impact the traders’ confidence in the company. And we can easily say that NAGA broker excels in pretty much all of these aspects.

To give my words some meat let me give you a couple of examples.

NAGA is a regulated financial entity. It is regulated by the CySEC and it is also fully compliant with the MiFID directive. For traders who lived under the rock all this time, I’ll explain/ MiFID is a special directive that defines the guidelines and legal frameworks for every forex broker that is eligible to provide services in the EU jurisdiction.

And more seasoned traders know that there are several complicated regions for forex brokers to work on. The EU is one of them. The green light for NAGA to register EU citizens automatically brings the broker on another level in terms of credibility status.

If it’s not enough there is another argument in favor of the top-notch reliability of this company. At one point NAGA board decided to become a public company. To be able to do so, all the companies that want to go through IPO should become maximum transparent to the [potential investors.

They successfully accomplished it, and now the shares of teh NAGA are listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange.

You can even buy the shares of NAGA broker, if you have direct access to the German stock exchanges.

I guess I encouraged you to do a more thorough research about the broker to get a more comprehensive impression on the question “How is NAGA broker?”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/crfzd4ownvihsx2m', 'title': 'How is Naga broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It’s a great question.

Weston Cathy,4y,How much money do Forex brokers make roughly in a year?,"Every day, some new Forex brokers start working. Is it really such a profitable business that is attracting so many entrepreneurs to run a Forex brokerage firm? How much money can a Forex brokerage make?

The short answer to this question is that a Forex brokerage can make a lot of money. However, it is not as easy as most people think. It is a challenging business and needs a lot of things to be managed and promote properly. It is not just a website, a sign up form and a trading platform. There is a lot more behind the scene.

So how much money Forex brokers make?

As you know, there are two kinds of Forex brokers: Market Maker and ECN/STP

The income of these two kinds of brokers are completely different from each other.

Market Maker Brokers

A market maker broker doesn’t route the traders orders to the real currency market. It holds the trades with itself. That is why they call it market maker, because it is the broker that makes the market. So if you lose when trading through a market maker broker, indeed you are losing to the broker and the money you lose belongs to him. If you win, it is the broker who has to pay the profit you have made.

Therefore, traders losses is the main source of income for a market maker broker, because over 95% of the retail traders always lose and wipe out their accounts at least a few times before they give up or become profitable finally. So, a market maker broker makes a lot of money through the clients losses.

Market Maker brokers also charge spread and swap which is another source of income.

The other side of the story is the costs that running and managing a Forex brokerage has. A brokerage company needs a few teams for the accounting, compliance, tech, sales and marketing. For each 10,000 clients, they need at least a few account managers who take care of the clients deposit and withdrawal requests. They need a team to manage the platforms and take care of the technical issues. Also, it is not free to use the platform. It costs a $100,000 one time fee and $1,500 monthly fee to have an MT4 license. There are so many other apps and plugins that they might need to add.

If they want to be regulated, they will have to spend a lot of money and also deposit a lot more money in the banks as the guarantee and collateral. Based on the country they want to be regulated in, it can cost them from thousands to millions of dollars. Besides, they have to pay the compliance team constantly to follow up with the regulatory organizations.

When they manage to run such a complicated system, still one big problem is left. They have no clients. They have to advertise and attract people to sign up for an account. Their success depends on this. If they can promote the business and attract clients on a daily basis, they can cover the expenses, and chance are they make a lot of money. They have to keep the clients happy and satisfied. They have to offer an affiliate program that enables other webmasters to promote the brokerage and be compensated by the broker for each trader they refer.

Dealing Desk

Market maker brokers need another team which is called dealing desk. They have to sit at the computers and monitor the traders positions all the time. They have to be traders themselves. When they see a trader is doing good and goes for a position which can be potentially profitable, they take the same position with an ECN/STP broker, bank or liquidity provider, to make profit and recover the loss they might have to handle because of the profit that the trader will make (because the trader profit is their loss).

So, it is not an easy task to run and manage a brokerage. If they resist and keep on offering a good business, they will become popular and can make a lot of money. Learn more about market maker brokers:

ECN/STP Brokers

The work is much harder and a lot more complicated for ECN/STP brokers, because they don’t make any money through the traders losses, which is a great source of income for the broker. They route the traders orders to the banks, also known as liquidity providers, and charge a small fee which is called commission. Commission is the only legal and legitimate source of income for an ECN/STP broker, which is around $10-20 for each standard lot.

Although the ECN/STP brokers income is much lower than the market maker brokers, and their work can be a lot more complicated technically, they have a safer business, because they will not be affected by profitable traders who make money constantly.

Some ECN/STP brokers use some other ways to make more money. For example, they add markups to the orders. Markups are hidden to the traders, and just slip the price when they want to get in and out of the markets. For example, when a broker adds a 2 pips markup to the entry prices, then the client will enter the market with a 2 pips higher price in case of long positions, or 2 pips lower price in case of short positions. This 2 pips will be the broker’s profit also: 6 Ways Forex Brokers Cheat You

ECN/STP brokers don’t have to have a dealing desk. They just need to keep the servers up and running and allow the clients to take positions without any problems. So they don’t have to pay for a dealing desk.

Nowadays, most ECN/STP brokers have a dealing desk or market maker system too, because they want to make money from the traders losses like what market maker brokers do. When they see over 95% of the traders lose, they see no point to route their orders to the liquidity providers. They place the profitable traders accounts on the ECN/STP, and losing traders accounts on the dealing desk system. They know that most of those who open a small account, are novice traders who don’t know how to trade and make money, and will wipe out their accounts finally.

There is nothing wrong with this as long as the broker doesn’t do anything to make the traders lose faster, easier and more. It is not the broker’s fault when a trader loses based on his/her own mistake. When they see that someone is making money, they can easily move his account to the ECN/STP system and leave him alone to make his profit. But they are not allowed to do something to make him lose. Also, having hidden fees like markups is a fraud.

An ECN/STP broker can make a reasonable amount of money if he can have a reasonable number of clients. Unlike the market maker brokers, they don’t have to have too many employees, so their expenses is much lower. Also, they can hire a third party company and pay them a flat monthly fee to take care of the platforms servers. This will save a lot more money for them. They can only focus on marketing and taking care of the clients deposit and withdrawal requests.

Conclusion

Although it is not clear how much money each Forex broker makes every year, it looks like a profitable business for those who know how to start and promote it, and those have enough money to survive and promote the company as long as they have not become able to cover their expenses yet.

In spite of this, it looks like a too challenging business. Most people who know about trading, prefer to be a good trader and make a reasonable amount of profit every year, rather than to be a Forex broker who has to deal with too many problems every day.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ajpqcxb17589molf', 'title': 'How much money do Forex brokers make roughly in a year?', 'score': {'original': 0.32563333333333, 'ai': 0.67436666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Every day, some new Forex brokers start working.

It costs a $100,000 one time fee and $1,500 monthly fee to have an MT4 license. There are so many other apps and plugins that they might need to add.\n\nIf they want to be regulated, they will have to spend a lot of money and also deposit a lot more money in the banks as the guarantee and collateral. Based on the country they want to be regulated in, it can cost them from thousands to millions of dollars. Besides, they have to pay the compliance team constantly to follow up with the regulatory organizations.\n\nWhen they manage to run such a complicated system, still one big problem is left. They have no clients. They have to advertise and attract people to sign up for an account. Their success depends on this. If they can promote the business and attract clients on a daily basis, they can cover the expenses, and chance are they make a lot of money. They have to keep the clients happy and satisfied. They have to offer an affiliate program that enables other webmasters to promote the brokerage and be compensated by the broker for each trader they refer.\n\nDealing Desk\n\nMarket maker brokers need another team which is called dealing desk. They have to sit at the computers and monitor the traders positions all the time. They have to be traders themselves. When they see a trader is doing good and goes for a position which can be potentially profitable, they take the same position with an ECN/STP broker, bank or liquidity provider, to make profit and recover the loss they might have to handle because of the profit that the trader will make (because the trader profit is their loss).\n\nSo, it is not an easy task to run and manage a brokerage. If they resist and keep on offering a good business, they will become popular and can make a lot of money. Learn more about market maker brokers:\n\nECN/STP Brokers\n\nThe work is much harder and a lot more complicated for ECN/STP brokers, because they don’t make any money through the traders losses, which is a great source of income for the broker. They route the traders orders to the banks, also known as liquidity providers, and charge a small fee which is called commission. Commission is the only legal and legitimate source of income for an ECN/STP broker, which is around $10-20 for each standard lot.\n\nAlthough the ECN/STP brokers income is much lower than the market maker brokers, and their work can be a lot more complicated technically, they have a safer business, because they will not be affected by profitable traders who make money constantly.\n\nSome ECN/STP brokers use some other ways to make more money. For example, they add markups to the orders. Markups are hidden to the traders, and just slip the price when they want to get in and out of the markets. For example, when a broker adds a 2 pips markup to the entry prices, then the client will enter the market with a 2 pips higher price in case of long positions, or 2 pips lower price in case of short positions. This 2 pips will be the broker’s profit also: 6 Ways Forex Brokers Cheat You\n\nECN/STP brokers don’t have to have a dealing desk. They just need to keep the servers up and running and allow the clients to take positions without any problems. So they don’t have to pay for a dealing desk.\n\nNowadays, most ECN/STP brokers have a dealing desk or market maker system too, because they want to make money from the traders losses like what market maker brokers do. When they see over 95% of the traders lose, they see no point to route their orders to the liquidity providers. They place the profitable traders accounts on the ECN/STP, and losing traders accounts on the dealing desk system. They know that most of those who open a small account, are novice traders who don’t know how to trade and make money, and will wipe out their accounts finally.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this as long as the broker doesn’t do anything to make the traders lose faster, easier and more. It is not the broker’s fault when a trader loses based on his/her own mistake. When they see that someone is making money, they can easily move his account to the ECN/STP system and leave him alone to make his profit. But they are not allowed to do something to make him lose. Also, having hidden fees like markups is a fraud.\n\nAn ECN/STP broker can make a reasonable amount of money if he can have a reasonable number of clients. Unlike the market maker brokers, they don’t have to have too many employees, so their expenses is much lower. Also, they can hire a third party company and pay them a flat monthly fee to take care of the platforms servers. This will save a lot more money for them. They can only focus on marketing and taking care of the clients deposit and withdrawal requests.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough it is not clear how much money each Forex broker makes every year, it looks like a profitable business for those who know how to start and promote it, and those have enough money to survive and promote the company as long as they have not become able to cover their expenses yet.\n\nIn spite of this, it looks like a too challenging business. Most people who know about trading, prefer to be a good trader and make a reasonable amount of profit every year, rather than to be a Forex broker who has to deal with too many problems every day.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.32563333333333
Marat Lapin,6mo,How is Naga broker?,"How is NAGA broker?

I think I can share some impressions with you.

First of all, I would like to start by saying that this is not just any broker. NAGA is part of a system of several companies that are united in NAGA Group AG.

This is a solid financial tech company that has not only several licenses and regulations, but also engaged in various activities.

These activities include the implementation of brokerage services. I am sure that you are not interested in other services of this group. Unless only NAGA Pay may be interesting because this service is connected with brokerage activity and can be a great addition.

My description of this broker is not detailed. But even based on what I have described it is clear that NAGA is a solid company.

As for the brokerage and trading conditions, it is obvious that this company provides high-level services.

In a highly competitive environment between brokers, such a large company cannot afford to have low-quality services or unfavorable trading conditions.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/scrhpdt6834anyvk', 'title': 'How is Naga broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.971, 'ai': 0.029}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'How is NAGA broker?\n\nI think I can share some impressions with you.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to start by saying that this is not just any broker.

James Richardson,7mo,How is Naga broker?,"Judging by the financial situation of the company and the fact that it is publicly traded on the Frankfurt stock exchange Naga broker is totally okay. Glad that you’re asking.

Jokes aside, this broker is probably the most renowned forex broker, at least in the EU region.

Of course it exerts its influence far beyond the EU. It works globally with the same efficiency.

Nevertheless, the EU stamp of approval means a lot in the forex business, for retail traders specifically. It’s all because the European regulators are much more strict when it comes to financial services providers.

As far as I know there is a thing called MiFID II that defines the overall framework which all the financial entities of the EU must comply with.

In addition we can’t ignore the reality that Naga shares are available to buy and own for any individual out there.

Steven Haddock,1y,Why did lawyers and real estate brokers have such bad relationships in the 1940s-1970s?,"They still do.

Let’s say there’s a home that sells for $1 million. The typical take for the brokers would be about $40,000, maybe split two ways.

So what does the lawyer make on that transaction? Maybe.. $2,500?

And guess who is the more likely to get sued if something goes wrong. That’s right - the lawyer. They take far more risk because the thing that’s most likely to go wrong is there’s something wrong with the buyer’s title. You also wouldn’t believe how many lawyers lose their license over real estate transactions that turn out to be fraudulent and the lawyer is the dupe in the whole thing.

To be a broker you have to take a multi-week training course and pass a straightforward exam. To be a lawyer you need a 7 year education that’s tremendously exclusive and pass an exam that might last three days.

That’s why in a lot of places lawyers are the default brokers now. In most places, lawyers can act as brokers without being licensed as brokers.

Jerod Rippin,Sep 14,How can I identify a trusted crypto broker?,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading, one of the most crucial decisions you'll make is choosing a trusted crypto broker. I've learned that finding a reliable broker is paramount to ensuring a safe and profitable trading experience. I'll share my insights on how to identify a trusted crypto broker, drawing from my experience with XBTFX.

Regulation and Licensing:
The first and perhaps the most critical aspect to consider when searching for a trustworthy crypto broker is regulation and licensing. Regulatory bodies exist to oversee the operations of brokers and ensure they adhere to industry standards. It's a clear signal that a broker takes its responsibilities seriously. In my experience, I found that XBTFX, the broker I ultimately chose, is regulated and complies with industry standards, providing me with peace of mind.

Transparent Fees and Commissions:
A reliable broker should be transparent about its fee structure. Hidden fees can eat into your profits and lead to unpleasant surprises. A trusted broker, like XBTFX, provides information about its fees upfront, with competitive spreads and low commissions, allowing traders to calculate costs accurately.

Security Measures:
Security is a top priority in the crypto world. Look for brokers that implement robust security measures to protect your funds and personal information. Features like two-factor authentication (2FA) and encryption protocols are non-negotiable. With XBTFX, I've experienced the assurance of knowing my investments are safeguarded.

Customer Support:
A broker's customer support is a reflection of its commitment to its clients. A trustworthy broker, such as XBTFX, offers round-the-clock support, ensuring that assistance is available whenever you need it. High customer review ratings can also be an indicator of excellent customer service.

Account Types and Leverage:
A trusted broker caters to traders of all experience levels and offers different account types to suit varying trading styles. It's essential to understand the leverage options available, and XBTFX, for instance, provides clear information about leverage and margin requirements for different assets. This flexibility ensures that traders can tailor their approach to their individual preferences and risk tolerance.

Quick and Transparent Transactions:
Efficiency in processing deposits and withdrawals is vital. Trusted brokers, like XBTFX, enable quick registration and immediate deposits, with same-day withdrawals processed within 24 hours. This expediency simplifies the trading process and ensures that I can access my funds when needed.

Regulatory Compliance:
Regulatory compliance adds another layer of trustworthiness. Ensure that your chosen broker adheres to the regulations of the regions it operates in, as well as international standards. XBTFX complies with industry regulations, providing further peace of mind. Knowing that XBTFX meets these requirements gives me confidence in the legitimacy of their operations.

Community and Reputation:
Researching a broker's reputation is an invaluable step in identifying trustworthiness. Reading reviews from other traders and exploring online communities can provide insights into the experiences of others. XBTFX boasts a community of over 10,000 like-minded traders, a testament to its credibility. This sense of community has allowed me to learn and grow as a trader while knowing that I'm part of a reputable network.

In conclusion, the path to finding a trusted crypto broker is a critical one for any trader. Through my experiences, I've come to rely on XBTFX as a broker that meets the criteria of trustworthiness, including regulation, transparency, security, and customer support.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gb210wrkiocxaedn', 'title': 'How can I identify a trusted crypto broker?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading, one of the most crucial decisions you'll make is choosing a trusted crypto broker.

Felix Jacob,Updated 1y,What are the best brokers in Switzerland?,"There are several Swiss brokers, and most Swiss banks have their broker service. But some international brokers like Victoria Grace Lindsay firm are also available in Switzerland.

You need a broker account if you want to invest in the stock market. So, before investing, you need to choose a broker account. You need to choose carefully since changing brokers is neither easy nor free. Therefore, it is essential to pick the best broker possible.

By the end of this article, you will know which broker you should use as a Swiss passive investor in ETF!

How to choose a broker?

Choosing a broker is not very difficult, but it is a very important decision.

You are likely to use it for many years. You can always switch to a new broker. But moving your shares to a new broker is not free and not straightforward to do. So, it is better to start with the right decision directly. Ideally, you want to start with the best broker for your needs.

You first need to ensure that you only trade with a reputable broker. You will entrust your investments with this broker. So you want a broker with a good reputation and excellent security.

Mainly, you must ensure that the broker will hold your assets separately from the broker’s legal entity. If the broker defaults, you can still reclaim your assets through the secondary entity. This separation is called asset segregation, something that any proper broker will do.

The second thing you should check is whether the broker gives you access to the exchanges you need. For instance, if you want to trade in Swiss stocks, you will need access to the Swiss Stock Exchange (SWX).

Due to a bad set of laws, it is currently challenging to access Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) from the U.S. Indeed, European investors cannot currently invest in these funds.

And only Interactive Brokers (among the affordable brokers) will offer Swiss investors access to these U.S. ETFs. So, your choice is highly limited if you want to invest in these funds.

Finally, you need to look at the prices of transactions. Price is the main issue with most Swiss brokers. They are expensive. As we will see later, there can be a vast difference in fees between different brokers. Most people do not realize this! When you compare brokers, you will see that the difference is too big to ignore!

Out of these three criteria, the third one is the one that requires the most research. Finding reputable and safe brokers is not very difficult. But finding an affordable broker giving you access to the stock exchanges you need is not always easy. If you research correctly, you will directly start using the best broker for your needs.

The best brokers in Switzerland

As I said before, there are many options. You can probably trade directly with your bank. But Swiss banks are costly for trading. It would be convenient to trade directly with your bank. Unfortunately, they are too expensive. So, you should not trade with your bank.

Dung Quach,Sep 24,What are the differences of Doto Vietnam reviews from broker’s reviews in other jurisdictions?,"Let me tell you the first, foremost and most distinctive difference between a doto review Vietnam and doto reviews in other jurisdictions:

Doto reviews in Vietnam are probably in Vietnamese! Whereas doto reviews in Europe could probably be in English, German, French, Spanish!

Well, okay, if we got that ridiculous joke out of the way, let's talk shop.

In the picture I have provided, I don't know if you speak Vietnamese or not, but it is safe to assume that some people who will read this thread might know it, some people might not. After all, quora is an international platform.

What you see is basically this:

Non-Trading Operations Policy

Client Agreement

Compaints Handling Policy

Terms and Conditions

Risk Disclosure

Best Execution Policy

Market Terms of Use

Cookie Consent and Policy

Privacy Policy

Also,

Doto Global, the trade name for Doto Global Ltd, is licensed and regulated as an Investment Dealer by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Mauritius, under license number C119023978.

So, what are those?

This information basically states that Doto has an international regulatory license that allows it to operate across many jurisdictions worldwide.

And why is that important?

Regulatory rules usually determine what kind of trading conditions a broker will apply for individuals and customers from a certain jurisdictions. Now, they still might vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction even though both jurisdictions fall under the same regulatory license, but more or less they could be similar.

And why is this important, again?? Well. Since Doto operates both in Vietnam and so many other jurisdictions that fall under the same regulatory capacity and rules, and the trading conditions in these jurisdictions and specifications that traders could find on Doto platform might be similar as well, their experience could be siimlar, and their reviews could be more or less siimlar as well.

Sumayah,11mo,"Is the brokerage contract (NCNDA- Export and import business) valid once a buy-and-sell deal is made, or is the broker entitled to a commission as soon as the buyer and seller are connected, even if the deal fails?","The validity of a brokerage contract (NCNDA) and the broker's entitlement to a commission will depend on the specific terms and conditions of the contract. In some cases, a broker may be entitled to a commission as soon as the buyer and seller are connected, even if the deal fails. In other cases, the broker may only be entitled to a commission if the deal is successfully completed.

It is important to review the terms of the brokerage contract (NCNDA) carefully to determine the broker's entitlements and obligations in the event that the deal fails. Some common provisions in brokerage contracts include:

1. Commission amount: The amount of commission that the broker is entitled to receive in the event of a successful deal.

2. Commission structure: The structure of the commission, such as a percentage of the total deal value or a flat fee, and when the commission is payable.

3. Exclusivity: Whether the broker has exclusive rights to negotiate on behalf of the buyer or seller, or if either party can negotiate with other brokers or parties.

4. Termination: The conditions under which the contract can be terminated, and any penalties or consequences for termination.

5. Confidentiality: The terms of confidentiality and non-disclosure, and the obligations of the buyer, seller, and broker.

Amanda Kevin,Feb 5,"When you try to sell the Airbnb business, Would you speak with a business broker or a realtor?","While I understand the appeal of professional photoshoots for property listings, the idea that you need to break the bank to elevate your images is simply not true.

With the right tools and techniques, you can transform your property photos from drab to fab without ever leaving your office.

First, consider the lighting.

Natural light can make a world of difference, so try taking your photos during the day and using curtains or blinds to diffuse the light and avoid harsh shadows.

If natural light isn't an option, you can use inexpensive lighting equipment like ring lights or softbox lights to achieve similar effects.

Next, think about the composition of your shots.

Make sure to declutter the space and use simple, clean lines to draw the viewer's eye towards the focal point of the room.

You can also experiment with different angles and heights to add visual interest and showcase the property's best features.

Finally, don't be afraid to get creative with editing.

There are countless free and low-cost photo editing tools available that can help you adjust colors, brightness, and contrast to make your images pop.

From adding filters and effects to removing unwanted objects, a little bit of editing can go a long way in elevating your property photos.

So before you shell out thousands of dollars on a professional photoshoot, consider giving these tips a try.

With a little bit of effort and creativity, you can transform your property images and make them stand out from the crowd.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/l4cjkix7pg5mofwz', 'title': 'When you try to sell the Airbnb business, Would you speak with a business broker or a realtor?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""While I understand the appeal of professional photoshoots for property listings, the idea that you need to break the bank to elevate your images is simply not true.\n\nWith the right tools and techniques, you can transform your property photos from drab to fab without ever leaving your office.\n\nFirst, consider the lighting.\n\nNatural light can make a world of difference, so try taking your photos during the day and using curtains or blinds to diffuse the light and avoid harsh shadows.\n\nIf natural light isn't an option, you can use inexpensive lighting equipment like ring lights or softbox lights to achieve similar effects.\n\nNext, think about the composition of your shots.\n\nMake sure to declutter the space and use simple, clean lines to draw the viewer's eye towards the focal point of the room.\n\nYou can also experiment with different angles and heights to add visual interest and showcase the property's best features.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to get creative with editing.\n\nThere are countless free and low-cost photo editing tools available that can help you adjust colors, brightness, and contrast to make your images pop.\n\nFrom adding filters and effects to removing unwanted objects, a little bit of editing can go a long way in elevating your property photos.\n\nSo before you shell out thousands of dollars on a professional photoshoot, consider giving these tips a try.\n\nWith a little bit of effort and creativity, you can transform your property images and make them stand out from the crowd."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1980971, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""While I understand the appeal of professional photoshoots for property listings, the idea that you need to break the bank to elevate your images is simply not true.\n\nWith the right tools and techniques, you can transform your property photos from drab to fab without ever leaving your office.\n\nFirst, consider the lighting.\n\nNatural light can make a world of difference, so try taking your photos during the day and using curtains or blinds to diffuse the light and avoid harsh shadows.\n\nIf natural light isn't an option, you can use inexpensive lighting equipment like ring lights or softbox lights to achieve similar effects.\n\nNext, think about the composition of your shots.\n\nMake sure to declutter the space and use simple, clean lines to draw the viewer's eye towards the focal point of the room.\n\nYou can also experiment with different angles and heights to add visual interest and showcase the property's best features.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to get creative with editing.\n\nThere are countless free and low-cost photo editing tools available that can help you adjust colors, brightness, and contrast to make your images pop.\n\nFrom adding filters and effects to removing unwanted objects, a little bit of editing can go a long way in elevating your property photos.\n\nSo before you shell out thousands of dollars on a professional photoshoot, consider giving these tips a try.\n\nWith a little bit of effort and creativity, you can transform your property images and make them stand out from the crowd."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Diversification: It's important to have a diversified investment portfolio to minimize risk. If you have a significant amount of assets to invest, you may consider opening multiple brokerage accounts with different brokers to diversify your investments across different asset classes and investment products.
Investment goals: Your investment goals may also determine how many brokerage accounts you need. For example, if you have a long-term investment goal, such as saving for retirement, you may consider opening a retirement account like an IRA or 401(k) in addition to a regular brokerage account.
Fees: Each brokerage account may have different fees and commissions associated with it. If you're looking to minimize fees, it may make sense to consolidate your investments into a single brokerage account.

Juicy Lisa,1y,What is the best brokerage for beginners?,"I think for a novice investor without any investment experience, moomoo
 should be a nice choice.

The first time I met moomoo, a tech-driven financial services platform, was about last year when I earned my first salary in my life. I have a lot of curiosity about how to earn money in the stock market. But as a newbie, I'm so poor at that time, so I must make every decision more carefully to avoid losses.

Moomoo helped me a lot in being an experienced investor. So if investors want to grow from beginner to veteran, there are two ways-learn how to invest systematically, or lose money in the market to grow up. But moomoo provides a complete set of investment analysis tools, like a wealth of market data, financial news, an energetic community, and other functions.

Just like the reason why I choose moomoo: it's aiming to empower every investor to learn and grow via a complete investment education system and truly invest like a professional investor.

To be more specific, before I make the decision to buy a stock, I need to judge the company's value, whether its stock price is lower or higher than it should be at the buying point. But it's hard to make the decision because there are tons of ratios and uncertainties in the market.

Moomoo provides a tutorial of ""step-by-step guide to technical analysis"", which has a comprehensive interpretation of indicators. The courses let me recognize indicators not only literally, but also practically. Oh by the way, the paper trading function is also useful for me to start trading because I won't lose money but have the opportunity to see what the real market performance is.

In addition, as moomoo was born in the internet era, it's a very user-friendly App. Whatever stage the investor is in, the journey of being an experienced investor is tailored for everyone. For example, the study plan function on moomoo integrates the existing investment education content into a clear and complete learning program that provides systematic courses for users at different levels.

Except for the study plan, there are more functions worth exploring on moomoo, such as financial news, online community, live broadcasts, video tutorials, free level-2 market data, and analysis tools integrated into one App. Through learning and analysis, I can acquire a wide range of information on listed companies and industries, and make their investment decisions better grounded.

All in all, moomoo gave me a good experience being a mature investor, hope you have the same wonderful journey.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ou2whi6ytde5l7jc', 'title': 'What is the best brokerage for beginners?', 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think for a novice investor without any investment experience, moomoo\n should be a nice choice.\n\nThe first time I met moomoo, a tech-driven financial services platform, was about last year when I earned my first salary in my life.

Leah Campbell,1y,How do I pick the best real estate brokerage?,"Choosing a real estate brokerage can be intimidating, but with the right research and guidance, you can find one that best suits your needs.

When selecting a real estate brokerage, it is important to consider whether they have experience in the area you are looking to purchase or invest in and their track record of success. Researching individual brokerages and talking with their agents will help you identify if their team is knowledgeable and experienced enough to ensure your success.

Additionally, ask them questions about how they handle transactions so that you’re sure they uphold ethical standards while providing superior service.

It is also essential to understand what services each firm offers before making a decision as certain firms may specialize in different facets of the industry such as new home sales or short-term rentals.

Knowing which services are provided by each firm will assist in narrowing down which ones could potentially offer what you need now or down the line when searching for the perfect property for yourself or an investment opportunity.

Finally, compare fees between different brokerages before signing any agreements; some firms may charge flat fees for specific services whereas others might only take commission when selling a property; knowing these terms can save time and money when making such an important decision.

Deciding on a real estate brokerage requires commitment so make sure your chosen company checks all boxes beforehand!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fwzxu1lyo5snmkba', 'title': 'How do I pick the best real estate brokerage?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Choosing a real estate brokerage can be intimidating, but with the right research and guidance, you can find one that best suits your needs.\n\nWhen selecting a real estate brokerage, it is important to consider whether they have experience in the area you are looking to purchase or invest in and their track record of success.

Dr. Mukul Agrawal,Nov 1,What are the broker charges for a stock SIP?,"Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are typically associated with mutual funds, not stocks. SIPs allow investors to regularly invest a fixed amount in a mutual fund at predetermined intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly). The concept of SIP doesn't directly apply to individual stocks.

However, if you're interested in regular investing in stocks, you can set up a periodic investment plan with a broker. The charges for such investments may vary depending on the broker and the specific plan you choose. Here are some of the potential charges to consider:

Brokerage Commission: You'll be charged a brokerage commission when you buy or sell stocks. Some brokers offer discounted or flat-rate commissions for regular investments.
Demat Account Fees: If you don't already have a Demat account, there may be account opening charges. Additionally, you'll typically pay Annual Maintenance Charges (AMC) for maintaining your Demat account.
Transaction Charges: Stock exchanges impose transaction charges on every trade you execute. These charges may vary depending on the trade value.
Securities Transaction Tax (STT): STT is a tax levied on stock market transactions and is applicable when buying and selling stocks.
Goods and Services Tax (GST): GST is applicable on brokerage and other charges associated with trading.
Stamp Duty: Stamp duty is a state-level tax applied to the transfer of shares. Rates can vary from one state to another.
Exchange Transaction Fees: Some stock exchanges levy transaction fees on the buy and sell sides of the trade.
Margin Interest (if applicable): If you use margin or leverage for your stock investments, you may be charged interest on the borrowed funds.
Auto-Debit Charges: If you set up auto-debit for your periodic investments, there might be additional charges associated with this service.

It's important to check with your chosen broker to understand their specific fee structure for regular stock investments. Brokers often provide information about their charges on their websites or in their account opening documents. Make sure to read the terms and conditions and ask your broker for a clear breakdown of all charges associated with your investment plan. Keep in mind that fees can vary, and it's wise to compare different brokers to find the one that best suits your investment needs.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/c8x4wd3gapbvz5rh', 'title': 'What are the broker charges for a stock SIP?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are typically associated with mutual funds, not stocks.

First and foremost, ZuluTrade is not just a copy trading platform; it's a whole network that allows you to be both a follower or a trader who shares his strategy and receive benefits for that. Of course, it doesn't work autonomously, as you need a brokerage company that is partnering with this software, and basically, almost all variables depend on the broker, like assets for trading and so on.

As for ZuluTrade, then a bunch of functions are available on its website. If you consider to start copy trading and you are looking for a broker that has a partnership with this company, then it's better to get acquainted with the different tools the company possesses. For instance, there is a whole simulation system that helps you to dive deep into this activity without any need to spend your personal funds. You just set a certain sum of money, choose a timeframe, and then this simulation will upload an artificial ""leader"" who you will follow. It's created specifically to help new clients to understand what it is all about.

Additionally, if you doubt the company's competence or you just hesitate because you aren't convinced of full-fledged funds protection, you can read information about the ZuluGuard system. It tracks traders' activity and eliminates those traders whose strategy deviates from the established profit/loss ratio. In a nutshell, it simply means that you won't be able to end in the red simply because this protective mechanism won't allow any trader you follow to cheat on you. Besides, this mechanism helps you to protect your account by automatic calculation of exit points according to the sum you should set beforehand.

Secondly, ZuluTrade has an immaculate help center on the website, where all answers to frequently asked questions are given. On top of that, there are investor/leader/affiliate guides. Yeah, the company also proposes a special affiliate program and precise conditions are described on the site as well. Moreover, I forgot to mention the community of traders right on the site where they chat, ask about different things, sometimes even share analysis and so on. It's inserted in the website, so you don't need to click some links and proceed to other subsites.

As I have promised you, I should also touch upon the broker I once traded with, which supplies ZuluTrade software. This broker is Fxview. The overall process of connection to ZuluTrade isn't difficult as everything is already done by the broker. Everything you need to do is to find the appropriate button on the website, to register an account, to fund it and then you will be connected to the platform. It's as easy as pie. The process of choosing a leader isn't sophisticated as well. Hopefully, ZuluTrade cared about providing the most transparent information about traders who share their strategies with an innovative dashboard where all required data is depicted. Here are such variables:

- Neat statistics

- Portfolio

- Strategy a trader uses

- Number of traders who follow him

To sum up, I just want to recommend this software for those having a stake in copy trading. You can choose Fxview as a broker, which gives you access to ZuluTrade, as the number of tradable assets and other trading conditions are also appealing.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hn0ac8u4v3ytkx6m', 'title': 'Which ZuluTrade brokers can you name, and what are the conditions for using this software on their platforms?', 'score': {'original': 0.4207, 'ai': 0.5793}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Oh, I actually faced one broker ZuluTrade company cooperates with.\n\nUndoubtedly, this company supplies brilliant services from the point of copy trading opportunities, as basically, it\'s very difficult to find a good copy trading platform these days.

Mesrop Karapetyan,1y,What kind of features and advantages of HFM.com broker can you emphasize that stand out?,"This comes off as a very broad question. And I think the answer could be many pages long if we start enlisting them in a random order.

This is why, I will try to classify them in a few broad categories and expound on them with some features and advantages I would deem the significant.

The broad categories I mentioned above, that I would like to look at to put forward the possible features and advantages of HFM.com broker, or any other broker for that matter, are:

1) Security, Safety of Funds, Legal Documentation and the Regulation of the broker

This is a very technical issue, and may probably sound boring to some people. But you never assume so. Some people, just because they would like to skip to the fun part, they neglect the legitimacy of the broker in the eyes of the law enforcement, financial regulatory bodies and governmental watchdogs. And they easily end up in situations where they get their funds stolen, or they want a lawsuit with the broker, etc. You absolutely don't want that. This is why we are kicking things of with this aspect in the first place.

What we see at HFM, when we turn our eyes to the regulatory environment
, can be explained with a single word: abundance. They are abiding by the regulatory requirements of tons of reputable, well-known, strict and respectable regulatory authorities across the world. Starting from CySEC, their regulatory licenses reach from FCA in the UK, DFSA in UAE, FSCA in SA. With 7 global regulatory licenses and more than 20 local licenses and registrations, it is obvious that they are taking this matter very seriously.

In terms of the security of funds, HFM implements best-in-its-class industry standard protocols. Such as market insurance, seggregation of funds, regulatory supervision, investor compensation fund, negative balance protection for traders, any much more. Along with that, they publicly offer every single necessary legal document on their own website as well.

2) Accounts, Platforms and Tools for traders offered

In terms of this aspect, a lot traders argue, that it's not the specifications of accounts, platforms or tools that matter, but the availability of choices, preferences and options matter. Because it could be not very easy to develop tons of account types, tools and have multiple platforms available for traders' use in place on a broker.

HFM offers multiple account types, including a Zero Spread account, a Copy trading account and other account types. They all have varying features and trading conditions.

With regards to trading platforms and software support, HFM is probably offering every type of MT4 and MT5 version out there, for the PC, Web Terminal, Phone, Tablet, etc. I say probably because I don't know how much exactly there are.

As for the tools, HFM offers multiple trading tools and analytics tools in their platform. They range from autochartist tools, premium trader tools such as sentiment tracking, sophisticated alarms, messaging, alarm manager, correlation matrix and so much more. Advanced insights, exclusive analyses, VPS hosting, traders' board and one-click trading services are also available as tools.

Additionally, HFM's customer service department are also available for traders' questions, inqueries and requests over the platform.

3) Trading conditions and cost of trading of the broker:

Trading conditions such as minimum deposit, spread types, spread amounts, leverages and number of possible open orders obviously vary depending on the account type you choose, but overall, a comparison of how HFM compares to other brokers' spreads out there on their website, and by the looks of it, it compares very well. Some accounts have spreads starting from 0 zero pips, and they start from just a pip in some other accounts. Leverage levels also vary depending on the product traded, but there it can be said that there is enough leverage on the platform for everyone.

4) Reputation of the broker:

Lastly, what people think about the broker also matters by a lot. What you can do is have a quick look-around in terms of what has been written about brokers to see if there has been any red flags. In the case of HFM though, if you do try to look for some red flags or deal-breakers, you might actually draw a blank there.

Overall, as I have said, there are many features and advantages you would find on HFM's platform if you look deeper into the aspects I have picked and other aspects, but I still tried to take some of the most important aspects for analyzing a broker. Hope this was helpful to you to form an opinion about HFM.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/y05fwh7kgbxo3jea', 'title': 'What kind of features and advantages of HFM.com broker can you emphasize that stand out?', 'score': {'original': 0.67005, 'ai': 0.32995}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This comes off as a very broad question.

Hope this was helpful to you to form an opinion about HFM."", 'result': {'fake': 0.7412, 'real': 0.2588}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 8, 'credits': 1980914, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""This comes off as a very broad question. And I think the answer could be many pages long if we start enlisting them in a random order.\n\nThis is why, I will try to classify them in a few broad categories and expound on them with some features and advantages I would deem the significant.\n\nThe broad categories I mentioned above, that I would like to look at to put forward the possible features and advantages of HFM.com broker, or any other broker for that matter, are:\n\n1) Security, Safety of Funds, Legal Documentation and the Regulation of the broker\n\nThis is a very technical issue, and may probably sound boring to some people. But you never assume so. Some people, just because they would like to skip to the fun part, they neglect the legitimacy of the broker in the eyes of the law enforcement, financial regulatory bodies and governmental watchdogs. And they easily end up in situations where they get their funds stolen, or they want a lawsuit with the broker, etc. You absolutely don't want that. This is why we are kicking things of with this aspect in the first place.\n\nWhat we see at HFM, when we turn our eyes to the regulatory environment\n, can be explained with a single word: abundance. They are abiding by the regulatory requirements of tons of reputable, well-known, strict and respectable regulatory authorities across the world. Starting from CySEC, their regulatory licenses reach from FCA in the UK, DFSA in UAE, FSCA in SA. With 7 global regulatory licenses and more than 20 local licenses and registrations, it is obvious that they are taking this matter very seriously.\n\nIn terms of the security of funds, HFM implements best-in-its-class industry standard protocols. Such as market insurance, seggregation of funds, regulatory supervision, investor compensation fund, negative balance protection for traders, any much more. Along with that, they publicly offer every single necessary legal document on their own website as well.\n\n2) Accounts, Platforms and Tools for traders offered\n\nIn terms of this aspect, a lot traders argue, that it's not the specifications of accounts, platforms or tools that matter, but the availability of choices, preferences and options matter. Because it could be not very easy to develop tons of account types, tools and have multiple platforms available for traders' use in place on a broker.\n\nHFM offers multiple account types, including a Zero Spread account, a Copy trading account and other account types. They all have varying features and trading conditions.\n\nWith regards to trading platforms and software support, HFM is probably offering every type of MT4 and MT5 version out there, for the PC, Web Terminal, Phone, Tablet, etc. I say probably because I don't know how much exactly there are.\n\nAs for the tools, HFM offers multiple trading tools and analytics tools in their platform. They range from autochartist tools, premium trader tools such as sentiment tracking, sophisticated alarms, messaging, alarm manager, correlation matrix and so much more. Advanced insights, exclusive analyses, VPS hosting, traders' board and one-click trading services are also available as tools.\n\nAdditionally, HFM's customer service department are also available for traders' questions, inqueries and requests over the platform.\n\n3) Trading conditions and cost of trading of the broker:\n\nTrading conditions such as minimum deposit, spread types, spread amounts, leverages and number of possible open orders obviously vary depending on the account type you choose, but overall, a comparison of how HFM compares to other brokers' spreads out there on their website, and by the looks of it, it compares very well. Some accounts have spreads starting from 0 zero pips, and they start from just a pip in some other accounts. Leverage levels also vary depending on the product traded, but there it can be said that there is enough leverage on the platform for everyone.\n\n4) Reputation of the broker:\n\nLastly, what people think about the broker also matters by a lot. What you can do is have a quick look-around in terms of what has been written about brokers to see if there has been any red flags. In the case of HFM though, if you do try to look for some red flags or deal-breakers, you might actually draw a blank there.\n\nOverall, as I have said, there are many features and advantages you would find on HFM's platform if you look deeper into the aspects I have picked and other aspects, but I still tried to take some of the most important aspects for analyzing a broker.

Eero Pennanen,1y,What broker's peculiarites has FXCC trading for average newbie?,"All right. This is actually a good question. Because a lot of brokers these days on the market are claiming to be better than the others by saying they are offering this advanced feature, that advanced feature, developed this, developed that. It seems to me that they are trying to offer a lot to the more experienced and professional swath of the populace of traders than newbies.

Let's see what FXCC trading has to offer to an average newbie.

However, in order to do that, I also would like to put the theme under the microscope, that, what an average newbie would need from a broker?

A newbie, or in other words, a trader who is not deeply involved in the world of trading and does not have profound knowledge about the nuances of brokers, would need, in order to not to get his account wrecked in the first days of his trading journey:

- A stable, reputable, and trustworthy broker which can provide safety and security to newbie's funds

- A reliable company, so that there will not be any conflict of interest, and the broker is not trying somehow conning or misbehaving

- A top tier trading software so the first experience of the average newbie is smooth and seamless

- A favorable trading environment which is suitable for newbies, assuming they are not allocating a ton of money to this because they are relatively new.

- A customer friendly broker who is going to help the trader move forward on the learning curve, and a good customer team who are ready to help the trader out should they have any questions or need for assistance

Now that we got that out of the way, let's check out what end of the spectrum the FXCC stands on, in regards to this question as a broker.

First of all, FXCC has a reputable organization which has been in this industry since 2010. They have been awarded multiple times by various platforms for offering high quality services to its customers.

FXCC is a Straight-through-processing (STP) electronic communications network (ECN) brokerage company. Let me explain if you are already confused. It is their business model. This business model means that FXCC effectively sends all the clients' orders to qualified financial enterprises in the pool of liquidity FXCC has. This means that FXCC does not maintain a dealing desk with an order book, they do not match the orders with theirs or other people's orders on the platform. This way, clients face no price manipulation or spread manipulation as well.

This model increases the liquidity, removes the possibility of broker taking the other side of the trades and trading against its own customers. With the increase liquidity, traders will have more chance not to get slippages and requotes. And the broker only facilitates the trades. Which is transparent and honest.

FXCC's cost structure is also very transparent and customer friendly: No commissions, no swaps, no mark-up on the spreads, no hidden fees, no taxes are taken away from clients' funds.

Opening an account is also free.

There is no minimum deposit amount at FXCC. Traders can put in whatever amount they wish. But there is a 100% first deposit bonus should they decide to deposit up to $2000.

Minimum trade size is 0.01 lots which is also a favorable feature for newbie traders.

In terms of the security, FXCC abides by all the regulatory rules and safety protocols, under which they are supervised, they keep the clients' fund seggregated and offer a Client Money Protection mechanism, all of which are on the side of clients.

FXCC offers a vast selection of educational material and e-books for newbies as well to learn and digest information about the financial world, forex, and how to trade. They also have 24/5 multilingual customer support.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ry4l0kpm2fucqg1n', 'title': ""What broker's peculiarites has FXCC trading for average newbie?"", 'score': {'original': 0.7299, 'ai': 0.2701}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""All right.

Stefan Kennedy,1y,How did Exnova reviews help you out with your process of choosing a broker?,"It's a long story for me. So better fasten your seat belts.

It's nice to be in the pursuit of new and challenging opportunities, whether it is a new market or an asset type that you are not expert on, or a new broker that could give you better perspectives, education or features that you could easily draw on in your favor on global financial markets.

I did not know about Exnova back then, and when I finally heard about it for the first time, I decided to research the company, and my process obviously included reading a lot of Exnova reviews as well.

As far as the reviews go, the company was all fine with decent trading conditions, preferable ecosystem, reliability, transparent regulatory situation, quick to deposit and withdraw, easy to use and get accustomed to, dynamic and exciting.

But I did not dive straight in, I took things a bit slow, analyzed the company a bit further, its features, its website, what people say about it. Then I registered for a demo account and instantly got $10,000 in virtual currency to completely try out the demo account. It was quite a good experience, the platform worked well and experienced my trades flawlessly, found the assets I liked to trade and know about. So I went over the features, and I was ready enough to try the platform with my own real money at stake.

When you first start looking at any platform, you usually would like to see what the broker has to offer to its traders. I found free tutorials in video form, instructions on how to use the platform thoroughly step-by-step, a lot of charts, visualizations and great looking charts to help me out.

So I started trading here with the input I gathered about the broker and the trading experience of other people in my mind. And people shared their experience about pretty much every aspect of the broker there is. Starting from how the platform is powerful and glitch-free even the most volatile times in the market, how fair the trading conditions are, how the interface is clear, how the choice of assets are a handful and there are more than enough stocks and crypto assets you could easily enjoy trading, and how abundant the educational resources are.

Well, after carefully reviewing the reviews themselves, and cross-checking what's been said about the broker on the platform first hand. I can enthusiastically confirm that majority of those points are on-point and accurate.

This is why you should always try to have a first-hand approach and experience in the first place after reading tons of reviews. You should confirm them for yourself, to see if this broker can be long-term for you.

So, a couple of major points for me was:

The broker fully complies with the modern regulatory protocols that are put in place to protect the investors, traders and end clients of brokers from any misbehaving of the broker. This one fully abides by it. So, you can bet your bottom dollar that your funds and hard earned money will be safe in your accounts here.

It was evident to me, that Exnova team put a great deal of time and effort into their trading platform to have it work without any problems, glitches, lags, slowdowns. The platform basically works like a clock even when the volatility goes up massively during big and significant macroeconomic announcements, during the US market open and close. This was a really important issue for me, and the broker ticked this box in a positive way.

In terms of the additional features that contribute to the reason why I chose this broker besides their reputation in the reviews and why I am thinking of keeping my account here, some of them would be:

- The community here is quite large. And the broker allows it to use the community and their actions in your favor. You can utilize the live chat, there is an option for traders' sentiment on the platform, so you can see where people are betting their money on, and you can display community live deals, so you can literally see the money in action, flowing.

- I can say that broker could be ideal for beginners who are just trying things out and low budget traders who do not have a lot of money to put in every single order. The minimum deal size starts at one dollar. Which can be a huge positive for those kind of traders.

- Other smart features of the trading platform include price movement alerts, the smart newsfeed and the properly designed economic calendar, which, if you know what you are doing, you can use it in your favor greatly.

All in all, apart from what's been said about the broker in the reviews, which, help traders a lot to realize what the broker has to offer to its traders,, all positive features I put a good emphasize on above also help people to gain a good understanding of how proper and reliable this broker is.

This has been an exciting journey overall to discover this broker, even though I haven't been able to get a full grip on what's on the table, I am sure with enough time and usage, I will get the full comprehension of the complete spectrum of features this broker can offer to me. But, coming back to your question, in terms of if and how the reviews helped me: they definitely help you with a lot of things that you would not normally discover this broker. So, it can be said, that reading reviews about a broker before and while you are doing business on the platform can be really helpful.

I hope I could actually answer your question in a satisfactory way.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7fw5z8ux4gtrqe3v', 'title': 'How did Exnova reviews help you out with your process of choosing a broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.577, 'ai': 0.423}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""It's a long story for me.

You can utilize the live chat, there is an option for traders' sentiment on the platform, so you can see where people are betting their money on, and you can display community live deals, so you can literally see the money in action, flowing.\n\n- I can say that broker could be ideal for beginners who are just trying things out and low budget traders who do not have a lot of money to put in every single order. The minimum deal size starts at one dollar. Which can be a huge positive for those kind of traders.\n\n- Other smart features of the trading platform include price movement alerts, the smart newsfeed and the properly designed economic calendar, which, if you know what you are doing, you can use it in your favor greatly.\n\nAll in all, apart from what's been said about the broker in the reviews, which, help traders a lot to realize what the broker has to offer to its traders,, all positive features I put a good emphasize on above also help people to gain a good understanding of how proper and reliable this broker is.\n\nThis has been an exciting journey overall to discover this broker, even though I haven't been able to get a full grip on what's on the table, I am sure with enough time and usage, I will get the full comprehension of the complete spectrum of features this broker can offer to me. But, coming back to your question, in terms of if and how the reviews helped me: they definitely help you with a lot of things that you would not normally discover this broker. So, it can be said, that reading reviews about a broker before and while you are doing business on the platform can be really helpful.\n\nI hope I could actually answer your question in a satisfactory way."", 'result': {'fake': 0.0263, 'real': 0.9737}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 10, 'credits': 1980893, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""It's a long story for me. So better fasten your seat belts.\n\nIt's nice to be in the pursuit of new and challenging opportunities, whether it is a new market or an asset type that you are not expert on, or a new broker that could give you better perspectives, education or features that you could easily draw on in your favor on global financial markets.\n\nI did not know about Exnova back then, and when I finally heard about it for the first time, I decided to research the company, and my process obviously included reading a lot of Exnova reviews as well.\n\nAs far as the reviews go, the company was all fine with decent trading conditions, preferable ecosystem, reliability, transparent regulatory situation, quick to deposit and withdraw, easy to use and get accustomed to, dynamic and exciting.\n\nBut I did not dive straight in, I took things a bit slow, analyzed the company a bit further, its features, its website, what people say about it. Then I registered for a demo account and instantly got $10,000 in virtual currency to completely try out the demo account. It was quite a good experience, the platform worked well and experienced my trades flawlessly, found the assets I liked to trade and know about. So I went over the features, and I was ready enough to try the platform with my own real money at stake.\n\nWhen you first start looking at any platform, you usually would like to see what the broker has to offer to its traders. I found free tutorials in video form, instructions on how to use the platform thoroughly step-by-step, a lot of charts, visualizations and great looking charts to help me out.\n\nSo I started trading here with the input I gathered about the broker and the trading experience of other people in my mind. And people shared their experience about pretty much every aspect of the broker there is. Starting from how the platform is powerful and glitch-free even the most volatile times in the market, how fair the trading conditions are, how the interface is clear, how the choice of assets are a handful and there are more than enough stocks and crypto assets you could easily enjoy trading, and how abundant the educational resources are.\n\nWell, after carefully reviewing the reviews themselves, and cross-checking what's been said about the broker on the platform first hand. I can enthusiastically confirm that majority of those points are on-point and accurate.\n\nThis is why you should always try to have a first-hand approach and experience in the first place after reading tons of reviews. You should confirm them for yourself, to see if this broker can be long-term for you.\n\nSo, a couple of major points for me was:\n\nThe broker fully complies with the modern regulatory protocols that are put in place to protect the investors, traders and end clients of brokers from any misbehaving of the broker. This one fully abides by it. So, you can bet your bottom dollar that your funds and hard earned money will be safe in your accounts here.\n\nIt was evident to me, that Exnova team put a great deal of time and effort into their trading platform to have it work without any problems, glitches, lags, slowdowns. The platform basically works like a clock even when the volatility goes up massively during big and significant macroeconomic announcements, during the US market open and close. This was a really important issue for me, and the broker ticked this box in a positive way.\n\nIn terms of the additional features that contribute to the reason why I chose this broker besides their reputation in the reviews and why I am thinking of keeping my account here, some of them would be:\n\n- The community here is quite large. And the broker allows it to use the community and their actions in your favor.

Annabel TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATION INDUSTRY,11mo,Will a stock broker make me money?,"Since nearly half of the people in the United States don't have any money in the stock market, we need to get the word out about the different ways people can invest. Most people learn about stocks from brokers, who tell them that they could make a lot of money if they invest.

A stockbroker can help you get rich, but that's not their main goal. Since they get paid per transaction, it's in their best interest to get you to sell and buy quickly so they can make the most money. But the best way to get rich is to buy and keep something for a long time.

You can trade US stocks by using the popular broker analyst 𝖵𝗂𝖼𝗍𝗈𝗋𝗂𝖺 𝖦𝗋𝖺𝖼𝖾 𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖽𝗌𝖺𝗒.

Here are the steps and requirements to begin trading stocks and profiting with the assistance of this broker:

Diversification is the key to achieving a balanced risk profile when investing.

Consider this easy illustration: if you invest your entire portfolio in one or two stocks and these companies collapse, you will likely lose your entire investment. To limit risk, you should invest in a diverse portfolio of 20 to 30 equities. You can diversify your portfolio by investing in multiple asset classes, such as bonds, currencies, and REITs, as opposed to investing solely in stocks. Consider utilising a Broker to assist you in managing your assets.

Step 1

Examine your eligibility

To begin trading investment products, you must be at least 18 years old and have been freed from bankruptcy. Determine the minimal amount of capital with which you are willing to start investing.

Step 2

Open a trading account with your preferred broker.

A trading account permits stock purchases and sales. A multitude of brokerage services and Brokers are available to investors. It should be mentioned that an individual can hold multiple trading accounts with different brokerages simultaneously. I do urge novices to deal with a seasoned Broker such as Victoria Grace Lindsay. Performing a Google search on her will yield additional information.

Step 3

Pick the stocks you wish to buy

When determining which companies to purchase, evaluate the industry, business model, management, growth indicators (share price or dividend yields), and stability (debt-to-EBITDA ratio). Does the stock in which you're considering investing match your investment style, strategy, and risk tolerance? In other words, Victoria Grace Lindsay management will make trading less stressful because she may be able to generate a substantial return on your portfolio while you monitor the trade online utilising her research and techniques.

Step 4

Make a Purchase

Provide your broker with a purchase or sale order. Before placing an order, you must choose between a market order and a limit order. Also, how long will the order be valid? Will it expire at the end of the trading day or on a particular date?

Step 5

Review portfolio on a regular basis

Short-term or long-term investments? How often will you conduct a review of your investments? Regardless of the sort of investor you are, it is essential that you regularly analyse your assets in order to make investment decisions or modify your investment strategy in reaction to market fluctuations. If you are uncertain, you should always consult a professional, such as your broker or an advisor like Victoria Grace Lindsay. Regardless of your country of residence, you can open an account with her.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h5v07dwluo1gbekq', 'title': 'Will a stock broker make me money?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Since nearly half of the people in the United States don't have any money in the stock market, we need to get the word out about the different ways people can invest.

Priyanka Kapoor,7mo,What is the best broker app?,"When it comes to choosing the best broker app, it's important to consider the two types of brokers available: full-service brokers and discount brokers. Both types have their own apps for trading convenience.

I have used Groww and m.Stock personally, however I find m.Stock to be my preferred choice for several reasons.

m.Stock's user-friendly interface is a delight to use. It's intuitive and well-organized, making trading and managing investments a breeze. The platform's design has simplified my trading experience and allowed me to focus on making informed decisions. Overall, it has been a positive and seamless experience trading with m.Stock.

m.Stock stands out with its zero-brokerage offering across all products like delivery, intraday, etc at a one-time fee of Rs. 999, which can result in significant cost savings for traders. On the other hand, Groww charges brokerage fee of Rs. 20 or 0.05% (whichever is lower) for equity delivery and intraday trades, which may impact overall profitability.

m.Stock also has the benefit of MTF. They offer the market's lowest interest rate starting from 6.99%, allowing traders to leverage their transactions and potentially increase their returns. This feature provides flexibility and can help traders enhance their trading strategy. Groww, on the other hand, does not provide this functionality.

Both apps offer portfolio tracking tools for monitoring investment performance in real-time, which aids in making informed decisions. However, m.Stock's app is known for its user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable trading experience.

Real-time market data is accessible in both apps, providing users with up-to-date information for making well-informed trading decisions. Traders can access up-to-date information on stock prices, market trends, and news, enabling them to make informed investment decisions.

Lastly, m.Stock emphasizes a quick and hassle-free account opening process, allowing traders to start trading promptly. This streamlined approach adds convenience and efficiency for users.

Considering these factors, I personally believe that m.Stock is the best broker app choice. Its zero brokerage, Margin Trading Facility, user-friendly interface, real-time market data, and hassle-free account opening process make it an attractive option for traders seeking a comprehensive and cost-effective trading experience.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/l3k1ng7au6yetbov', 'title': 'What is the best broker app?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""When it comes to choosing the best broker app, it's important to consider the two types of brokers available: full-service brokers and discount brokers.

Lillian Marks,9mo,What can I gain from reading the fxpro reviews even when I know that the broker is reliable?,"If you're already convinced that FxPro is a reliable broker, you might be wondering what the point of reading reviews is. However, there are still several benefits to taking the time to read reviews from other traders. We will get into that right away.

Actually, before that, I want to agree with you that FxPro is just amazing, and the broker checks all the right boxes. The broker does the most in this industry for its clients, really. But let's get right to it. Why should you read reviews? Do they have any use once I trust the broker? Here are a few reasons why they are important.

1. Learning from Other Traders' Experiences

One of the major benefits of reading fxpro reviews is that it can provide valuable insight into the experiences of other traders. By reading reviews, you can learn about the pros and cons of trading with FxPro, as well as any common issues that other traders have faced.

2. Finding New Trading Strategies

Another benefit of reading FxPro reviews is that they may mention specific trading strategies or tools that have been successful for other traders. By reading these reviews, you can gain new insights into trading and learn how to improve your own trading skills. For example, a review may highlight a trading strategy that has been successful for many traders or a tool that has been helpful in managing risk. By incorporating these strategies and tools into your own trading routine, you may be able to improve your trading performance and achieve better results.

3. Staying Up-to-Date with Changes

Even if you've been trading with FxPro for a while, the broker may make changes to their platform, fees, or policies. Reviews can help you stay up-to-date with any changes that may affect your trading experience. By reading reviews, you can stay ahead of changes such as new trading platforms, updated policies, or changes to fees. This can help you adjust your trading strategy and be prepared for any potential impact on your trades.

4. Identifying Red Flags

While FxPro is a reliable broker, there may be some negative reviews that mention red flags or warning signs. By reading these reviews, you can be more aware of potential issues and take steps to protect your investments. For instance, a negative review may mention that FxPro has a slow customer support response time or that there have been issues with withdrawals. By being aware of these potential issues, you can take steps to mitigate any risks and protect your investments.

5. Comparing FxPro to Other Brokers

Reading FxPro reviews can also help you compare the broker to others in the market.

This can help you feel more connected to the trading community and can provide a source of motivation and inspiration. In addition to this, being part of a trading community can help you learn from other traders and gain insights into trading that you may not have discovered on your own.

7. Gaining Confidence

Ensure that your broker provides both online as well as offline support, it should also have advanced features for traders, because eventually you might want to get into trading. Also, choose a broker who’s known for research & advisory and someone who provides excellent customer support because these things will become vital when you need help with your investment decisions.

Gleb Solovyov,1y,Do you have an experience working with or just have something interesting to say about tixee broker services?,"It’s not necessary to work with tixee to understand that it’s a solid forex broker. It’s enough to look at its website and trading conditions.

First of all, tixee broker deserve a lot of credit for the transparency of the website. All the crucial information is placed on the site, I mean the info about regulations.

There are three jurisdictions that supervise the broker: CySEC, FSA and FSCA. All of them have the license numbers, for potential tixee clients to check if the licenses are viable.

It’s a great approach from the broker’s side, I must say, that shows the overall attitude of the company towards the customers. It makes you trust the broker right off the bat.

On top of that all these licenses that tixee obtained, also add to the reliability of the broker. As far as I know, these authorities imply compensation funds in case the company faces financial hardships.

I write so much about the regulations because the credibility of the broker is a cornerstone, when it comes to trading. The company can have the best conditions ever, however if there is no confidence in the broker, then the trading process won’t come easy.

And on the contrary, if I, as a trader, have full trust in my broker, then I can relax and focus on just my trading routine. It makes a difference for sure.

Unfortunately, traders learn such things the hard way. In the beginning they submit with some questionable brokers that offer appealing conditions. But in the end they end up with reliable companies, like tixee, just because the peace of mind is much more important.

Also, one of the distinguishing traits of tixee broker is the large number of trading platforms. The broker decided not only to provide Metatrader 4 and 5 platforms to the clients. But the company chose to develop their own, proprietary platforms.

Tixee custom platform is available in various versions.

There is a commonly used web platform of tixee broker, as well as Simple Trader. Simple Trader is a platform that is easy-to-use, supposedly suitable for beginners of the forex market.

Sometimes Metatrader platforms can be quite complicated to master, especially for newbies. But tixee Simple Trader has a very intuitive and sleek design that is much more accessible for rookies.

It is definitely the platform that every tixee client has to try at least once. Even if they are not going to trade on it on a regular basis.

Tixee has a special platform for social trading too. It is titled tixee Social Trading. For those who are not familiar with social trading, it’s the feature that allows tixee clients to choose the desired trading method from the particular trader.

In a nutshell, you monitor the traders that present their trading strategies for everyone to see. And if you like what you see, you just copy the deals from their account getting the profits from it.

The cool thing is that it can work both ways, meaning that you can be a strategy provider too. It will allow you to earn up to 20% from the profits of other accounts.

Tixee social trading is an amazing opportunity to extend your trading results, without depositing substantial amounts of money. It’s a win-win situation for both parties. Strategy followers get profits without the stress of manual trading; and strategy providers increase his income dramatically.

There are also some additional tools that tixee offers to its clients, that boost up the market awareness of traders. I’m talking predominantly about the analytics and news section of the broker.

The company has a feature called tixee Live! among other things. Basically, it’s where the broker’s expert is talking about different things related to the market. Whether it’s an analysis about the current state of the financial system; or the explaining of the basic knowledge of the forex market.

It’s convenient that everything goes to tixee Youtube channel, so that you can go at any time and watch the video that you missed.

All in all, tixee broker has a great analytical section, where various news and market insights are available for the clients.

Jamie Janssen,11mo,How much can IronFX brokers earn in a year?,"Wow, there Quora questions become weirder and weirder.

I wonder why you would like to know about the financial state of the IronFX broker? Does it somehow affect the decision of making an account here? Or maybe it influences the decision on whether you stay here or not?

In any case we can elaborate on this topic a little bit, since you’ve already asked this question.

First up, we have to define the sources of income the forex brokers have. One of the primary sources of income of forex brokers is the commissions and spreads. Sometimes it’s just one of those, either commissions, or spreads. But sometimes it’s both.

There are only two commission-based accounts at IronFX. The other five are purely spread-based.

Now, IronFX broker claims that they have 1,500,000 accounts across 180 countries globally. It is highly possible that the majority of these accounts are either inactive, or almost inactive. Meaning that they trade very small volumes inconsistently.

but even if we assume that half of these huge numbers of accounts trade on a daily basis, let’s say on average 1 trading lot.

Then with average spread
 about 1.5-2, we get the approximate number of $15 million a month and it’s a very rough calculation.

Minus the operational costs for employees and the maintenance of MT platforms, I guess the net revenue would be around 10 million USD monthly.

And again, it may be just my thoughts that have nothing to do with reality, and IronFX’s monthly profits are higher by an order of magnitude. We would never know that.

Right now I want to think about what those numbers can tell us, as traders or clients of his company.

The first thing that comes to mind is that the forex brokerage business is a lucrative sphere of activity. Although, I believe that it is, at the same time, very demanding business, in terms of professionalism. I don’t think that everyone can do it, and the entry bar is relatively high.

Oh, I almost forgot about the partnership programs, where IronFX can also gain profits. I’m speaking about Whitelabel
 partners in particular. However, I don’t think it brings a lot of revenue to the broker.

For us, traders, the most crucial information from this is that it is not profitable for the IronFX broker to scam its customers. As nowadays, in the internet era the risk of losing the reputation is always tangible and as a result of this the losing a big part of its revenue. It is simply not worth it.

I assume this question was asked to understand the whole situation with the broker’s revenue to assess the financial security of the broker in the first place. Since the majority of traders enter the forex market with a preconceived notion that 99% of forex brokers are scammers that make their profits purely from expropriating the clients’ funds.

Yet, according to our calculations it’s far from the truth, mildly speaking. And I remind you that it was a very approximate estimation. In reality, IronFX broker can earn much bigger by incentivizing them to trade actively intraday. As far as I can tell, the majority of STP/ECN and Live floating spreads accounts are suitable for that.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3p1rh0mktz4ud5x6', 'title': 'How much can IronFX brokers earn in a year?', 'score': {'original': 0.48445, 'ai': 0.51555}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Wow, there Quora questions become weirder and weirder.\n\nI wonder why you would like to know about the financial state of the IronFX broker?

Patrik Slavichek,Nov 5,What do you think about the overall trading ecosystem and infrastructure of the FxPro broker?,"For a broker of the scale of Fxpro, this is a really well-structured question. For this type of broker, it is correct to talk about the entire trading infrastructure, and not only about certain trading conditions or types of accounts.

Of course, trading conditions are also important, especially when they play the biggest role in deciding whether a certain broker suits us or not. But the more experienced among us, when evaluating the conditions for trading with a particular broker, also pay attention to the infrastructure and the overall ecosystem that that broker owns or offers. They understand very well what makes a broker to have fast execution, check who their liquidity providers are, but also check what else is included in their ecosystem that could contribute to a better trading experience.

Let's try together to review and evaluate the infrastructure and ecosystem of the FxPro broker.

First of all, we must admit that FxPro is a top-tier broker. But what makes FxPro what it is? Two things come to my mind first. With the spread of the company around the world, there is almost no country where they do not offer their services, and thus the number of clients they have, that is, the number of traders who choose FxPro as their trading platform. The second thing is the impressive regulation. They possess multiple regulations, including from the most reputable financial institutions, which allows them to offer their services in multiple jurisdictions. Although these two things could be linked, robust regulation and the number of countries and customers, it is not achieved overnight. FxPro has been in business for many years and has gradually built the reputation of a reliable partner, to be what they are today.

In order to offer quality services to such a large number of customers, a serious and advanced trade infrastructure is undoubtedly required.

This is especially important to maintain a reputation as a trusted partner. With certain attractive trading services or products, a broker can attract a certain number of new clients in the short term, but if it has a weak infrastructure that cannot respond to the number of transactions per second or the number of clients attached to the platform at the same time, they will not tolerate crashed systems, execution delays, etc. Clients will simply go away, as they came.

However, a huge number of clients remain trading with this broker. That's proof in itself that FxPro had an excellent infrastructure that could handle the huge number of clients or transactions per second.

While writing this comment, I have opened the official website of FxPro and found an interesting data: on average up to 7,000 orders are executed per second, and the record is 199,397 orders filled in a single day! These are impressive numbers! Only a few brokers in the world, including FxPro, have systems that can process such a large number of transactions per second.

But where and how are the transactions carried out?

FxPro has one of the most advanced data centres - Equinix in LD4 London. The servers are co-located and interconnected with Tier 1 banks that provide liquidity through their proprietary Quotix aggregator. In simple words, they have a modern data centre and advanced servers connected to the servers of the largest liquidity providers, which enables the fastest possible communication between them.

Moreover, something else is worth noting in this context. FxPro has managed to create its own execution model thanks to the large number of clients and transactions. Thanks to this, the broker has the ability to respond internally to a large proportion of transactions. This means that if you open a position, if at the same second, there is another client of this broker who closes a position, the transaction takes place between you, without any outside intervention.
I hope I managed to capture what kind of advanced system and infrastructure it is. They developed a system and base for years and when they reached the level of having thousands of transactions per second, they created an execution model that benefits both the broker and even more so their clients.

Finally, let's talk about the FxPro ecosystem.

If we talk about trading software, they have a really advanced platform of their own, but in addition, they also offer the three I would say the most popular and used platforms - MT4, MT5, and cTrader. There is a choice for everyone's taste and style. Almost nothing is missing from tools and charting solutions, too.

But what makes it special and unique is its proprietary FxPro wallet. Having your wallet is a great advantage for any broker. It reduces the costs of transfers between accounts, but also represents an excellent tool for further development. I recently discovered that the company behind FxPro is expanding its services into the banking sector, i.e. the rapidly developing neobank sector. Great news, which confirms that the company continues to develop and will be a leader in offering brokerage and possibly a wider range of services for a long time.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/239l0hudmjzn7y5w', 'title': 'What do you think about the overall trading ecosystem and infrastructure of the FxPro broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.04945, 'ai': 0.95055}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""For a broker of the scale of Fxpro, this is a really well-structured question.

Bine Majcen,Dec 11,What kind of features and advantages of HFM.com broker can you emphasize that stand out?,"As a current client, I can say that there is a lot to pay attention to. However, it's a very vague topic to discuss on cuz we have to understand that there are traders who have experience in this sphere, and certain advantages of the HFM broker can be considered by them as something ordinary, I'd say, mundane.
Others who only start in this business can find something new without a doubt.

Let's consider on this topic on behalf of completely new traders or those who haven't acquired a broad expertise in the field yet, huh?

Indisputably, the possibility of copying trades on the platform can seem like something really new to them cause the majority of new traders are aware only of manual trading. Consequently, it can potentially become something that will grab their attention. HFCopy service has certain characteristics:
- Opportunity to follow more than 1 strategy provider;
- Access to the full control and monitoring of your trades with the possibility to set up required settings;
- Everything is done autonomously, without any need to open/close trades;
- As a cherry on the top - straightforward instruction on how to delve into copytrading, as well as non-intricate steps to fulfill.
These are the most significant things about copytrading here. Still, getting back to advanced traders, I haven't mentioned rather high payouts, paid bi-weekly, and the opportunity to recommend yourself as a reliable strategy provider.

Think of other functions on the platform, and then I would draw your attention to their bonus system, so-called Promotions. This is also considered to be something that magnetizes rookies cause they tend to enter the market with humble sums, especially if it boils down to the broker they see first in life. Bonuses potentially affect the margin increase. Thus, they will be able to operate bigger volumes. ""Boost your trading"" bonus offers up to 20% of additional margin depending on your top-up size. It seems to be a pretty enticing venture.

Additionally, like many other guys in this thread, I would focus on their educational section, the so-called hub, which is extremely important for beginning traders who are only about to make their first steps in the market. And, it's worth mentioning side tools such as autochartist, VPS hosting, all sorts of calculators and so on. But, to my mind, it refers more to those who have experience.
Contemplating on the education and actually being a consumer of these materials here, I'd advise paying attention to online trading courses that are aimed at training skills in different realms of trading. For instance, there are courses for beginning traders, intermediate and advanced ones, but also there are narrow-aimed courses about commodities & futures trading specifics, as well as about other ""pairs"" of assets.

Maybe it's time to warp it up? I presume I have shared enough information about different specifics that potentially stand out from the crowd in case we are talking about the HFM broker. I hope this answer will come in handy for you. If you are a beginning trader, then it will definitely be helpful.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q45e7lpazcibv8o1', 'title': 'What kind of features and advantages of HFM.com broker can you emphasize that stand out?', 'score': {'original': 0.39335, 'ai': 0.60665}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'As a current client, I can say that there is a lot to pay attention to.

Williams Brooker,Updated 1y,"I live in the UK, where can I find a good stock broker to invest my money for me?","There are many high-quality Online Brokerage firms in the UK.

Brightwire Loans,Jan 25,How can I find a company in NJ to physically hold mortgage brokers’ documents from an out-of-state broker?,"To find a company in New Jersey that can physically hold mortgage brokers' documents from an out-of-state broker, you should be aware of certain regulations and requirements. According to New Jersey's administrative code (N.J. Admin. Code § 3:15-6.3), a business licensee, such as a mortgage lender or broker, needs to notify the Department of Banking and Insurance about the location where its business documents are kept. This includes books, records, accounts, and other related documents.

If these documents are moved, the Department needs to be informed prior to the move. Additionally, a business licensee may keep records at a licensed office in New Jersey, an unlicensed site either in or out of the state (with prior approval), or a licensed office outside New Jersey (also with prior approval). The approval to keep records at a site outside of a licensed office involves an agreement with the Department, which covers maintenance and production of records at that site.

For a residential mortgage broker in New Jersey, specific requirements apply. These include having a surety bond, an unqualified, audited financial statement, and relevant documentation from the NJ Division of Revenue and County Recording Office. Additionally, each control person of the brokerage must complete a criminal history background check. The brokerage must also have a qualified individual licensee, who is an officer, director, partner, member, owner, or principal of the business entity.

Given these requirements, you might want to look into companies that specialize in document storage and management, particularly those that are familiar with the financial and legal sectors. They would be more likely to understand the regulatory requirements and have the necessary security measures to protect sensitive documents.

For further assistance and specific information on compliant document storage services, it's recommended to contact the NJ Department of Banking & Insurance directly, as they can provide guidance tailored to your specific needs and ensure that you are in compliance with state regulations.

For more information, you can refer to the New Jersey Administrative Code
 and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance

Truth Font,9mo,What do you think is more useful: FBS broker reviews or the broker’s demo account trading?,"It’s quite a bizarre question really.

I would say both of these deserve its attention from traders. And it’s counterproductive to juxtapose one to another, only if you do it for research purposes.

Anyways, let’s elaborate more on these two matters if you want to know what is more useful: FBS broker reviews or demo account.

First of all, reading reviews and trading on a demo account indeed have some things in common, for instance they give you the overall impression of the broker and the services it provides to the customers.

But after this, the similarities end. Because the knowledge that reviews of the brokers give you is incomparable to the experience of trading on a demo account. Even if the demo account is a constrained version of the live trading, we all know that.

While trading on the FBS demo account you can feel how to trade with certain leverage offered by the broker, or get the impression of orders’ execution. Ultimately, you are free to test the trading platforms if you are new to trading and haven’t got acquainted with the Metatrader platforms yet.

Another advantage of the FBS demo account is that it is completely free of charge and also risk-free for everybody.

Unlike the real accounts where you risk your hard-earned money every time you open the deal on the platform. Demo account doesn’t imply any type of risks, yet you can run your risk management plans there, or trading strategies as well.

It’s kinda valuable tool for newbies and more seasoned traders too if you know how to implement it in your trading practice.

Reviews, on the flip side, can contain some information that is not accessible on the demo account.

Let’s say payments as an example. You won’t be able to test out the deposit or withdrawal methods on the FBS demo account. Thus, it will be hard to know what payment mechanism is more appropriate for you specifically.

If you have no experience with payments at all, then you’ll learn it only by using all the payment methods one by one. I assume it’s not very convenient. Therefore, it’s good to read some broker reviews to understand what payment method to choose out of all.

Traders usually describe the pitfalls of deposits/withdrawals of forex brokers in those reviews. So that you would know what to expect from a certain method.

I would also point out the efficiency of the FBS Cent account as a great alternative to the demo account.

The thing is on the demo you exclude out of the equation one vital aspect of forex trading. The one that won’t allow you to reach mastery in this sphere - psychology of trading.

The biggest downside of risk-free trading is that there are no emotions involved, and the fear of losing money is the best teacher, as far as I’m aware.

Whereas, on the Cent account trading is not completely risk-free. It is much cheaper than on any other FBS live accounts, but eventually you still have to put your money on the line.

From my perspective it’s a perfect solution for newbies and all types of forex trading newcomers.

To conclude it’s fair to say that both FBS broker reviews and demo account trading have the right to exist. Despite their overlapping, they cover various needs of the traders, depending on the background or trading style.

The best method would be to combine the two in the most thoughtful manner.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4vn30os92cgmyphe', 'title': 'What do you think is more useful: FBS broker reviews or the broker’s demo account trading?', 'score': {'original': 0.50305, 'ai': 0.49695}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It’s quite a bizarre question really.\n\nI would say both of these deserve its attention from traders.

Emir Kort,11mo,"How can you describe iForex, a broker for investing or trading?","It is actually possible to not to associate iForex to one concept at all, so, neither an investment broker, not a trading broker.

But it is also both.

So the terms can be interchangeable here.

Because, it all depends on what you do, not what the broker does.

I will explain what I mean by that. Let's talk about the iForex broker first. And then decide.

iForex is a well-known, well-regulated, well-promotional broker. What I mean by well-promotional is that, it is also widely known that iForex offers 100% welcome bonus, which is a rare thing to find in the industry, and also a reason for the broker to chosen by many.

But it is only a one reason amongst many other reasons.

The broker offers a compact trading platform that has many features, executes well, easy to use and straightforward to understand.

As a customer, you are eligible to use a broad spectrum of payment methods to handle your deposits and withdrawals in a fast, secure and compatible way.

Another thing the broker provides is extensive educational and analytical resources. There is an education center of the platform, and many tools you can incorporate into your trading/investing framework such as the Live Rates, Economic Calendar, Live Chart, Trading Signals, Trading Sentiment, Technical Indicators, Today's Opportunity and The Trading Expert.

It is also a wide-asset broker, meaning that you can trade

+ Currencies

+ Commodities

+ Market Indices

+ Equity Shares

+ Exchange traded funds

+ Cryptocurrencies.

Now, when I say ""trade"", I mean the usual, buying or selling CFD contracts on those instruments, possibly with a predetermined level of leverage broker offers that you can utilize to amplify your returns. These CFDs tend to have a systemic characteristic, that, since you are using leverage, meaning that you are borrowing funds from the broker itself to buy with more money than you have in your account, there are a certain set of costs associated to your trade, that is automaticallty being debited or credited from and into your account.

It can be debited or credited, because all assets have their own specifications. It varies depending on the forex pair you look at, or the equity shares you are intended to trade.

However, the assets you can deal in are not limited to that. iForex also offers non-leveraged products
 for its users.

So, what are they?

As they call it, it is a unique way to invest in popular share and cryptocurrency CFDs.

With this product, what the broker does is to provide you with the opportunity to buy equity shares of some of the world's most well-known companies and most popular cryptocurrencies with no leverage at all. You buy financial securities at your own margin in a one-to-one ratio. Meaning, that when you buy a unit of one security, you own the total number of units you have purchased. Your P&L with that particular asset that you have purchased will fluctuate exactly as the asset's price action moves themselves. They will not be amplified neither to the upside, nor the downside.

Which practically can be called investing. Why?

Because you can purchase financial securities for the long run.

You will reduce your portfolio volatility, and risk to getting margin called, unexpected amplified drawdowns because your exposure is lowered. It is very rare, that an asset literally goes to zero. And if it does, it does slowly. So you will have many chances to cut your exposure or risk.

And, the overnight fees or cost of your operations that are associated with borrowing funds from your broker is absolutely and utterly neutralized. Since you have no debt to service in front of your broker.

Lastly. This means that you can hold the assets into.. well. perpetuity, or until the moment you actually want to sell and take profit.

Meanwhile, you can keep benefiting from all the tools and features that the broker provides you with.

Best thing is that, you can do the leveraged ""trading"", and non-leveraged ""investing"" operations together within the same account!

That's what I meant in the beginning of my post. The broker gives you to choice, and it is up to the trader to decide whether they want to be a trader, or an investor on this platform.

To wrap it up, this is why I said that the broker does not need to be associated to a particular label. It can be a trading broker, and it can be an investing broker. That is completely up to what you are doing with your funds on this platform. The broker has the capabilities to become both, or neither.

John Nijhar,Aug 23,"Is IronFx a favorable broker, and if so why?","""IronFX is the award-winning Global Leader in Online Trading, with 10 trading platforms and more than 500 tradable instruments in forex, spot metals, futures, shares, spot indices and commodities. Founded in 2010, IronFX serves retail and institutional customers from over 180 countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.""

Here's what I found from their official statement.

But what we should to is to take a step further and do a deep dive into what IronFx offers and verify if it is a favorable broker or not.

But how do we determine if a broker is legit, favorable and a good option to trade on?

Usually what happens is, there are key elements we need to check for presence and operability to understand what kind of standards we are looking at. These are basic and fundamental things like:

A) Legitimacy

1. Regulation and Licensing

2. Reputation

3. Broker's history and possible awards they have won

4. Safety and Security Protocols

B) Inner works

1. Costs associated to trade with this broker

2. Account types

3. Trading platfotm softwares available

4. Asset Inventory

5. Leverage

6. Tools and Instruments

7. Deposit and Withdrawal Methods Available

8. Educational Resources

9. Customer Service

10. Demo account

11. Anything additional

This is not the most extensive list out there, but it is similar to foolproof. If a broker checks all or majority of these boxes, it follows that it is most likely to be quite a favorable trading platform by a vast majority of traders out there.

So what do we think of IronFx in that sense?

First of all, IronFx is a legit broker. It has all the legal documentation in place, readily available and publicly shared on their website. You can go and check that out anytime you want. There's a lot of talk on the street about them which feeds into their reputation. I mean active platforms and crowded discussions about them online. You can find them on Quora, on other venues where people discuss brokers, forums, etc. Overall reputation of them is positive, but i'll leave the task to you to dig in, I am not ready to lay out everything that is being said about them in this post. That's just too much work for one person :))

In terms of the international recognitions and awards they have won, they have TONS. There's a whole section on their website devoted to the awards they have been winning since the year 2011. And since 2013, they have been awarded consistently.

What have they been awarded for? Lots of reasons.

We are talking about being best educational broker, best multi-asset broker, best CFD provider, most outstanding online trading partners program, forex operator of the year, best online forex trading platform, broker of the year, Leading Online Trading Solutions Provider of the Year.

Hard to miss those when they have awards in tons of categories going on.

IronFx is also a safe broker. All client data is guarded under SSL data encryption technology, which ensures that nothing gets stolen through the instrumentality of the latest and most reliable industry standards available in this sphere.

So that's what it looks like from the outside. Let's have a look at what it looks from the inside, right?

Now, IronFx offers various account types for traders with different trading timeframes and styles in two main categories

Live Floating/Live Fixed Spreads

Straight-Through Processon/Electronic Communication Network Accounts

In the first category, IronFx offers Standard, Premium, VIP and Live Zero Fixed Spread accounts.

In the second category, you will find No Commission, Zero Spread and Absolute Zero accounts.

Just to give a little bit color on what you can expect from those accounts in terms of trading costs associated with your positional execution,

In the standard accound, spreads are floating from 1.6, and fixed to 2 pips. There is no commissions.

In the zero spread account, spreads are from zero pips, there's a commission for trades.

In the absolute zero account, there are no commissions and spreads are from zero pips.

Leverage levels are flexible, and ranges across the account types. They can be 200, 500 or up to 1000 depending on your account type of choosing.

In terms of the trading platforms you can choose whilst you're on Ironfx, you have all the flexibility. You can go for MetaTrader 4, Web Trader, Mobile Application, Web Application.

Not only that, but you can have access to Virtual Private Server, Personal Multi Account Manager and TradeCopier, effectively increasing your possibilities based on your trading style.

IronFx offers about five hundred tradable financial instruments across six broad asset classes, as we discussed, all with flexible leverage.

There are tons of trading instruments and charting tools available for your analyses on assets on every single platform of theirs.

In terms of additional trading instruments; you will have access to autotrading tool, trading widgets, trading central, and we could possibly count tradecopier here as well as an additional tool to access.

Now, in terms of the education, you will have access to exceptional information like trading videos, financial news, podcasts, seminars, webinars, market trends, there is a whole academy ironFx on education, which includes special courses, webinars, ebooks, glossaries.

There is also a VIP trading room offered by ironfx, which has 5 different account tiers, and based on your account tiers, you can have access to dealing desk prop traders, interact with them directly, weekly private group calls, access to chief traders, free vps access, and priority support. All the more for supporting traders with data-driven analyses.

Lastly, IronFx offers a dedicated customer support concept, available 24/5 in thirty different languages. You will not be left hanging.

In the light of all this information I have just shared with you, the final verdict is that, yes, IronFx is favorable.

I hope this information should be enough.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/c7zlbux2sjqdmwo8', 'title': 'Is IronFx a favorable broker, and if so why?', 'score': {'original': 0.27165, 'ai': 0.72835}, 'blocks': [{'text': '""IronFX is the award-winning Global Leader in Online Trading, with 10 trading platforms and more than 500 tradable instruments in forex, spot metals, futures, shares, spot indices and commodities.

Dan Blokhin,10mo,How reliable is AAFX trading broker in general?,"In general, AAFX Trading broker is pretty reliable. Of course reliability is a thing that can be assessed only over time. Sometimes you see a broker that looks quite safe and credible. But the fact of the matter is that you never know the broker 100%, so you can’t trust it 100% either.

The reliability of the broker consists of several things that must be mentioned.

1. Regulation and licenses.

AAFX broker has the license of FSA regulator which is decent. Not the best, but I don’t think it may raise some worries.

Although it’s an offshore regulator, they can also be good and reliable. At this point it’s quite unreasonable to claim that all offshore regulated forex brokers are basically scammers, they are not.

I think if you trade long enough on this market, you definitely know someone, or maybe traded yourself with an offshore forex broker that was completely honorable in every aspect.

You have to consider all the variables in the equation to understand if the broker is trustworthy or not.

2. History of the broker which is the next one.

It is obvious that the amount of years the company provides its services affects directly on the reliability of it. It shows how the given company reacts to the shocks that occur regularly on the financial market.

The majority of traders, those who have substantial experience in particular, have this preconceived notion about the forex brokers with more than 10 years of market presence. They think that these brokers have the highest reliability score among all the others that don’t have such a noticeable background.

Well, I don’t know if it’s true, but the big number of years on the market definitely gives some kind of confidence.

AAFX broker was established in 2010 as far as I know. So we can say with certainty that its brokerage background tells us about the high level of safety.

At least the possibility of the broker going insolvent or making some questionable actions against its clients tends towards zero.

3. Safety measures.

AAFX as a credible and secure broker makes a lot of effort to achieve the maximum safety of clients’ funds. Along with the standard segregation of funds which ensures that the clients’ funds won’t be abused by the company. These funds are deposited in the renowned and credible banks only.

Additionally, all the payment operations are performed with the SSL security. Plus, the risk management system of the broker is completely autonomous. Which means no human factor involved. And where there is no human factor, there is less room for errors.

4. KYC & AML
.

For those who don’t know what these fancy abbreviations stand for I’ll explain. During the registration process you have to verify your identity by uploading some documents in your personal area. It is done not to annoy you, but to get the full impression about you as a client to avoid some money laundering on the one hand. On the other hand these requirements make your account more protected from the hacks and compromises.

Because the last thing you want is your account to be hacked and your money gone. Although it’s not that simple to withdraw money even if someone hijacks your account. Brokers like AAFX have the rule of using the same payment mechanism for withdrawals as you used for deposits. Or at the very least you need to verify the payment method too. This rule is quite inconvenient at first, but with time you realize that safety is more preferable than convenience.

5. Global presence.

AAFX is a true global broker. It has registration in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and in Malaysia. In addition to this, the broker has an offline office in Hong Kong. Offline office gives this company a different status, simply because the majority of the forex entities don’t have such a thing.

It’s good to know that all the clients can visit this office once they turn out to be in Hong Kong.

Chan Lee,11mo,What do you think about the overall trading ecosystem and infrastructure of the FxPro broker?,"I'd say that FxPro broker has certainly a trader-friendly ecosystem and provides offers client-oriented services around a solid, reputable and robust infrastructure.

They don't force any kind of specific account type to choose, a particular asset class to trade, a trading platform software to use. They leave the choice up to you.

What they do is, they create the product, the service, the opportunity to choose, the variety in anything that is choosable. And then they respect the trader's free will and choice to trade in any way they like.

This is what I am talking about when I say things like being trader-friendly and client-oriented.

I am sure people who will read these can make their own comparison, I am not here to do that, but, all I can say is that, resource-wise, FxPro offers a large volume of abundance and variety.

We don't even have to talk about these trading platforms, their advantages, how they compare against each other. The key take-away message here is that FxPro offers all the platforms you see there. And it is up to you to pick based on your preferences, experieneces and own liking.

Another thing I would say is the additional features, that the broker does not have to offer but it still does. What I mean by that is the supportive tools, educational material, extra safety measures to protect the traders from something happening to their data and funds, the investment broker makes to its own name to increase the reliability and reputability of the platform, and therefore, the traders who choose this platform.

In terms of the trade execution, FxPro does not just make the necessary integration with those trading platform softwares and stop there, it invests in its liquidity, its execution model, its data centers, it makes the effort and investment to try to be the best at what they do.

One last thing I would mention is the Customer Support. Offering such a wide range of tools, assets, platforms will of course bring the need of getting help from the side of the traders who will effectively be the end customers of this product and service. They will have questions, they will need guidelines, they will need to get assistance. FxPro also tries to do their best here. If you check various websites and venues where people can directly ask questions, leave their remarks and reviews, and the official representatives actively pick them up, and try to resolve them if they need assistance, try to guide them if they seem to be lost at some point, and appreciate their kind words if they have had a good experience with the platform.

Stefan Kennedy,1y,What do you think about the overall trading ecosystem and infrastructure of the FxPro broker?,"Let me very shortly answer your question. It is a highly developed and a dynamic one, equipped with and supported by cutting edge technologies.

I don't think that is going to cut it though, so let me expand what I mean a little bit.

Arguably, The FxPro broker is a very popular trading platform, widely known amongst retail traders and institutional traders. They provide their services to very large numbers of market participants every single day.

FxPro's infrastructure and the execution policy have been awarded by many rating platforms across categories such as Forex, and CFDs.

FxPro's ecosystem of trading engines and infrastructure of execution is slightly different to what you might have been hearing and seeing from different brokers on the market. I will explain.

FxPro labels itself as an NDD (No Dealing Desk) broker, and states that it offers superior execution and trading conditions. Which is slightly unusual, because, even though the execution policy of the Electronic Communication Network (ECN), the broker is not completely ECN. And even though the company uses Sraight-Through-Processing technologies, it is not completely a STP broker either.

So, it is located in a position where it just takes the best of both worlds and combines the favorable trading conditions in a transparent and very fast way.

First of all, FxPro has many clients worldwide, and some of them are really big clients, this results in a situation where FxPro's internal orderbook in and of itself has very deep levels of liquidity. This is why, a big part of the clients' trades at FxPro are matched within the order flow on FxPro's platform. They are not interfered or intervened, but matched.

As a result of this execution policy, according to the last year's statistics, around 75% of the trades were matched at quote, meaning, precisely at the desired price. And almost 12% of the orders were matched with a positive slippage, meaning, that traders were able to get a better price than they asked for.

With more than 98% of all trades getting absolutely no requotes at FxPro's trading platform, traders can make sure that they get what they see on their screens. They don't have to settle anything less than that.

FxPro also cares a lot about the latency and fast connection for their servers, their order book and execution engines are located in data centers in London, and they care highly connected with the first tier banks who provide liquidity to FxPro's orderbook. This results with traders that are executed with an average latency of less than 13 miliseconds.

Overall, it can be said that what we have here is a tech-driven, abundantly developed ecosystem and a very professional infrastructure for traders of the platform.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fz05bsntvgiwy7l2', 'title': 'What do you think about the overall trading ecosystem and infrastructure of the FxPro broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Let me very shortly answer your question.

Oleg Bespalov,1y,Is IQ Option the best broker for binary options?,"I think we should look at this question from a broad perspective to see if IQ Option is a good broker that I would recommend or not.

Because the term ""The Best"" in any realm or industry is kind of a tricky one. Certainly, there are just so many measures that you can measure something or someone, whether it is an individual human being, a company or a service.

Let's try to figure out if IQ Option is a good enough broker to open up an account for any reason.

When I try to filter brokers and compare them to each other, I always try to get as much data as possible. Nowadays, in our modern times, every broker out there is trying to do something differently or slighly better to gain competitive advantage over their competitors in the industry. And rightly so. Trading has become a very competitive industry, and I find it really good that there is a healthy competition between companies to offer highest quality services possible to traders from all countries in the world.

I am going to try and lay out my mental model and break out the important aspects, from which I tend to judge brokers. I am then going to put the building blocks together to form an overall opinion about the company, with regards to your question. Let's have a look at the following parameters:

1- Regulation. It is very important for the broker to comply with the rules of well-known regulatory authority in a reputable jurisdiction. A broker which is not following certain rules, does not have security protocols and practices in place, and is not held accountable for any wrongdoing is not a good broker for me. IQ Option passes this test properly by being regulated, having good practices in place in terms of security of funds and personal data of its users on the platform.

2- Reputation: IQ Option is without a doubt one of the most popular trading platforms and brokers online. It is very significant to check more than just one source to see what people think about this company. You can conduct the research for yourself as well, but, to me, I think the broker has very positive reviews all over the web and a lot of people seem to have a good experience with this company. So we can tick this box as well.

3- The Platform and Features: We all now have so many options when it comes to this. This is why we should always dig deep and try to get the best platform and features possible from the brokers' side. IQ Option has a very intuitive, straightforward, properly designed trading platform and tons of good quality features, details, very versatile charting engine and a great number of charting tools, helping traders to benefit from them like add-ons in their trading operations. I personally like the platform, how its designed, how it works and executes the positions. Judging by the number of people using the platform and arriving at a conclusion, that the platform executes literally millions of positions daily, I don't think it would be erronous to say that the infrastructure behind the trading engine, the orderbook, the liquidity; the whole system operates very good.

4- Trading Costs: It is always frustrating to deal with hidden costs, and higher than necessary outlays at any platform. Because they eat away your margin. In this regard, IQ Option has a transparent and reasonable outlay structure, which can be classified as cost-effective. Always nice to have your broker on your side in this regard.

5- Customer Support: IQ Option has a reactive, fast, responsive and attentive customer support team with multilinguistic abilities to help out a great number of customers from all corners of the world. Having someone in front of you who can talk to when you have an issue makes you feel valued and cared about. So, I never overlook this regard either.

Overall, based on the parameters I checked, I can easily say that IQ Option is actually a great platform to trade on. If you can make your ""best"" trades there and get really profitable using the features of the platform, it can easily be ""the best"" platform for you.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/s086djb2laekw5x9', 'title': 'Is IQ Option the best broker for binary options?', 'score': {'original': 0.38635, 'ai': 0.61365}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think we should look at this question from a broad perspective to see if IQ Option is a good broker that I would recommend or not.\n\nBecause the term ""The Best"" in any realm or industry is kind of a tricky one.

Wendel Schneider,1y,Is IQoption trustworthy and a good broker?,"I assume I also should share my two cents here in general about IQ Options.

In an attempt to get a good feeling and a comprehensive understanding about a broker, you cannot simply just look at the broker from one angle or perspective. I suppose, it would be better if you had a multi-layered and more consolidated approach, encompassing many aspects of what kind of a broker is, what sort of an operation they are running, so on and so forth.

This is why, I would suggest doing the same here and putting the given institution under the same scrutiny and microscope. And those aspects would be the ones of high significance, such as:

a) Reliability, Legal and Regulatory Aspect

b) Cost of trading and how it compares to the competitors

c) Trading platforms, their kind and how they function

d) Features and choices you get in trading and services

e) Funding, Deposits and Withdrawals. And the options, speed, credibility of the institutions and payment processors they work

d) Customer service, and the approach they retain towards their existing clientele and new clients onboarding their platform.

If we could take a brief look at all the points belowmentioned, the picture that we get is primarily this:

IQ Options is based and regulated in Cyprus by Cysec. This is a prevalent regulatory body that takes care of a lot of the entities in the industry. So, one could probably argue that the regulatory issues, and concerns regarding the safety of funds would apply here.

With cost of trading I mean now for the positions, spreads and commissions but fees including every operation you make. IQ Option here can be considered one of the low cost trading platforms in the industry. Trading fees do not apply when opening and closing down positions, no account opening fees and no deposit fees. There are other types of fees but they are in line with what happens in the industry in general.

Broker has a good design in their trading platform, it is visually appealing, it is evident that they have put a good amount of research and effort in designing and creating this platform. No problems here.

You get educational materials, customizable charts, good mobile app, a chatroom where you can communicate with other traders in the ecosystem, trading competitions. Interactive features basically make and keep the environment active. Not to mention more than enough assets to enrich your trading experience.

With several options for depositing and withdrawals internationally, you should assume that they got your funding choices covered. There are some prevalent and well-known payment processors in the set of choices you can go with

Frankly, these days a lot of brokers make good investment in their customer support team, so people would have less problems and complaints. I do believe that IQ Option is one of them. To this point, none of my trader friends complained to me about how they approach to their clients and how willing they are to solve issues quickly.

As a conclusion of a reasoning built on the points above, I think you could say that they are a fine broker.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q3w7k52bufzjin0d', 'title': 'Is IQoption trustworthy and a good broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.35715, 'ai': 0.64285}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I assume I also should share my two cents here in general about IQ Options.\n\nIn an attempt to get a good feeling and a comprehensive understanding about a broker, you cannot simply just look at the broker from one angle or perspective.

Ferdinand Bertram,Dec 28,How can you explain to a newbie why the IronFX broker offers such a big trading Academy? Is it really in demand in the community?,"I can name two points, describing which I can most fully answer this question.
1) Why a trader needs training
2) Why a broker should train traders

- Let's start in order. On the one hand it is obvious that a trader needs training, but on the other hand it may not be so obvious for some beginners who have a wrong idea about trading.

Unfortunately, some novice traders treat trading in the financial markets as gambling. They think that in order to make a profit they only need to guess the direction of price movement. If you guess correctly, you get profit, and if you don't guess correctly, you lose money. Further everything depends on luck.
But this is a completely wrong idea. Trading can be called work. The same work as, for example, programming or a car mechanic.
In order to get a positive result you need to have some knowledge. And such knowledge is not something a person has from birth. I think it is difficult to become a programmer or a car mechanic without having any knowledge about what you do. So it is important to get some theoretical knowledge about trading and practical trading skills to trade successfully.

We can conclude that education in the field of trading is in demand in community of traders.

- Now we move on to training itself. You can find quite a lot of theoretical data about trading on the net. There are various articles and even books. Some forums contain useful tips and explain peculiarities of different types of trading.
At the same time, quality of these educational resources can be different. Some have really useful information and some give low quality advice.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of various analytics and educational articles to gain knowledge about trading.

Then why does a broker need to educate traders? What is the benefit for broker?

First of all, a broker that educates beginners is obviously attractive for beginners. Therefore, a company with such quality training as IronFX is likely to be popular among beginners.

Secondly, traders who passed quality training and received a lot of useful knowledge are likely to trade with profit. This is not a hundred percent, but the probability is quite high.
Such a trader receives more income and therefore continues to trade. In addition, the size of his deposit grows, which means that the size of positions also grows. That in turn leads to the fact that broker, receiving commissions and spreads, gets more profit together with trader.

Thirdly, such Academy is quite positive for the company's reputation.

Bottom line: broker offers such a large academy because it's beneficial not only for traders but also for the company itself. And training is in demand in community of traders. By the way, even among some experienced ones.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/n39hsfdprqwvz451', 'title': 'How can you explain to a newbie why the IronFX broker offers such a big trading Academy?

Sakit Kasumov,6mo,How reliable is AAFX trading broker in general?,"Let me write an AAFX Trading review in which I will point out everything I know about the reliability of this company. And you will be able to make your own conclusions about this company's reliability after reading my review.
Thanks to this, you will form your own opinion about the company which you will be able to trust.

It seems to me that I should start with the legal evidence of reliability and then I will list the actual means of ensuring reliability.

I realize that my review will be read not only by novice traders, but also by experienced traders who are interested in this company. Therefore, I can say with confidence that someone who reads my review knows about Regulations and Licenses that brokers have.
Some believe that such regulations are not necessary to carry out brokerage activities. And it is true. Some quite reliable companies do not have any licenses.
Therefore, the presence of a license is an additional confirmation of the company's reliability.
State bodies that issue licenses, as a rule, impose some requirements to companies that try to obtain them. Brokerage companies must meet the requirements of reliability and security, and must carry out financial activities in accordance with the rules established by the regulator.
It turns out that the company that has a license follows the regulator's rules and has the necessary level of reliability.

AAFX Trading has several licenses and regulations.

- Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
- The company is officially registered in Malaysia
- It is also registered in Hong Kong.

Thus, we can see that the company strives to carry out its brokerage activities in acordance with the reliability standards set by the rules of these regulators.

I think that traders who already have trading experience have noticed that many brokers have similar security requirements. Including requirements for opening an account. They also have some similar features of trading conditions. As a rule, it is connected with the requirements of international regulators.

Next, about reliability.
One of the most important reliability requirements is the separation of client and company funds. This broker's clients' funds are kept on separate bank accounts and are not mixed with the company's money. This ensures the safety of the clients' money even if the broker goes bankrupt.
A little more about this. If the clients' and the company's funds were in the same account, then in case of a financial problem and even bankruptcy, traders would not be able to get their money. And with split accounts traders have access to their money under any circumstances.

I wrote about money being held in bank accounts. So the question arises as to how reliable these banks are.
The answer is quite reliable. Clients' money is deposited in several banks at once. These banks are reliable and reputable. As far as I know these are European banks that have a solid reputation.

Next confirmation of the company's reliability is the way the broker has organized its activity and how its services work.
The company uses proven technologies. And the work of services is built in acordance with the rules described in internal legal documents.
By the way, these documents also confirm the opinion about the reliability of this broker.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/04v5qht93z2yaicm', 'title': 'How reliable is AAFX trading broker in general?', 'score': {'original': 0.7948, 'ai': 0.2052}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Let me write an AAFX Trading review in which I will point out everything I know about the reliability of this company.

Including requirements for opening an account. They also have some similar features of trading conditions. As a rule, it is connected with the requirements of international regulators.\n\nNext, about reliability.\nOne of the most important reliability requirements is the separation of client and company funds. This broker's clients' funds are kept on separate bank accounts and are not mixed with the company's money. This ensures the safety of the clients' money even if the broker goes bankrupt.\nA little more about this. If the clients' and the company's funds were in the same account, then in case of a financial problem and even bankruptcy, traders would not be able to get their money. And with split accounts traders have access to their money under any circumstances.\n\nI wrote about money being held in bank accounts. So the question arises as to how reliable these banks are.\nThe answer is quite reliable. Clients' money is deposited in several banks at once. These banks are reliable and reputable. As far as I know these are European banks that have a solid reputation.\n\nNext confirmation of the company's reliability is the way the broker has organized its activity and how its services work.\nThe company uses proven technologies. And the work of services is built in acordance with the rules described in internal legal documents.\nBy the way, these documents also confirm the opinion about the reliability of this broker."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.7948

Derek Russell,Dec 19,What are the most liquid assets with the Activtrades broker?,"I know what you're thinking.

If we're talking about liquidity, you probably thought about EURUSD immediately, then probably GBPUSD, then probably USDJPY, GBPEUR, EURCHF, AUDUSD, USDCAD any few others. These are major forex pairs and there are trilions of dollars worth of liquidity in the forex markets for them every single day.

Then what you would probably say is the indices of the stock market out of the United States.

Well. That's more or less true, but that is not the whole case.

Now, liquidity is surely paramount for an effective and seamless trading in public and fair markets. You need buyers and you need sellers, then you need transactions at the fair market price and around it. That is called liquidity.

And all the assets we have described above are the most popular ones, because of the same reason. Liquidity and popularity are almost interchangeable terms in this context. The more popular the asset is, the more liquidity there is going to be baked into that.

You can find all those assets on Activtrades broker platform, and then some. But the thing you need to take into consideration is that, activtrades is also a very popular broker for a number of reasons. First of all, they have a lot of choices when it comes to trading platforms and assets across many classes and categories, they have favorable trading conditions and precise execution in terms of the prices you will get when you execute your trades. This broker has top tier liquidity agreements with high quality banks to ensure that your positions get executed at fair prices without error and fail, slippages, requotes and other vexing stuff like that.

What I am saying is, when you are trading on activtrades platform, assuming you are a retail trader, you probably don't have to worry about liquidity issue for any of the assets provided, available for you to trade. I am assuming that you are not turning over billions of dollars in not-so-many popular assets. The liquidity engine, internal protocols and the executional parameters of activtrades are fully operational and your trades are most probably will get executed without any liquidity problem.

But as a general rule, what I said earlier is true. The most liquid assets in financial markets are EURUSD, SPX, Gold and other stuff mentioned above. That does not mean that the remainder of assets are not liquid. They may not offer liquidity to institutional traders and maybe a hedge funds, but they do their position sizing in billions.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/39pom4inh1wdj0cr', 'title': 'What are the most liquid assets with the Activtrades broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I know what you're thinking.\n\nIf we're talking about liquidity, you probably thought about EURUSD immediately, then probably GBPUSD, then probably USDJPY, GBPEUR, EURCHF, AUDUSD, USDCAD any few others.

Vilgot Holmqvist,Aug 23,"What will be your verdict, is FBS legit, or should one avoid trading with this broker?","Let me answer the second part of your question first.

There is absolutely no single reason to avoid trading FBS. It may not be your perfect broker to choose to trade with, but there is no reason to advise anyone to avoid FBS altogether.

They are two completely different things. It is one thing to evaluate a broker whether it suits your trading style, whether it offers trading conditions that are in line with your preferences or needs, and based on that make a recommendation to others.

But to say that someone should avoid a certain broker, it needs more serious arguments and reasons, or some serious foul on the part of the company. There is no such thing related to FBS.

With that being said, you can probably guess in which direction my verdict will go.

However, I will try to be objective, in fact, I have absolutely no reasons not to be. I have some experience trading with this broker, and I have no reason to suspect that FBS is not a legitimate broker. And since you asked for a verdict on whether is FBS legit, like any other judgement, I'll try to make mine based on arguments and facts, not bare opinions or experiences.

Let's get to work.

Two things are important or fundamental when evaluating the legitimacy of a particular broker. The first is the regulation of the broker, which means that the broker has certain licences to work, respects the legal rules, and his business is regularly monitored.

The second is the broker's reputation between traders and other financial institutions or industry participants.

At the very beginning, I will repeat what I mentioned above in the text. Trading conditions are one of the most important features of a broker. But generally, they are not related to the legitimacy of the broker. The flexibility here is great, and these are the tools that allow brokers to compete in the market. Trading conditions can make one broker better or worse compared to others, but legitimacy is a completely different aspect of its operation.

I repeat this because many traders often confuse these things. especially with the use of the word ”legit” as slang, which is understood in a much wider way.

Regulation

To better understand why regulation is so important, look at it as the body that essentially answers the question of this topic, which is, whether the broker is legitimate or not. And what's more, it is not a one-time process, in which the broker applies for a licence, fulfils the conditions stipulated for it, and continues to work. The broker's operations are continuously monitored, and he must regularly submit reports on his work. Otherwise, his licence will be revoked.

In this regard, FBS is legit. They offer services in over 150 countries worldwide. An impressive number and many jurisdictions. This means that they must be licensed to operate not by one or two regulatory bodies but by many more.

When I was assessing this broker, I did research about its regulations. I was happy to find out that among the others, FBS is regulated by one of the most renowned authorities - the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. CySEC oversees the brokers operating within the countries of the European Union.

You have probably read that CySEC regulation is one of the most respected in the trading community, but you can rarely read the reasons for that. Let me briefly share here.

Being regulated by the CySEC means that strict rules of fairness and transparency must be followed. By requiring third parties to control the receipt, transmission and execution of orders, it eliminates the possibility of a broker manipulating prices, or being a “market-maker”, a familiar term for brokers prone to fraud.

Furthermore, brokers must regularly submit financial statements, but not only submit, also ensure that they adhere to the highest standards of compliance.

And finally, the broker must have insurance to protect the investors' funds, if the company goes bankrupt or cannot meet its financial obligations on time. FBS is a member of the Investor Compensation Fund, and is another reason why traders can trust the services of this broker.

From so-called “global regulations”, which every broker has for working in a large number of countries in different parts of the world, FBS has a registered seat in Belize, and is regulated by IFSC financial authority, also well-known in the industry.

Reputation

As in any business, here too, reputation is very important. Although there are no written rules for this, the reputation of a particular broker plays a large role in evaluating whether a broker is legitimate or not.

It's not just about whether the broker enjoys a good reputation among traders. It is equally important to have a good reputation among other parties involved in trading, such as financial institutions from which the broker provides liquidity, or so-called liquidity providers, which can be reputable global banks or other specialised financial institutions.

In this regard, it can be said that FBS enjoys a solid reputation, both among traders and among other financial institutions.

FBS is a company that started providing brokerage services in 2009, and today it is one of the leading companies and among the most popular international brokers. From the company's website, it can be seen that over 27 million users are already registered on their platform. Is there a better counterargument than this if you need to answer someone if FBS is a scam?

Furthermore, FBS has won some kind of recognition almost every year. In its history, it has received over 90 such recognitions for the quality of services, the platform, trading conditions and so on.

However, there is one downside which is ruining their reputation.

They simply cannot choose a proper football club to support. First, it was Barcelona, then Leicester. The first one almost went bankrupt, the second one got relegated. They need to hire me as a consultant when it comes to choosing the right football club to support 😀","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tkfv0o84ribx3p2y', 'title': 'What will be your verdict, is FBS legit, or should one avoid trading with this broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.3901, 'ai': 0.6099}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Let me answer the second part of your question first.\n\nThere is absolutely no single reason to avoid trading FBS.

Trading conditions can make one broker better or worse compared to others, but legitimacy is a completely different aspect of its operation.\n\nI repeat this because many traders often confuse these things. especially with the use of the word ”legit” as slang, which is understood in a much wider way.\n\nRegulation\n\nTo better understand why regulation is so important, look at it as the body that essentially answers the question of this topic, which is, whether the broker is legitimate or not. And what's more, it is not a one-time process, in which the broker applies for a licence, fulfils the conditions stipulated for it, and continues to work. The broker's operations are continuously monitored, and he must regularly submit reports on his work. Otherwise, his licence will be revoked.\n\nIn this regard, FBS is legit. They offer services in over 150 countries worldwide. An impressive number and many jurisdictions. This means that they must be licensed to operate not by one or two regulatory bodies but by many more.\n\nWhen I was assessing this broker, I did research about its regulations. I was happy to find out that among the others, FBS is regulated by one of the most renowned authorities - the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. CySEC oversees the brokers operating within the countries of the European Union.\n\nYou have probably read that CySEC regulation is one of the most respected in the trading community, but you can rarely read the reasons for that. Let me briefly share here.\n\nBeing regulated by the CySEC means that strict rules of fairness and transparency must be followed. By requiring third parties to control the receipt, transmission and execution of orders, it eliminates the possibility of a broker manipulating prices, or being a “market-maker”, a familiar term for brokers prone to fraud.\n\nFurthermore, brokers must regularly submit financial statements, but not only submit, also ensure that they adhere to the highest standards of compliance.\n\nAnd finally, the broker must have insurance to protect the investors' funds, if the company goes bankrupt or cannot meet its financial obligations on time. FBS is a member of the Investor Compensation Fund, and is another reason why traders can trust the services of this broker.\n\nFrom so-called “global regulations”, which every broker has for working in a large number of countries in different parts of the world, FBS has a registered seat in Belize, and is regulated by IFSC financial authority, also well-known in the industry.\n\nReputation\n\nAs in any business, here too, reputation is very important. Although there are no written rules for this, the reputation of a particular broker plays a large role in evaluating whether a broker is legitimate or not.\n\nIt's not just about whether the broker enjoys a good reputation among traders. It is equally important to have a good reputation among other parties involved in trading, such as financial institutions from which the broker provides liquidity, or so-called liquidity providers, which can be reputable global banks or other specialised financial institutions.\n\nIn this regard, it can be said that FBS enjoys a solid reputation, both among traders and among other financial institutions.\n\nFBS is a company that started providing brokerage services in 2009, and today it is one of the leading companies and among the most popular international brokers. From the company's website, it can be seen that over 27 million users are already registered on their platform. Is there a better counterargument than this if you need to answer someone if FBS is a scam?\n\nFurthermore, FBS has won some kind of recognition almost every year. In its history, it has received over 90 such recognitions for the quality of services, the platform, trading conditions and so on.\n\nHowever, there is one downside which is ruining their reputation.\n\nThey simply cannot choose a proper football club to support. First, it was Barcelona, then Leicester. The first one almost went bankrupt, the second one got relegated. They need to hire me as a consultant when it comes to choosing the right football club to support 😀"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.3901

Sebastian Dobre,1y,How does copy trading work with Esperio broker?,"I am sharing my experience of copying trades with Esperio.

I want to start with the fact that the function of copying deals is quite common on the web. Some Companies provide such services. Some traders have whole channels dedicated to it. As a rule, it looks like a trader shows some deals in real time. At the same time, the trader says that he opens more deals than he shows. Access to all information is sold separately. Thus, you can either buy training from this trader or get into a closed group, where all information about trades will be.

As for the Esperio broker, it has a slightly different approach. As far as I know, traders who broadcast their trades at this broker work only with this broker. This means two things:

1. the trader is interested in the quality of trades made. The trader earns not by advertising or luring new clients. He earns from the commission for profitable trades. That is, he only aims for a positive result. The broker offers several traders to choose from. This creates competition between them. Thus, traders treat their work more responsibly to attract more clients.

2. Broker, when providing such service, risks his reputation. After all, if traders make losing trades, an investor will have a negative attitude not toward a concrete trader but toward the broker. The selection of traders takes place. In addition, the broker performs the overall control. It ensures the reliability and safety of the mechanism.

I think that this mechanism can be considered a way of investing. But here it is investing not in some asset but in a certain trader. Everything becomes simple and clear if we consider copying trades in Esperio as investing in an asset.

Here are more details about the mechanism.

Through a special account, the investor gets access to the base of traders. Traders determine the amount of commission they receive from profitable trades. Each trader determines the amount independently. Thus an investor can choose between traders. An important point. An investor can attach only one trader to one account. To invest in several traders, you need to create separate accounts. I understood that this is done for security purposes.

Then the trader makes transactions, and the investor observes the process. He receives profit in the form of a fixed commission. Such commission is accumulated in the investor's account. At any time, the investor can stop cooperation with the trader. Close this asset. As a general rule, the mutual settlement takes place in a period specified by the trader and investor in advance. The gained profit is divided between the investor and trader in a predetermined percentage proportion.

My opinion is that such copying of deals is not passive trading as many people think. There is no exact duplication of trader's trades. An investor does not make ill-considered deals just because a more experienced trader did so. It's investing in a promising asset. And an investor in his choice of a trader to whom he is ready to entrust his funds should show the investor's skills. Analyze, compare, allocate assets, etc. When choosing a trader, an investor determines the number of funds he is ready to entrust to him. Risk management is necessary here, as in any other investment.

In any case, it is worth paying attention to this investment instrument.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0b1y3m5cdx4ju92l', 'title': 'How does copy trading work with Esperio broker?', 'score': {'original': 0.474, 'ai': 0.526}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am sharing my experience of copying trades with Esperio.\n\nI want to start with the fact that the function of copying deals is quite common on the web.

Denis Rutherford,9mo,How do I stop reading Fxview broker reviews and start trading?,"That can be a common issue amongst many traders.

And it is not specifically about the Fxview broker review content either, it can be all kinds of reviews, educational material on how to implement particular strategies, it can be about the time when a trader finally shifts into live trading after using the demo.

It is a psychological threshold overall, and the main question here is.

Are you ready to start trading?

It can be tough on many traders to take this final step and end up in the world of real trading, where everything is trading live, any price action can help your P&L, or be detrimental to it.

When you read Fxview reviews, you can learn a lot about the company, how the trading is happening, what the broker can do for you, what sort of features it can bring to your trading capabilities.

You understand that people are trading and getting satisfactory results on multiple platforms, they can compare them and choose the one that fits their trading style the most. You understand, that they have also multiple choices in terms of the assets they trade. They can trade the ones they know the most about, or they can try the ones they don't know much about, because the asset basket is quite large. You understand, that, when people are trading those assets, they have access to so many trading tools and indicators that the platforms trade by default, and the broker provides to them additionally.

You understand, that they don't have a lot of worries in terms of fund safety and data security, because the broker, while being strictly and successfuly regulated, they also have additional measures in place to ensure maximum safety, they also provide negative balance protection.

You understand, that the traders on the platform can have preferences in terms of the account type and trading type can choose. They can go for manual trading or copy trading if they want to.

However, even though they have so many positive features, choices and preferences, that still does not mean that getting to the trading part is very easy. Whether it is the first time for people when they are going to trade in financial markets, or it is the first time for them to trade at a broker's trading platform for the first time, they can have this moments of hesitation.

What they need to understand, is that, you lose 100% of the chances you don't take. So, if you never trade, you can never make money, you can never be profitable.

Gleb Gorshkov,Sep 13,How did FXcess reviews affect your decision-making in becoming a client of this broker?,"It was actually a review on the Fxcess multi account account manager that got me really interested. As a professional trader, managing the accounts of other people is something that is quite common, and it is not the nice to keep swapping between accounts.

The Fxcess broker capitalizes on the MT4 very impressively, because they understand that the majority of the retail traders prefer to use it, and trust that it will always be reliable. The trading conditions that the broker provides are also very competitive, with the leverage going as high as 1:1000. This is a very good leverage range for traders because they can utilize the maximum to be more profitable. But that is not a leverage that I would use all the time. And that is another reason why I have multiple accounts; so that I can use different leverages.

And back to the PMAM, which is Personal Multi-Account Manager. With the PMAM, I can manage all my accounts from one place. That is including the accounts of, for lack of better words, my clients as well. It allows me to allocate funds, move funds between accounts, duplicate trades, make one-click trades on multiple accounts, manage orders, positions, and equity all in one place. This is mostly a professional tool and it is a very practical and functional one as well. You can check out the broker's website if you need more information on what the PMAM can do.

There are a lot of other reasons to join the broker, from a none professional perspective.
