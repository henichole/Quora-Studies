Suman Kumar Karn,6y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"A dog reached a Grocery Shop with a carry bag hung in the neck. The shop keeper saw the dog and curiously opened the bag. He saw a list of items along with money. The shopkeeper felt amazed and provided the items as per list and hung it back in the neck of dog. He was still surprised and was really impressed with the intelligence of dog. He thought, he must meet the owner of that dog. He then followed the dog… Dog went to a bus stop and boarded a bus and as there is an address mentioned in his necklace, the bus conductor issued tickets and took the money from bag. At the destination, the dog got down and reached at the gate of a house. He rang the door bell. The shop keeper behind him was full of surprise. Suddenly the door opens, and a man comes out and slaps the dog.

After seeing such unwanted reaction, shopkeeper got irritated and asked “the dog has done a fabulous job and still you slapped him?”. The owner replies “ I was in deep sleep, he could have kept the key with him, I wouldn't have been disturbed”.

Expectations of boss is limitless… Don't ever get trapped… Do the best you can..

Rana Ashish,Updated 5y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"Almost 3000 answers are there on this thread, I am not going to give you another lesson that I learned, but I will try to provide another perspective which is not written or I haven’t read yet.

Let me explain with a small incident that happened with me today.

Tomorrow is a holiday (For Bakrid) and I am going to Goa this weekend, so I have taken 3 days of leaves (Monday to Wednesday), So I have two remaining working days till Friday. Today I was assigned to develop a new algorithm for processing some tasks. When I checked the complexity of the algorithm, I realised that it was no way possible to complete it before my leaves begin.

So I dropped a mail,

Hello XYZ,

I will start working on this Algorithm. What will be the deadline to complete this code?

Because tomorrow is a holiday here (As he is a foreigner, he is not aware of our holidays) and I am taking 3 days leave in the next week.

Thanks,

I was expecting a date, but he played his card and replied. This time he put every senior personnel from entire world in the CC.

Hi Ashish,

Can you give me an estimate on when you will be able to complete this?

Thanks,

I estimated that development and came to the conclusion that it will take 4 working days. Now, here is the catch. If I were a fresher, then I would have surely replied that I need 4 working days, which will be completed on next weekend. And, certainly I would have created a bad impression in front of the world (CC).

So, this is what I replied,

Hello XYZ,

I will try to complete it as soon as possible before I go on my leaves. In case I won’t be able to complete, I'll need 1 more working day after my leaves.

Thanks,

“Sure, sounds good.” This is what he replied.

This is a simple email conversation. But, you can see diplomatic approach while replying.

Let’s see another example:

Hello Ashish,

Can you please check the production issue on urgent basis?

Fresher’s reply:

Hello XYZ,

Yes, I have resolved this issue.

Thanks,

And a reply from a guy, who has some years of experience,

Hello XYZ,

Yes, I have resolved this issue. Please verify from your side, whether it causes another issue or not.

Thanks,

See, here is the catch. Newton’s law applies here blindly. For every action, there is equal and opposite reaction.

When your code is running on the production, you can’t be sure that you have given a fool-proof solution. You try to fix one thing, which may result in the failure of multiple other things. So, if anything goes wrong, every person will start pointing finger at you.

But when you add these extra lines, you are somehow safe.

Lesson that I have learned: How to respond to other people diplomatically according to the situation.

It is really important in your real life too.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/14cd6eayqb5fknm9', 'title': 'What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Almost 3000 answers are there on this thread, I am not going to give you another lesson that I learned, but I will try to provide another perspective which is not written or I haven’t read yet.\n\nLet me explain with a small incident that happened with me today.\n\nTomorrow is a holiday (For Bakrid) and I am going to Goa this weekend, so I have taken 3 days of leaves (Monday to Wednesday), So I have two remaining working days till Friday.

Rajju Manju,Updated 3y,What are some tricks used by salesmen that most people never notice?,"One fine evening , hubby stopped car in a traffic signal . Had plenty of time to clear, so many vehicles.

I took some pen and pencil by teenage girl , who came near our car window to sell. And while taking, i asked her , You go to school?

She said, Yes madam, evening school

Meanwhile hubby saw a man with little birds in a cage.

Philanthropist inside him gave a call and hubby thought to free those birds. 😅

Image: google. (Just example)

Hubby gave money and told him to release them. He did, took money and vanished. 😄

Seeing all the birds flying in the air, hubby felt very happy, kid clapped.

I said, wow.. Good job.

The girl with pencils near our next car giggled,

“No use madam. He will whistle and all birds will come back to him . They all trained. He get both money and birds back. This happens daily.

Menaka Seenu,Updated 3y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"Never ever compete with a guy who works 24/7. There will always be somebody who knows/works better than you. Work efficiently as much as required for the day. That's enough . Have work life balance.
Never be close friends with your colleagues unless you know them since your college days. Most of them are friends with you because they need you.
Never be loyal to the employer . You are just another employee to them.
Have every word/promise written in mail . Anybody can turn their back at you.
Never show your anger to anybody in office.
Never discuss your family matters.
Don't flirt with anybody. Approach sincerely.
Keep learning something. It helps you to quit confidently when you don't like something or somebody

Srinath Nalluri,Updated 6y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"My close friend told me this popular story once:

A farmer had two animals, a horse and a goat.

One day, the horse fell sick and it couldn’t get-up. The doctor came and checked the horse. He gave him the medicines and told: ‘I doubt it can make it. Use these medicines for three days. If its condition doesn’t improve, I will give an injection and put it to the rest on the fourth day.’

The goat listened to the whole conversation.

On the first day, the farmer made the horse drink medicine water.

After he left, the goat whispered to the horse: ""Come on, friend. I know you can do it. Get up. Yes, do it..""

But the horse couldn’t get up.

On the second day, the farmer gave the second dose.

The goat said: ""Friend, you should try. You don’t know your strength. You can do it.""

The horse tried hard. But it couldn’t.

On the third and final day, the farmer gave the third dose hopelessly. He decided to call the doctor again as the virus might spread and infect the other horses.

The goat shouted: ""Listen, it's now or never! You are going to die tomorrow. Get up, come on! Have courage! Come on! Get up! Get up!’

The horse tried with all its might and it stood up. It started walking.

“Fantastic! Run, run more! Yes! Yay! Yes! You did it, you're a champion!!!” The goat shouted in excitement.

The owner came back next morning and to his surprise, he saw the horse running in the field.

He shouted excitedly ‘Yes!! My horse is healthy. It is running… Thank god.’

He called his worker and told ‘Call the doctor tonight for party. Let’s celebrate! And you, for the dinner cut this goat and cook it’

Moral of the story:

Organizations never know which employee actually deserves the appraisal.
Whatever you do, always CC your boss and keep him in loop.

Andrew Shaffer,7mo,What happened when selling a house that made you not sell to the prospective buyer?,"I was charged by my mother with selling my stepfather’s house after he died.

Stu,6mo,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","At my former employer we had a saying “Hell hath no fury like a loyal customer scorned”. I now know that I am one of those customers.

I was a customer of ATT Cellular for over 20 years, paying well over $350 a month for 5 lines for my family. That’s $350 after all the “discounts”. The incentive to stay with ATT was mostly inertia and a “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it approach”. In spite of the bluster, they really didn’t give any incentives on new phones other than interest free financing, and I knew I could probably find a better price elsewhere, but…

Then a few months ago my credit card number got stolen (not the card, just the number) and the bank caught it right away and changed the account number. This happened to be the card that ATT used for my auto-bill. I didn’t realize it until they sent me a text saying my monthly payment was one day overdue. So immediately I went online, paid the one-day overdue bill, and changed the credit card number. The bill was over $50 higher due to removal of the e-bill discount and a late payment fee.

The next bill also had a removal of the e-bill discount and the added charge of $7 for late payment. I thought that was unfair, but I let it go.

But a month later the next bill arrived and still had no e-bill discount and added another $7 late fee! I called up to inquire and was told too bad, it takes at least a month and a half to register the new credit card in their system. All I wanted was the recent $7 late fee credited. First I appealed to their sense of fair play, and got nowhere. I then asked politely if I could ask a manager for a waiver.

The manager said no way. I pointed out I was a customer at $350 a month for 20 years, but I would leave over $7. He calmly told me the equivalent of “don’t let the door hit you in the ass” (I’m paraphrasing). No raised voices, just a calm discussion that ended in goodbye.

So I started the research, and found a carrier that uses the same cellular network plus others, and is costing me $210 a month less! $210 a month less for the same exact service! This was the best $7 wake-up call I ever had!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jnqcowbx03h49l2r', 'title': 'What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'At my former employer we had a saying “Hell hath no fury like a loyal customer scorned”.

Aakash Tripathi,Updated 5y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"No one cares.

In my office, an IT firm, there was this guy Anubhav in my team. We joined the firm together as freshers from different colleges and used to sit next to each other. During the initial days, I didn’t like him much as he was just writing codes and nothing else. Every time I had to talk to him, I have to ping him on Skype for Business (Company uses it for all internal conversations) although sitting next to him as he was so into his Laptop screen.

But, as the days passed I started respecting his love for his work and duties. I got fond of him and got even lucky to talk to him in person during Lunch breaks and evening snacks. He even got the Star Performer of the Quarter award. Everything was going good till that Monday.

Being punctual was one of his primary habits so he was never late to office. But on that Monday when I reached office, his chair was empty. Even the office was not the same. He was fired with many others. Gloominess was in the air and the office was half empty. I called him and asked to meet him after the office, he agreed. We went out in the evening to a cafe and I looked at him; he was really sad… That day I got to understand, what made him the person I knew for past 6 months. They were the responsibilities of his family, taunts of the uncle living next door, and his own expectations. He was striving hard to become the best version of himself, to prove himself, and he was achieving that. But no one cared.

Next day onwards, he started applying to other companies. He needed recommendations. So, he contacted our manager (who couldn’t help praising Anubhav while he was in office) for a recommendation, but in vain. He didn’t receive a reply from our manager till date. Even I asked my manager about this, but again in vain. He contacted senior colleagues from office who liked him (or at least it seemed so) to refer him to their previous companies, but only thing he could get was “I will try”. He was sending 10s of mails everyday to different HRs, searching naukri, iimjobs and monster but only reply he got was “Apologies, we need experienced people for our roles”. Everybody wants experience but the irony is, they themselves are reluctant to give one. No one cares…

And I think, this is not one story, there are way too many Anubhavs in our corporates, fighting everyday with everything, everyone, and specifically themselves.

He is still looking out for a job…

Edit: Thanks a lot Quorans for all your support and upvotes. The good news is, today Anubhav got a job offer and he will join the office tomorrow onwards.

Scott Dismukes,3y,Multiple laws must be passed to ban the sale of handguns. Do you agree or disagree? Why?,"If you mean a complete, or near complete, ban on sales of all handguns, then I totally disagree.

The Heller and MacDonald decisions by the Supreme Court held that guns in common use are protected under the Second Amendment. That means you can write all the laws you want (Helloooo California), but that as they get to the courts, they will be struck down.

The 9th Circuit just struck down a ban on large capacity (over 10 rounds) magazines. The Court held that ban would make illegal magazines already owned; about half of the magazines currently owned in CA held over 10 rounds. The law tried to ban half of magazines already legally held in the state, plus the routine sale of them going forward. If a magazine ban didn’t pass constitutional muster, what do you think the odds of a GUN BAN law are?

Part of the 9th Circuit’s decision also reflected that the law had no impact on criminals, just on the law abiding people. Why on earth do you want to ban the law abiding, those that commit no crimes, while leaving criminals unaffected? Just what do you think you will achieve by diminishing those who don’t commit crimes, while not affecting the criminals?

This is the biggest and most complete fallacy in any gun control argument - criminals don’t give a flying rat’s patootie about the law - they will continue to ignore every one they choose to ignore. No piece of paper with ink on it ever physically stopped someone from committing a crime. The words on the paper (“do this and we will punish you with that”) may dissuade you. But the paper puts up no force field, no barrier to do it if you have decided to do it. Criminals long ago have made that decision, and keep making it every day.

Vineet Banga,4y,Is the BJP government's decision to sell Air India correct?,"So, let us look at history of Air India! Air India started off in 1932 as Tata Air Services and christened Tata airlines later. They decide to name it Air India after WWII and it became a Public Limited Company. It was founded by J.R.D.Tata and in fact he used to fly some of the flights himself. After Indian independence, Govt bought 49% stake in the airline.

Now, let us look at why we need a National airline. I am sure you have heard of Emirates or Qatar. One of the finest in the world! They have huge hubs from where their flights take off or land.

Many politicians fear their nations will be irrelevant if they abandon their money-losing flag airlines. That’s probably a stretch. In most places, the market likely would fill the gap — provided the government got out of the way. But national pride is powerful, and few people want to see storied brands disappear.

— Brian Sumers

The idea was to connect your country to the outside world. Also, for the outside world to know that a country exists and is capable of running their own airlines which can connect to any other country in the world; as needed. So, just like outer space mission, it was a pride that we also have National Airlines. But is this relevant today?

Now, let us look at why this move by the Govt is a little late. It should have done if not two decades ago, then at least a decade ago. Air India has an annual bail out budget or Rs. 4,600 Crores. As per my knowledge, Air India has never made any profit. So, while Local buses and trains serve the people to connect within the country and are trying to reinvent themselves, why should we continue to carry a burden of Rs.4,600 crore which is going to increase every year.

Will people lose jobs? Of course they will! Why do you think they are losing money? It is because it is the same old bureaucratic set up where tenure and reservations hover above merit. So, letting it continue to run when the losses mount up is not anyone running a business would do. Air India has served the Politicians more than the people.

The airline most often tops the chart when it comes to poor on-time performance, flight cancellations, passenger complaints and grievances redressal. For instance, the airline's domestic operations registered 287 complaints in July, the highest among all airlines. While all other airlines managed to address the issues, AI couldn't close 65 passenger complaints against it.

I have flown within India for 15-Years, and the only time I used Air India was when I used to fly from Hyderabad to Bangalore because it was the cheapest flight available.

Head smack. I plucked the check out of his fingers and walked.

R J Holland,Updated 8mo,What is the best personal submarine for sale?,"A Polaris Nuclear submarine for only $6.98.

When I was a kid, they had all kinds of neat things you could send away for in comic books.

I ordered the Big Bang cannon and scared the shit out of my family one night when I fired it off in my room. After that it was an outside cannon only. Worse was when I was 10, I fired off a .22 starter pistol in my room. That gun was confiscated. Then there was the black chewing gum that turned your mouth black when you chewed it. I gave a piece to my older sister Tracy when she went out with her friends. Funny! Younger brothers did things like that. My pal Earl ordered the X Ray Specs, glasses that you were supposed to see through things with, like girls clothing. Didn’t work. Earl was vastly disappointed. He wore them over to my house hoping to see through my sisters clothes.

“Those are pretty stupid looking sun glasses,” Lori said to him. Earl felt stupid.

I ordered the footlocker full of soldiers, tanks, boats and airplanes. A FOOTLOCKER FULL OF THEM! WOW. When I finally got the footlocker, it was about seven inches by two inches full of flat, tiny, half inch crap, not even to scale. Very poorly made. Disappointment was real though. This stuff was all junk but they made it look so great.

I remember when I was ten I asked my mom at the breakfast table if I could get the little monkey advertised in the comic ads. My twelve year old sisters burst out laughing.

“I’ll look after it,” I promised.

“RJ, those things aren’t real. They’re all fake,” Lori said to me. But they actually were real. Live animals shipped to kids for $18.99, a lot of money in those days. Unbelievable.

Mom laid the law down. NO MORE ORDERING FROM COMICS!

But the dream of many boys was the Polaris Submarine. WOW! A real nuclear submarine! For only $6.98! Many boys dreamt of getting their sub and taking it down to the river where they could float around, dive, and shoot nuclear missiles and torpedoes. The ad actually said you could hunt for sunken treasure and explore the ocean floor. To good to be true? Yes it was. When the package arrived, you had to build it, ‘out of cardboard’. It would last two minutes in the water. It wouldn’t last an hour out in the rain in the back yard.

Most of the ads were lies but they got away with it. Many children were disappointed. But still, it was fun to look at those pictures and dream.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ec9orjgwd38qsx50', 'title': 'What is the best personal submarine for sale?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'A Polaris Nuclear submarine for only $6.98.\n\nWhen I was a kid, they had all kinds of neat things you could send away for in comic books.\n\nI ordered the Big Bang cannon and scared the shit out of my family one night when I fired it off in my room.

Shrishti Lahoti,5y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"Heard this story on the first day of my MBA from the director sir.

One day a hungry tiger came into the premises of a huge corporate company and hid inside the washroom. He saw the junior manager of the company entering and pounced upon him.

Cathy Buchanan,2y,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","In 2004, I bought cell phones for my husband and myself for Christmas. We had a three-year “family plan” contract with the service provider.

Husband passed away seven months later. I called the service provider, explained the situation and asked if I could switch to a one-person contract. (Naive of me, I know, but I was new to the world of cellphone contracts.)

They turned me down cold, and were actually quite rude about it. The agent I spoke to just said “That’s not our problem…you signed up, you pay. No exceptions.” So I was stuck with a phone I didn’t need and wouldn’t be using, and stuck paying for service for two phones for the rest of the term of the contract.

Near the end of the contract, I got a call from a very nice lady on behalf of the provider, inviting me to renew my contract with them. I told her I would swallow ground glass before I ever dealt with her company again. She was shocked, and of course she asked me why.

I told her what had happened when I tried to change my contract. She was even more shocked…she apologized, and said “That’s not our policy…I don’t know who you dealt with before, but they were wrong!”

At that point I thanked her for her kindness, but I pointed out that it obviously only came into play when her company wanted something from me. When I needed something from them, I was treated very rudely and dismissively.

I told her the wrong answer was bad enough, coming from someone who should have known the right answer…that was his job, after all. But if the company’s “customer service” agents felt free to treat people like that, they had much bigger problems than an employee who didn’t know what their “deceased customer” policy was.

I told her it wasn’t so much the contract issue that had upset me, although I did resent having to pay for service for a dead man for nearly two and a half years. It was that “Not our problem” that had really pissed me off. And I remembered it every time I used my phone.

She tried to talk me around, but I didn’t change my mind. It was eight years before I bought another cell phone, and I made sure I chose a different service provider.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v30p49ue5n8zt2yr', 'title': 'What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In 2004, I bought cell phones for my husband and myself for Christmas.

Pamela Puller,Updated 3y,Have you ever had a car salesman speak down to you and not take you seriously? Were you able to make him learn the error of his ways? How?,"About 30 years ago, as a young woman, I needed a new vehicle and decided to buy a small pickup truck.

Austin C Tracy,Updated 3y,What was the most obvious lie a car salesman ever told you to try to sell you a car?,"It was 1997. I was 21 years old, and there was a car I was in love with…

I researched it. I knew all the options, I knew all the variations. I knew exactly what I wanted.

it was a 1991–1995 Toyota MR2 Turbo. T-Tops, leather, fully loaded in any color but red.

mid-engine turbocharged, 200hp, rear wheel drive, variable assist-electro-hydraulic power steering…. It is a mini-ferrari.

I called my bank and was pre-approved for a loan, so I started calling around dealerships. I called them all with the same request.

Do you have a 91–95 Toyota MR2 Turbo, fully loaded in any color but red? No? Well, here’s my information, please call me if you get one in. Thank you.

Two days later, I got a call from Camelback Honda (in Phoenix, AZ) “Hello, Is this Austin? Well sir, I have your car!” “You have a MR2 Turbo?” “Yes sir, Come on down!”

I was totally excited!! I canceled plans with my girlfriend, and drove the hour to the dealership…. When I arrived, I circled the lot, looking for the car, and didn’t see it. I figured it was in the back, so I parked up front in the sea of Hondas. I went inside and found the salesman who called me. I asked where the car was, and he said it was right out front (I must have missed it). He led me outside and next to my car, double parked was…

A RED… base model Honda prelude…. 135hp, front wheel drive piece of shit.

I asked “what’s this?” He said “That’s your car!” I said “I called and asked for a Toyota MR2 turbo in anything but red…. How is this my car?” He said “It’s basically the same thing!” I refuted this. He said “well why don’t we take it for a test drive? You’ll love it!”

So he tossed me the keys, he got in and I got in, adjusted the mirrors, seat and steering wheel.

So this is where I have to explain that I had been racing cars since I was 16 years old. Dirt circle track, Solo 2 (precision driving), hill climbs, and illegal gymkhana races (drifting before it was called drifting)

I was pissed off. So leaving the parking lot I reved and popped the clutch, spinning the inside front wheel “whoops, foot slipped off the clutch”. I banged every shift off the rev limiter. We drove up 7th street to North park, which has a narrow winding road that goes over hills and down through dips. I crested the hills so fast that the front wheels lost traction, I bottomed the suspension out on the dips, and every corner was taken so hard that the tires screamed in anger and the inside wheel spun freely. He was grabbing at the dash and “oh shit” handle and bracing with his knees against the door and center tunnel.

When I returned back to the lot, I made sure to yank the hand brake and slide the rear end to a stop. I got out of the car, leaving the keys in the ignition, and started walking to my car

He shakily got out of the car and said “Where are ya going?!? Don’t you like the car?”

I said: “when someone calls in and asks for a car with such specificity that he knows every option he wants, what makes you think that he’s still ‘on the fence’ with what he wants?” He said “well I figured when you saw this sports car that you would fall in love!”

I said: “ I asked for a top of the line Toyota MR2, a mini-ferrari, you gave me a base model Prelude… essentially a 2-door accord. If you don’t know the difference, you need to be in a different business. Now ensure that you and your company NEVER call me again. If you do, I’ll file harassment charges against you!

I never heard from that dealership again.

You’ll love it!”\n\nSo he tossed me the keys, he got in and I got in, adjusted the mirrors, seat and steering wheel.\n\nSo this is where I have to explain that I had been racing cars since I was 16 years old. Dirt circle track, Solo 2 (precision driving), hill climbs, and illegal gymkhana races (drifting before it was called drifting)\n\nI was pissed off. So leaving the parking lot I reved and popped the clutch, spinning the inside front wheel “whoops, foot slipped off the clutch”. I banged every shift off the rev limiter. We drove up 7th street to North park, which has a narrow winding road that goes over hills and down through dips. I crested the hills so fast that the front wheels lost traction, I bottomed the suspension out on the dips, and every corner was taken so hard that the tires screamed in anger and the inside wheel spun freely. He was grabbing at the dash and “oh shit” handle and bracing with his knees against the door and center tunnel.\n\nWhen I returned back to the lot, I made sure to yank the hand brake and slide the rear end to a stop. I got out of the car, leaving the keys in the ignition, and started walking to my car\n\nHe shakily got out of the car and said “Where are ya going?!? Don’t you like the car?”\n\nI said: “when someone calls in and asks for a car with such specificity that he knows every option he wants, what makes you think that he’s still ‘on the fence’ with what he wants?” He said “well I figured when you saw this sports car that you would fall in love!”\n\nI said: “ I asked for a top of the line Toyota MR2, a mini-ferrari, you gave me a base model Prelude… essentially a 2-door accord. If you don’t know the difference, you need to be in a different business. Now ensure that you and your company NEVER call me again. If you do, I’ll file harassment charges against you!\n\nI never heard from that dealership again.\n\n………………………………..\n\nDamn, 27k views and 650 upvotes in 12 hours. I should have pulled a sean kernan and asked a question I already had an answer/story for so I can rake in that Partner Program money!\n\nand as I keep getting asked…. Yes, I did end up getting my MR2. It was a 91 turbo, T-tops, black leather, fully loaded. It was the beginning of a long history with Japanese sports cars.

Vasudev Roy,5y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"The MNC I work in has a defined structure of employees.

Every manager has around 3–4 direct reportees. Every director has around 3–4 managers reporting. Every Vice-President has 3–4 directors reporting. Every President has 3–4 VPs reporting and so on.

The other day, I was stuck at some code and since manager was on leave, I approached director for the rectification. To my surprise, her understanding about the whole subject and business was marvelous.

I went back to my seat but the minions in my head were still in that situation, “how often is one so clear about rectifying a random doubt coming out of the blue? How in the holy world could she be so attentive and structured?”

I thought for a while and realized this fact,

I am working on just a single project.
My manager has his eyes on 3 projects of his direct reportees and one of his own. So 4.
The director has her head at least in 16 projects.
Keep multiplying it with 4 to only flabbergast by the amount of knowledge and clarity the leaders must be having.

The biggest lesson?

Mats Andersson,7mo,What happened when selling a house that made you not sell to the prospective buyer?,"We met at the estate agent’s office, all set – but as we talked the deal over with him, it became more and more obvious that he was having second thoughts. It was a bit of a stretch for one income, even though it was a good income.

In the end, we (well, the estate agent) plain asked him. And since he hadn’t yet signed the paper, he could, with visible relief, back out of the deal.

Looking at the other bids, we decided to sell to the third highest bidder. The home had huge potential, which we hadn’t been able to realise for various reasons, and the third bidder was a young couple – and he was a carpenter. He would know how to do stuff, he would know his limitations, he would know people who could do whatever he wanted done at a good price.

They were ecstatic, especially the girl, who had fallen in love with the place to the extent that she had been crying herself to sleep when they lost the bidding.

And… it felt very nice, because for the house we were moving to, we hadn’t been the highest bidders, either; it was just that the previous owners liked us a lot better than the highest bidder. (And they had owned the house since the 1950s and were making an insanely good deal anyway; they paid off their mortgage some 70 times over with what we paid.)

Mohit Sharma,Updated 4y,How was your experience with Cars24 for selling your car?,"I went to sell my Honda city Dec 2010 model at mohali branch of Cars 24.

1st of all kindly make sure you never ever go them as they will give you a quote of junk not your car, the quote they give is ridiculously low and jaw dropping.

You will feel like if you had come to sell a car or a bullock cart.

However there inspection method is detailed and quick but of no use for you.

Here is what I experienced.

1) Had a trouble finding them as they didn’t have any branding of them, 2 guys sitting inside one automobile dealership with one small cars 24 signage.

2) Took 35 minutes to inspect car, did thorough check and uploaded details on their mobile app simultaneously.

They checked tyre condition using digital depth gauge, measured paint thickness at various points.

3) They put details on system where so called 10000 plus brokers were supposed to bid for your car based on assessment they did.

after this 24 minutes they gave me quote of 1.41 lacs for my Honda city.

Attaching few picks of my car, in open market it’s being sold in price band of 2.6 to 2.8 easily and they ridiculed me with their best quote of 1.41 lacks.

The employee sitting himself was aware that this price is way too low and didn’t even look into my eyes while giving this price, but he was bound under his organisation policy.

I am myself mechanical engineer and working in reputed Car company in Chandigarh.

Thanks

Edit1:

Today I got call from them, though they didn’t utter a word on Twitter.

I was surprised to hear a shameless tone of one of their executive who was forcefully trying to justify that 1.41 price to me quoting his 8 years of experience in this field.

I couldn’t express anything but pity, such startups don’t go for long.

Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,2y,What did you sell recently and what did you buy instead?,"(288 words and 4 pictures)

I just sold my old car, a Santro Xing Automatic. It was fifteen years old and I wanted to dispose of it before maintenance problems started. I got a fitness certificate from the RTO. Here is me (with my wife), posing with it a few minutes before it was driven off by the buyer.

I felt sad of course. It had served me well. But it was time to part with it.

I sold it to the showroom who gave me a reasonable price for it after some haggling, when I bought a new car, from them. A Wagon R (1.2 litre engine), with Auto Gear shift and twin airbags. The total price was 7.3 lakhs. I paid 6.05 lakhs and gave away my old Santro to them.

Here is a picture of me taking delivery of the new car. Keeping my age in mind the showroom was kind enough to send a sales rep who drove it all the way from the showroom in Yelahanka to Devanahalli, a distance of 25 km, and delivered it to us. Here is a picture of us, taking the keys from him. at the same spot in the basement parking lot where the Santro had been parked earlier.

The number plate is yet to arrive.

Here are two better pictures of the new car I took this morning when we went out for short drive.

This may be the last car I will buy. Unless the government bans petrol driven cars and makes electric cars compulsory.

I don’t expect that to happen for at least 10 more years.

Do you think I will be able to convert this Wagon R into an electric car by retaining the shell and the seats and tires and replacing everything else?

Shubham,1y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"Learn to say NO at the right time.
Be brave enough
Try to work independently as much as possible.
Be ready for less increment or low grades even if your performance has been exceptionally great.
Always be bold
Keep your personal life and corporate life balanced
If you're assigned to a task and you're not clear with it, always try to get it cleared before performing that task.
You have to be yourself, nobody is going to help you out all the time.
Don't expect people to care about you
There are no friends in an office.
Everyone is replaceable and will eventually be replaced.
Never write an email when you're angry. It reflects.
Your looks, dress and communication skills matters a lot.
Always try to communicate through the mail.
Never share your salary with your colleagues.
People around you will always try to pull you down. Be careful.
HR is not there to protect you. HR is there to protect the company.

Only Learning will pay off and please don’t adjust yourself at lower wages if you have the skill set.
Never get involved in office politics until people are letting you live peacefully.
After the appraisal, a minimum of 20% of your colleagues will resign.
Never make any argument with your team lead (doesn't matter how open-minded they are).
Separation is not a crime so stop thinking too much, some people come some people go. This is how life works.
Keep your spirit and self respect up, never let anyone to harm your image. (No matter if that person is super senior or junior) They selected you because you were better than others.
Keep your confidence high otherwise, people will eat your job. Always Open your hands to take new responsibilities.
Always try to save your weekend or holidays from office work. Company is not gonna take care of your family. You will regret later when the time will start taking your loved ones back, every product of nature has expiry date. This is harsh truth.
Never make a relationship in the office, a single mistake will destroy your personal and professional life.
Never say no to challenging opportunities and put you 100% if you get any.
Stay away from bitchy and annoying people, you are not there for a talk show. (Just mind your own business)
Emotional and professional are opposite words in corporate culture. Don’t share your emotional stories with your colleagues, surely one day, they are gonna make fun of your emotions.
If you are not learning anything since a while, please change your job right now otherwise the company will fire you and build some new skill sets too.
Try to connect with straightforward and introvert type experienced colleague, they give you the best advice.
Talk to your loved ones(Parents, best friends) daily so that you could release your mental stress. (Not about your office issues)
Never use your office PC for personal purpose, people have their own ways to stop you and you might end up with mental stress and frustration.
Follow Tradition, Respect your seniors, Be disciplined, these three mantra will help you a lot.( Please read again and again).
One request from my side, Please play TT, carom or badminton whatever you love to play regularly but please never play with your juniors. They are human too and once upon a time you were at same position.

Best of luck and thank me later. Upvotes are overrated, I need written responses.

Thanks for such warm response.

Ramsey Williams,4y,"Have you ever stumbled across a valuable rare find at a garage/yard sale or a secondhand store and knew you were getting too good of a deal? If you bought it, did you feel guilty and tell the other party what you found was worth at some point?","I went to an estate auction one day just to check out what was for sale. The old people that had owned the home for years were known to have some extremely nice items. I spotted an old large Hummel figurine that I had never seen or even heard of before, and since my ancestors were from Germany, every one of them had fairly good collections of Hummel figures, so when I spotted one I had never even heard of much less seen, I stuck around to bid on it. The auction company was not well versed in collectibles, so I figured I might have a good chance at getting that large figurine. I was right, the auction outfit would box up multiple random items and auction them off a box full at a time. The box I wanted that had the Hummel also contained over a half a dozen of old Polaroid bellows style cameras and a few old odds and ends that looked like the junk drawer in everyone’s kitchen. When the box came up for auction there was only one other person interested in the box beside me and that was an elderly gentleman who was obviously interested in the cameras. At around 50 dollars, he began slowing his bidding, waiting almost until the gavel dropped before upping his bid by a dollar or two. Since I am not a fan of auctions, if I see something I want, I go and get it. So my next bid was for 100 dollars. That obviously was more than the old guy was willing, or able to spend. I won the bid and picked up my box of goodies and headed out the door. As I was leaving, I ran into the old guy as he was climbing into his car. I walked over to him and asked if he was still interested in the box of goodies without the Hummel figurine. His eyes lit up and he smiled, “I certainly am”, he replied. “How much do you want for those old cameras?”, he asked. I handed him the box and took out the Hummel figurine and told him that they were all his for free. “But you paid a hundred dollars for them”, he replied. “No, I paid a hundred dollars for this figurine, and I believe it was a great buy. I have no idea of the value of the cameras, so to me they are just stuffing in the box”, I said. “I would be more than happy to pay for them”, he said. I insisted that he could have them only if he agreed to take them for free. He chuckled and agreed and said, “Son you drive a hard bargain”, and we both had a good laugh. We exchanged phone numbers and agreed that we would let each other know what our treasures were actually worth.

Almost six months passed when the old man called me and told me that after he had cleaned the old cameras up and kept the one that he wanted for his collection, he sold the others for over three hundred dollars which he offered to split with me. I turned down his offer and thanked him. Then I told his that the figurine I had bought was one of only three known in existence and that there was no appraised value short of it being worth somewhere in the six figure range. The other two were in museums in France and Germany so I had the only one of its kind still on the free market. Hopefully that will be able to pay for my grand-kids college tuition or make a really nice wedding gift.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3wsi5f40xmtzyd61', 'title': 'Have you ever stumbled across a valuable rare find at a garage/yard sale or a secondhand store and knew you were getting too good of a deal?

Rama G,Updated 1y,"Have you ever bought a product, just out of courtsey for your friend selling it, even though you didn't like it?","A few times. Especially Tupper ware, and Amway products. Later we made it clear, it will work no more. They should do business with outsiders .

I explained to them, out of courtesy even if we take, it won't help them in long run. To just friends and relatives, it's a very small circle. If they are really serious about their business, they should explore and expand outside market.

Because those are sometimes over priced. Not expected quality but still I am expected to buy from them, this made me little discomfort.

But once really and purposefully I bought.

My friend's brother was there.

He was not street smart. mildly mentally challenged . Very good and innocent child at heart . He was already twenty seven years old at that time. But , could not settle in any job or business. My friend was always worried about him.

One day we all thought, let us encourage him to do some essential products business on retail basis. Like cooker gasket s, cooker weights, gas pipes, knifes holders , lighters, etc. He will sell on MRP.

We will arrange for a whole Saler to supply him. He will get for a little discounted price. At least by interacting with people he will learn how to live in this big city.

Since ours is a big township. He will get business also regularly.we spoke to our emu to allow him to do the business. By seeing him he said ,ok ! But, take care he should not create any nuisance in the township.

He started it. out of kindness every one encouraged him. One day he came and said Didi (sister)! buy something. I said ok! and bought one lighter. Next day he came with gasket. I took it.like each day one product. Really I started getting irritated. My husband told it's ok. He sells any way few items. Once you buy all the varieties he won't come. Almost all items I took from him. His sister felt very embarrassing. Even I didn't know why he was after me.

Then one night at nine o clock he came with a gas pipe. Generally I use my gas company's product only, since it is dangerous to experiment with gas stove.

He sells another company's product. My entire house was occupied by unexpected guests. He came directly in to the kitchen saying ‘Didi take this'!

I was busy cooking. I got irritated and told I don't want. He said ‘your stove pipe is looking old'!

I told ‘it's ok. I get it later. Your pipe is of different company, I don't take risk.’

‘It's not Ok! Before you buy a new one, if it develops cracks ,what you will do?' he said loudly.

I can hide no more my irritation,

I said ‘if it develops cracks I will cut a small piece and fix it.ok! You first go out! Can't you see I have guests and I should finish my cooking!?

Straight away he went to my husband and pulled him in to the kitchen, started showing pity on him. ' Bevkuf Didi hei!' paagal hei kya? Kaise tolerate Kar rahe ho?

(Stupid Didi. Is she mad? How you are tolerating her?)

That’s it . I got so much angry. Really I wanted to neck him out.

My husband is very calm natured. He laughed and asked him, why he thought like that?

Now read in that fellow's words.

‘Didi is saying she will cut and fix the pipe it seems! if it develops cracks. Every day if she keep on cutting, only this much will be left. (Gestured with his arm). Then it won't reach stove. You will have no food then! You have to sleep hungry. You are good jijaji(brother in law). Do you need all this? Hey ram ! Give some sense to her!' And started laughing and dancing.

All my guests and my husband even me could not control our laugh.

My husband said, ‘No ashok! I can't sleep hungry. Give me that pipe. Really your Didi doesn't know any thing!' he paid money and took it. That fellow went happily.

I asked my husband ‘why you took it?

He replied, Along with his sister you also worked hard to give him some respectable life.

He does not even understand that. Such an innocent fellow. Let's buy one.Anyway it's not very expensive. Let us give someone if it is not useful to you.

He is innocent. He doesn't know how to market his product and how to talk with a prospective buyer. I liked his plain childish behaviour'.

Anyway I am happy he understands one logic , if you keep on cutting, pipe will become small one day which thing a national merit student like you could not understand!'

Every one laughed. Even I could not hide my smile.

Later he stayed in our township for two years then his mom took him to their native place. But when ever he sees me irrespective of the place and situation he says, 'hehehe! Didi budhu hei!

Didi is stupid!

Really I pray for him whenever I remember him. Whereever he is. Later I came to know he is working in a nursery and enjoy talking to the plants in his native place. May God bless and protect him.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ql1haiufovyz2mg8', 'title': ""Have you ever bought a product, just out of courtsey for your friend selling it, even though you didn't like it?"", 'score': {'original': 0.71725, 'ai': 0.28275}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""A few times.

Kelly Schweighsr,2y,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","Many years (decades) ago, I had my wallet stolen. So I had to cancel all my credit cards (yeah, I was an idiot for carrying them with me, but I learned better).

So I spent most of an afternoon looking up phone numbers (pre-internet) and canceling all the credit cards. Most of these calls were short 10 minute conversations where I was able to cancel the old card and either close the account (they were all paid up) or order a new card. Everyone was polite and competent and very sorry that I had had my wallet stolen.

Except for Sears.

Sears was a nightmare - a two-plus hour argument with a series of “customer service” (ha!) agents who did not want me to cancel the old card OR close the account. Finally, the THIRD supervisor (maybe the sixth or seventh person) I spoke to told me the card was canceled and the account was closed.

It wasn’t. The thief used the card to order *four* rooms full of furniture and several appliances. Two complete bedroom sets, a sofa/ loveseat combo, end tables, coffee table and a five piece dining room set plus a washer and dryer. I think there was a TV in there too - oh, and linens and décor pieces… they really went to town!

I called Sears back and - was not pleasant. Another hour on the phone and threats to contact the police and a lawyer and they finally canceled the bill and said they closed the account.

Only they still did not close the *@#% account!

Which I found out three or four years later when I applied for a mortgage and it was turned down because not only did I have this open Sears account, but Sears actually had *raised the credit limit* on the card to accommodate the thief who stole my card and to order all that furniture. So naturally the mortgage company assumed that I would use that account to furnish the house I was buying. Seriously, the new limit on the card was almost a third the value of the mortgage I was seeking. (This was back in the 1980s when houses were cheaper.)

So I called Sears and told them to close the account right *@#% now or I was going to sue. Finally, after years they finally closed that stupid account. And this time I had my bank check the credit agencies to make sure it was really closed.

And I vowed to NEVER, ever buy anything from Sears again. Good job chasing away a customer, Assholes!

Scott Dismukes,3y,Why did gun sales surge in the US in 2020?,"Uncertainty.

When Covid first started the scientists projected 200k to 2,5 million dead by July 2020. We indeed hit the low estimate. But do you recall what the media ran with, breathlessly touted as THE ONLY number? Right, the 2.5 million. Everything was based on that. Long after the trend line showed wouldn’t hit it, the press and the Democrats all acted like it was still going to happen. Shutdowns, the lot.

LA said their 911 would not respond to low level calls. All the people heard was “911 won’t respond”. Well, if 911 is down with this low level of death, what would happen to delivery drivers and hospitals if the numbers rose to projections? What happens when grocery stores are out of everything, not just TP and sanitizer?

What if people started foraging for food? What if they thought you had some hidden and wouldn’t share? What if they got angry? What happens when mobs get angry?

Then came Floyd. Now you had rioters the government refused to control. These rioters were burning, looting, and killing. They looked into the TV cameras and told the suburbs they were coming for you.

The Seattle police chief sent the residents a letter. It said if your property was being attacked by a mob, 911 would not respond, you were on your own. Sound familiar?

If you heard all that, would you still believe you don’t need a gun, the police will protect you. Heard that claim before? It’s all the gun control types ever say. “You don’t need a gun. You don’t need a gun. The cops will protect you”.

Gregory B.,Updated Sep 8,What happened when selling a house that made you not sell to the prospective buyer?,"My wife and I had a beautiful home we lived in for 25 years and raised our family in. Once everyone was out of the house and it was just the 2 of us we decided to sell and find our next dream home in a higher rent town by us we spent a lot of time in. We found it and were approved for our mortgage after our home went into contract. We were actually approved to carry both mortgages.

The buyers of our old home agreed to the price and things proceeded well they did there inspection that came back with no problems. Some how the buyer found out our deadline for getting a 40K deposit back on our new home and after the inspection started demanding concessions on our old home stating although there was nothing wrong with things they would eventually need to be replaced. We made a few concessions for a couple thousand dollars he wanted 20k. We kept asking but never heard from them till they knew we would lose our deposit the next morning if we needed to back out he thought we we would need to if we couldn't close but were approved for both mortgages.

Long story short It was obvious he thought he could strong arm us and was shocked when I said I did not need to sell my home and out of principal my offer of concessions was off the table and he started back tracking knowing he was going to lose his deposit.

The conversation ended with my explaining to him he did not understand my home was not for sale to him. I am refusing to sell my home to you You could hear his wife pleading with him and crying in the background. In the end he lost his deposit I closed on the other home and sold my existing home for more money a few months later to a cash buyer.

Rami Sivan,4y,Is it right that a non-Hindu should suffer the delay of a house sale because of Pitru Paksha?,"You should be asking the Hindus involved.

Pitru paksha is a fortnight during which one honours one’s ancestors. During this time no auspicious ceremonies are performed.

The degree to which this is practiced and the restrictions which are applied depend upon the individual.

I would say most Hindus don’t even know the dates nor do they honour their ancestors nor do they care about observations.

Jay Bazzinotti,8y,Is it true that Cisco has a ruthless and cutthroat sales culture?,"I worked for Cisco for six years. The top salesmen made millions of dollars per year and I wouldn't have traded places with them for all of that money. They were emotionally beaten constantly.

There were only two kinds of sales people -- those on their way up and those on their way out. The ones the way up would stab you in the stomach with a smile on their face to accomplish what they wanted. They would say absolutely anything it took to get the deal. The ones on the way out were shaken, emotionally washed out regrettful millionaires who can never forget what they did to get where they are.

Ivan Miller,Updated 4y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"Here’s mine:

people hire people they like. so be likable.
Focus on giving key people you work with what they want. At the end of the day, all people want to hear is “i’m going to fix your problems”.
Trust your intuition. People will try and fill your day with shit that doesn’t matter, do what YOU know does matter.
Make some friends, even if just to keep your sanity.
Don’t participate in shit talking. If a co-worker decides you are their confidant, just nod along with them—but never engage directly in the shit talking. You’ll save your own reputation and as a bonus you won’t feel shitty about yourself.
Say NO more. people respect people that can say no and don’t rollover for everything. Saying YES to everything just leaves you running on an endless treadmill.
Under-promise, over-deliver. always.
Make every effort not to give concrete deadlines, because you won’t be able to meet them anyway. Your credibility will falter. Unfortunately you’ll probably have to give them at some point.
Don’t try and be the best. Instead, make friends with people in a position of power and be at least competent.
Learn empathy. In reality, people don’t really care what gets done if you make them feel important and like they are achieving things. People just want to be heard, man.

A lot of these suck to admit….but it’s the way things are. Whether that’s because of some bullshit implicit social contracts or just the way we’re wired….its what corporate life is really like.

Doug Eastling,2y,Have you ever conned a car salesman who thought he was going to con you?,"I once bought a car using my home equity account, which is basically a checking account, for those that aren’t familiar.

Brought it back a couple of days later to have LoJack installed. Got the car home and noticed a serious scratch on the dash that had not been there. Called them up and explained the situation and they kept transferring me around. Finally, someone said to bring it in and they’d look at it to see if they thought it was their installer’s fault or not. He had a very skeptical tone to his voice.

Called the dealer back and the finance guy was kind of stern about getting a new check, so I mentioned that I’d hand deliver it AFTER they resolved the scratch on the dash to my satisfaction.

Paulette Pearce,6mo,What happened when selling a house that made you not sell to the prospective buyer?,"The house that motivated me to stop renting, and buy a place was a “for sale by owner” house. I was young and had never negotiated such a monumental purchase, so I hired a real estate person to represent me. My bad, as she was self-serving and not competent. She told the sellers that she had a buyer for them, but they had to sign a contract with her (more commission for her). She lied to me and said they refused my offer because they “just didn't want to sell to me”. That Saturday morning, I knocked on their door (without the agent) and point blank asked what had really occurred. They told me that my real estate agent said we would both walk unless they signed her contract, and they told her “goodbye”. In the end, I did not buy that house, but for other reasons. I had a 6-month contract with that agent, and she said she would hold me to it and take her commission whether she showed the he houses or not. I kept her SO BUSY for the next few months! I decided that IF she got any commission, she would earn it.

It all worked out. I learned valuable insight into human psychology and greed, as well as more than I ever needed to know about buying a house (from the loan process to hiring closing attorney's and everything in between!)

‘Keep it.’

‘No, no. I don’t want.’

‘Keep it. You are nice.’

After a few ‘take it- keep it’ lines, he gives her two more roses and says ‘Keep these also. Stay happy. Keep smiling.’ and pretends to walk away.

The girl is genuinely smiling now as some random guy at a famous holiday place has given her roses and wished her happiness.

A few seconds later, the guy gives the boyfriend unasked information: ‘Go straight for the tower entrance.’ or ‘Beware of the pickpockets.’ and then asks, ‘Take care, sir. By the way, some money, please?’

The boyfriend understands the scam now. He looks at his girlfriend and her smile now. He can't take back the roses and let the smile drop.

So he gives him the money.

The lesson here is

In this busy, bustling world, especially at a tourist place, no one has the time to come to you genuinely and do you favours without your asking. So beware of the free meals.

Jason Yan,Updated 4y,What has a car salesperson said to you that resulted in you immediately leaving?,"You’re probably expecting some rags-to-riches story about how I walked into a Porsche dealership with raggedy clothes while people ignored me, but then I called my butler who rolled up in a Bentley handing me a suitcase full of cash which I used to buy a 911 Turbo on the spot, right? Sorry, that did not happen.

Once upon a time, I was a new college graduate deep in debt with barely any money after paying rent. An extra $100 each month was hard to come by, and I often wondered why I worked only to give all my money away to taxes and bills.

So after saving an eternity for a car down payment, I was really hoping to buy a more reliable car to get me to work. Not a fancy one. Not even one with power windows and power doors. Something cheap and reliable — the Toyota Corolla CE!

So I walked into the nearest Toyota dealership and told the sales guy I wanted to finance the low-end CE model. I had done my research and had seen their ad in the newspaper. It fit my budget. He insisted on showing me models with fancier features and I looked but then would politely tell him, “No, I can’t afford that. I need the one with nothing, not even AC.” Shit, this CE model didn’t even have hubcaps. Bare steel wheels. I want that!

He tells me, “My friend, no means no” and walks away, leaving me in the parking lot.

I went home to think about what just happened; $1000 difference might have been nothing to him, but that was a lot to me. So the next day I went to a dealership 15 minutes farther and asked to buy the same car again. Again, no power windows, no AC. Hell, I’ll even take the shittiest color you have, beige. What do I care, I need cheap and reliable. This guy here is not trying to impress anybody. Done! Without attitude or judgement from the second dealership, I bought my ugly-as-shit beige Toyota Corolla CE with no hubcaps, no power windows, and no AC. But I was happy!

What I learned is that some dealerships play this game where they advertise cars they have no intention of selling. They keep it on the lot so that their advertisement is legitimate. It’s just there to draw in more potential customers, hoping to convert you to a more expensive car. That works on most people, but not on a starving college graduate who is already concerned about the price of Top Ramen.

Richard Cochran,6mo,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","I used to have cell phone service via Sprint. I had been their customer for about five years when I noticed an extra fee on the bill. I’ve forgotten the exact amount, but it was around $10 monthly, for “ringtone services”. This was before Android or Apple smartphones, but phones could sometimes get custom ringtones. I never intentionally paid for such a thing. I called their customer service, and after around an hour of being put on hold and having to press numbers for menu items, I got to speak to a human. The conversation went something like:

Me: I’d like to cancel this charge for ringtone services

Agent: That service is provided by a third party, and all we do is bill you for it. If you want to cancel, you’ll have to directly contact the company that is providing those services.

Me: Can you give me the contact information?

Agent: I have no way to get that information.

Me: Do you know the name of the company?

Agent: No. You must have signed up for it, so you’ll have to contact them in the same way that you did when you signed up.

Me: I don’t believe I did sign up. I refuse to continue paying that monthly fee. If you can’t cancel just the ringtone services, then I suppose I’ll have to cancel Sprint service entirely, in order to avoid paying that fee.

Agent: You need to take it up with the company that is providing the ringtone service.

Me: You mean the company which you can’t tell me how to contact?

Agent: Yes.

I never paid another Sprint bill. Furthermore, I filed a complaint with my state’s public utilities commission.

Eric Erlandson,Updated 3y,Car salesmen: who was the most “shrewd negotiator” customer you’ve ever had?,"I had a customer that exhausted me with negotiating, but he got himself a great deal.

He would show up on the lot every few weeks showing interest in a new Toyota 4Runner. He would get our best price but never buy. One day during an off-site sale he started to get serious. We went back and forth for quite some time on the price. We had got to a price where my manager didn’t want to budge from anymore. It was something like $34500 (this was over 20 years ago). The customer would not pay this price because he said that the number 4 was unlucky in his culture (not unlucky enough for him to choose to pay a price over $34500). After I badgered my manager more, I finally got the price to $33399 for my customer.

Mind you, I wanted to strangle the customer, but after so many hours negotiating, I didn’t want to walk away without a sale. We got the 4 out of the price, so I thought for sure that I was finally going to be able to wrap up the deal. Wrong! Now he says that anything that ends with 99 is unlucky in his culture. By this point my manager (who was a very friendly, reasonable person) was DONE. He was not going to go another $99, and my customer wasn’t budging either. So there I was, $99 away from a deal.

I finally kicked in $99 out of my pocket (the commission was only $75, but I was getting a $250 spiff from Toyota). But I wanted something to show for the $99 that I put in. The customer owned a Chinese restaurant, so I told him I wanted a gift certificate for some buffets. He offered me 5 buffets (worth about $25-$30 total). Now it was time for me to have some fun. I told him that was not a fair trade for what I put into the deal. So then he offered me 10 buffets. I told him 10 was not a good number for me. He eventually offered 15, but wouldn’t you know it - that’s unlucky for me as well! I finally got 17 buffets from him.

He offered me 5 buffets (worth about $25-$30 total). Now it was time for me to have some fun. I told him that was not a fair trade for what I put into the deal. So then he offered me 10 buffets. I told him 10 was not a good number for me. He eventually offered 15, but wouldn’t you know it - that’s unlucky for me as well! I finally got 17 buffets from him. Only used four of the buffets, but I got some satisfaction in that negotiation.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9997
Shaunak Bhattacharjeee,7mo,What happened when selling a house that made you not sell to the prospective buyer?,"Last year, my father had purchased an apartment and was looking to rent it out. He tried checking with acquaintances and agents offline but was not getting a suitable tenant. So I suggested listing it online on Magic Bricks, 99 Acres and OLX. Since he isn't that tech-savvy, I uploaded the pictures, added all the write-ups even though half of the important specifications were missing, because I had no idea about the house and gave my contact number on the advertisement.

I received at least 5–10 calls in the first hour itself. We didn't even have 5 eager tenant applicants in two months and after listing them online, we got double the number of applicants in a single hour. I was happy that I could help my dad. The callers were very keen to stay there just by looking at the pictures posted online. When I told them that I would call them back the next day, they were even okay to send the first month’s rent as an advance payment to lock the deal. That's when it hit me that this was too good to be true. How could people agree to rent a house they only checked online, without even visiting the place and checking it out themselves?

I shared the same with dad. Dad asked the callers individually for their Aadhar Card, PAN Card and details about employment. Quite strangely, all of them happened to be from the Indian army and the posts mentioned on their ID Cards didn't even exist. The pictures also looked photoshopped in some cases.

Finally, I checked their numbers on Truecaller. That's when it showed that all the numbers - each and every single one of them were frauds. They would pretend to send the rent amount but would instead send a request on Google Pay and instead of money being credited to your account, it would get debited. These scammers have disguised themselves as the Indian army because people would grow patriotic instantly and wouldn't question them much! I deleted the advertisements from the online forums and our hunt for a tenant continued offline for the next few weeks, after which we found a suitable family.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rjge8p26thbo7vu0', 'title': 'What happened when selling a house that made you not sell to the prospective buyer?', 'score': {'original': 0.9345, 'ai': 0.0655}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Last year, my father had purchased an apartment and was looking to rent it out.

James Abbgy,Updated 2y,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","This was recent, last quarter of 2021.

I was growing tired of manually operating my garage door. Like most people (well, most “1st world” people) my car is one of my two most valuable assets, so I don’t like to leave it out in the elements. But during rain or the cold of Michigan winters, getting out of my car to open/close the garage door was a hassle. I decided to automate the issue.

I ordered a new garage door opener from Lowes, and ticked the box for “professional installation.” There was, of course, a charge involved, but I don’t mind paying for quality service. I’m not a totally inept handyman, and could probably have done it myself… but would rather pay a pro to do it right.

My first red flag should have been the company name. Seems Lowes contracted a company called “Handy” for the installation. Should have known I’d get *&&%ed by a company whose name is a euphemism for a sex act. Confusion quickly followed. According to my order, the opener was going to be delivered to my house. According to my receipt from Lowes, the opener was going to be picked up by the installer. According to Handy, they were not going to pick up anything, and I needed to have the opener at my home and ready.

I had a fairly quick, very pleasant call with Lowes support. They were aware of the discrepancy. I have a small car, and was concerned I might not be able to bring the box home. But Lowes got me exact measurements, and I figured I could make it fit in my little two seater. The install was scheduled for Sunday. I was going to go pick it up on Saturday. It arrived at my house on Friday… A surprise, but a welcome one.

Sunday afternoon, I get everything ready. I make sure the garage is clean and clear. I park well out of the way. I first get a call from my installer about 5 minutes before he was scheduled to arrive. He has a family emergency, and needs more time. Life happens. I understand, and tell him to take his time, and let me know if he needs to reschedule. Couple hours later, he calls again, and says he is on his way. Half hour later, he calls and asks if I have a ladder he can borrow… the guy apparently does not have all of the tools he needs for the job? I actually did not have a ladder at that time, so he had to delay further in order to get one.

We meet, briefly discuss the project, and I leave him to it. I’m not one to stand over people’s shoulders. I have some social time scheduled with old friends (Hooray for Covid era videoconferencing?) and settle into that. Some time later I hear what sounds like an uncontrolled slamming of the door. Not long after, the guy asks me to come out and look at a few things.

He starts to explain that the door is broken, shows me a crack, and shows that one of the cables that attach the door to the spring cylinder has come undone. Odd, none of those issues had been present before. He says he can’t finish because of these issues, that obviously have nothing to do with him, but that he can fix if I pay him more. I insist that he do what he can, and that I’d look into the rest.

At the end of the night, I had an opener that was not connected to anything. I pull my car into the garage, start to close the door… and holy hell, garage doors are heavy. Fortunately, I’m not injured trying to keep the door, which is no longer connected to the spring, from slamming down on me. There’s no way I can lift this door to get my car back out, and I need to get to work tomorrow…

Fortunately, my small car is able to turn around in the space of this duplex garage, and the other door still works. I’m able to get my car out of the garage, go to work, and contact Handy. The job is not complete. Things are broken. There is clear shearing on one of the pieces, and a cable broke loose. I call them, and explain everything. They schedule another visit, from a different “pro.”

This visit is scheduled for midday. I leave work early. Pro #2 shows up on time, but has been given no information from Handy. He is not prepared to make repairs. I make more calls to Handy. I detail everything that is wrong, providing pictures. They schedule pro #3. Another midday appointment. Another afternoon where I leave early from work. Pro #3 is a no-call no-show.

I have now lost more in wages than the original install and opener cost. Handy support is a joke. Clearly out of country. No internal communication. I’ve explained the issues many times, but every time I call them (or they call me) I have to explain everything again. It has become clear that no notes are being taken, and no effort will be made to correct the issue.

I eventually called an actual pro to get the job done. He is amazed at the ineptitude shown in the original install. It is a bit pricey, but he does quality work and after weeks of storing my car outside, I’m happy to have it done. Handy does nothing, and insists I’ll have to go through Lowes to get any recompense. They’ll not even reimburse me for the incomplete job that their own contractors confirmed. And the price of that initial install is right at that sweet spot that is a noticed loss, but too low to be worth a court battle.

I won’t buy a thing from Lowes, so long as they partner with Handy. I’ll drive the extra miles to another home improvement store, even if I’m only buying a 3 cent nail. And I won’t even consider Handy.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bjdnitm0hl649eas', 'title': 'What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?', 'score': {'original': 0.62295, 'ai': 0.37705}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This was recent, last quarter of 2021.\n\nI was growing tired of manually operating my garage door.

Tyler Lee,5y,What is the craziest sale you've ever made?,"In high school, I worked as a representative on behalf of various charities. Officially I wasn’t a salesman, but my job was all sales. I was contacting previous donors trying to get them to donate again.

I remember the sale vividly. There was one veteran salesman who blew the 30 or so other salesmen and women out of the water. A good day for the average worker was about $2,000 of donations in an 8-hour shift. Any day where he got less than $20 grand in donations was mediocre. This guy sold like Michael Jackson danced and Sugar Ray Leonard boxed. No one ever tried to beat him, everyone just tried to be number 2 in the office.

One day, about 3 months in, I realized I may have a shot at beating him. I was working on behalf of a very well-known and respected international charity. It was a good day for me. About 3 hours in I was at $7,400 and he was at $7,800. I set out to beat him. I even skipped lunch so I could be #1.

Fate soon seemed to work against me, however. I had fallen behind. I was at $12,000 and he was at $16,000, with only two hours left in the shift. That’s when it happened.

My computer made the call. An older southern gentleman answered. “Great,” I thought. “Another rotten lead. This guy gave $500 7 years ago. He’s not going to give now.”

But, I launched into my pitch. There was silence. Then he spoke.

“You know, I never gave anything to (charity name). My mother was a big supporter, I’m sure she gave the $500 in my name. My dad left her a lot of money, and she gave a lot of it away before she died and I got the rest. But, I haven’t been too good about using it how she’d want me to…suppose I gave you guys $20,000. How much good would that do?”

I almost jumped out of my seat. I had a list in my cubicle of what different donations amounts would do to help the cause, but it only went up to $5,000. So I just quadrupled that. We both agreed that would do a lot of good. But I wanted to push it further. I personally love this charity more than any other, AND I wanted to be #1 in the office. For the next 20 minutes, I gave the greatest performance of my young life. We went back and forth and back again. The woman sitting in the next cubicle turned off her phone so she could watch me. And then, it was over.

$85,000. He had agreed to give the charity $85,000. I ended the day breaking two new records, single largest donation and largest amount raised in a day ($104,000). The previous records were $18,500 and $74,000 respectively.

I even got a handshake from the man himself, the greatest salesman in the office. Life was good.

The only way it could’ve been better is if the job paid commissions…

Anonymous,Updated 6y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"I am a software engineer, working in a good product based company for 1.5 years.According to me lessons I have learned in corporate world are as follows :

1.Never ever fall in love with any girl from your company :

Here is my experience. I was in love with a girl from my team. We were very close. Everyone knew that. For initial 1 year I felt very good that I got new friends. But as year passed, everyone joined with me started to switch jobs. One of my colleagues got job in a very big company with very good package. And shit started from there. The girl with whom I was close started ignoring me. She became close with that guy who got good job. All this was to get a job in his new company through referral. So don’t take anyone for granted. I am not saying don’t make female friends. Make friends, but don’t get attached to them emotionally. It hurts a LOT !!

2. Never show anger to any of the colleague or any company employee :

I am telling this one because you are in company to work not to get involved with anyone. If you show anger to someone, you never know the very next day you have to work with them(not by wish but to get your work done). So stay diplomatic with everyone and get your work done.

3. Don’t let anyone make fun of you :

If someone makes fun of you and you don’t reply, he will assume that you liked it. And you will become a topic of fun in the office. I am not saying stay rude to all. Upto certain limit fun is okay, but it should not become only topic of fun in office. Give a proper reply at correct time.Or you will regret later.

I think all other point are covered in other answers. I don’t want to repeat them again.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/detk8712a6bc054x', 'title': 'What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am a software engineer, working in a good product based company for 1.5 years.According to me lessons I have learned in corporate world are as follows :\n\n1.Never ever fall in love with any girl from your company :\n\nHere is my experience.

Jim Parker,5y,"What was the one time you ""owned"" a salesperson, and what happened?","Years ago, I saved up the cash to purchase a new car, and was going to purchase a Ford Taurus SHO. I had done a ton of research and knew what a good deal would be (Internet price searches were much more difficult and unusual back in those days). I drove to the local Ford dealership. Probably because of the old clunker I was driving at the time, none of the sales people rushed out to greet me. There was one SHO in the showroom, so I walked over to check it out. It wasn’t the color I wanted, but was otherwise exactly what I wanted. I finally had to go into one of the sales guy’s offices and told him “I want one exactly like this, but white instead of black, and I’m willing to pay ($amount) for it - out the door, including taxes, title — everything. You’re the first dealership I’ve been to, so you get first chance. Do we have a deal or not?”

He literally laughed in my face, and said “You don’t want that one. It’s the SHO with the high-output V8, and it’s a manual transmission.” I said “Actually, it’s a Yamaha-tuned V6, with dual intake runners, and a manual transmission. I’ve done a lot of research on the car, and that one is exactly what I want, other than the color. Do you want to sell me the car, or not?”

After a bunch more back and forth, he wrote up an “offer sheet” with my offer, and took it to his sales manager. Upon return, he had a new offer letter for me to sign — it was $5,000 above my offer, and did not include TTL. I stood up, and walked out the door, with the salesman chasing me the whole way. As I was getting into my clunker, he’s telling me I don’t understand the car buying process, etc. I stopped, and looked him in the eye, and said “You don’t know the car selling process. When a guy shows up with cash to buy a new car, and makes you a fair offer, $500 above your invoice price, not including the dealer hold-backs, and you run him out of the dealership, that’s just stupidity. Here’s my business card. Write down my offer, and when you’re ready to sell me the car I want at the price I want, give me a call.” At that point, I drove away.

Two weeks later, I got a call from the sales guy, telling me they are ready to sell me an SHO (white - in stock) at my price. I reiterated the price I was willing to pay, and the optional equipment I wanted on the car, and he said, “Yep, we’ve got a deal. Come get your new car.”

I drove to the dealership, where the salesman met me by my car, and took me to see “my” car. It had everything I wanted, except it also had a sunroof, which I did NOT like or want. I told him I didn’t want the sunroof, and would not pay anything extra for it, and he said “Come on inside, and I’ll see what I can do about that.” So we went back to his desk, and we wrote up an offer sheet for that specific car, at my price, and went to the sales manager for approval. He was gone for maybe 15 minutes, and when he came back, it was with another offer sheet from the sales manager, with the same $5,000 (+TTL) above my offer. He’s just beaming at me… So I stood up, and walked out of the dealership without saying a word. The salesman chased me all the way to my car, trying to get me to come back in and talk. Nothing doing. I was more than a little angry at how they had wasted my time.

Two weeks later, he calls me again, saying they’re at month-end and he and the sales manager both need to sell a few more cars for some contest they have going on, and they are ready to make the deal with me on the white SHO. So I go back in again, we write up the offer, and again he returns with an offer sheet from the sales manager that is $3,000 above my price, and again doesn’t include TTL. This time, I was absolutely furious as I left the dealership. Twice they’d lied to me and had wasted a lot of my time.

In fact, I was furious enough that when I got back to the office, I decided to call the owner of the dealership, a local guy but not someone I’d ever met. It took maybe 10 minutes to get him on the phone, but once I did, I very calmly and politely explained what had happened, and asked him if this was what a customer should expect from his dealership, sales manager, and salesman. He said that he was disappointed that they had wasted my time. I then told him that I was still willing to purchase the car from them at my price (including TTL), which still allowed them a $500 profit margin on the car, not including dealer hold-backs. But I told him I did not want the sunroof, and would not pay for it if they wanted to sell me the specific car they had on their lot. Then I point-blank asked him, “Are you willing to sell me the car at that price, or not? If not, I’ll go find another dealer who will.” He asked me to give him 10 minutes and he would call me back. Sure enough, in 10 minutes, I got a call-back from him, saying “Come get your car.” I told him I’d heard that line before, but he assured me that everything was ready, and they would have the contract written up and ready for me to sign when I walked in the door.

I drove to the dealership, where I was met at my car by the same sales guy. I said, “I’m not talking to you. I’m here to pay for my car and leave.” He said, “I know - I’m supposed to escort you to the office to sign the paperwork.” Literally 10 minutes later, I was walking out to my new white Taurus SHO (with the sunroof), having written a check for exactly (to the penny) the amount I had offered on my first visit to the dealership.

As I’m getting into the car, the sales guy says “You know, I’m pretty pissed off with you. You got both me and my sales manager into a world of trouble with the owner, and there was just no reason for you to handle it that way.” I stopped, looked him in the eye, and said “Two weeks ago, I made you the exact same offer for the exact same car, and told you I would not pay even a penny more for it. You and your sales manager were too dumb to take the deal that offered your dealership a reasonable profit margin on the car. Instead, you lied to get me to come back out here, only to lie to me some more. Then you did it again! You had every chance in the world to make the deal without outside interference, and you weren’t smart enough to take those opportunities. So don’t give me any crap about ‘getting you into trouble’ over that. You’re the one who wasted my time, and your own.”

His jaw was still hanging open as I left the dealership in my new white Taurus SHO… It was a great car that I owned for 10+ years, and we used it to teach all three kids to drive a stick.

+++ EDITED TO ADD INFO +++

A couple of people have asked “Why not just go to another dealership?” That was definitely the plan, but I was working 65–70 hours per week at that time, and there were no other Ford dealerships nearby. This one was on my way to the office, so it was very convenient to stop by after work or run there during lunch. Next closest dealer was maybe 30–45 minutes away in heavy traffic, so 90 minute round trip. So all this took place before I got around to visiting another dealer.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0v5gz3p7i4u6rnfq', 'title': 'What was the one time you ""owned"" a salesperson, and what happened?', 'score': {'original': 0.36253333333333, 'ai': 0.63746666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Years ago, I saved up the cash to purchase a new car, and was going to purchase a Ford Taurus SHO.

I’ve done a lot of research on the car, and that one is exactly what I want, other than the color. Do you want to sell me the car, or not?”\n\nAfter a bunch more back and forth, he wrote up an “offer sheet” with my offer, and took it to his sales manager. Upon return, he had a new offer letter for me to sign — it was $5,000 above my offer, and did not include TTL. I stood up, and walked out the door, with the salesman chasing me the whole way. As I was getting into my clunker, he’s telling me I don’t understand the car buying process, etc. I stopped, and looked him in the eye, and said “You don’t know the car selling process. When a guy shows up with cash to buy a new car, and makes you a fair offer, $500 above your invoice price, not including the dealer hold-backs, and you run him out of the dealership, that’s just stupidity. Here’s my business card. Write down my offer, and when you’re ready to sell me the car I want at the price I want, give me a call.” At that point, I drove away.\n\nTwo weeks later, I got a call from the sales guy, telling me they are ready to sell me an SHO (white - in stock) at my price. I reiterated the price I was willing to pay, and the optional equipment I wanted on the car, and he said, “Yep, we’ve got a deal. Come get your new car.”\n\nI drove to the dealership, where the salesman met me by my car, and took me to see “my” car. It had everything I wanted, except it also had a sunroof, which I did NOT like or want. I told him I didn’t want the sunroof, and would not pay anything extra for it, and he said “Come on inside, and I’ll see what I can do about that.” So we went back to his desk, and we wrote up an offer sheet for that specific car, at my price, and went to the sales manager for approval. He was gone for maybe 15 minutes, and when he came back, it was with another offer sheet from the sales manager, with the same $5,000 (+TTL) above my offer. He’s just beaming at me… So I stood up, and walked out of the dealership without saying a word. The salesman chased me all the way to my car, trying to get me to come back in and talk. Nothing doing. I was more than a little angry at how they had wasted my time.\n\nTwo weeks later, he calls me again, saying they’re at month-end and he and the sales manager both need to sell a few more cars for some contest they have going on, and they are ready to make the deal with me on the white SHO. So I go back in again, we write up the offer, and again he returns with an offer sheet from the sales manager that is $3,000 above my price, and again doesn’t include TTL. This time, I was absolutely furious as I left the dealership. Twice they’d lied to me and had wasted a lot of my time.\n\nIn fact, I was furious enough that when I got back to the office, I decided to call the owner of the dealership, a local guy but not someone I’d ever met. It took maybe 10 minutes to get him on the phone, but once I did, I very calmly and politely explained what had happened, and asked him if this was what a customer should expect from his dealership, sales manager, and salesman. He said that he was disappointed that they had wasted my time. I then told him that I was still willing to purchase the car from them at my price (including TTL), which still allowed them a $500 profit margin on the car, not including dealer hold-backs. But I told him I did not want the sunroof, and would not pay for it if they wanted to sell me the specific car they had on their lot. Then I point-blank asked him, “Are you willing to sell me the car at that price, or not? If not, I’ll go find another dealer who will.” He asked me to give him 10 minutes and he would call me back. Sure enough, in 10 minutes, I got a call-back from him, saying “Come get your car.” I told him I’d heard that line before, but he assured me that everything was ready, and they would have the contract written up and ready for me to sign when I walked in the door.\n\nI drove to the dealership, where I was met at my car by the same sales guy. I said, “I’m not talking to you. I’m here to pay for my car and leave.” He said, “I know - I’m supposed to escort you to the office to sign the paperwork.” Literally 10 minutes later, I was walking out to my new white Taurus SHO (with the sunroof), having written a check for exactly (to the penny) the amount I had offered on my first visit to the dealership.\n\nAs I’m getting into the car, the sales guy says “You know, I’m pretty pissed off with you. You got both me and my sales manager into a world of trouble with the owner, and there was just no reason for you to handle it that way.” I stopped, looked him in the eye, and said “Two weeks ago, I made you the exact same offer for the exact same car, and told you I would not pay even a penny more for it. You and your sales manager were too dumb to take the deal that offered your dealership a reasonable profit margin on the car. Instead, you lied to get me to come back out here, only to lie to me some more. Then you did it again! You had every chance in the world to make the deal without outside interference, and you weren’t smart enough to take those opportunities. So don’t give me any crap about ‘getting you into trouble’ over that. You’re the one who wasted my time, and your own.”\n\nHis jaw was still hanging open as I left the dealership in my new white Taurus SHO… It was a great car that I owned for 10+ years, and we used it to teach all three kids to drive a stick.\n\n+++ EDITED TO ADD INFO +++\n\nA couple of people have asked “Why not just go to another dealership?” That was definitely the plan, but I was working 65–70 hours per week at that time, and there were no other Ford dealerships nearby. This one was on my way to the office, so it was very convenient to stop by after work or run there during lunch. Next closest dealer was maybe 30–45 minutes away in heavy traffic, so 90 minute round trip. So all this took place before I got around to visiting another dealer.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.36253333333333
Tina Torrest,4y,What has a car salesperson said to you that resulted in you immediately leaving?,"I’m a Jeep girl. Always have been; always will be.

My first “car” was a white Wrangler with hot pink pinstripes (don’t judge. It was the ’80s). That one was traded in for a red Wrangler in ’97 (which I still own to this day). Once I got pregnant with Spawn #1, however, it was time to get a family vehicle, and we headed back to my trusty Jeep salesman for the third time and picked up a used Grand Cherokee.

It served us well, but by 2013, it was time to trade in the old gal for a newer model. The kids were bigger by this time, and between their sports or music equipment plus their entourage of friends, we knew we needed a third row. Not an option on the Cherokee, so I went in search of a non-Jeep option.

It was weird to think about buying from a new dealership, but there were plenty of options out there beyond my beloved Jeeps which wouldn’t require me caving to convention and settling for a minivan, right?

Anything but the dreaded minivan!

After some internet sleuthing, I decided to check out the Lincoln Navigator in person. A salesman greeted me on the lot, took note of my beater Cherokee, and after a bit of scripted chit-chat, asked me to come inside and fill out a contact form.

Ugh. Okay, fine. Whatever.

I handed the completed form across the desk, and Sales Guy scanned it over. “You put ‘author’ in the employment field.”

The way he said it was strange. As if he wanted to make sure I hadn’t made a mistake.

“Yes,” I said, proudly. “That’s my job.”

He literally rolled his eyes as he snickered, “And what kind of books do you write?”

“Romance,” I replied, chin held high. I’ve encountered enough people over the years who were content to snub the entire genre. I had to learn pretty early on to grow a thick skin about my chosen subject matter.

Another eyeroll. “That’s cute,” he snarked. He went on to make a few joking comments about “bored housewife… little hobby… Fifty Shades… no income and you’re looking at a $40,000 vehicle…” all in supposed good fun, just kidding around with me. I don’t remember his exact words because I was fuming by this point.

Now. Here’s the part where I tell you that I had only released my third novel by then. But it was the final book in a trilogy which had somehow managed to find some success, so I had just quit my day job(s) and gone all-in on the writing thing. That year was a turning point, not just financially, but because I had just started allowing myself the right to call myself an author.

And there I was for the first time actually trying out my new title in public, and this clown was mocking me for it.

I leaned back in my chair and cocked my head. “You know, I don’t normally go around bragging about this, but I happen to be a New York Times bestselling author.* I’ve already made six figures from my ‘cute little hobby’ this year alone.** So, yeah. I’m able to buy a new SUV.”

I wish I could tell you that I added, “Just not this one,” and got up from my chair while his mouth gaped in shock before he ran after me begging for forgiveness and pleading for my business. But that’s not how the story went down. Instead, I politely said my goodbyes and left that particular dealership, holding true to my convictions that I would never buy a car from that place.

Regardless of the fact that my little rebellion was entirely unknown to that snarky salesman, I was proud of my choice to deny him the commission.

I ended up buying a Ford Explorer from an awesome dude who thought my career was “groovy.”

No regrets.

~ Tina

Scott Baldridge,8mo,What happened when selling a house that made you not sell to the prospective buyer?,"We listed our house in 2016 during a red-hot sellers market. In the Pacific Northwest, houses were selling in 1–2 days. We were hoping to sell quickly because we’d just built another home and two mortgages would be a lot to handle.

When the house finally listed we had a full price offer of $275k on the first day and we were thrilled. We didn’t think twice about accepting it with only one contingency - a home inspection, which is common here. We arranged for the inspection which would take one week.

You know there’s often more to the story. *Image from CBS News.

We were a little concerned when the buyer asked to have an HVAC inspection using their own company instead of using the home inspector, but we gave our permission without asking why.

Their HVAC company did their inspection a few days before the previously-arranged home inspector was supposed to show up. We were presented with a quote for $15k to fix several problems: AC too small, gas fireplace won’t ignite, the furnace was not installed to building code, and the furnace didn’t work. The first words out of my mouth were “what the F?”.

Since it was springtime, we’d been running the AC and furnace on and off before showings so we knew they worked. We contacted the owner of our HVAC company who installed the furnace only three years before and he came out immediately to check on all these issues. We contacted the buyer’s realtor and we all went to our house to check out this mystery.

Our HVAC guy:

-measured the AC unit and determined it was sized properly for our home.

-the fireplace igniter was disassembled by “someone”. We put it together and it started right up.

-now the HVAC guy went into our crawl space where he confirmed the furnace was installed to code.

-we tested the furnace and it wouldn’t start. Our guy tested a few things and finally removed the steel face and found the igniter power wire had been unscrewed and the nut carefully set to the side for a quick reattach!

Not my furnace but you get the idea. A nut was carefully removed and wire pushed aside. *Image from Google images.

We’d been sabotaged.

With the buyer’s agent standing right there, I asked why her client had done such an obvious job of messing with the system. She quickly became very nervous and near tears but I had a feeling she wasn’t involved. In her nervousness, she started telling us that she’d visited at least 20 houses with these people and they’d made many lowball offers, always sticking to prices that were too low. We assumed they had made a plan to buy and then demand price concessions after “inspecting” the HVAC. They probably had a family member that worked there or arranged for a kickback. In my head I’ve made the plot much more sinister over the years.

I told my realtor we weren’t going to work with this buyer. No deal. We’d take the property off the market before selling and if they pressed us they would regret it as we had a lot of evidence that they’d tampered with our HVAC systems. They walked away with their earnest money (pun intended).

Since we had offers so quickly we increased the price by $10k and removed the “pending” status. After a few days we had an all cash offer which we accepted.

So, the silver lining … a learning experience! I’m happy we had a trustworthy realtor on our side.

Yes, many times.

Generally with the salesman making statements like “if you leave, this deal will be gone and you won’t be able to get it back” or “if you walk away from this deal, it’ll cost you $1000 when you come back tomorrow”.

Every time. Every. Single. Time. I got a call back with a better deal. Sometimes I took it, some times I had already gone to another dealership and had purchased the vehicle at the price I was willing to pay.

Story time:

My wife and I decided our ancient, well-worn pop-up camper wasn’t what we wanted to go camping in anymore. We wanted a travel trailer with more room and features to make our camping more comfortable. We had decided to become glampers. After poking through a lot of different models and features, we settled on a specific model and set of features that we wanted. When we went to searching for one we looked for used models, but there were very few available and had to consider purchasing new.

The brand was StarCraft and StarCraft only allows one dealer per area, so there really was no local competition, but calling around to the dealerships in neighboring cities we got a good sense for what the camper would really sell for. We headed down to our local StarCraft dealer and they had the exact model we were looking for on the lot. It was everything we expected, but when it got to talking about the price, the salesman would only quote the MSRP for the camper and the MSRP was $5000 over what the dealership in the next town was asking. I mentioned this and response was that as a salesman, that was the only price he could quote and if I wasn’t willing to pay that I’d have to talk to the sales manager, but he had gone home for the night. I set an appointment to meet the sales manager over lunch the next day and headed home.

The next day at work I called the dealer in the next town over and asked him to verify all of the features and the out the door price. The salesman did me one better, he faxed me a sales order and said that all I had to do was sign it and fax it back to him and the camper was ours. I headed to the local dealership armed with the offer from the other dealer. When I arrived, I was put in a room and asked to wait. After 30 minutes I was needing to head back to work and went out to the sales floor to ask what was going on. The salesman from the other night said he’d have the paperwork for me in 5 minutes and asked me to just wait in the room. I went back and about 5 minutes later the salesman walked in and put a credit application in front of me and told me to fill it out. I told him I wasn’t filling out a credit application, I was here to negotiate the price with the sales manager. He said that the sales manager had left for lunch, wouldn’t be back for an hour, and it would take at least that long to process my application. I pulled out my checkbook and said I was paying cash, so no, I wouldn’t fill out any application for credit under any circumstances and since he had wasted my lunch hour, I was leaving.

The salesman had a blank look and said he would get the sales contract as the manager had given him the bottom dollar. I agreed to wait for that. The sales contract he put in front of me discounted the price by $1000, but now the camper magically suddenly had over $1000 in add-ons like scotch-guard, upgraded wheels, UV protectorate, etc. I just shook my head and walked out of the room. I got the same old “if you don’t sign this the price goes back up” spiel from the salesman. I turned around and showed him the sales order from the other dealership that had an out the door price $5000 less than what they were trying to offer me. The salesman wanted to keep it so he could try to get the sales manager to match the price. I told him not to bother as I had a bonafide offer in hand that I didn’t have to battle for.

I went back to the office and the sales manager had already left me a message and begged me to call him back, so I did. Now he was so apologetic that he couldn’t meet me because he had a family emergency, but now that he was back he could straighten it all out. He would match the price from the other dealership, but he couldn’t remove the added items because they had already been applied and you couldn’t un-ScotchGuard the fabrics. I told him that was unfortunate as I had a bonafide offer and was willing to drive 60 miles to get it, so he was again wasting my time.

I ended the call and immediately called the other dealer to tell them I’d take their offer. The salesman asked if I had been trying to deal with my local dealer. I told him I was. He said the sales manager had called him trying to discourage them from selling their camper to me calling me an overbearing and demanding customer that they’d regret dealing with and that they had ultimately refused to sell me the camper. I was gobsmacked and asked what he was planning on doing. He said a deal was a deal, so it was mine if I wanted it. I did.

At the closing table, the owner of the dealership where I purchased asked me a few questions about my local dealership. I relayed the experience I had and he confirmed that I wasn’t the first buyer that had made the 60 mile drive because of that sales manager. He then handed me a card with the 800 number for StarCraft customer service and suggested I may want to share my experience with them. (I did) Then he gave me card for 10% off of any accessories and service for the lifetime of the camper since I’d have to drive an extra hour to get to their dealership.

I still make the drive every time.

Bobby Tucker,Updated 3y,What has been the rudest salesperson you have ever experienced?,"Some time in mid- to late-2008 a new loadmaster joined our unit. She was young and beautiful, standing only 5′02″ (I’m 6′04″), with reddish brown hair and the most perfectly adorable sprinkling of freckles. And even as tiny as she was, her smile could fill an auditorium.

I worked full time for the Air Force Reserve, so I was at the squadron all the time. She was a traditional reservist, meaning she wasn’t around very much. I saw her no more than a handful of times for probably her first four to six months in the unit. I practically didn’t know she existed, even though I’m sure you find that hard to believe based on the opening paragraph. But it wasn’t until early 2009 that I saw the woman in the first paragraph. She’d been there all along, I just didn’t realize it. I had never even spoken to her.

And while I have strayed a bit already in my answer, I’ll try to keep the rest pertinent to the question as much as I can. I was craving sushi for lunch one day and no one else was interested in going, until I heard a voice from a corner desk pipe up, “I like sushi.” And lest you forget, I hadn’t spoken a word to her before this. I had just seen her in the squadron a few times, but on this particular day my craving just happened to coincide with a day that she was at the unit working on some paperwork.

So she and I went to lunch together…. and fell madly in love while we were at it. She was 21, I was 40. I had never dated someone more than a year or two younger than me. I thought I was crazy when she seemed interested and internally chastised myself for being such a fool. You’ll think me a liar, and that’s okay, I wouldn’t believe it if I wasn’t there to see it for myself, but she actually pursued me. And even now I have no idea what that vibrant young girl saw in such a boring old man.

We married in July after a whirlwind courtship of only a few months. I know better than to say she was perfect, but she was perfect for me. In fact, she was the great love of my life. She was from Ohio, I am from South Carolina, and our lives intersected in Montgomery, Alabama. Who’d a thunk it?

In April 2010, just 9 months after we were married, she was killed in an accident on our property. We had a few acres, some horses, and we were trying to get some work done around the place before I was to leave on yet another deployment. She turned the tractor over on herself while I looked on, helpless to save her from where I stood. She was just 22, and I was now widowed at 41.

I got the surpassing joy of enduring two memorial services, one here and one in northeast Ohio. As I drove back to Alabama following the Ohio service, I could not bear the thought of walking into my empty house. It’d be the first time I was there alone. The house had been filled with family from the day she died until I left for Ohio.

I called my friends, a husband and wife that Leigha and I knew from church, as I approached the Montgomery area. I asked them if we could meet somewhere, anything to avoid going back to that house for at least a little while more. I couldn’t think and kept fumbling while trying to come up with an idea. Finally, and I know it’s strange, goofy, weird, what have you, I asked them to meet me at the Harley-Davidson dealership. I just wanted to kill some time and wander aimlessly while doing nothing. I didn’t care one whit about a single thing in there of course. I couldn’t even see if you know what I mean. I could barely breathe.

A salesman approached me, trying to sell me a motorcycle. I told him as politely as possible that I wasn’t interested. I was sure the pain was written all over my face and was in my voice. Could he not see it or hear it? He approached a bit more aggressively a second time, and a third. I didn’t feel the need to explain myself. I didn’t think I could without falling apart. But finally, after his fourth attempt, I offered to take him to the car and show him my wife’s ashes, buckled as lovingly as ashes can be into the front passenger seat. I told him I was just getting back into town from her funeral out of state and that I was just trying to avoid going home as long as I could.

And with his attitude he called me a liar. He didn’t say the words he didn’t believe me, but he said he didn’t believe me all the same. He turned from me with a contemptuous huff and didn’t offer so much as an apology or his condolences. Leigha and I had seen this man several times that we had been in that store buying things for the motorcycle that we owned. I suppose it’s possible he had never paid us any mind on those occasions and therefore had no idea who I was, or I suppose it’s possible he didn’t recognize me in the state I was in and without the beautiful woman that was usually with me. But even if that’s true, when a grown man breaks down, begging you to leave him alone, and offers to show you his wife’s ashes between sobs, maybe you ought to at least consider apologizing.

If there was any good news to be had, it was that my father was at my house when I got there. He had driven back from South Carolina to be there when I arrived so that I wouldn’t have to come back to an empty house after all.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/k08zyr4lqexatci3', 'title': 'What has been the rudest salesperson you have ever experienced?', 'score': {'original': 0.99215, 'ai': 0.00785}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Some time in mid- to late-2008 a new loadmaster joined our unit.

You’ll think me a liar, and that’s okay, I wouldn’t believe it if I wasn’t there to see it for myself, but she actually pursued me. And even now I have no idea what that vibrant young girl saw in such a boring old man.\n\nWe married in July after a whirlwind courtship of only a few months. I know better than to say she was perfect, but she was perfect for me. In fact, she was the great love of my life. She was from Ohio, I am from South Carolina, and our lives intersected in Montgomery, Alabama. Who’d a thunk it?\n\nIn April 2010, just 9 months after we were married, she was killed in an accident on our property. We had a few acres, some horses, and we were trying to get some work done around the place before I was to leave on yet another deployment. She turned the tractor over on herself while I looked on, helpless to save her from where I stood. She was just 22, and I was now widowed at 41.\n\nI got the surpassing joy of enduring two memorial services, one here and one in northeast Ohio. As I drove back to Alabama following the Ohio service, I could not bear the thought of walking into my empty house. It’d be the first time I was there alone. The house had been filled with family from the day she died until I left for Ohio.\n\nI called my friends, a husband and wife that Leigha and I knew from church, as I approached the Montgomery area. I asked them if we could meet somewhere, anything to avoid going back to that house for at least a little while more. I couldn’t think and kept fumbling while trying to come up with an idea. Finally, and I know it’s strange, goofy, weird, what have you, I asked them to meet me at the Harley-Davidson dealership. I just wanted to kill some time and wander aimlessly while doing nothing. I didn’t care one whit about a single thing in there of course. I couldn’t even see if you know what I mean. I could barely breathe.\n\nA salesman approached me, trying to sell me a motorcycle. I told him as politely as possible that I wasn’t interested. I was sure the pain was written all over my face and was in my voice. Could he not see it or hear it? He approached a bit more aggressively a second time, and a third. I didn’t feel the need to explain myself. I didn’t think I could without falling apart. But finally, after his fourth attempt, I offered to take him to the car and show him my wife’s ashes, buckled as lovingly as ashes can be into the front passenger seat. I told him I was just getting back into town from her funeral out of state and that I was just trying to avoid going home as long as I could.\n\nAnd with his attitude he called me a liar. He didn’t say the words he didn’t believe me, but he said he didn’t believe me all the same. He turned from me with a contemptuous huff and didn’t offer so much as an apology or his condolences. Leigha and I had seen this man several times that we had been in that store buying things for the motorcycle that we owned. I suppose it’s possible he had never paid us any mind on those occasions and therefore had no idea who I was, or I suppose it’s possible he didn’t recognize me in the state I was in and without the beautiful woman that was usually with me. But even if that’s true, when a grown man breaks down, begging you to leave him alone, and offers to show you his wife’s ashes between sobs, maybe you ought to at least consider apologizing.\n\nIf there was any good news to be had, it was that my father was at my house when I got there. He had driven back from South Carolina to be there when I arrived so that I wouldn’t have to come back to an empty house after all.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.99215
Jan Rosenzweig,3y,"Everyone's heard the phrase ""you get what you pay for."" What are some examples of when the opposite is true, and a cheaper product does a better job?","This beauty:

It is an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Selfwinding Chrono 44mm. An iconic, beautiful watch. It will set you back a very reasonable GBP 45,000 in the UK.

Whereas, this beauty

is a quartz watch that you can buy in an airport duty free shop for 25 quid.

It is more accurate, more reliable, virtually indestructible and water resistant to 100 metres. Which, let’s face it, is about 50–60 metres more than most professional divers ever see in a lifetime. And if you do damage it, it is only 25 quid to get a new one. You could be buying a new one every year for 20 years and only spend 500 quid. Which would leave you with some 44,500 change from the Royal Oak.

In terms of having an exquisite piece of machinery that you can admire, no contest - it’s the Royal Oak. Although you will probably never even see the machinery - you will just see the case.

In terms of leaving something to your grandchildren, no contest - it’s the Royal Oak. The quartz will last, but they will probably stop making the batteries at some point.

But in terms of having a reliable watch that you can take anywhere and it will tell you the time accurately, it is also no contest - it’s the quartz.

Oh, and if you really, really need a chronograph - you can get that in a 25 quid quartz watch from the airport duty free as well.

BRVIDEO FCP,02-Jan,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","Lowe’s. Went to the store and ordered a GE gas wall kitchen oven with 5 year extended warranty. Not in stock, they had to order it and I had to wait. Because of a unique kitchen cut out and old house, I had few options. I call the store a few times over several weeks to try to get a status update. “Should be coming in soon”. Three months later they call to say GE no longer makes the model. Come in and pick another or get a refund.

I go in, get my refund and decide to do some more research. A few days later I go back to Lowe’s and order a Frigidaire gas wall oven and 5 year warranty. Not in stock, have to pay and wait for it to come in. I do so. About three months later they call to say that model is no longer made. Come in and pick another or come and get a refund.

I go in to get the refund. When they refund me, I notice I did not get refunded the $300 for the 5 year extended warranty. The cashier tells me they don’t give refunds on the warranties in the store. I have to call a special Lowe’s Telephone number to get that refunded separately.

I go home and then spent the next two weeks in automated telephone carousels trying to get to somebody who can orchestrate the refund. Probably spent 40 hours in total on the phone at different times before finally getting somebody. They had no record of the sale so I have to email them all my purchase and refund receipts. I do so. More run around. After a few weeks I get a check in the mail for the refund.

It then occurs to me…did I get a refund on the GE oven extended warranty I ordered first? I go back and look at the receipts and see they did not give me the $300 warranty refund on that one, and I didn’t notice.

Back to the store who tells me I must call the telephone number. Back on the phone trying to get to the right person. Did I mention this telephone number they have me calling has no weekend hours and limited weekday hours? When I do reach someone they have no record of the sale or return so I need to send them all copies of my receipts, which I do. Weeks later, no word. And no response from more hours on the phone. Mostly on hold.

I write a letter and send it through the mail to Lowe’s corporate office. I gave them documentation and photocopies of every single receipt and my timeline of purchases, calls, emails…every interaction, everything. I explain what’s been happening.

A few days later I get a letter from them saying they’d be happy to assist. All I have to do is call this telephone number (the one I’d been calling).

At that point my stomach could no longer bear it and I had to decide if $300 was worth the stress and time. I let it go.

I wouldn’t purchase a nail from Lowe’s ever again.

At that point I searched the internet and found the first GE oven I wanted at Plessers Appliances. I call them. They had five in stock. So the model wasn’t discontinued. I ordered it from a salesperson on the same call on which I confirmed it was in stock. I paid by debit card and it was installed 3 days later.

A true story. No embellishments.

Why didn’t I just go to Plessers to begin with? I didn’t know they existed. Their closest store to me was about 50 miles away in a town I never visit. But more importantly, initially I had no reason to doubt the information Lowe’s gave me about both models being discontinued. I know wall gas ovens are becoming more and more rare, so it seemed possible. And I didn’t want to deal with a gas to electric oven conversion, but that probably would have been the next step. But not with Lowes.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1qfd2i0p6eo7nz4a', 'title': 'What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?', 'score': {'original': 0.65765, 'ai': 0.34235}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Lowe’s.

Misha Appleton,3y,How can we get sales for our Shopify website?,"The first few transactions are particularly important when launching a new e-commerce website. These sales promote positive development and can be used to improve marketing strategies and overcome business obstacles. Unfortunately, these first sales are also the most difficult to achieve.

Here are a few tips on how to get sales.

1. Send the message to your email distribution list.

creating a (small) email list is an important first step in starting a business. If you have a pre-launch list, please email these contacts first. These contacts may be your most qualified potential customers at first because they have already expressed interest and gave you an email address for more information.

If you don’t have an email distribution list, please skip this point.

2. Sell directly to relatives and friends.

The most basic strategy for making the first sale: Let friends and family shop with you as usual. This does not mean that you should persuade your mother to buy products she does not need. Consider which friends or family members will like and use your product. Contact these people directly and ask for a few minutes to showcase your product.

3. Organize lotteries, contests or distribute gifts

Honestly speaking: Promotional gifts, so-called gifts, have always been a popular way to draw people's attention to new products. One might say that freebies mostly attract people seeking deals. However, if done correctly, the viral competition will generate a lot of initial traffic and recommendations among friends. This will help you expand the presence and knowledge of stores and products. If participants mention your product or store on social media, you can give participants a greater chance of winning, and you can use some of these very good apps to enhance and extend the giveaway.

4. Sell to friends strategically through social networks.

Therefore, you have been able to persuade friends or relatives to buy directly from you. Maybe you do something together or sell to someone at a meeting or party. It's time to start developing a social media strategy. You are safe on Facebook, aren't you? So how do you sell to friends on Facebook?

Before launching your business and products to the public, start wisely with a strategic approach. Using Facebook's powerful social graph search function, you can find people who are most likely to be interested in your product and will use product-related keyword searches to make purchases.

Therefore, once you find someone with potential product interest in your friends’ list, please contact him or her immediately. In addition to this targeted approach, you can also try the watering can principle: post some status updates to introduce your new store to your Facebook friends. Since you are talking with friends and family, please consider whether the ""Family and Friends Discount"" makes sense.

5. Sell on other marketplaces.

To become a successful online entrepreneur, you must try everything, including other channels (such as the market). Sites such as eBay and Craigslist may be good places for first sales. First of all, they are great because these markets already have traffic and product searches. This will give you an initial boost when you build SEO and organic traffic on Google.

6. Be part of the Reddit community.

Reddit is a huge community of smart people, divided into specific market segments or market segments based on their interests. With thousands of subreddit, you will definitely find a suitable market segment and expect to have a high degree of interest in the product.

But please note that you cannot start selling products only through these subcategories. In order for Reddit to serve you, you must become a member of the community and participate. What you get is not only potential sales but also a community of like-minded people with whom you can build a good relationship.

7. Post an ad on Facebook.

The seventh biggest sales challenge you face is to generate sales through Facebook’s own advertising platform. Facebook has the most precisely adjusted advertising features on any platform and is a channel that all e-commerce entrepreneurs should try. But even if Facebook has some very good destination options, you need to spend some time thinking about your target market, lifestyle, and what people like or dislike.

When you start using Facebook Ads, you initially pay quite a bit to reach your first customers. Please keep this in mind as you adjust your campaign for a while and observe the results.

Remember, your initial sale does not necessarily have to be related to profit maximization, but should be related to finding the right market and first customer for the product, and then conduct advertising, transportation, order fulfillment, customer service strategies and customer experience optimization.

8. Set up Google Ads

Google Ads is one of the most popular online advertising networks. Therefore, if you have a new product that you have never heard of, advertising may not be your sales channel. For everyone else, Google Ads may be a bit too complicated, but there are many online guides that can help.

The key to the success of Google Ads is to regularly monitor and adjust campaigns. Simply running any activity will not succeed. Remember, this also applies to Facebook Ads; you have to invest some money to get your first customer, which may even exceed the cost of the product. Say it again: Your goal now should be to learn more about each channel, not to make a profit.

Your first Shopify
 store sales are especially important. They start the engine and drive your business development. Keep in mind that the first few deals are the most difficult because you still need to adjust your direction and find the marketing secrets that suit your specific business and niche market.

These sales promote positive development and can be used to improve marketing strategies and overcome business obstacles. Unfortunately, these first sales are also the most difficult to achieve.\n\nHere are a few tips on how to get sales.\n\n1. Send the message to your email distribution list.\n\ncreating a (small) email list is an important first step in starting a business. If you have a pre-launch list, please email these contacts first. These contacts may be your most qualified potential customers at first because they have already expressed interest and gave you an email address for more information.\n\nIf you don’t have an email distribution list, please skip this point.\n\n2. Sell directly to relatives and friends.\n\nThe most basic strategy for making the first sale: Let friends and family shop with you as usual. This does not mean that you should persuade your mother to buy products she does not need. Consider which friends or family members will like and use your product. Contact these people directly and ask for a few minutes to showcase your product.\n\n3. Organize lotteries, contests or distribute gifts\n\nHonestly speaking: Promotional gifts, so-called gifts, have always been a popular way to draw people\'s attention to new products. One might say that freebies mostly attract people seeking deals. However, if done correctly, the viral competition will generate a lot of initial traffic and recommendations among friends. This will help you expand the presence and knowledge of stores and products. If participants mention your product or store on social media, you can give participants a greater chance of winning, and you can use some of these very good apps to enhance and extend the giveaway.\n\n4. Sell to friends strategically through social networks.\n\nTherefore, you have been able to persuade friends or relatives to buy directly from you. Maybe you do something together or sell to someone at a meeting or party. It\'s time to start developing a social media strategy. You are safe on Facebook, aren\'t you? So how do you sell to friends on Facebook?\n\nBefore launching your business and products to the public, start wisely with a strategic approach. Using Facebook\'s powerful social graph search function, you can find people who are most likely to be interested in your product and will use product-related keyword searches to make purchases.\n\nTherefore, once you find someone with potential product interest in your friends’ list, please contact him or her immediately. In addition to this targeted approach, you can also try the watering can principle: post some status updates to introduce your new store to your Facebook friends. Since you are talking with friends and family, please consider whether the ""Family and Friends Discount"" makes sense.\n\n5. Sell on other marketplaces.\n\nTo become a successful online entrepreneur, you must try everything, including other channels (such as the market). Sites such as eBay and Craigslist may be good places for first sales. First of all, they are great because these markets already have traffic and product searches. This will give you an initial boost when you build SEO and organic traffic on Google.\n\n6. Be part of the Reddit community.\n\nReddit is a huge community of smart people, divided into specific market segments or market segments based on their interests. With thousands of subreddit, you will definitely find a suitable market segment and expect to have a high degree of interest in the product.\n\nBut please note that you cannot start selling products only through these subcategories. In order for Reddit to serve you, you must become a member of the community and participate. What you get is not only potential sales but also a community of like-minded people with whom you can build a good relationship.\n\n7. Post an ad on Facebook.\n\nThe seventh biggest sales challenge you face is to generate sales through Facebook’s own advertising platform. Facebook has the most precisely adjusted advertising features on any platform and is a channel that all e-commerce entrepreneurs should try. But even if Facebook has some very good destination options, you need to spend some time thinking about your target market, lifestyle, and what people like or dislike.\n\nWhen you start using Facebook Ads, you initially pay quite a bit to reach your first customers. Please keep this in mind as you adjust your campaign for a while and observe the results.\n\nRemember, your initial sale does not necessarily have to be related to profit maximization, but should be related to finding the right market and first customer for the product, and then conduct advertising, transportation, order fulfillment, customer service strategies and customer experience optimization.\n\n8. Set up Google Ads\n\nGoogle Ads is one of the most popular online advertising networks. Therefore, if you have a new product that you have never heard of, advertising may not be your sales channel. For everyone else, Google Ads may be a bit too complicated, but there are many online guides that can help.\n\nThe key to the success of Google Ads is to regularly monitor and adjust campaigns. Simply running any activity will not succeed. Remember, this also applies to Facebook Ads; you have to invest some money to get your first customer, which may even exceed the cost of the product. Say it again: Your goal now should be to learn more about each channel, not to make a profit.\n\nYour first Shopify\n store sales are especially important. They start the engine and drive your business development. Keep in mind that the first few deals are the most difficult because you still need to adjust your direction and find the marketing secrets that suit your specific business and niche market. Don\'t be afraid to spend some money and offer some discounts to get more appeal. Your Shopify store will only continuously improve your methods, quotations, product-market adaptability, and marketing activities over time to generate profits.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.00045
Darva Campbell,Updated 3y,"Have you ever stumbled across a valuable rare find at a garage/yard sale or a secondhand store and knew you were getting too good of a deal? If you bought it, did you feel guilty and tell the other party what you found was worth at some point?","About 30 years ago I was a single mom. I had an antique store to help ends meet. I specialized in vintage jewelry. I stopped by several thrift stores every day on my way to wherever I was going, and played a little game with myself to keep things fresh. I’d pretend out of 100 visits to any given store I would find one really great item, so whenever I shopped and didn’t find anything, I’d just think, “Day 42? Check!” and move on. “One more day closer to finding a treasure,” is how I thought of it.

Once on my way home I was making my rounds at a junk shop where I rarely - if ever - found ANYthing. Day 67…

While sorting through the costume jewelry I spotted something interesting tangled up in the pile of cheap chains and pot metal rings - a large brooch and pair of earrings. There was no price, they were just jumbled in with everything else. I asked how much and was told by the fellow behind the counter, “I can do it for $12.99.”

I’m sure the fellow thought they were plastic. Needless to say, since I’m answering this particular question . . . they were not. Instead, they were from a time before plastic was invented.

Once I got them home and under a loupe, it turned out they were an exquisite 18 kt gold filigree demi parure with with small rubies surrounding three magnificent hand-carved malachite cameos… worth at the time north of a thousand times the $12.99 I had paid for the set, as it appraised right at 15K at the time.

I didn’t ever put them in the shop … I still have them … the best deal I ever made. I wish the photo did them justice . . . the detail in the hand-carved cameos is fabulous, the filigree is exquisite, and the rubies are wonderfully colorful and clear. I especially like the way the earrings were carved to face each other by some master craftsman a couple hundred years ago …

As to feeling guilty, no, I can’t say I’ve ever felt guilty from doing my homework and getting good deals. I have spent thousands of hours - and a lot of money over the years - learning to recognize items of value. I’ve made expensive mistakes - particularly at auction - purchasing things I THOUGHT were one thing, to find after purchase they were something else entirely. Expensive mistake...

John Marty,Updated 6y,What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?,"Your career is a game – treat it that way.
Getting promoted is like dating – you’re either a match or you’re not (if you're not, find a new boss).
Never talk shit about anyone (they will find out).
There’s a high probability you’ll get promoted sooner if you take a role at a different company.
Always stay positive.
Humility.
Never complain unless you plan to present a solution (but really, just don’t complain).
Office politics are real. Learn the psychology and motivation of your co-workers to gain influence.
Your job title doesn’t mean you know everything - maintain the mindset of a student.
Leadership visibility is often more important than the quality of your work.
Learn to say no to people (even your boss). If you keep a roadmap of priorities and your boss asks you to do something, kindly tell them you can’t unless you de-prioritize one of your current tasks.
Always stay calm.
Ownership is everything.
Meetings, lots and lots of meetings.
Every job has shit we dislike…a different job will have different shit we dislike (The grass is never greener, unless somebody else wants to pay you 30% more, then it’s probably greener).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8fz496mxt5ycwsoh', 'title': 'What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Your career is a game – treat it that way.\nGetting promoted is like dating – you’re either a match or you’re not (if you're not, find a new boss).\nNever talk shit about anyone (they will find out).\nThere’s a high probability you’ll get promoted sooner if you take a role at a different company.\nAlways stay positive.\nHumility.\nNever complain unless you plan to present a solution (but really, just don’t complain).\nOffice politics are real.
