Sayan Chaudhary,Updated 2y,What are some of the most bizarre scientific experiments?,"Easily, this one.

Take a look at this picture, a nice long look.

Now, tell me what is going on here.

No, you are not hallucinating. You are not on drugs, or high. This is not photoshopped.

This is actually a rhino, hanging upside down from its ankles, being dangled by a helicopter.

Your first thought might be that this is horrendous! The poor animals are going to be severely hurt! Surely, this must be the work of someone without a soul.

Nope, this is a science experiment, being funded by Namibian Ministry of Environment. And it’s actually helping them to save the rhino population from dwindling even more.

You see, due to widespread poaching of these animals, their populations have become very low, with most of the animals being concentrated in places like national parks and wildlife reserves. However, there’s a problem which arises due to this high concentration - inbreeding.

Rhinos, unable to find mates from outside, have to resort to mating among their own gene pool. This, of course, leads to a lot of problems - none of which are good for the rhino population.

Because of this, groups dedicated to preserving these majestic beasts have been shifting rhinos away from their families when they reach maturity, so that they can reproduce outside their own gene pool, and prevent inbreeding.

As to how they performed this shifting?

The rhinos were tranquilized, before being secured in box. This box, containing the rhino lying in it, was then flown to other regions by helicopters.

However, analysis showed that this position was quite harmful to the rhinos.

In this position, the muscles of the side on which they were lying, get damaged. These muscles are simply unable to handle their immense weight.

Their lungs also suffer. I don’t exactly get how, but from what I understood, its due to the imbalance of oxygen supply to the two lungs. The one on the lying side gets a lot of oxygen, but the one facing the sky gets too little.

And here enters the hero of our story, Robin Radcliffe, a wildlife veterinarian from Cornell Uni. He proposed that instead of being carried on their side, the rhinos should be hung from their ankles (Ya, I don’t get it either)

This sounds like an insane idea, and it is! But much to everyone’s surprise, his solution actually was proven to be better than the previous method.

He and his colleagues showed the effectiveness of this method by transporting 12 tranquilized black rhinos with the help of the Namibian Ministry of Environment.

In fact, the guy’s idea was so ridiculous, yet effective, that he won the ig-nobel prize for transport technology this year!

The motto of the ig-noble prize is: “Research that makes people laugh and then think”.

And I must say, if there’s any piece of research which deserves this prize, its this one.

Israel Ramirez,Updated 11mo,Did the greatest physicist of the 19th Century really disprove Darwin’s theory of evolution?,"Darwin worried that this might be so, writing in a letter to Wallace, in 1869: “Thomson’s views on the recent age of the world have been for some time one of my sorest troubles.”[1][2]

William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, was certainly one of the greatest of his era, maybe the very greatest. He wrote his first scientific paper at the age of 16 and went on to invent the 2nd law of thermodynamics and the concept of absolute zero.

He was a major advocate of the importance of precise measurement and math saying that:

When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.[3]

Darwin was a defective scientist by that rule. He hardly ever used numbers.

Kelvin knew that Darwin’s theory of evolution had another weakness. Natural selection is slow and needs a lot of time to accomplish anything. It would take hundreds of millions of years for natural selection to have produced the many prehistoric creatures that had been discovered.

Lord Kelvin proved that the Earth couldn’t be that old.

People knew, by then, that the Earth’s temperature increases the further one descends below the surface. That meant that the Earth’s core was releasing heat, thereby cooling. If you extrapolate back in time, the Earth would have been warmer in the past. But there’s a limit to how hot the Earth’s core could have been because rocks can only get so hot before they melt or vaporize.

Kelvin calculated the highest possible starting temperature for the Earth and the rate at which it lost heat. Kelvin also understood that the sun cannot burn for hundreds of millions of years. No known fuel source could provide that much energy for so long.

Between 1861 and 1897 he produced a series of increasingly better calculations. At first his estimates had a wide range 20 to 400 million years, but he eventually settled on the lower value 20 million years.[4]

Kelvin’s numbers didn’t provide enough time for Darwin’s theory of natural selection to work,[5] especially when you remember that during the early stages, the Earth would have been too hot for living things. Geologists knew, by then, that the Precambrian era was very long but didn’t contain any fossils.

In 1899, another Physicist, John Joly, estimated the age of the earth based on the gradual accumulation of salt into the oceans. His age, 90 –100 million years, was bigger than Kelvin’s but still too low for Darwin.

Darwin’s response

Darwin tried to dispute these numbers. He calculated that the chalk in the Weald region of England must have taken 300 million years to erode. But nobody accepted this number, not even modern scientists, and he eventually removed it from new editions of the Origin.

Darwin understood that Lord Kelvin’s (W. Thompson) results could disprove his theory:

I am greatly troubled at the short duration of the world according to Sir. W. Thompson, for I require my theoretical views a very long period before the Cambrian formation.[6]

What changed people’s minds since then?

The discovery of radioactivity made Lord Kelvin’s calculations irrelevant. The Earth’s heat comes from radioactive rocks.

And the sun gets its energy from fusion, a source that can last for many billions of years.[7]

The moral of this story

Many people assume that the debate about Darwin’s theory was a theological debate with Darwin on the side of science and his opponents on the side of darkness and ignorance. But Kelvin’s criticism was based on cold, hard, numbers and the best science of his era.

There really were legitimate scientific criticisms of Darwin.

The second moral of this story

Sometimes the best science, and the best scientists can be wrong.

Kelvin was wrong about the age of the Earth. But so was Darwin. His estimate of the age of the Earth from his analysis of the Weald region of England was wrong. In another Quora answer, I describe another of Darwin’s geological errors. [8]

Scientists are fallible human beings who see some things correctly but may miss others. Over time, errors get corrected, but the scientific frontier is full of invalid hunches, incomplete information, and things we don’t know but really should.

The third moral of this story

Physics isn’t always nobler or better than Biology just because it uses more math. Kelvin’s carefully prepared formulas and precise measurements led to an incorrect conclusion, while Darwin’s non-mathematical argument about evolution turned out to be correct.

Jim Mowreader,1y,What scientists paid the ultimate price for their work?,"Meet Dr. Karl P. Schmidt. I chose a pencil sketch of him rather than a photograph because he was famous for labeling his specimen bottles at Chicago’s Field Museum with a Number 2 pencil. So…pencil just seemed right.

In the early years of the 20th Century, Dr. Schmidt was the top herpetologist - reptile scientist - in all the world. From 1941 to 1955, he ran the zoology section at Field Museum. He was still employed by the museum when this incident took place.

On September 25, 1957, Marlin Perkins, the director of Chicago’s Lincoln Park Zoo, called Dr. Schmidt with a rather usual-for-Dr. Schmidt request: “We have a new snake here and we don’t know what it is. Could you identify it for us?” Of course he could, so the zoo sent it over. Marlin Perkins was a very good snake man himself, so this snake must have been really exotic. (Yes, this is the same Marlin Perkins who created the famous nature television show “Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom.”)

It was a young boomslang snake. Native to Africa, the boomslang is a very pretty green-and-black beast - EXTREMELY green. They knew it was venomous, but at the time they believed snakes with the fangs in the backs of their mouths like this one has aren’t harmful to humans. While handling the snake, it bit him on one of his thumbs.

So…what does this crazy bastard do? Instead of going to the doctor like a normal person would do, he got a notebook and started documenting how he was feeling. One of his notes read as follows:

9:00 PM-12:20 AM Slept well. No blood in urine before going to sleep, but very small amount of urine. Urination at 12:20 AM mostly blood, but small in amount. Mouth had bled steadily as shown by dried blood at both angles of mouth.

He died before 3 pm the next day. At his autopsy they discovered he was bleeding from everywhere - lungs, out his eyes, kidneys, intestines and so on.

Today we know the boomslang to be one of the most lethal snakes in the world. Its venom is stronger than the venom of a king cobra.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gu98dmto7p136j0r', 'title': 'What scientists paid the ultimate price for their work?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Meet Dr. Karl P.

Could you identify it for us?” Of course he could, so the zoo sent it over. Marlin Perkins was a very good snake man himself, so this snake must have been really exotic.

No blood in urine before going to sleep, but very small amount of urine. Urination at 12:20 AM mostly blood, but small in amount.

In India where the number of mobiles are higher than toilets, I found this as an amazing thing which was made by a group of school students who were 13 years old.

We all know that in our country in some remote schools there aren't any toilets and students are encouraged to go out.

They made this within a budget of ₹600. The schools that can’t afford the costly urinals can make use of it.

Karmanya Singh,7y,What is the most interesting scientific fact?,"Our brain thinks on the Logarithmic Scale, instead of the additive scale. This means that our brain thinks in proportions instead of differences.

Thus, we subconsciously believe that the difference between 2 and 1 is greater than the difference between 3 and 2 and so on...

The first scale here is the logarithmic scale while the second one is the commonly used additive scale.

It comes in handy in most practical life situations but sometimes, it causes some problems too.

Take a look at the following scenarios

Case 1: There is one tiger in front of you.
Case 2: There are two tigers in front of you.

Obviously, you are more scared in case 2 than you are scared in case 1.

Case 3: There are 100 tigers in front of you.
Case 4: There are 101 tigers in front of you.

Now in cases 3 and 4, even though the difference in the number of tigers is the same, the difference in the fear you feel in case 4 is negligible to the fear in case 3, whereas this difference is quite substantial in cases 1 and 2.

This is because, in cases 1 and 2, the no. of tigers gets doubled. Hence the proportion is comparatively larger, than in cases 3 and 4.

Thus, logarithmic thinking helps our survival instincts and judge cases practically and comes in handy.

But in some cases, logarithmic thinking causes problems too. You wouldn't be as happy on getting a $5 discount on a $2000 object as you would be on getting a $5 discount on a $10 object.

This is because, in the first case, you are getting a lower proportion of discount whereas in the other case, the proportion of discount is greater. Although, the amount of the discount is the same i.e. 5 dollars.

Hence, even though we learn to count on the additive scale, our brains were wired to count on the logarithmic one.

Alex Cooper,4y,What are the most fascinating science facts?,"Tree-Induced Desiccation of a Deceased Doggo

When someone says “tree bark,” what comes to mind? Probably not this:

But yes — it’s exactly what it looks like — a mummified dog stuck up a tree.

Sorry for the morbid nature of this one, but it is an interesting, albeit a bit of a sad and gruesome story.

Loggers found the petrified pooch when they cut the top off a chestnut oak tree to load it into their truck. He must have shimmied 28 feet up, through a hole in the trunk.

As it’s a hunting dog, it’s assumed that he was chasing something up the tree, but got stuck when the tree narrowed. There evidently wasn’t anyone there to help him, either, so there he remained, until the loggers found him.

Why didn’t the doggo decompose?

Normally when a person or an animal dies, the microbes in the body are left unchecked by biological processes that keep them under control in living creatures. Without the usual guardians in place, they begin to eat the body, and then the microorganisms in the gut start the process of putrefaction. ""They grow, they reproduce, and they start taking over the body,"" Killgrove told Newsweek. ""That's the disgusting part."" The body bloats and decays, and bacteria, fungi, insects and other animals come to eat the remains.

But this isn't what happened with (the dog) in that chestnut oak that would become his coffin. Chestnut oaks contain tannin, which is used to tan animal pelts and prevent decay. Tannin is a natural ""desiccant,"" or material that absorbs moisture and dries out its surroundings.

The low-moisture environment stopped the microbial activity, Killgrove explained. And no microbial activity means no decay.[1]

He wasn’t eaten in the subsequent years, because the shape and position of the tree also made it hard for anything to smell him.

He’s now on display in Southern Forest World, locked in a perpetual struggle to catch whatever it was that caused his predicament.

Good boys deserve better than this.

At least he’s treated with the respect he deserves…

His name? Stuckie.

Ryan Phillips,4y,What scientific photos are hard to believe but are indeed real?,"A Boy And His Atom holds the world record for the world’s smallest film.

It took four researchers and two weeks of 18-hour days to make. Each frame measures 45 by 25 nanometers.

Created by IBM using individual atoms and two scanning tunnelling microscopes, this 90-second stop motion short is magnified over 100 million times, and shows a figure constructed entirely of carbon monoxide molecules playing and dancing with an atom.

It would take 1,000 of the frames of the film laid side by side to span the width of a single hair.

The boy bounces his atom on the floor and against the wall like a tennis ball, then jumps up and down on a molecular trampoline.

As seen by the waves of influence around the atoms, only the top layer of atoms are in focus, leaving the copper surface blurred.

You can actually see the bonds between the particles, appearing as dips in space!

“This isn’t really about a particular scientific breakthrough. The movie is really a conversation starter to get kids and other people talking about — and excited about — math, science and technology.”

Dr. Andreas Heinrich, IBM Research

As someone who has worked on a few stop motion shorts in college, I cannot emphasise enough the level of precision involved in moving small objects a tiny bit at a time. One screw-up and it’s buggered.

That’s probably why they lowered the temperature to around -260℃ so that the atoms held still.

I can’t imagine the level of concentration required to achieve these images!

Daniel Kaplan,Updated 2y,What scientists paid the ultimate price for their work?,"Karen Wetterhahn.

I agree that many of these other deaths are tragic. Marie Curie, as an example, is particularly so. Still, that was back when our knowledge of science was far less than it is now. I mean… we didn’t get radiation. She was truly in unknown waters.

Karen Wetterhahn was the first female chemistry professor at Dartmouth College. Not back before WW2. We’re talking about the 1990s. Her research on the dangers of heavy metals, with her knowledge and experience and with the financial backing and equipment of Dartmouth should have made her safe. Unfortunately, two drops of dimethylmercury on the back of her lab gloves were enough to kill her.

Why dimethylmercury? At the time, it was used for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
. At the time, Dimethylmercury wasn’t known for its ability to very quickly pass through latex gloves. She cleaned her lab before taking her gloves off. Again, as far as we know, this was standard procedure at the time.

I’m not a scientist. I know that mercury is a heavy metal, but the kind you find in old thermometers isn’t all that dangerous. I’ve seen pics of people playing with it. You can simply wash your hands and probably be fine. Methylmercury is nasty stuff you might get from eating too much fish, like with Minamata disease
.

Dimethylmercury is a different animal. It is one of the most dangerous chemicals out there. Dimethylmercury apparently doesn’t kill you right away. The two drops passed through her glove and were in contact with her skin for seconds. It was enough. Unlike a lot of other substances, dimethylmercury is capable of passing through the blood-brain barrier with tragic results.

Three months after the incident, she had stomach problems. Five months after the incident, she began having significant neurological problems like stumbling and speech slurring. No matter what the doctors did (and they tried everything they could), she wound up falling into a “persistent vegetative state.” She eventually died 10 months after the exposure.

Dimethylmercury stripped a vibrant, healthy woman of everything, even robbing her of her mind. That’s part of why scientists will use just about any other substance. It’s just too dangerous.

Silk Road,Sep 25,Which is the first metal to be discovered by man?,"Definitely copper.

That shiny reddish-brown metal that you see in wires, pipes, coins, and statues was the first metal that humans discovered.

Copper was probably the first metal mined and crafted by humans. It was originally obtained as a native metal and later from the smelting of ores.

Earliest estimates of the discovery of copper suggest around 9000 BC in the Middle East.

A copper pendant discovered in what is now northern Iraq has been dated about 8700 BC.

For nearly five millennia, copper was the only metal known to man, and thus had all the metal applications.

People used copper for everything from cutting to cooking to decorating.

Some ancient civilizations also believed that copper had magical or sacred properties.

For example, the ancient Egyptians used copper to heal wounds, sterilize water, and make ornaments.

They also thought that copper gave them special powers if they wore it.

The ancient Indians used copper as part of their surgical instruments.

Copper is still very useful and important today. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity, which makes it ideal for many electronic devices and appliances.

It is also part of our diet, as it helps our body function properly and stay healthy.

Copper is truly a remarkable metal, don't you agree?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/awelzh07k56ucgbq', 'title': 'Which is the first metal to be discovered by man?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Definitely copper.\n\nThat shiny reddish-brown metal that you see in wires, pipes, coins, and statues was the first metal that humans discovered.\n\nCopper was probably the first metal mined and crafted by humans.

Zipho Tefu,Updated 4y,"What are the greatest examples of the ""butterfly effect"" that have happened throughout history?","Here's one we've all contributed to:

Well technically we didn't start it.

In 1907 a man named Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite, the first fully synthetic material, meaning it contained no molecules found in nature.

It was invented as a substitute for shellac which was a natural electrical insulator. Bakelite was a good insulator, very durable, and ideally suited for mechanical mass production.

Bakelite could be shaped or molded into almost anything, providing endless possibilities and was marketed as “the material of a thousand uses.”

Eventually Bakelite evolved into what we know as the modern day plastic.

It then became a major trend. And in the 1970s a huge movement started to use plastic instead of paper bags in order to “save the trees”.

And this made sense. It still does. Using plastic instead of paper does reduce deforestation. But now we have a new problem.

Where does the plastic go?

It can't decompose. We knew we couldn't keep it on land. So where did we put it?

I'll give you a hint.

It's starts with “O” and ends with “cean”.

That's right the ocean! (This feels like Dora the explorer).

One day, the very first piece of plastic was placed into the ocean. It all started with just one piece of plastic.

One thing led to another and now we have this:

And this:

As well as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

It's a large concentration of plastic in the ocean.

Some interesting facts about the garbage patch:

It is roughly three times the size of France.
Once plastic enters the patch it is unlikely to ever escape.
It contains between 1.1 to 3.6 TRILLION pieces of plastic.
What you're seeing is just the tip of the iceberg as a lot of the plastic is underneath the water.
It contains plastic that is decades old.
Plastic accounts for 74% of a sea turtle's diet.

The scariest part?

It's just one of 5 other patches.

And it all started with a man who was just trying to make the world a better place.

Steven Haddock,1y,When and why did the Islamic world lose the scientific edge it once had?,"Meet William Harvey (1578–1657)

Harvey was a physician and, being of a curious mind, he set out to figure out a problem that had been plaguing medicine for centuries - just how did blood work?

Everyone knew about blood. Everyone knew the heart had a role in how the body used blood. Everyone knew if you lost enough blood, you died.

The best medical science of the day held that the heart created blood, where it was distributed to the rest of the body at which point it was consumed. Nice and simple.

So Harvey measured the amount of blood in a human body. He then took a heart, filled it with blood, and squeezed it to see how much blood would come out. What he discovered was that the heart could pump about 1/60th of the total amount of blood in the body with each cycle. The body did this, all day, every day, for a person’s entire lifetime. If existing theories were true, that meant that, every minute, the body had to create and consume about 5 litres of blood. 300 liters an hour. Over 6,000 liters a day.

And that didn’t seem right.

So Harvey looked further. He started following the tubes coming out of the heart and tracking them throughout the body. He found that some of these tubes only worked in one direction - they had valves that only allowed flow one way. After he finished, he found two “circuits”, one from the heart through the aorta and back to the superior vena cava, and another through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and back through the pulmonary vein.

In other words, blood circulated. He still couldn’t explain where it came from, but it explained why just five litres of blood could keep you alive indefinitely. The blood wasn’t the body’s food, it was the body’s transportation system. It kept going around and around, the whole five liters being pumped about once a minute.

He published. Everyone recognized the breakthrough.

So, why didn’t Islamic physicians, who in this century were head and shoulders above European ones, find this relationship?

Because they couldn’t do what Harvey did to find out - cut open dead bodies. Although Harvey did experiments on living people too (to demonstrate the flow of blood in veins, for example) to hit upon “circulation” Harvey needed to dissect bodies to see how the blood actually flowed. That was forbidden in Islam.

Although it was controversial in Europe too (and Western physicians often sold bodies when volunteers were in short supply), this process of “dissection” caught on fast in Western medicine. It never did catch on in Islamic medicine. These sorts of breakthroughs eventually made it through to other sciences, often with scientists openly battling with religious authorities all the way. It helped that, a couple of hundred years later, Catholic scientists could flee to Northern Europe when their work became controversial.

Harvey literally made the first big breakthrough in western Medicine, something that just wasn’t possible in other cultures at the time because of the rules respecting the treatment of dead bodies.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xdv5362iehnr9m0l', 'title': 'When and why did the Islamic world lose the scientific edge it once had?', 'score': {'original': 0.36405, 'ai': 0.63595}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Meet William Harvey (1578–1657)\n\nHarvey was a physician and, being of a curious mind, he set out to figure out a problem that had been plaguing medicine for centuries - just how did blood work?\n\nEveryone knew about blood.

Israel Ramirez,Updated 1y,"What are the most dramatic examples of major scientific advances which were discovered, forgotten or disregarded, then discovered again?","You may have read accounts of the discovery of the ability of citrus fruits to prevent and treat scurvy. What those accounts don’t usually mention is that this discovery was forgotten and recovered several times.

The problem

In the early days of long distance sailing, scurvy was a major problem. Humans, like other primates, lack the ability to create their own Vitamin C. That vitamin is present in many foods but tends to deteriorate during storage of dry food or when food is cooked. Sailors often used copper cooking vessels, not realizing that copper destroys this vitamin. As a result, sailors fed diets heavy in crackers and dried meat gradually lost the Vitamin C in their bodies, and became sick.

Scurvy, ""the plague of the sea,"" killed over an estimated two million sailors during the Age of Sail. Far more naval personnel died from scurvy than all other diseases combined, including deaths from combat, storms, disasters, and shipwrecks…. Scurvy is a gradually debilitating disease that destroys the body's connecting tissues, causing lethargy, blotchy skin, rotting gums and teeth, and reopening of old wounds or healed fractured bones. If not treated, scurvy leads to death. [1]

Ancient informal knowledge

Most accounts about Vitamin C start in the 1700’s but ancient people knew about it. The Ebers papyrus, from Egypt 1500 BC, described symptoms and prescribed onions which contain of vitamin C.[2] Later on:

Starting with Vasco de Gama’s crew in 1497, sailors have repeatedly discovered the curative power of citrus fruits, and the cure has just as frequently been forgotten or ignored by subsequent explorers.[3]

In 1614, the Englishman John Woodall, in his manual The Surgeon’s Mate recommended eating oranges, lemons, limes and tamarinds. Somehow, this knowledge got lost, and sailors were dying from scurvy all over again.

First formal discovery

Recovery of this knowledge began in 1734, when Johann Bachstrom claimed that scurvy was solely due to ‘a total abstinence from fresh vegetable food, and greens’. In 1747 James Lind conducted a formal experiment in which he fed two sailors oranges and limes. He published his findings in 1753. Lind continued to treat scurvy in his position of head of Haslar Hospital for the rest of his career. (Illustration from: [4] )

But nobody understood why fruit worked and attempts to concentrate the fruit never worked. Some of the equipment used to concentrate fruit contained copper which destroys Vitamin C. Eventually, wort of malt emerged as the preferred treatment. It was cheaper than citrus fruit though it didn’t work as well.

Rediscovery

Later on Captain Cook tried a variety of antiscorbutic foods and concluded that orange and lemon juice, as well as wort of malt, worked. He rediscovered Lind’s original finding. For that, the Royal Society awarded him the Copley Gold medal. But the navy didn’t change the way they fed sailors.

Second rediscovery

British sailors became limeys in 1790–1799. That’s when Sir Gilbert Blane, persuaded the Admiralty to issue a daily ration of three quarters of an ounce of lemon juice to all Royal Navy sailors. Blane had conducted, and published his own studies, and was aware of previous work by Lind and Cook. But the most important factor was Blane’s social standing. He was born to a prominent family and he knew all the right people.

Alternative sources of Vitamin C

Vitamin C is present in lots of fresh foods and it isn’t clear why the British focused on citrus fruits. Some physicians, including Shakespeare’s son-in-law, favored a plant called scurvy grass, which was apparently named for its ability to cure scurvy.[5] Captain Cook fed his sailors various foods including scurvy grass, wild celery, sauerkraut, and others but citrus is what he is remembered for.

Some authorities thought that acid or sourness was important and that might explain why the British focused on citrus. That’s another example of a forgotten discovery. Lind’s original study tried acids including cider, vinegar and sulphuric acid; none worked. The idea that acid was responsible caused problems later on.

The cure got forgotten again

By the time of Robert Falcon Scott's 1911 expedition to the South Pole, the ability of fruit to cure scurvy had been forgotten and his crew had all the symptoms:

The symptoms of scurvy do not necessarily occur in a regular order, but generally the first sign is an inflamed, swollen condition of the gums. The whitish pink tinge next the teeth is replaced by an angry red; as the disease gains ground the gums become more spongy and turn to a purplish colour, the teeth become loose and the gums sore. Spots appear on the legs, and pain is felt in old wounds and bruises; later, from a slight oedema, the legs, and then the arms, swell to a great size and become blackened behind the joints. After this the patient is soon incapacitated, and the last horrible stages of the disease set in, from which death is a merciful release.[6]

Scott knew about Lind’s discovery but was certain that citrus fruit couldn’t cure scurvy. In fact, citrus fruit wasn’t helping British sailors anymore.

The British thought that the agent which cured scurvy was acid. So, they thought that it made sense to switch from using lemons to limes which are more acidic. But despite having less acid, lemons have more vitamin C, so the switch reduced the amount of vitamin C the sailors were getting.

The British navy also began storing condensed juice in copper vessels instead of storing intact fruit. That was a big mistake because copper destroys Vitamin C. The condensation method also exposed the juice to air and heat which can also destroy Vitamin C.[7]

So, the British had been giving their sailors juice that doesn’t cure scurvy. They didn’t notice that because they also began offering sailors better food. That’s important because fresh foods of all kinds have Vitamin C. Also, voyages became shorter because steamships travel much faster than sail ships. That meant there was less time to get scurvy.

Sailors didn’t need to get as much citrus fruit, but nobody noticed that the juice they were getting was useless.

Then they began voyages into the Arctic and Antarctic. People on those expeditions got scurvy. Fortunately, they discovered that fresh meat, like polar bear, seal, and penguin, worked very well. Some people concluded that meat was a better cure for scurvy than fruit.

Scott wasn’t able to carry fresh meat on his trek to the South Pole. There’s a good chance that scurvy contributed to his death.

Modern era

The actual discovery of Vitamin C required an animal model. That happened in 1907 on account of pure luck:

C. Axel Holst and Theodor Frolich had been studying beriberi (another deficiency disease) in pigeons, and when they decided to switch to a mammal model, they serendipitously chose guinea pigs, the one animal besides human beings and monkeys that requires vitamin C in its diet. Fed a diet of pure grain, the animals showed no signs of beriberi, but quickly sickened and died of something that closely resembled human scurvy.

Szent-Györgyi used guinea pigs and, in 1932, definitively determined that Vitamin C is ascorbic acid.

Progress in isolating the element was slowed by the exceptional dangers of generating fluorine: several 19th century experimenters, the ""fluorine martyrs"", were killed or blinded.

Richard Muller,7y,Who are the most unfortunate scientists of all time?,"Ludwig Boltzmann. He founded the modern theory of atoms, put the theory of heat on a fundamental foundation, and explained the deep meaning of entropy; but his great achievements weren’t believed. He argued that pressure was just the result of numerous gas particles constantly bombarding a surface, and that heat was not a separate fluid, but just the vibration and random motion of molecules.

But, like Cassandra, he was not believed in his own time (with some significant exceptions, including Einstein). He spent “nearly four decades … defending his theories of statistical physics. He suffered from what we now call bipolar disorder, and in 1906, during a fit of depression, he hanged himself, just three years before Perrin’s experiments [on Brownian motion] convinced the physics world that the basic assumptions of his work were right.” (Quote taken from Now: The Physics of Time.
)

Before he died, he asked to have his equation for entropy (S = k log W) engraved on his tombstone. The constant “k”, now called Boltzmann’s constant, is one of the most important numbers in all of physics, considered by professional physicists to be in the same category of importance as the speed of light c and Planck’s constant h.

I refer you also to Dragos Serban's answer. He also named Boltzmann, but I didn’t see his post until I added mine. He fills in some interesting details.

Boltzmann’s tombstone request was granted. I attach a photo.

This tombstone reminds me of the famous tombstone of Archimedes. He asked to have a sphere surrounded by a cylinder put on his tombstone. That’s because that diagram was what enabled him to make what he considered to be his greatest mathematical achievement: deriving a formula for the surface area and volume of a sphere. Many years later, Cicero searched for the tomb of Archimedes, and knew he had found it when he saw one with the sphere/cylinder mounted on it. (See, for example, Tomb of Archimedes
.) Of course Archimedes was also unlucky, having been killed by a Roman soldier (see the account by Livius
) when Archimedes refused to stop his work and pay due respect.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/viky069ps3l158ud', 'title': 'Who are the most unfortunate scientists of all time?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Ludwig Boltzmann.

Ian O'Grady,Sep 2,What are the weirdest experiments performed throughout history?,"How do you sanely tell a doctor you’re not insane? This was an answer psychologist David Rosenhan wanted to find out. He set out to conduct a test to determine the validity of psychiatric diagnoses.

The test involved him and other participants to be committed to various psychiatric institutions around America. They had feigned mental illness by pretending to be hallucinating to be accepted, but once they were committed they had to act like their normal selves for the duration of their stay in the hospital.

Throughout their time in these hospitals, none of the doctors or staff suspected them to be a pseudo patients. They took notes during these stays, and one nurse labelled the note-taking as obsessive behaviour related to mental illness, but in reality, they were taking notes on the nurse’s conduct. The only people who suspected and believed them to be imposters were other patients.

The object of the experiment was to get released on your own, but a lawyer was on hand in case it became clear the hospital wasn’t going to let you go on short notice. To get out a lot of the participants had to admit to having a mental illness and take antipsychotic medication.

During their time at these hospitals, the pseudo-patients recorded how they felt overwhelming dehumanization and an invasion of privacy by doctors and staff. They noted how doctors would discuss them in great detail with another doctor as if they weren't even in the room. They were also subject to verbal and physical assaults by other patients which would be ignored if brought to staff’s attention.

In one hospital Rosenhan spent three months trying to get out, even after he told family members he would be out in three days.

When details of the experiment was published it was wildly criticised. A psychologist at another hospital was quite intrigued by his experiment and asked Rosenhan to send him a group of Pseudo-patients along with regular patients, and bet Rosenhan that his staff would be able to tell the difference.

Out of the 100 patients Rosenhan sent to the hospital staff there were able to identify 41 pseudo-patients.

Peter Spering,1y,What scientists paid the ultimate price for their work?,"The Inventor of FM Radio.

In the world of inventors, the name Edwin Howard Armstrong is one that remains tucked away in a dark corner, known by few.

It is, then, a terrible irony that he invented something that went on to have global impact — FM radio.

The invention of his magnum opus proved to be both a blessing and a curse. Armstrong’s project was backed by his long-time friend and head of RCA, David Sarnoff. However, when Armstrong presented his finished product to Sarnoff, he was unimpressed due to its complexity. Edwin later returned with a streamlined offering, but Sarnoff’s mind was made up. He told Armstrong to remove his equipment and that was the end of it.

However, the inventor didn’t give up. He took his technology to the Federal Communications Commission, impressing them with a demonstration, and who eventually decided to create a commercial FM service.

And thus, the Radio Wars began.

Sarnoff realised that Armstrong’s invention was quickly becoming a threat to his company. Its increasing popularity was weakening RCA’s stranglehold on the world of American radio, and so he moved to act. At first, RCA approached Armstrong and made him an offer; $1,000,000 ($21,000,000 in today’s money) in exchange for a royalty-free license to use his FM patents.

Armstrong refused, feeling it would’ve been unfair to other licensed companies who had to pay 2% royalties for their sales.

The furious RCA boss set his mind to sabotaging his old friend; he lobbied the FCC to move their FM broadcasts to another band, cutting off 500,000 FM listeners in a stroke. They created their own FM patents, which they claimed were ‘non-infringing’. Armstrong sent the above photo of himself on RCA’s 115 foot tower to Sarnoff, leading to him banning Edwin from RCA.

RCA’s patents led to a gruelling court battle that lasted years, which inevitably took its toll on Armstrong. Not just him either. You see, he was married. The inventor wooed one Esther Marion MacInnis in the early 1920s, scaling high towers for her, driving around in sports cars and gifting her the first portable radio:

Edwin and Marion with the first portable radio.

The spark in their marriage progressively dimmed as the legal battle marked year after year, until the couple were left penniless and at their wit’s end. Their mental health deteriorated to the point that Marion threw herself into a river, and spent a spell in a mental hospital. During one frantic argument, Edwin grabbed a poker and swung it at her arm; it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. She packed her things and left.

Three months after their separation, Armstrong wrote a two page letter to his wife. He expressed his deep regret about having hurt her, and his sorrow about never being able to see his most beloved ever again. He finished the letter:

""God keep you and Lord have mercy on my Soul.""

Then, he got up and put on his gloves, hat and overcoat. He walked over to the window of his thirteenth floor apartment, stepped onto the ledge and jumped.

His legacy is obvious, though he died long before it came to fruition.

By the 1980s, countries from the USA to Australia had largely switched from AM to FM for both its improved quality and cheaper cost. Marion chose to continue the legal fight and eventually won against companies like RCA and Motorola, establishing Edwin as FM’s inventor. She established awards to honour her husband’s name and named the Armstrong Memorial Research Foundation after him.

On 9/11, New York used the tower that he’d built as a temporary transmitter for their television stations too.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8ldcvpiur7m1094e', 'title': 'What scientists paid the ultimate price for their work?', 'score': {'original': 0.5851, 'ai': 0.4149}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The Inventor of FM Radio.\n\nIn the world of inventors, the name Edwin Howard Armstrong is one that remains tucked away in a dark corner, known by few.\n\nIt is, then, a terrible irony that he invented something that went on to have global impact — FM radio.\n\nThe invention of his magnum opus proved to be both a blessing and a curse.

Ian O'Grady,7mo,What is the most recent thing that scientists have discovered?,"A new species of cat has just been identified from the Galeras Volcano, in South Colombia. The skin with no bones from a cat from the above picture is all they had to go after and this was collected in 1989. It resurfaced in 2001 and the team looking at it realized that the coat didn’t match anything we knew of.

They thought it may have been some weird tiger cat or some weird ocelot, even maybe a hybrid. We know these cats in South America hybridised a lot, but there was no way to figure out what it was. They just assumed it was some type of tiger cat and named it the Nariño Cat. It just became the species that was a one off there wasn’t much else they could do with it.

But now that has changed. Because now they’ve sequenced the DNA of that skin. Once they identified that genome they knew they were on to the right track. Then they got the genome of 112 other felid species, so they could map the genome of this skin amongst all the rest, and what they found is pretty surprising.

This cat wasn’t just a hybrid, it was actually its own distinct species, that last shared a common ancestor with its closest modern relative over one million years ago. So the animal its actually closest related to is the pampas cat, which is another bit of a surprise.

The pampas cat for reference is a small South American cat that looks like the cat in the above picture.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q53f1yupw4jvg8i9', 'title': 'What is the most recent thing that scientists have discovered?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'A new species of cat has just been identified from the Galeras Volcano, in South Colombia.

Alejandro Jenkins,Updated 7y,Does Isaac Newton deserve the praise and respect he's been given throughout history?,"I think that, if anything, Newton's enormous personal contribution to the establishment of modern science is under-appreciated.

It is now extremely difficult for a casual reader, even one with advanced training in mathematics and physics, to understand Newton's great work, the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy""), first published in 1687. The great astrophysicist and Nobel laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910-1995) dedicated the last five years of his life to reading the Principia and making it understandable to a modern professional physicist. He only managed to get through what he thought were the key bits before he died.

There are three main reasons why the Principia is so difficult to read (aside from the fact that it was written in Latin, which few people learn now). The first is that Newton presented his proofs in a geometrical (""synthetic"") form, in the manner of the ancient Greeks, rather than using the algebraic (""analytic"") language that is favored by modern scientists and which is much easier to systematize and to teach (especially to people who, as the Soviet mathematician V. I. Arnold complained, ""don't really understand it"").

William Whewell (1794-1866) memorably commented on this aspect of Newton's work:

Nobody since Newton has been able to use geometrical methods to the same extent for the like purposes; and as we read the Principia we feel as when we are in an ancient armoury where the weapons are of gigantic size; and as we look at them we marvel what manner of man he was who could use as a weapon what we can scarcely lift as a burden.

The second reason why the Principia is difficult to understand is that Newton hated controversies, and he deliberately wanted to keep his work technical and abstruse to ""avoid being baited by little smatterers in mathematics"". It is easy to blame Newton for this attitude, but if one looks into the literature of the time, it is clear that Newton had to contend against intense criticism from many fronts, almost all of it misguided and some of it malicious. Even a man with a less prickly and suspicious temperament than Newton would have balked at the prospect of straining to make his work accessible to people who were so eager to attack him.

The third reason why the Principia is hard to read is simply the incredible depth and breadth of what it accomplished. Newton created a new mathematics and a new physics, and not for the purpose of solving the simple problems with pulleys and inclined planes that we teach now to students. In the Principia, Newton formulates his laws of motion and then uses the calculus, which he had invented, to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion from an inverse-square force law for gravity. He goes on to use the same principles to explain the motion of comets, the shape of the Earth, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and even the irregularities in the orbital motion of the moon (an instance of the famously difficult ""three-body problem"" that occupies mathematical scientists even now). The scope of the work on celestial mechanics in Book III of the Principia (""The System of the World"") goes beyond what is taught today to an undergraduate student in physics or astronomy.

There is a mathematical result in Book I of the Principia, about the algebraic non-integrability of smooth ovals, that was not appreciated until it was re-discovered 300 years later by V. I. Arnold and others. There, Newton makes a topological argument long before topology was invented as such. (Arnold points out that it was the first impossibility proof since the ancient Greeks.)

Vladimir Igorevich Arnold (1937-2010)

In Book II of the Principia, Newton struggled with the problem of describing the motion of bodies in resistive media (air or water), long before the nature of that resistance was adequately understood. Much of that work is now obsolete, but fluid dynamicists still deal on a daily basis with ""Newtonian fluids"", because Newton was the first person to define precisely the concept of viscosity.

And Newton was not just a brilliant mathematician and theoretical physicist. He was a also a first-rate experimentalist, who built the first practical reflecting telescope and demonstrated (using a glass prism) that white light is a combination of the colors of the visible spectrum. (His other and far more accessible published work was the Opticks, which appeared in 1704.) Newton also came up with the idea for the sextant (the most important of all nautical instruments until the advent of GPS), formulated an empirical law for the rate at which hot bodies cool off, and studied the speed of sound.

Moreover, Newton was philosophically well ahead of his time. For instance, his great rival Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) rejected the Newtonian theory of gravity because it did not explain how gravity acted across empty space. Newton famously replied that he did not know what gravity was, that he was only formulating a mathematical law that described its observable behavior. Richard Feynman commends the modernity of Newton's approach in his famous lectures on The Character of Physical Law (1965).

It is true that classical mechanics is not taught today in the language in which Newton formulated it, but the ideas are very much his. Two people were principally responsible for the analytical approach to mechanics that we use now: Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) and Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813). Both of them admired Newton greatly. In fact, Lagrange was often heard to remark that Newton had been both the greatest and the most fortunate of all mortals, because one may discover the system of the world only once.

It is also true that we now know that Newtonian mechanics is not the last word on the workings of the Universe. It fails to describe both the behavior of objects traveling very fast with respect to each other (for which we need Einstein's relativity) and the behavior of matter and radiation at very small scales (for which we need quantum mechanics). But the discovery of relativity and quantum mechanics would have been impossible without Newton's pioneering work, which created the framework in which the exact sciences have proceeded since. (Einstein left several touching tributes to the greatness of Newton's intellectual achievements.) Newton himself understood quite clearly —often more clearly than his followers— the scope and limitations of his work. And as long as there continue to be physics students, it seems quite likely that they will start by learning Newton's laws of motion.

Post-script: I am a physicist, so I naturally focused on Newton's contributions to physics. But, besides sharing the credit with Leibniz for the invention of calculus, Newton made other seminal contributions to pure mathematics. He generalized the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents. He contributed greatly to the theory of power series (the ""Taylor series"" is more Newton's than Taylor's). He classified most of the cubic plane curves (in the process helping to develop the techniques of projective geometry) and he showed how to construct the conic section for five given points or tangent lines. Those who work on numerical analysis are very familiar with ""Newton's method"" for approximating the roots of a real-valued function. Also well known are ""Newton's identities"" relating the powers of the roots of a polynomial with the coefficients of that polynomial.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/btokd92l0zp5cfvw', 'title': ""Does Isaac Newton deserve the praise and respect he's been given throughout history?"", 'score': {'original': 0.50906666666667, 'ai': 0.49093333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think that, if anything, Newton\'s enormous personal contribution to the establishment of modern science is under-appreciated.\n\nIt is now extremely difficult for a casual reader, even one with advanced training in mathematics and physics, to understand Newton\'s great work, the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy""), first published in 1687.

Isky Mathews,5y,"Can you name some scientists who if they had not died early in their life, could have made great contributions to mathematics or physics?","I think we surely mention not necessarily those who are famous, but those who are relatively obscure due to their death.

One of the people I feel has to be on this list is Yutaka Taniyama, the Japanese mathematician who worked in complex analysis, particularly at the boundary between modular functions and elliptic curves, and who is most famous for his part in the creation of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. Here is our only photo of him:

The official statement of the conjecture requires some pretty ”heavy machinery” in analytic terms, so we shall try to summarise it here.

There are some very important functions in analytical number theory called modular forms
, which are complex-valued functions defined on the upper-half plane (of the complex numbers) that are holomorphic (that is, they are differentiable in a neighbourhood of every point in their domain) and their output is invariant, in a specific sense, with respect to action by the group (or sometimes a specified subgroup, depending on the text) 
S
L
(
2
,
Z
)
.
SL(2,Z).

There are other, perhaps more interesting objects called elliptic curves - these are algebraic varieties on the projective plane taken from the solutions of equations of the form 
y
2
=
x
3
+
a
x
+
b
y2=x3+ax+b
 - which are of central relevance to number theory, often due to properties of their bases related to group actions
.

Now, the aforementioned conjecture states that all plane curves that are elliptic are in fact modular. This may seem to those first reading this to be unimportant, confusing, meaningless or all of these and more, but at the time that he was working in the 1940–50s, this was a great revelation. In fact, many didn’t believe the claim at all and even in the early 1980s, when people were more sure that it might be correct, it was considered one of those “untouchable problems” - it wasn’t simply that it was difficult, nobody knew how to tackle it!

It’s importance was made known when Andrew Wiles announced his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, in which the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture was proved for a certain subset of elliptic curves (semistable curves) and played a central role! At last Taniyama and Shimura got the recognition they deserved.

Or, at least, Shimura did. Taniyama had comitted suicide on the 17th of November, 1958. Why? Nobody really knows. All we have is his suicide note:

Until yesterday I had no definite intention of killing myself. But more than a few must have noticed that lately I have been tired both physically and mentally. As to the cause of my suicide, I don't quite understand it myself, but it is not the result of a particular incident, nor of a specific matter. Merely may I say, I am in the frame of mind that I lost confidence in my future. There may be someone to whom my suicide will be troubling or a blow to a certain degree. I sincerely hope that this incident will cast no dark shadow over the future of that person. At any rate, I cannot deny that this is a kind of betrayal, but please excuse it as my last act in my own way, as I have been doing my own way all my life.

Shimura himself said that when he heard the news, the only thing he felt was ”confused”. He had felt that his best friend had been slightly down recently, but not suicidal. He also said this:

“He was always kind to his colleagues, especially to his juniors, and he genuinely cared about their welfare. He was the moral support of many of those who came into mathematical contact with him, including of course myself. Probably he was never conscious of this role he was playing. But I feel his noble generosity in this respect even more strongly now than when he was alive. And yet nobody was able to give him any support when he desperately needed it. Reflecting on this, I am overwhelmed by the bitterest grief.”

And this, one of the most interesting comments I have read about him:

“He was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to imitate him. But I've realized that it's very difficult to make good mistakes.”

Today, there is still some debate over the naming of the Taniyama-Shimura Theorem. You will notice that I name it after these two Japanese mathematicians (Shimura is, after all, still alive) but others call it the Weil Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil Theorem. This is because a Western mathematician called Andre Weil talked to them in the 1950s and wrote a paper about it in Western mathematics journals detailing the ideas and some work he had done in relation to it - but didn’t cite them at all. Many in the West first came to know about the idea from Weil’s paper, so they called it “Weil’s Theorem”.

Some people, such as Wikipedia
, simply call it the “Modularity Theorem” to be diplomatic; however, whenever I hear someone refer to it with “Weil” in the name, I recall Shimura calling him “a traitor” - for it is not for mathematicians to steal ideas - and whenever I read “Modularity Theorem”, I think of the photo above and Taniyama being forgotten.

Incidentally, I find the photo above one of the saddest I know - if there had to be just one photo left behind showing him, this wasn’t bad. He and Shimura were part of a college group of friends, full of bright sparks, and the photo above makes me think of the time I spend with my friends in the afternoons discussing maths together. It makes me wonder what he was like as a mathematician … or as a friend.

In memory of Yutaka Taniyama, 1927–1958.

With that condition in place, there are probably fewer than ten candidates at the very top level — the level where a Nobel Prize adds more to the prestige of the Nobel than it does to theirs.

Millikan, Bardeen, Feynman, Schwinger, Gell-Mann… maybe a couple of others? Weinberg?

But I’d vote for someone who towers above all these in terms of his actual achievement.

In popular recognition, he’s nowhere. If you Google his surname, you get a Wikipedia article on a fictional character from the show NCIS before you find him.

Hint. Not him:

Him:

Josiah Willard Gibbs

His achievements? They’re both enormous and rather difficult to communicate — but basically he took the mess of concepts about heat and microphysical dynamics that had been put together by Carnot, Clausius, Boltzmann, Maxwell and others, added a load of his own and tied them into a tear-jerkingly elegant framework that held together, matched experiment, and was flexible enough to be used by every physicist and physical chemist for the next 150 years. Amongst other things, Gibbs’ work founded the entire field of chemical thermodynamics — the field that tells us which reactions will happen and which won’t (which is just as important as it sounds).

In that sense Gibbs is up there with a Maxwell or a Dirac. I can’t do any better than Millikan’s summary:

… he did for statistical mechanics and for thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure

He was also all-American, receiving only the fifth PhD awarded in the US in 1861. His was a devout, Christian scholarly family, all of whose members achieved highly in scholarship, law and business. His father was a New Haven theologian and lawyer who was best-known for his involvement in the Amistad case, when he taught himself Mende from slaves and well-travelled sailors in order to prove the slave-owners’ stories to be false. Willard himself had a quiet, sober career at Yale, writing papers on the mathematics of statistical mechanics that were ignored by almost everyone around him, but were received with awe by the tiny number of physicists in Europe who could see what he was doing.

James Clerk Maxwell, and later Einstein, Planck, Poincare and Bohr all raved about the insights of this obscure, isolated American, who was working almost entirely alone. When Maxwell died in 1879, the joke at Yale went:

Only one man lived who could understand Gibbs’ papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead.

Einstein published papers on statistical mechanics in the early 1900s, But when he finally read Gibb’s 1902 textbook “Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics”, he noted that he would never have written them if he had known of Gibbs (whose works were not then published in German) — for Gibbs’ treatment was so much better than his. Later, he declared Gibbs as undoubtedly the “greatest American genius in history”. And then right at the end of his life Einstein was asked who was the most insightful person he had ever known. He said it was Henrik Lorentz, but added that if he had been able to meet Gibbs, his opinion might have been changed.

For anyone learning physics nowadays, the strangest feature of Gibbs’ work is simply that … it’s still used … unchanged. This almost never happens. When students learn Newton’s mechanics, they never use his original geometrical techniques: they use his ideas reinterpreted through layers of new concepts like vectors (oddly, a concept co-invented by Gibbs) and never actually make contact with Newton’s own writings. Likewise for Maxwell, Boltzmann or other path-blazers.

But Gibbs’ mathematical tools are pretty much unchanged today, and can be written down straight into the textbooks. They were so elegant, well-chosen and general that they even survived the quantum revolution. That is, while there was an earthquake in the understanding of the microphysical, Gibbs’ statistical mechanical framework survived intact, and we are still able to use his ideas in quantum mechanics. This is quite extraordinary, and the result of deliberate design by Gibbs. He was determinedly agnostic about the nature of the microphysical, and constructed his analysis on general enough principles that it would hold whatever the detailed dynamics turned out to be.

So, why is Gibbs so little known? Possibly, because as the above might hint: it’s quite difficult to explain why concepts like the grand canonical ensemble, the Gibbs Free Energy, and similar ideas are as important as they are, without going through a few years of undergraduate study first. So only a few physicists and chemists will ever appreciate what he did.

Another point is that Gibbs was quite so unassuming, normal and quiet. He didn’t deliberately cultivate his own legend, like Feynman. He didn’t (directly) create a technology that changed the world, like Bardeen. Nor did he emphasise the full scope and significance of his conclusions: he assumed that his readers were as insightful as him, and would easily see the consequences that would follow from his mathematics. They didn’t, and it often took several decades for the wider world to realise what he had done. In his personal life too, he was modest and did not seem to care one bit about his lack of recognition.

But if you look at Gibbs’ work, the extent to which it was unparalleled by his peers, and how over decades it influenced others and lies at the base of the advances in 20th Century physics and chemistry — it becomes clear that Gibbs was the greatest American physicist, and for that matter, the greatest American scientist in history.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nuwpbio2dc8rl5fy', 'title': 'Who is the greatest American physicist of all time?', 'score': {'original': 0.5176, 'ai': 0.4824}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'First, let’s say that when we say “American” we mean “American born and bred” as opposed to — say — “fled to America and took citizenship after their best work was done because Nazis”.

He was in charge of a group of people whose job it was to do long tedious amounts of arithmetic (because this was in an age before computers and pocket calculators). Although they were all civilians, the project was run by the US military. His military bosses were upset by the playful, “unmilitary” way he ran this group of people…so he taught them to do a kind of military ‘drill’ with their pencils. So on command, they’d lay their pencils on the edge of the desk - and in perfect synchronism whack one end with their hand so the pencil would flip up, twirl end-over-end and then be caught right in the correct place to begin writing. So when the general came around, Feynman would yell “Preseeeeeent PENCILS” and in perfect unison, 30 pencils would flip into the air and be ready to write!

He used science for everything. After his wife died, and he went into some kind of a depression, he decided to use scientific methods to learn how to pick up women in bars!

When he had a vacation, he’d take it by doing work in some totally different field - so normally, he did particle physics and such - but when he had a 2 week vacation, he’d go and work in a biology lab or something.

Feynman was also a great teacher (unusual for great scientists) and his lectures on Physics 101 are still so great that the three volume set of books transcribed from them are still used in many Physics 101 courses today.

His most famous thing was after the first Space Shuttle disaster. There was a committee formed to look into the problems. Feynman actually ignored most of the committee work and just wandered around talking to NASA engineers. He found that the “O-rings” in the shuttle SRB’s would fail to work adequately at cold temperatures - and the engineers who knew this couldn’t get themselves heard. So in front of a bazillion camera - and after a bunch of other committee members had blathered on about this and that - Feynman took a piece of O-ring material out of his pocket, clamped it in a small C-clamp and dunked it into the glass of iced water that had been provided for each of the committee members. After a few seconds, he pulled it out of the iced water, released the clamp and showed…right there…on live television - that the material didn’t expand as it needed to do.

This demonstration - super-simple though it was - totally blew away thousands of pages of reports and graphs and who-knows-what. EVERYBODY who watched that presentation understood immediately what went wrong.

Bad-assed…and then some! (Oh yeah - Quantum Electrodynamics…Nobel Prize…yadda yadda).

Sangram Sagar,1y,What are some historical records of the reversal of the Earth's magnetic field?,"In Ngawha, on the North Island of New Zealand, an ancient tree has been discovered that contains a record of a reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. The tree - an Agathis australis, also known as the Maori name kauri - was found during excavation work for the expansion of a geothermal power plant.

The tree was buried 9 meters deep and measures 2.4m in diameter and 30m in length. Carbon dating indicated that she lived for 1,500 years, between 41,000 and 42,500 years ago.

“There is none of this anywhere in the world. This Ngāwhā kauri is unique.”

The lifespan of the kauri tree covers a point in Earth's history when the magnetic field nearly reversed. Magnetic north and south have shifted positions, but a complete reversal has not taken place. It was almost a reversal.

The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by the iron in the planet's core. It produces electrical currents that extend into space as they move. The magnetic field is really like a barrier that protects the planet from the solar wind, which is a stream of particles from the Sun that could remove the Earth's atmosphere, as happened on Mars. With the magnetic field, they are attracted to the poles.

When the magnetic field reverses, it weakens and the planet suffers more from the effect of the Sun's radiation. Scientists have already linked extinction events to reversals of magnetic fields.

The rings of this kauri tree have a complete record of this near reversal, and this is the first time a tree that lived through the entire event has been found.

Scientists are now analyzing samples from the tree and are led by Chris Turney of the University of New South Wales, an expert in paleoclimatology and climate change for the past 40,000 years. The research is being funded by the Research Council of Australia.

Turney explained:

“The precious thing is that this huge lone tree grew for about 1700 years in a remarkable period in our planet's history, when Earth's magnetic field reversed 42,000 years ago, a period known as the Laschamp Excursion. We're doing a detailed analysis of carbon-14 in the various rings of this tree.

In the last 83 million years, there have been 183 magnetic pole reversals.

This process takes about 7,000 years to complete. Monika Korte, scientific director of the Niemegk Geomagnetic Observatory at GFZ Potsdam, Germany, says:

“It is not a sudden movement, but a slow process, during which the strength of the field becomes weak, most likely the field becomes more complex and may show more than two poles for a while, and then it strengthens and aligns itself in the same direction. opposite direction.""

According to NASA, magnetic field reversals occur at random intervals, although over the last 20 million years it appears to have settled into a pattern, occurring once every 200,000 to 300,000 years.

The last total reversal took place about 780,000 years ago.

Recently, scientists announced that the magnetic north pole had moved unexpectedly.

Instead of constantly tracking from the Canadian Arctic towards Siberia, it sped up so much that researchers had to update the World Magnetic Model (WMM), which is a representation of Earth's magnetic field. It is used extensively in navigation by the US Department of Defense, the UK Ministry of Defense, and many civilian systems - so knowing exactly where the north and south magnetic poles are is of utmost importance.

Brady Swanson,Updated 4y,What scientific photos are hard to believe but are indeed real?,"The Pale Blue Dot.

On the surface, this photo doesn’t look like much, right? Just some blackness, a few colorful lines…where’s even the dot?

Oh, there it is.

At first glance, you might think that you’re looking at an atom, or some other extremely small particle. Certainly something extremely tiny that’s been magnified, right?

Nope.

On February 14th, 1990, NASA, (at the request of the legendary Carl Sagan himself), sent a command to the Voyager 1 space probe for it to orient its cameras towards Earth and take one last photo before journeying on into the Kuiper Belt.

And at a distance of 6.05 billion kilometers (3.76 billion miles), at a point in space beyond the orbit of Neptune, Voyager 1 did just that.

It is the most distant photo ever taken of the Earth.

Just think about it…

That tiny, pale blue dot- that little, itty-bitty speck suspended in the dark void of empty space…is us.

It is Earth.

It is our home.

It is the birthplace of every living being we’ve ever discovered.

The battleground for every war and battle ever fought.

The workshop for every inventor and scientist.

The studio where every piece of music was composed- where every painting was imagined.

It is the only known place in the universe that harbors life.

That little, tiny, fragile speck contains everything that anyone has experienced.

Every heartbreak.

Every first kiss.

Every baby’s first cries.

Every final, dying breath.

Every triumphant moment of victory.

Every crushing day of defeat.

Every great cry of joy.

Every sorrowful weep of misery.

Everything that has been experienced, every life that has been lived- not just by humans, but by all living things, from bacteria to dinosaurs- has taken place on that tiny, insignificant pale blue dot.

This picture really puts things into perspective for me.

It reminds me that no matter how large my problems, or how great my triumphs- they are irrelevant in the grand face of the Universe.

And yet, looking at this picture, I can’t help but feel lucky for my existence- to have a chance to experience all that this tiny, yet intricate world has to offer.

It truly is a humbling thought for a resident of the Pale Blue Dot.

Franklin Veaux,4y,How often do scientists lie about their experiments?,"Very, very rarely, because of this thing called “peer review.”

What is peer review?

People have this notion that scientists are a bunch of eggheads in a lab concocting elaborate conspiracies. “Say, Dr. Schnausenpuss, would you like to help me suppress this cure for cancer I’ve just discovered?” “Why, I’d love to, Dr. Blinkenlites, but I’ve already told Dr. Frizzenstern I would help him with his global warming hoax. Mwah ha ha!”

In reality, scientists are a cantankerous, backstabbing bunch who love proving other scientists wrong even more than they love winning Nobel Prizes.

A typical peer review session looks like this:

You know what peer review is? Peer review is when you take the meanest kid in your middle school on his worst day, give him a doctorate in your field of study, and tell him his life’s mission is to destroy you.

If you lie about your experiment, he will find out...

Stephen Doherty,Updated 5y,What are some unintended science inventions in history?,"Percy Spencer worked as an engineer for Raytheon - a company that made and sold military radars.

In 1945, Percy walked by a radar room with a chocolate bar in his pocket.

He came too close to the magnetron tube.

When he reached in to his pocket to for his chocolate bar, he found that the chocolate had melted.

Known for his curiosity, he began pointing the magnetron at pop corn kernels, eggs and any other food item he could find.

And so the “Radarange”, or the “microwave oven” as we know it, was discovered.

He found he could stack these units to recreate all the crystal forms of the minerals, so these must represent the shapes of fundamental units that made up the minerals.\n\nHaüy, in my view, is a neglected pioneer in the discovery of atoms.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9973

Raymond Martinez,Updated 7y,What are some unintended science inventions in history?,"Percy Spencer was 18 months old when his father died. His mother soon left him to his aunt and uncle. Eventually, his uncle also died when Spencer was just seven years old. He didn’t finish grammar school; instead tried his hands working at a spool mill. He held this job from the age of 12 until he was 16 years old.

One day he heard about a nearby paper mill that was having some daunting electrical concerns that intrigued him. He tried to learn what he could about the problem with the mill, and somehow became one of three people who were hired to install electricity in the mill, despite no formal education in electrical engineering.

Later on he got interested in wireless communications.

When Spencer turned 18, he decided to join the U.S. Navy where he made himself an expert on radio technology by reading a lot of textbooks on the subject and teaching himself during his night duty. Spencer was very precocious; he even taught himself trigonometry, calculus, chemistry, physics, and metallurgy, and other subjects.

In 1939, Spencer saw himself as one of the world’s leading experts in radar tube design while working at Raytheon. It is said the company where Spencer worked with had won government contracts to develop and produce combat radar equipment due mainly to his reputation and expertise in the field. The projects they did were of huge importance to the Allied Forces during World War II.

It was at Raytheon when Spencer tried to investigate something strange that happened to his candy bar inside his pocket. While Spencer was working on building magnetrons for radar sets, he was standing in front of an active radar when his candy bar melted in his pocket. At this point he and other colleagues began positioning the magnetron in a manner to direct heat at other food items like popcorn kernels and egg to see if a similar effect would occur.

Needless to say, this accidental melting of his candy bar inside his pocket led Percy Spencer, an orphan and a grammar school dropout, to invent the microwave oven that is used in most households today.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hj96zqm8i05puonc', 'title': 'What are some unintended science inventions in history?', 'score': {'original': 0.9983, 'ai': 0.0017}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Percy Spencer was 18 months old when his father died.

Hayden Miller,Updated 7y,Who is your favorite scientist and why?,"Marie Curie

Look at her being the only woman at the Solvay conference with Schrödinger, Einstein, Bragg, Dirac, Bohr, Planck etc. and not giving a single fuck.

She was born to a poor family in Poland, her mother died and her father struggled to support them. In a quest to become independent and get a higher education (which she was forbidden as a woman in Poland), she moved to France at 24. She then got 2 degrees whilst supporting herself.

She then went on to be the first and only scientist to receive two Nobel Prizes in different fields of science - Physics and Chemistry.

During the war, she set up a radiology institute, inventing mobile x-ray units and donated the Nobel Prize money to the war effort. Still, she went unrecognised by the French government for her efforts.

Throughout her life, both her and Pierre, her husband, refused countless awards and donated all excess funding to friends and charities. She denied the risks of her research with radioactive isotopes and wrote a book Radioactivity in the throes of radiation poisoning [fucking hardcore]. She never patented her methods such as not to hinder future scientific research and honoured her husband after his death by the naming of a road (Rue Pierre-Curie, where the Radium Institute was built) and the writing of a biography.

PS : he was equipped with jetpacks with nitrogen thrusters controlled by the unit

2)Photo 51 : the first ever picture of DNA ever taken

It is the first step to identify the double helix structure of DNA by Rosalind Franklin in 1952

3)The Pale Blue Dot

The pale blue dot is the first picture of earth taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the space probe surpassed Saturn.The second picture was filmed by Cassini in 2013

4)The Extreme Deep Field

This is an image released by NASA by combining the pictures taken by Hubble Space Telescope for 10 years.This image shows thousands of galaxies that date back to about 13.2 billion years while the universe is estimated to be 13.7 billion years old.

5)Trinity Nuclear Test

The first ever nuclear test named Trinity held at 5:29 am on July 16 1945 that took place at 35 miles southeast from Socorro, New Mexico.

6)Pioneer Plaque

This might look simple but it has so much related to the human race. It was affixed to Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 space crafts in 1972 and 1973 respectively which were first set to leave solar system so that the aliens could read and find out about the humans.

7) Picture of Saturn’s moons in alignment

NASA's Cassini satellite has spent in the orbit of Saturn for over a decade and has taken many photos of saturn and its moons and this is the pic of its moons coming into perfect alignment

Sean Kernan,1y,What are some of the most useful inventions that were created by mistake?,"Penicillin.

Dr. Alex Fleming went into his lab after being away for several weeks of vacation.

As he settled back into his lab, he noticed mold growing inside one of his petri dishes. Yet interestingly, there was a halo around the mold, preventing bacteria from getting nearer.

It had emitted antibacterial properties.

This led to the insight that he could use a chemical from that mold to treat bacterial infections.

Penicillin under the microscope.

At one point, penicillin was so expensive that it was extracted from other patients' urine to reuse on other patients.

But in the end, it saved so, so, so many lives.

Smallpox had a similar trajectory of discovery. It began after doctors found out that milk maids weren’t catching smallpox. They then learned that cowpox provided immunity against smallpox.

There’s actually an incredible number of inventions and innovations that scientists stumbled into.

Michael B.,Updated 3y,"Is there such thing as ""Lost Technology,"" or is that a myth?","Little bit of A, little bit of B.

The Saturn V rocket, it would be all but impossible to recreate this rocket in 2020.

Every industry has something called institutional, or tribal knowledge. Knowledge crucial to the industry which is never written down, either because its so basic that it’s not worth writing down or because it’s not something that can easily be written down.

But this knowledge only exists so long as people make use of it. There is a rumor that NASA lost the blueprints to the Saturn V rocket. While it is true that Nasa no longer has the ability to produce these rockets, it’s not because they lost the blueprints, it’s because they lost the people.

The rockets were built by experts who could fill in the gaps left by the blueprints. Without them the knowledge to build these rockets was lost, since no blueprint can ever be 100% complete.

And that’s for a rocket build 50 years ago in a society with almost 100% literacy. Imagine how much more institutional knowledge was lost because the people who had it couldn’t write at all.

Damascus steel, real Damascus steel was a now forgotten alloy used to make swords. We believe that the steel itself was imported. Something happened to disrupt the trade routes, the blacksmiths had to find other jobs, and their knowledge wasn’t passed to the next generation.

Until recently Roman concrete was of a higher quality than modern concrete. The written recipe was written down, but something was always missing. Turns out the Romans used salt water for concrete, a detail so obvious to them they never wrote it down.

Antikythera Mechanism, computer model showing what it would have looked like when first built.

And then there are the one offs. The Antikythera Mechanism, the Baghdad Battery, Heron of Alexandria’s steam engine. The technologies that were produced by some mad genius, which never caught on because the technologies needed to make them useful didn’t exist.

A computer built by a society that had no concept of decimal math, let alone binary. A steam engine which couldn’t be scaled up because of inadequate metallurgy. A battery which had nothing to be plugged into.

Finally there are the technologies that were lost because even the people who used them didn’t fully understand them. The ancient Egyptians were using penicillin thousands of years before Alexander Fleming. But they had no means of purifying it, nor did they understand what it was.

And their knowledge was dismissed by future generations who saw it as mere superstition.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qdl5u8v6ynjz4r2h', 'title': 'Is there such thing as ""Lost Technology,"" or is that a myth?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Little bit of A, little bit of B.\n\nThe Saturn V rocket, it would be all but impossible to recreate this rocket in 2020.\n\nEvery industry has something called institutional, or tribal knowledge.

Tim Chang,5y,What are some unintended science inventions in history?,"Stainless Steel

Stainless steel was discovered by accident in England in 1912.

Harry Brearley was working for a gun manufacturer, and was trying to find a material more resistant to wear. The internal diameter of gun barrels wore away too quickly due to heat and discharge gases. He experimented with putting 10–20% chromium into steel.

Here’s where historians can’t agree what happens next.

Some say, that he didn’t properly dispose of the failed batches and just left them outside. After a few months he noticed that they had not rusted, and thus the discovery of stainless steel.

Others say that when attempting to analyse the steel/chromium mixture under a microscope that he needed to first etch with nitric acid, he found it remarkably resistant to corrosion.

Rather than finding a wear-resistant steel, he had found a corrosion resistant steel.

Either way, realising the potential of his discovery, he went to a cutlery manufacturer to get knives made in this new material. It was first called “rustless steel”, but the manager, Ernest Stuart renamed it “stainless steel” when he failed to stain it with vinegar.

Brearley applied for a US patent in 1915, and later that year an article in the New York Times introduced the world to stainless steel.

Today, stainless steel is ubiquitous in the modern world. It is used everywhere from manufacturing, automotive, aviation and construction industries to surgical instruments, locks and just about anything that might be exposed to the weather.

Modern stainless also adds nickel to the mixture. A ratio of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, is the most common grade of stainless, often shortened to 18–8, or 304 stainless.

Jay Mishra,1y,When and why did the Islamic world lose the scientific edge it once had?,"The when is easy. The 14th & 15th Century Renaissance when the Europeans rose to be dominant

The why is far more interesting.

The fourteenth century Arab culture was the pinnacle of civilization. Women had rights and were an equal partner in knowledge and the running society. Prosperity (relatively) abound, warring factions were more or less united. But..

The Arabs were excellent on theoretical knowledge, trade and mobile equipment. Now that makes sense, because the empire was vast. Imagine an empire 3x of Europe, from Jerusalem to the borders of India (modern day Pakistan). They needed mobile knowledge, that could be transmitted via trade routes.

Once heavy machinery came into common practice, the Arab method was obselete. They couldn’t have a particular base, because their empire was based on movement. The society was extensively nomadic. And heavy machinery didn't work it for nomads.

Heavy equipment was the challenge, and resulted in a slow but gradual decay.

For example, Islamic calligraphers were sought the world over for copying books and texts. A vastly profitable & respectable position. But the advent of the printing press made them obsolete

No development of port based infrastructure along the desert, because they preferred the silk route. But being in proximity to European development ensured that the closer segments (Turkish empire/Iran) split up from the main culture and focused on localized development. Other examples:

Ginning equipment and textile mills rendered embroidery obselete
Steam engines rendered traditional carts obsolete
Steel milling rendered smithies obsolete
Focus was starting to grow on mining practices, which the Islamic world knew nothing about (crude oil was still a few centuries off)
Prefabrication of building materials rendered their architecture outdated

When you throw stone on water surface with revolutions at angle of 20 to 25 degree , stone will bounce on water twice or thrice or even more . It's rotation cause these bounces .

In America they held championship of stone skipping .

It's kind of fun and amazing mechanism to watch.

Can you imagine that this technique might be used to build the bomb ?

Yes it was.

During second world war Britain was facing heavy air attacks from Germany . To stop those attacks they will have to destroy their production line . Which was secured with anti aircraft gun and Radar . Generally these machinery industries require lots of water . To fulfill the need they built their industries near the dams .

In order to destroy the aircraft industries Britain need to destroy these dams.

Möhne dam
Eder dam
Sorpe dam
Ennepe dam

But it was too much difficult as all these dams have anti torpedo nets protecting it from any attack .

To destroy it one need to blast the bomb at the base of dam .

Britain developed special bomb for this named “bouncing bomb” which was invented by Burnes Willis .

Its shape was like drum . Its weight was around 4000 kg . It's released at Target with 500 rpm . This will help to skip on the water . And after reaching to the wall of dam it's revolutions help it to stick to the wall . This bomb now acts as a depth charge . After reaching to certain depth it will blow up.

Britain was successful to slow down German aircraft production by attacking with these bombs .

It had a great impact on WW2.

Can anyone imagine that this beautiful and innocent game of skipping the stone could be used in such a disastrous attack ?

Well this is the world where anything can happen.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zxfoc3rdjgtlbyh1', 'title': 'What are the most fascinating science facts?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Do you know this .\n\nWhen you throw stone on water surface with revolutions at angle of 20 to 25 degree , stone will bounce on water twice or thrice or even more .

Cihad Kıbrıs,5y,What are the most fascinating science facts?,"‘’Cosmic Replay’’

This is one of the most spectacular examples of how fascinating our universe could possibly get: Provided with the right conditions, it operates in such a way that it allows us to see a cosmic event re-play. Let’s see how it works:

First of all, this phenomenon is a direct consequence of Einstein’s theory of general relativity in which he proposed that space-time is curved under the influence of mass and energy(1915). Soon after its formulation, scientists at the time embarked on a series of experiments aimed at the predictions of the general relativity. One of them was the expedition conducted by Eddington to observe the 1919’s solar eclipse off Africa. They reasoned, if space-time is curved by mass, then the paths light rays take in gravitational field would also be curved and the effect would be noticeable in the light emitted by the background stars that are normally outshined by the Sun during the day but become visible in solar eclipses during which the sunshine is mostly blocked out by the Moon. They observed that the gravity of the Sun deflected the light rays from the background stars that happened to pass by, making them appear slightly different from where they actually are in great accordance with the theory.

Today this effect is known as the ‘’gravitational lensing’’ since the deflecting body behaves like a lens that focuses light.

To date, astronomers have caught a lot of weird pictures that are explained by gravitational lensing; however, the most interesing case, in my opinion, is the ‘’Supernova Refsdal’’ that happened only once far behind MACS J1149.5+2223 galaxy cluster.

What’s interesting about it is that this massive intervening galaxy cluster acted as a lens and focused split images of the supernova to the Hubble. Since the paths the photons emanating from the supernova follow are all different, they arrived at the Earth at different times. With as large as a decade interval!

For instance, one of the images (the upper red circle) reached the Earth in around 1995. One (the lower circle) did in 2014 as four separate bright spots, forming an ‘’Einstein cross’’(This is also a result of lensing). Estimating and studying the amount of matter combined with dark matter and how they’re distributed across the cluster, astronomers predicted another path for the photons. And they started pointing the Hubble at the cluster’s surrounding periodically. Finally, on 11th of December 2015, they captured the anticipated re-appearance of the Supernova Refsdal(in the middle circle), making it the first time ever to predict a supernova. They are essentially seeing the same explosion take place over and over again, which is nothing short of a cosmic replay.

Israel Ramirez,Updated 5y,Was the greatest biologist of the 20th century wrong to claim that smoking is harmless?,"By 1958 most scientists had concluded that smoking causes cancer. But not R.A. Fisher. He wrote that “Unfortunately, considerable propaganda is now being developed to convince the public that cigarette smoking is dangerous, and it is perhaps natural that efforts should be made to discredit evidence which suggests a different view.”

That’s unusually blunt for him. He also said the same thing in his typical style, which was so formal that it reads like a parody of scientific writing: [1]

THE CURIOUS ASSOCIATIONS with lung cancer found in relation to smoking habits do not, in them in the minds of some of us, lend themselves easily to the simple conclusion that the products of combustion reaching the surface of the bronchus induce, though after a long interval, the development of a cancer.

Who was he?

Fisher has been called the greatest biologist since Darwin. [2] His list of accomplishments is astonishing:

Solved many of the mathematical problems involved in making Mendel’s theory of genetics compatible with Darwin’s theory of evolution. He is usually described as one of the three founders of theoretical genetics but he is the one most commonly cited today.
Devised many important theories about how evolution works, including heterozygote advantage, the need for sex, why there are equal numbers of males and females, mate choice, mimicry, parental investment, sexual selection, and much more. His ideas often come up in modern evolutionary discussions.
Developed the logical basis for analyzing experiments. Every experiment done by biological and behavioral scientists uses his logic. If you learned about hypothesis testing in science classes, you can thank Fisher for that.
Devised the techniques, that are still used now, to properly conduct studies on the effects of fertilizer and other treatments on plant growth. He’s part of the green revolution.
Invented the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method for statistical analysis. Nearly all biological and behavioral scientists use it regularly.
And lots, and lots more… [3]

Why didn’t he think that smoking caused cancer?

Until near the end of his life, the strongest evidence came from correlational studies. He pointed out that just because many people with lung cancer had once smoked, that doesn’t prove that smoking causes cancer.

And, what’s more, he had strong evidence against the smoking-cancer connection. Smokers who inhale are less likely to get cancer than smokers who don’t inhale. [4] If cigarette smoke really caused cancer, inhaling ought to increase it because that’s how cigarette smoke gets to the lungs.

Fisher also pointed out that “When the sexes are compared it is found that lung cancer has been increasing more rapidly in men relative to women.“ That’s something you wouldn’t expect if smoking caused cancer in both sexes.[5]

He concluded that “The theory that increased smoking is ""the cause"" of the change in apparent incidence lung cancer is not even tenable…“ He proposed, instead, that some factor that caused people to take up smoking also caused cancer. Maybe, some gene caused both.

Correlational studies can’t disprove arguments of this sort.

But don’t we know that smoking causes cancer?

We do now. Starting at around the time that Fisher made his arguments, scientists began identifying chemicals in cigarette smoke that cause cells to become cancerous. Those studies established a clear mechanism by which smoking causes cancer.[6]

But Fisher was right about correlational studies.

Scientists conduct a lot of correlational studies and report their findings as if they had shown some health benefit or disadvantage from consuming something.

This chart, for example, supposedly shows that drinking small amounts of alcohol each day makes you live longer, though drinking a lot makes you die younger.[7]

If Fisher were alive today, he would say that studies of this sort prove nothing.

The same issue comes up in nutritional studies on the effects of eating sugar, saturated fat, milk, caffeine, and lots more:

Israel Ramirez's answer to Why is there no clear correlation between refined sugar consumption and diabetes?

Israel Ramirez's answer to Why can't scientists tell us whether eating saturated fat is harmful to health?

Israel Ramirez's answer to Is milk really healthy or is it the number one cause of sickness or disease?

Israel Ramirez's answer to Does decaf provide the same health benefits as regular coffee? What extra benefit does caffeine provide, besides the jolt?

A. Peterson,Updated 4y,What scientific photos are hard to believe but are indeed real?,"Using a few images, I hope to demonstrate something that many people—especially young people—just don't seem to believe will ever happen to them.

I'm talking, of course, about noise-induced hearing loss. Before you crank up your speakers or headphones or attend another concert, look at the images below. Maybe you'll think twice.

Here's an electron micrograph showing the receptor cells inside a normal ear:

Each of the V-shaped structures is a collection of stiff hairlike protrusions that bend back and forth in response to vibrations from sound pressure waves. The three prominent rows show the hairs of the receptor cells that detect very weak vibrations and amplify them so they can be better detected by the cells in the single row which is just visible along the top of the image. These are the cells that send acoustic information to your brain. In any case, all of these cells work together to enable normal hearing sensitivity.

Here's a close-up view of the hairs on one hair cell (in a different animal, maybe even a different species, I'm not sure):

These hairs are exquisitely sensitive, capable of detecting vibrations that bend them by the width of a single atom! Unsurprisingly, these sensitive structures are fairly easily damaged by exposure to loud sounds. First the close-up view:

And now the wider view:

The previously orderly arrangement has been massively disrupted. This has a profound impact on hearing, and it's not reversible or treatable. Please, think about your hearing, especially if you're young and can still prevent the sorts of damage that so many young people subject themselves to. Your middle-aged and elderly self will thank you for it. It's easy to overlook the damage in the early years, but by the time you notice hearing problems, you've likely already destroyed more than one-third of your hair cells!

Addendum regarding terminology:

Although the auditory receptor cells are called “hair cells"" and their projections are described as “hairs”, they are not really made of hair at all. Instead, they are stereocilia, which are similar to microvilli. They contain a rigid crosslinked actin core and are covered by cell membrane.

Sources:

The wide-view images come from Listen Up! Protect Your Hearing
, a website the CDC produced to inform young people about hearing damage. A better resource for adults is probably What Noises Cause Hearing Loss?

The close-up images seem to originally come from the Dangerous Decibels

Bill Fryer,Updated 2y,What are the most fascinating science facts?,"1. If you stand in the sunlight for one second, 20 trillion neutrinos
 (a type of elementary particle) will pass right through your head without hitting a single atom. In fact, the same thing will happen even if you stand in the shade.

Most of these neutrinos will pass right through the Earth and continue travelling onward to galaxies so distant that their light hasn’t yet reached the Earth.

Neutrinos are so small we don’t even know their size. Their mass is estimated to be one millionth of an electron.

Yet, these tiny, mysterious particles outnumber electrons, protons and neutrons in our universe by a factor of about 10 billion to one
.

Unlike other particles, neutrinos travel in straight lines, so if we trace their trajectory we can determine where they came from.

This is exactly what scientists at the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory
 did when they mapped the course of a single neutrino arriving from outer space in September, 2017.

Astronomers traced the trajectory of the neutrino back to a massive black hole
 at the center of a galaxy 3.7 billion light years away.

(picture credit: Icecube/NASA)

Since neutrinos travel at or near the speed of light, this specific neutrino must have started its journey from the black hole slightly before the origin of life on Earth.

2. While we are on the topic of black holes, did you know there is a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way?

It’s located here, at Sagittarius A*
, 26,000 light years from Earth:

In fact, astronomers have calculated that there is a black hole at the center of most, if not all galaxies. A black hole seems to be an essential element of a galaxy.

3. Do galaxies create black holes? Or do black holes create galaxies?

Previously, astronomers assumed that galaxies create black holes by accumulating enormous amounts of matter at the center of the galaxy due to gravity.

But some recent evidence suggests that the reverse might be true. Black holes might actually be responsible for the creation of galaxies.

Some black holes have a relativistic jet
 that ejects matter like the neutrino detected by the IceCube Observatory.

Evidence suggests that black holes interact with the surrounding matter via their jets, potentially creating stars and galaxies in the process.

This is certainly an interesting finding and may require us to rethink our understanding of the formation of the universe.

Here is an actual photo of a relativistic jet of matter ejected from the black hole at the center of the Messier 87
 galaxy, as observed by the Hubble telescope:

The line of matter you see in this image is 4,400 light years long (41.6 quadrillion kilometers).

4. While we are on the topic of distance and light years, did you know there are 33 stars within only 12.5 light years of planet Earth?

The closest star is Proxima Centauri
, at a distance of only 4.2 light years (40 trillion km).

Believe it or not, this distance could be navigable by human technology.

The Voyager 1
 space probe, which was launched by NASA in 1977, has already left our solar system and has traveled 22 billion km.

It is on its way to star AC +79 3888, which is much further away than Proxima Centauri. Granted, you and I won’t be alive when it gets there, but human civilization will still be around.

Here are the current locations of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2
 probes in relation to our solar system:

Despite traveling non-stop for the past 42 years, these probes are still in communication with NASA’s Deep Space Network
, which can issue them basic commands and receive data from them.

While human interstellar travel is the stuff of science fiction and is extremely unlikely, the possibility remains that in the far distant future, humans might find a way to travel such distances, and might even find a reasonably hospitable planet in a nearby star system to start a new colony for human life before our Sun begins to expand and die.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/67pxmylk0s39vctr', 'title': 'What are the most fascinating science facts?', 'score': {'original': 0.79495, 'ai': 0.20505}, 'blocks': [{'text': '1.

Guy D. McCardle,3y,What is the greatest scientific fraud of the past 50 years?,"I think the rise and fall of Theranos is the greatest scientific fraud in recent times. The story is fascinating in a sick and twisted way, and the end has yet to be written.

Theranos is a company founded in 2003 by then 19-year-old Stanford dropout Elizabeth Holmes. Her idea was to use a tiny amount of blood obtained by a finger stick and run it through a machine only slightly larger than a microwave oven to diagnose everything from the common cold to HIV.

In theory, it’s a great idea. In practice, it could never be made to work. That didn’t stop Holmes, however.

** Holmes shows off a “nanotainer.” This was the container that held the blood sample intended to go through her diagnostic machine, which was then supposed to spit out the results of hundreds of sophisticated diagnostic tests.

To understand the fraud, it helps to know a little about the woman. To call her interesting and odd would be an understatement.

Elizabeth Holmes went from college dropout to tech billionaire and back to being broke in a little over a decade. She now faces millions of dollars in fines and up to 20 years in prison.

One of her most unusual qualities is her deep baritone voice. To me, she sounds a bit like Kermit the Frog. Decide for yourself. Those who knew her in her pre-Theranos days say she didn’t always sound like that.

Then there is the fact that she almost never blinks. She has a wide-eyed stare and a look that would make even the most hardened skeptics believe that aliens exist.

The other odd thing that I’ll talk about is her obsession with Steve Jobs. She idolizes him so much that the vast majority of her wardrobe is black and is mostly made up of black turtlenecks.

Back to the fraud part: Her company eventually raised 700 million from venture capitalists and private investors. It had a 10 billion dollar peak valuation in 2014. As I said, it was a good idea and would have made people lots of money if it had worked.

But it didn’t work as it was supposed to and that fact was very well and carefully hidden from investors and potential customers. Theranos employees who were aware of the system’s limitations weren’t free to talk because they all had signed non-disclosure agreements that would have penalized them significantly had they blown the whistle.

** The Theranos blood-testing device known as “Edison .”

The downfall of Theranos began in 2015 when John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal did a story on the company. He felt something wasn’t quite right, so he began to dig deeper. What he uncovered was a web of lies and fraud.

The company had been taking more and more money from investors when in reality, the Edison could only run a handful of the most rudimentary blood tests. Even then, they weren’t done well.

The other more sophisticated tests that the machines were supposed to be performing were farmed out to established laboratories without investor's or patients' knowledge.

The Wall Street Journal piece prompted investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) various state attorneys general, private attorneys, and others.

When the truth was discovered, Holmes's net worth plummeted from 4.5 billion dollars to almost nothing. The massive multi-billion-dollar company was eventually forced to shut its doors due to bankruptcy.

She and former company president Sunny Balwani were charged with “massive fraud” by the SEC in March of 2018. A section of the complaint against them stated that the company had annual reported revenues of $100 million in 2014 when the actual figure was closer to $100,000.

Holmes ended up paying a fine of $500,000, relinquishing the 18.9 million shares she held in the company, giving up control of the company, and being barred from being an officer or director in any public company for ten years.

In June of 2018, the State of California indicted Holmes on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy. Her trial was supposed to begin in August of 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID pandemic. It has been rescheduled to begin on March 9th, 2021.

Holmes has been quoted as saying:

“Success is not a matter of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.”

And that she did. She burnt herself and her company completely to the ground.

Israel Ramirez,4y,What were some well known scientific facts that were later proven wrong?,"From 1923 until 1956 scientists thought that humans had 48 chromosomes (24 pairs). In 1956, better methods of preparing cells allowed scientists to get the correct number, 46 (23 pairs). You would think that it should be easy to count chromosomes. Just take some dividing cells, slice them, add dyes to make the chromosomes easier to see, and count them under a microscope. Sounds straightforward.

Any Biology textbook will show you pictures like this, confirming that counting them ought to be easy.[1]

Actually, the next picture is a bit closer to what scientists saw using a microscope in the middle of the 20th Century.[2] You can see that the person who set this up had trouble distinguishing between chromosomes 4–5, 6–12, 13–15, 17–18, 19–20, and 21–22; they are too similar to distinguish. [3]

But even that picture makes things seem too easy because the scientist cut up the chromosomes from a photo and lined them up. Here’s Theophilus Painter’s drawing of what he saw in 1923.[4] Though that looks like a jumbled mess, it’s one of his best images he had. I understand that if you count them you get 48 (too confusing for me to even try).

The problem is that cells are 3-dimensional objects but microscopes can only see in two dimensions. If chromosomes sit on top of one another, you may only see the ones on top. A long chromosome could appear as two if the middle is obscured. A pair of chromosomes sitting very close to each other could look like one.

Scientists had begun trying to count human chromosomes since the 1890s. By 1914 at least 15 investigators had published papers reporting the chromosome number in humans. Most of them got 48 (24 pairs). Painter’s study in 1923 convinced him, and most of the scientific community, that the correct number was 48 though there were some who doubted that number.

Finally, in 1956 Dr. Joe Hin Tjio

working with Albert Levan improved the methods for getting pictures of chromosomes and got the right count.[5]

Here’s what their chromosomes looked like in one of their best photos. It’s still hard to tell some of the chromosomes apart but they can be counted fairly easily.

The technology they used is beyond my expertise but my source says that treating the cells with hypotonic (low salt) water and a drug called colchicine were crucial.

Dr. Joe Hin Tjio was a concentration camp survivor

Tjio was born to Indonesian parents of Chinese origin in Java and did research on potato breeding before he was imprisoned for 3 years and tortured by the Japanese in a concentration camp during World War II. After the war, he moved to Europe, doing work in Denmark and Spain before making his crucial discoveries in Sweden.

He and his mentor, Levan, disagreed over who should get the credit for the discovery. Levan was the head of the laboratory but Tjio did the work and made the original counts. Historians generally credit Tjio.

The Moral of this Story

Even the simplest things in science can be really hard. Errors can persist for a long time until improved methods make it possible to move forward.

Sounds straightforward.\n\nAny Biology textbook will show you pictures like this, confirming that counting them ought to be easy.[1]\n\nActually, the next picture is a bit closer to what scientists saw using a microscope in the middle of the 20th Century.[2] You can see that the person who set this up had trouble distinguishing between chromosomes 4–5, 6–12, 13–15, 17–18, 19–20, and 21–22; they are too similar to distinguish. [3]\n\nBut even that picture makes things seem too easy because the scientist cut up the chromosomes from a photo and lined them up. Here’s Theophilus Painter’s drawing of what he saw in 1923.[4] Though that looks like a jumbled mess, it’s one of his best images he had. I understand that if you count them you get 48 (too confusing for me to even try).\n\nThe problem is that cells are 3-dimensional objects but microscopes can only see in two dimensions. If chromosomes sit on top of one another, you may only see the ones on top. A long chromosome could appear as two if the middle is obscured. A pair of chromosomes sitting very close to each other could look like one.\n\nScientists had begun trying to count human chromosomes since the 1890s. By 1914 at least 15 investigators had published papers reporting the chromosome number in humans. Most of them got 48 (24 pairs). Painter’s study in 1923 convinced him, and most of the scientific community, that the correct number was 48 though there were some who doubted that number.\n\nFinally, in 1956 Dr. Joe Hin Tjio\n\nworking with Albert Levan improved the methods for getting pictures of chromosomes and got the right count.[5]\n\nHere’s what their chromosomes looked like in one of their best photos. It’s still hard to tell some of the chromosomes apart but they can be counted fairly easily.\n\nThe technology they used is beyond my expertise but my source says that treating the cells with hypotonic (low salt) water and a drug called colchicine were crucial.\n\nDr. Joe Hin Tjio was a concentration camp survivor\n\nTjio was born to Indonesian parents of Chinese origin in Java and did research on potato breeding before he was imprisoned for 3 years and tortured by the Japanese in a concentration camp during World War II. After the war, he moved to Europe, doing work in Denmark and Spain before making his crucial discoveries in Sweden.\n\nHe and his mentor, Levan, disagreed over who should get the credit for the discovery. Levan was the head of the laboratory but Tjio did the work and made the original counts. Historians generally credit Tjio.\n\nThe Moral of this Story\n\nEven the simplest things in science can be really hard. Errors can persist for a long time until improved methods make it possible to move forward.\n\nMore to read\n\nI relied heavily on this excellent article:\n\nhttp://image.sciencenet.cn/olddata/kexue.com.cn/upload/blog/file/2008/8/2008828172821663554.pdf\n\nHere are some other very good accounts:\n\nDr. Joe Hin Tjio: The science of counting - Helix\n\nThe case of the missing human chromosomes\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Human genome - Wikipedia\n[2] Inheritance of characters\n[3] Inheritance of characters\n[4] http://image.sciencenet.cn/olddata/kexue.com.cn/upload/blog/file/2008/8/2008828172821663554.pdf\n[5] http://image.sciencenet.cn/olddata/kexue.com.cn/upload/blog/file/2008/8/2008828172821663554.pdf', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.4914
Corina Okechukwu,Updated 4y,What scientific photos are hard to believe but are indeed real?,"Thank

This eerie like tree was snapped on camera by a local policeman in Kilnsey, North Yorkshire, UK. He went to have a closer look as it seemed the tree was moving. And indeed it was. Thousands of caterpillars had invaded the tree and they covered it in an enormous silk cocoon to protect it from predators.

These trees in Pakistan are the home of thousands of spiders. When the country was hit by one of the worst floods in history ( more than a fifth of the country submerged) the tiny creatures took over the trees to save their lives. The phenomenon is not only beautiful but very useful. The areas where the spiders have scalded the trees have seen hardly any malaria spreading mosquitos.

It may look like morning frost, but it’s only spider season in Australia. People call it Spider Frost.

Daniel Kaplan,1y,Who are the most unfortunate scientists of all time?,"So… there are a lot of answers here. I’m shocked that only one gave the answer I’d have thought was obvious, and it didn’t do the situation justice. I’ve written about her before.

Karen Wetterhahn

She died of exposure to dimethylmercury. If any substance can be described as evil, it is dimethylmercury. When a few drops fell on the back of her latex glove, the standard protocol didn’t tell her to do anything drastic. The gloves were supposed to protect her.

Months later, she began to suffer from its effects. Slurred speech, difficulty walking, and weight loss became more pronounced until doctors diagnosed her with heavy metal poisoning. After a few more months, she was in a persistent vegetative state during which she would have incidents in which her body was racked with spasms. At one point, tears came down her face, but doctors declared her too far gone to feel any pain.

The thing is… I do not doubt that she felt pain until she went into a persistent vegetative state and that I would have felt absolute terror imagining what was coming. Dimethylmercury slowly destroyed her brain, and all she could do was witness it from the inside.

Some of these scientists listed as answers under this question maybe missed an award or weren’t recognized for their genius. In the face of something like what Dr. Wetterhahn faced… they were damned lucky. A few died, including Marie Curie, but at least those were from known ailments that could be treated with opiates and the like. At least knowing that other people had gone through it must have been some comfort. Here, a valuable life was cut short through an accident that seemed like nothing at the time. Fate just snuck up on her and cheated her in the most horrific way possible.

I have to say this… I feel truly awful every time I run across her story (which happens surprisingly often due to some weird algorithms). I honestly feel like grieving for her husband who must have felt so damned helpless through the whole tragedy.

That is misfortune.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dv70j84fx5ch1p96', 'title': 'Who are the most unfortunate scientists of all time?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'So… there are a lot of answers here.

Jack Brownlee,4y,Which is the greatest invention to date?,"I don’t know if it necessarily counts as an ‘invention’, but I cast my vote for adult jokes in kids’ movies.

It isn’t super often that we encounter movies that are appealing to both adults and children. There’s just a lack of plot depth and intensity in children’s movies, deterring most adults, and obviously there can’t be a ton of gunfights and nudity in a kiddie movie. It’s difficult to make movies that appeal to a wide audience.

Adult jokes are the perfect solution to that issue.

I remember watching the Lego Batman movie with my parents and younger siblings a few years back. I was probably just finishing up with middle school, and I had definitely been exposed to some adult humor.

At one point in the movie, a character is talking about how

“My name’s Richard Grayson, but all my friends call me Dick.”

Batman so expertly responds:

“Well, children can be cruel.”

An expertly timed adult joke. Subtle enough that a kid wouldn’t know any better, but apparent enough that the adults in the theater chuckled.

For the rest of the movie, there are little sprinkles of mature comedy throughout:

It took me a few seconds to understand this one, but if you say it phonetically it sounds like a… naughty British epithet.

The jokes just don’t end. The plot is engaging to a younger audience, the humor keeps adults watching; it’s genius.

It’s the perfect marketing tactic.

Ahanjit Bhattacharya,7y,Who are the most unfortunate scientists of all time?,"Douglas Prasher: a gifted scientist who could unarguably have won the Nobel Prize, ended up as a shuttle bus driver.

He was the first scientist to successfully clone and sequence the genes for Green fluorescent protein
 (GFP) and shared his pioneering work with Martin Chalfie
 and Roger Y. Tsien
. He was also the first to suggest that GFP could be used as a tracer for biochemical systems. Unfortunately, within a brief period, Prasher had to quit academia since he was denied further research funding, but the latter two went on to receive Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2008). Not to mention, his works led to the foundation of multi-million dollar industries.

To emphasize the importance of his work, it can be said that, use of GFP as a biomarker or sensor has revolutionized the fields of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Chemical Biology, Medicine and several others. In layman's terms, GFP is used as a laser pointer to locate myriads of biomolecules. There is probably not a single lab working in Molecular Biology which does not use GFP.

However, Prasher was probably not destined to share this glory. His fate betrayed him time and again.

Following his rejection of funding application by National Institutes of Health, he was denied promotion from assistant professor to associate professor. Subsequently, he had to quit academia.
He transferred to Plant Germplasm Quarantine & Biotechnology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, but he had to leave from there since the working conditions deteriorated.
He went on to work for AZ Technology - a subcontractor of NASA in Huntsville, Alabama. But after one and a half years, NASA canceled the project because of a decision to cut funding for biological research.
Dejected and heartbroken, Prasher spent an year unemployed. Then he had no choice but to take up the job of a shuttle bus driver in Penney Toyota for $8.50 an hour. He even put a sticker at the back of his car saying ""Scientist needs work"" and wrote his phone number.

Prasher was invited at the Nobel Prize ceremony by Roger Tsien, and both Chalfie and Tsien acknowledged him for his contribution. Prasher also expressed his pleasure by saying,

I'm really happy for them. I was really surprised that particular topic carried that much weight.

In 2012, Douglas Prasher joined the lab of Roger Tsien at University of California San Diego at his invitation.

Nate Poulin,6y,"What are the most risky scientific experiments ever conducted, whether in terms of life, Earth’s properties, or economic situations?","One of the more risky experiments was done by Werner Forssmann at age 25, who performed the first cardiac catheterization. What is amazing is that he performed the procedure on himself.

At the time (1929), Werner had finished his medical education and was training as a cardiology intern. He was trying to find a way to better inject drugs into the right atrium. He had devised the cardiac catheterization experiment, but the chief did not approve of him carrying it out. He went ahead regardless but had to convince the nurse to provide him with the necessary surgical equipment. She agreed, but only if he performed the procedure on her.

He distracted the nurse by prepping her for the procedure, and then quickly made an incision in his antecubital vein followed by insertion of a urethral catheter. The nurse did not appreciate this maneuver, but she proceeded to help him make his way to the X-ray room. Once there, he advanced the catheter to his right atrium under x-ray fluoroscopic guidance. This was very risky, considering the unknown risk of perforating the wall of a vein or artery.

The chief (Schneider) was furious with Werner for disobeying him but he could not deny the importance of the procedure. He let him try it out on another patient. Unfortunately, not everyone appreciated his contribution. Shortly after taking an academic position at a hospital, he gained widespread coverage after the paper on the procedure was published. His supervisor discharged him from the position, since he thought it was a far too risky way of going about doing surgery. He may have just been intimidated by the man’s rise. Werner went back to Schneider, and he eventually was given hospital access and resources to continue with more experiments.

He was eventually awarded the Nobel prize for the original catheterization experiment, which has laid the groundwork for interventional procedures.

The nurse did not appreciate this maneuver, but she proceeded to help him make his way to the X-ray room. Once there, he advanced the catheter to his right atrium under x-ray fluoroscopic guidance. This was very risky, considering the unknown risk of perforating the wall of a vein or artery.\n\nThe chief (Schneider) was furious with Werner for disobeying him but he could not deny the importance of the procedure. He let him try it out on another patient. Unfortunately, not everyone appreciated his contribution. Shortly after taking an academic position at a hospital, he gained widespread coverage after the paper on the procedure was published. His supervisor discharged him from the position, since he thought it was a far too risky way of going about doing surgery. He may have just been intimidated by the man’s rise. Werner went back to Schneider, and he eventually was given hospital access and resources to continue with more experiments.\n\nHe was eventually awarded the Nobel prize for the original catheterization experiment, which has laid the groundwork for interventional procedures.\n\nThe Development of Interventional Cardiology\n\nWerner Forssmann - Biographical\n\nWerner Forssmann - Wikipedia\n\nhttp://www.mterasaki.us/etc/forssman.pdf', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9987
Rohan Nampalliwar,5y,What are the most fascinating science facts?,"That's moon and Jupiter as seen from my terrace. The photons from sun had to travel 775 million kms to jupiter and then 558 million kms back to earth before my phone's camera could capture it.

This means that with the speed of light being equal to 299792 km/s, it takes those photons 74 minutes after they leave the sun to reach the earth. Point to be remembered is that light can circle the entire globe about 7 times in just one second. Despite such large distance involved we are able to see jupiter with our naked eyes and that's because of the enormous size of jupiter.

Not impressed yet, consider this: the same photons which took 74 minutes to travel are actually 100,000 years old. It takes such a large amount of time for it just to escape from the sun after being formed inside it's core.

Now prepare to be mind blown: For the same photon, all this time is just an instant. According to the special theory of relativity, light particles do not experience time passing. This is due to a phenomenon called time dilation. When things approach speed of light, the time slows down. The passage of time is non existant at light speed.

.

A green beam is divided into two at beam splitter BS1. Beam 1 goes through non-linear crystal NL1 which creates pairs of entangled yellow and red photons. The red photons get reflected at mirror D1 and the yellow photons go through. The red photons pass through the cat cardboard cutout O.

The second green beam from BS1 goes through mirror D2 and creates entangled yellow and red photons at NL2.

After NL2, the two red beams combine. If one’s to put a detector for the red beam after D3, one won’t be able to tell where a photon comes through. This is extremely important, because it allows the two yellow beams to meet at BS2 indistinguishable and create an interference pattern before hitting the photon detectors. A photon at BS2 comes from both NL1 and NL2. If we can tell where the yellow photons come from at BS2, the interference won’t happen. This is the spooky aspect of quantum mechanics.

So while none of the yellow photons ever interacted with the object, they are entangled with the red photons that did and hence carry the information to reconstruct the shape of the cat.

It is responsible for transmitting signals in between the nerve cells (neurons) of the brain.

In a simple words, it is the chemical that makes us happy.

So whenever a person consume drugs like heroine and cocaine, they activate these nerve cells and makes them to release dopamine unnaturally,so the person feels or enjoys temporary happiness.

As this is an unnatural process, from next time, hypothalamus starts producing dopamine only in less quantities. Now, the only way to make oneself happy is consuming those drugs. Hence addicted.

Jack Fraser-Govil,6y,Should Kant also be considered one of the greatest scientists on the same level as Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein for the Nebular Hypothesis?,"No — not even close.

It's an interesting observation, and yes, it is widely accepted to be true nowadays.

But it's not groundbreaking science. It's nothing revolutionary.

As a comparison — Pierre-Simon Laplace independently came up with the same result a few decades later.

But.

Laplace also worked on:

Stability of the solar system
Described as “the most important advance in physical astronomy since Newton""
Predicted black holes
Ish
Laplace transforms
Work on the speed of sound and properties of fluids such as surface tension

As well as what can only be described as a shitload of mathematics. I really mean that — a shitload.

And yet — Laplace never even gets a look in between Einstein and Newton in these lists!

And Laplace did what Kant did and more! And yet you don't hear people asserting that Laplace should be the greatest scientist ever!

If you think that 1 puny discovery puts you on the same rank as Newton and Einstein you vastly underestimate quite how pivotal and groundbreaking their work was.

Kant has very little science to his name.

I gave myself a challenge. In 20 seconds, I attempted to write down as many people who are more important to science than Kant and his nebular hypothesis (excluding Einstein and Newton).

The list is as follows:

Laplace (obviously!)
Maxwell
Faraday
Dirac
Pauli
Bohr
Planck
Bernoulli
Heisenberg
Curie
Darwin
Haber
Feynman
Hawking
Schrödinger
Galileo
Fermi
Rutherford
Boltzmann

Phew. 19 people, in 20 seconds! A little Physicist heavy, but can you blame me?

And every single one of those people contributed orders of magnitude more than Kant.

Huyen Nguyen,Updated 3y,What are some of the most useful inventions that were created by mistake?,"In 1951, a WWII veteran named Wilson Greatbatch was working at an animal behaviour farm affiliated with the psychology department at Cornell. His work involved attaching experimental instruments to the animals, measuring their brain waves, heartbeats and blood pressure. One day, he had lunch with two visiting surgeons and listened to them talk about the dangers of irregular heartbeats. He imagined the heart as a radio that was failing to transmit or receive a signal. The random analogy didn’t come back to him until several years later.

A year later, Greatbatch started teaching electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo and worked part time at the Chronic Disease Institute. A physician at the institute recruited Greatbatch to help him design an oscillator that would record heartbeats using the new silicon transistors.

One day, while working on the device, Greatbatch happened to grab the wrong resistor. When he plugged it into the oscillator it began to pulse in a familiar rhythm.

Tara Collins,4y,Who is the most badass scientist in modern history?,"I'm going to have to go with Justin O. Schmidt, inventor of the Schmidt Pain Index.

Schmidt is an entomologist who originally studied honeybees but has since expanded to ants, wasps, and arachnids.

What do all of these creepy-crawlies have in common? Venom! Specifically, venom that hurts. He had a hypothesis that painful venom evolved first in hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees) and then only when they became social did they need stings that actually did damage to their victim. A solitary insect just needs to inflict enough pain to escape, while a social insect needs to keep a predator away from the colony. If the predator learns that the pain is a lie, not indicating real damage, they might push through it to get to the honey or larvae the insect is protecting.

It's pretty simple to quantify toxicity in a petri dish, but to test his hypothesis Schmidt needed to rank pain. This is less simple; tissue grown in a lab can't feel pain. So he did what any good scientist would do: be the test subject.

He exposed himself to the stings of dozens of insects, recording a rating of 1 to 4, along with comments more appropriate to wine tasting than agony: A sweat bee's sting (1.0) is “light, ephemeral, almost fruity. As if a tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm”, while a yellow jacket's (2.0) is “hot and smoky, almost irreverent. Imagine W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue”. One of the sadist champions, the warrior wasp, has a score of 4.0 and is described as “torture. You are chained in the flow of an active volcano. Why did I start this list?”

There are others I could mention who experimented on themselves, like Barry Marshall, who drank a concoction of Helicobacter pylori to prove that it, and not stress, was the cause of chronic stomach ulcers.

Pratim Sarkar,6y,What are some cool inventions?,"PENCIL WITH POTENTIAL

What if instead of throwing your pencil stubs away you could plant them and have them grow into something delicious, beautiful, and fun? What if pencils could grow?

CSAIL graduate Mario Bollini has transitioned from programming robots that bake cookies
 to developing pencils that when planted will sprout fresh herbs and vegetables.

Each pencil has a different seed located inside. When the pencil is too short to use, users can plant it, and when watered the pencil will sprout anything from cherry tomatoes to radishes and marigolds.

Sprout is a pencil with a seed inside. When it's too short to use, it can be planted at home, at the office, or in the classroom.

We really like writing with wooden pencils. They have a tactile feel that even the best mechanical pencils can't match. When Sprout is too short to use, it can be planted to grow into a wonderful flower, herb, or vegetable.The seed capsule is water activated, the first few times you water Sprout dissolves the protective capsule and starts the seed's germination.

Isn’t it amazing?

Niklas Nolte,Updated 5y,What are some unintended science inventions in history?,"Popsicles were unintenionally invented by an 11 year old.

In 1905, Frank Epperson (as I said, he was 11 year olds at that time) left his cup, which was filled by water, powered soda and a stick in the cold.

Surprise, it froze!

Today, the toal ice cream market of more than 59 billion USD[1] and I guess his random invention contributed to that.

Aravind Balaji,8y,What are the most fascinating science facts?,"Superfluid helium can leak through glass and climb out of its container




Superfluidity is a state of matter
 in which the matter
 behaves like a fluid with zero viscosity
; where it appears to exhibit the ability to self-propel and travel in a way that defies the forces of gravity
 and surface tension


In simple words, Superfluids have zero viscosity [eg. ketchup is more viscous than water] and zero friction. So low, that they can climb out of a wall of container and can leak through glass.

Liquid Helium behaves as a superfluid at -270.92 deg Celsius

Here's an image of Superfluid Helium-4 flowing out of a glass container


Still sounds unrealistic? Here's a video

Logan Gutierrez,3y,What scientific photos are hard to believe but are indeed real?,"i am going to don't go microscopic because lots of the responses mention equivalent.

so, here is my listing:

Star-shaped cataract

A punch when you look at the face left a person in India starry-eyed — actually. Doctors reported in an instance report, that he formed a rosette cataract after getting smacked in face.

Sun's north pole

A composite image of sunlight's north pole. The images, taken because of the European area department (ESA) and uploaded online in December 2018, provide a glimpse of sunlight with never ever already been seen directly.

Earth turtle

This amazing picture was taken by Washington university's Turtle Task power. The team spotted the turtle while investigating turtle migration. She had just emerged from a muddy opening inside soil by a dried-up pond.

Sun explodes

NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory used computer models to fully capture snapshots of the unseen solar technology, with spectacular outcomes. The computer-enhanced ultraviolet photo reveals a model associated with sunshine's magnetic-field lines swirling out from the stars surface.

Feather boa

Divers near northern brand new Zealand spotted this drifting “ feather boa\"" undulating through the water. The gorgeous ribbon of gold is called a pyrosome and it isn't an individual animal, but instead, a colony of tiny pets known as tunicates.

Quintuple rainbow

While shooting a sunset in nj-new jersey, photographer John Entwistle had been greeted by a sky coated with five rainbows Supernumerary rainbows such as this one contains a primary rainbow (the brightest of bunch) and about two other rainbows that are generally speaking less vivid.

Hurricane Florence eye

This beautifully nonetheless and peaceful violent storm attention belies the havoc Hurricane Florence wreaked over the southeastern U.S. in September 2018.

Pufferfish art

whenever it's time to get a hold of a mate, male Japanese pufferfish when you look at the Torquigener genus invest seven days, twenty four hours daily, sculpting a complex but in the end momentary masterpiece of design to the sandy seafloor. Plus they do it al by wiggling their fins to produce complex ridges and valleys.

Thor's well

Called Thor’s Really at this spot off the coastline of Oregon, there’s a 20-foot-deep (6 yards) chasm in which, right before and after high tide, frothy waves shoot out of the hole and then strain back off. Naturally, this really is significantly of an illusion, albeit an entirely gorgeous one.

Algae bloom swirls

NASA's Operational Land Imager from the Landsat-8 satellite spied a really intense algal bloom inside Baltic water in July. As for exactly what developed the sea art, experts suspect a mix of blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) and a chlorophyll-rich phytoplankton known as diatoms.

Steve aurora

This mystical and majestic ribbon of purple light slashing throughout the Canadian sky has a fittingly mystical title: STEVE. At the time, they thought Steve ended up being just another the main aurora borealis, or northern lights. But experts have since discovered that Steve is one thing very different — then one \""entirely not known\"" to science.

New brain cells

Your mind keeps making new neurological cells , even as you receive older. And they're breathtaking.

Whale's rainbow sneeze

Fortunately, wildlife professional photographer Domenic Biagini was in the proper location in the right time and energy to capture this image .Being an oxygen-breathing mammal, a whale exhales a combination of hot air, some water vapor and many whale snot. In this whale's instance, the water vapor caught the sunlight simply perfectly — in the same manner raindrops do if they refract light into its constituent colors, creating rainbows.

Exploding ants

When gross is … stunningly cool-looking. Treetop-dwelling ants from Southeast Asia defeat their enemies by blowing themselves up, rupturing their particular mobile wall space and spattering harmful human anatomy fluids around prey.

Yellowstone magma pit

Using a pc model, the group unearthed that 7 million several years of underground unrest led around the development of the twin magma chambers that animate the Yellowstone caldera in modern times. Shown right here, the grand prismatic springtime which will be among the numerous signs and symptoms of this concealed supervolcano.

Penguin supercolony

Lots and plenty of penguins were found nesting on Antarctica's risk islands.They estimate, based partly on poop spots (yes, poop) seen in aerial snapshots, that about 1.5 million adelie penguins are living and reproduction on this area.

Lava dome fountain

Ordinarily, volcanoes erupt lava in effective jets appear like fountains gone crazy. In this picture — grabbed Oct. 11, 1969, in Hawaii — the lava spurted out symmetrically, creating an aesthetically pleasing lava-dome water fountain.

Super blue blood moon

A Super blue bloodstream moon lunar eclipse graced the heavens and dazzled Earth-bound humans during the early morning hours of Jan. 31 2018, an event that hadn't happened in 152 years.

Spiral bee hive

The Australian stingless bees (Tetragonula carbonaria) in this image, captured by entomologist Tim Heard and posted to Reddit in January 2018, worked together to build this spiral nest that looks delectable to eat (or maybe not). The spiral-shaped towers are called brood combs, and they link together hundreds of egg chambers, forming a staircase of developing young.

Paul Barends,Updated 2y,What is the oldest recorded event in history?,"That can be found in the Cave of Maltravieso in Spain.

The hand outlines on the wall are estimated to be made 65,000 years ago. [1]

Correct photo thanks to the comment of Tudor Florescu.

This predates the supposed arrival of modern humans in Europe, so it’s possible that the outlines were left by Neanderthals.

They were present, that was the event. It’s also the first recorded case of Banksy style graffiti using templates.

The oldest cave painting made by modern humans dates back to around 40,000 years ago, like this hunting scene found in the Cave of El Castillo.

It was probably tied to a long forgotten story. Like, how uncle Harry once managed to shoot two bucks and a hind all by himself.

Thanks for asking, Diana.

Joaquin Bernal,4y,Who is the least significant person in history that we've all probably heard of?,"Eva Braun’s only claim to fame is that she was Hitler’s lover, only having been married a couple days before they committed suicide.

Aside from that, Eva Braun has consistently provided historians with very little of substance, making them very disappointed in the process of trying to dig up anything interesting. By all accounts, Eva Braun was not much more than a normal woman living in Nazi Germany. When she and Hitler became lovers in 1932, virtually no one knew. Only very close friends knew or very high-ranking officials. Hitler wanted people to see him as a strong unmarried man which he believed would help him keep a stable political reputation. As such, she never appeared with him in person at official events and the country never knew about her existence until after the war ended.

She also wasn't a very political person at all. For example, she never joined the Nazi Party or held any specific views. Records say that she was into things most young women of her age liked back then (she was 17 when she and Hitler first met in 1929): clothes, sports, and movies. Hitler also kept her out of any meetings he had with Nazi officials or business leaders and she even had her own room in Hitler’s Berlin house. The most ‘political’ thing she ever did in regards to the war was complain to Hitler about the possibility of banning women’s cosmetic items as part of the war’s rationing during the transition into a total war economy. A complaint that Hitler abided by halting production instead of banning them.

Eva Braun’s sex life with Hitler was also pretty normal too despite all the conspiracies. One charming thing that Eva Braun said about this is when she saw a picture of Neville Chamberlain on Hitler’s sofa and giggled: “Oh if he only he knew what that sofa has seen!”

So yeah, Eva Braun was pretty much just a normal woman who happened to be Hitler’s lover. Nothing super interesting about her which has disappointed historians.

Matt Riggsby,2y,"When Charles Darwin set sail on the HMS Beagle, what did he and most of his contemporary scientists think about the origin of species?","The scientific community had already long since moved away from the Mosaic chronology and into ideas of deeper time (though not as deep as we’ve later realized), and the idea of evolution had been current for more than a generation.

Jeffrey Wang,Updated 2y,What are some of the most ingenious calculations in history?,"These days, Edmund Halley is best known for the comet that is named after him—one which famously returns and grazes our night sky once every 75 years or so.

What many overlook, however, is that he was also an incredibly clever scientist—one with a knack for solving seemingly uncrackable problems. Among fellow scientists, he developed a reputation: give him a problem, and he would arrive at a solution (or at least try damn hard to reach one).

It was with this attitude in mind that the Royal Society approached him with a task in the early 1700’s. The English government had asked them for an estimate of the total landmass of England and Wales—and the Society was struggling.

Given the exceedingly unusual shape of the two countries, any physical survey would be exceedingly expensive. Similar issues impeded a traditional mathematical calculation of the landmass’s area.

Halley went about it in a very different way.

First, he found the most accurate map of the two countries available. Then, with the paper copy in hand, he cut out the shape of the two countries extremely carefully.

He then weighed the map piece with careful precision and noted the figure.

Finally, Halley cut out the largest complete circle he could from the center of the map piece and weighed that circle.

The radius of the final circle measured 69.33 miles. After comparing the measured weights, he figured that the map piece weighed roughly four times the circle. Hence, the combined area of England and Wales… was just four times the area of the circle.

His final measurement was only 1% off today’s figures.

It’s safe to say the fellows at the Royal Society were probably chuckling at themselves for that one.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/acher4nt2mv5xdzb', 'title': 'What are some of the most ingenious calculations in history?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'These days, Edmund Halley is best known for the comet that is named after him—one which famously returns and grazes our night sky once every 75 years or so.\n\nWhat many overlook, however, is that he was also an incredibly clever scientist—one with a knack for solving seemingly uncrackable problems.

Mats Andersson,Aug 28,Why was Galileo Galilei almost crucified when he said the earth was round?,"He wasn’t “almost crucified”, but given house arrest, and that the Earth is round had been the official doctrine of the Catholic Church for well over a millennium at that point (and before that, they simply had no opinion; anyone educated simply knew the Earth was round since at least 300 BCE so there was never any argument). Galilei was sentenced for saying the Earth went around the Sun, and for being a total dick about it.

You might be thinking of Giordano Bruno, who was burnt at the stake at roughly the same time, but it was not for any cosmological claims: it was for persistently preaching that people should abandon Christianity and start worshipping the old Egyptian gods.
