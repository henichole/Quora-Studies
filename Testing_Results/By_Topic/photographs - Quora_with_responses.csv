Deepanshu Sharma,Updated 2y,What shocked you today?,"My teacher's Whatsapp status

Why it shoked me?

She's the most strict teacher in School, Scolds every living being and rarely smiles.

Shocking isn't it?

Edit:

After thoughtful thinking about this, Our class decided to do something about it!

Behold my Slightly tilted laughing emoji ü§£

Edit:

So today was the day I went to school after this incident. And guess what. She liked it!

Liked it so much that She Made us stand for whole day‚Ä¶

Enough? Oh no wait there's more!

Ahh yes! Suspension for 1 Week! That's what you get for teasing teachers. XD

Also don't worry my parents are quite frank with this!

Edit:

Damn, I had no idea this would blow up. You guys are crazy. I could get into some real trouble because of this. I'm changing my profile picture. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Edit:

So many of you are asking why is kartik apologizing when his name is not on list. It's because his name is Hritik in school but his name is kartik at home.

Swatanshu Shekhar Singh,3y,What is the best example of a PM and opposition leader duo who worked for the betterment of the country? Share a picture also.,"India's economy was bankrupt in 1991.

The then Prime Minister Narsimha Rao called Finance Minister Manmohan Singh and asked how much money is there in the treasury, Manmohan Ji's answer was that only 9 days we can run the country, that much money is left.

On this, Narasimha Rao ji asked how to deal with this situation? Manmohan Singh said that the value of the country's rupee should have to fall by 20%. Narasimha ji said, okay call the meeting of the cabinet and get approval. Manmohan ji got up and started going towards his room.

After going a few steps away, he turned back and said to Narasimha Rao that if the cabinet convenes the meeting, we will not be able to take these tough decisions. All ministers will address the vote bank.

Narasimha ji told Manmohanji that right now you go to your room. After 20 minutes, the secretary went to Manmohanji in his room by giving him a letter and in that letter.Narasimha Rao Ji had written, Done!!

Later, when he asked that what had happened in 20 minutes that you had surprised everyone, including the Cabinet meeting, then Narasimhav ji had said that I had spoken to Atal ji and done it.

Means you look at Atal ji was more than his cabinet, PM knew that Atal ji will speak in the interest of the country. It happens that after the announcement of the Nationalist Opposition and that drastic decision, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not organize a protest movement, but supported the immediate Congress government to bring the country's economy back on track.

Gone those Politicians, gone those day‚Ä¶

Bk Aravind,Updated 3y,What shocked you today?,"Film industry is weird.

I saw two interviews of Bollywood celebs namely Alia Bhatt with Rajeev and Nawaz bhai in Aapki Adalat. It shocked me how life could be just so easy for someone and be difficult for other.

The conversation is as follows:

Interviewer: Have you had to fight for any role? or convince a director for a role?

Alia: No, but for Kalank movie, I called Karan(Producer) and Abhishek(Director) and told them that I would be really upset if you don‚Äôt cast me in the film.

And that is how she fought for her role and ended up getting it. Very interesting, it will be a spectacle if I go to an HR of one of top 5 MNCs and tell them I would be upset if you don‚Äôt recruit me.

Anyway, next, I happened to watch another interview, it was Aap ki adalat, where Nawaz bhai was being interviewed. It goes as follows.

Interviewer: for 12 years the industry did not give you a good role. You had too many rejections, how did a reject piece become accepted in this industry? (and then he goes on to show videos of his small roles like terrorist in sarfarosh, and waiter in shool )

Nawazuddin: I received rejections from everywhere, it was nothing new, I was happy with what I was doing. It is also not about how big or small role was, I did all my roles with honesty and it brought me where I am today but it took 12 years and it was all worth it.

This is what surprised me, how life can be so different for each and every person. I don‚Äôt want to offend any Alia Bhatt fans here, I do know that she did some good films. However, I truly feel that the industry sometimes forces some actors on the audience. This involves, giving too many opportunities to some actors even though people are rejecting the movies, this leads to finally people getting used to that actor, but actors like Nawazuddin take 12 years to get the right opportunity. TRULY SHOCKING.

Interviews can be easily found on youtube.

Amit Kr Yadav,Updated 3y,What shocked you today?,"I bought a boAt headphone last year in Feb 2020 which cost me 1500 and suddenly last week it broke like this üëá

I felt that (ho gya satyanash) and was thinking what should I do now and then searched on youtube 'how to fix this'. I realised that its warranty period wasn't over and there was still 2 months remaining, so I checked the boat official website and claimed for warranty. Sometime later they responded on my gmail that they would pick the headphone for repair. I packed it the box and handed it over to the delivery man who came to receive it.

It happened last week on Jan 22 when their courier partner received and sent it to the service centre.

Today as on Jan 29 they informed me by mail that the courier will be delivered today and I was happy that finally, I received my repaired headphone but when I opened the well-packed box I was surprised and shocked that they sent me a brand new updated BoAt headphone in seal packed box.üëá

Prerna Parashar,Updated 3y,What innocent-seeming picture is actually heartbreaking?,"He is Asish Dixit, a researcher from IIT Roorke. Smiling, with his mom and his sister, a bright student, swimming and exercising are his everyday routine. Father is at a good position in a government job, he too seems to have a great future and great opportunities waiting ahead.

Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with him right?

It was during the lockdown when all colleges and schools shut down. Asish was with his family in his home town when he encountered something wrong with him. He would vomit everytime he ate and was becoming weak day by day. The family got worried and he was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with blood cancer.

He had difficulty in getting government help due to his father being in government service and getting himself a scholarship. But CM relaxed the rules and ordered help. He contacted the family on the news of the illness from social media and helped 10 lakh. Also ordered PGI for better treatment and all possible help.

There are sometimes when life takes unexpected turns, but he is a fighter and he will get well soon. Cancer can touch you, but not your soul, neither your thoughts, nor your heart.

Get well soon Sir :)

Wishing all the readers good health and happiness ‚ù§

Moksha Sharma (‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ),1y,Can MBBS students share pictures of their hostel rooms?,"I am sharing the pictures of my alloted room of AIIMS BILASPUR.

We are given double sharing accomodation. The room is provided with---

A wooden cupboard

2. A small single bed

You have to bring your own matress, pillow, bedsheet and blanket. The bed has lots of space inside it to put or store things that are not used or needed much daily.

3. A tabble and a chair

This was my side of room.

The other side is owned by my roommate.

We also have a balcony and a window to see the amazing and mesmerizing views of nature‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Views from balcony----

The room is not much decorated. I am going to add some Harry Potter and Marvel posters on the wall in future as I am a huge fan.

This news is more than just shocking!!

I'm refusing to believe itü•∫

She played the Role of young Babita Phogat in an all time Blockbuster movie Dangal

According to sources

she was admitted to the hospital due to a reaction caused by medication. She had been receiving treatment for Fluid Accumulation in her body for a considerable Period

Her Final Rites are scheduled to take place in Sector 15 Faridabad

She was such a beautiful girl, crush of many ones like me and most importantly a wonderful soul.

Her Acting in Dangal was something that you cant expect from a 12 year old girl.

Her expressionsü§å

Her funny dialogues and timing of Dialogue Delivery ü§å

This all added a great fun side to the movie making it one of the highest grossing movies of all time.

I watched Dangal 3 times in Theatre, and more than 10 times on TV, still it gives a feeling that will make you to watch it for another time

but as people say

Don‚Äôt Cry because its over, Smile because it happened

Eddie,Mon,Can you share a memorable photo with your father that you can never forget?,"This is my most memorable one of me with my dad. I‚Äôm not sure what happened to my pants, I probably hadn‚Äôt gotten fully dressed yet. Dad and me goofing around with me in my Fruit of the Loom briefs. (I only wore tightie-whities).

Mom took this one in the den of our house when I would ‚Äúbother‚Äù dad when he was working. He loved it as much as I did even when I pushed it too far and didn‚Äôt stop when he told me to and I would get a butt warming. (Sometimes it was more than a warming but I didn‚Äôt mind because I kinda forced him to do it by not stopping when he told me.)

Cruz was probably 19 then - wanted to buy guns, but this particular store refused because they had a policy to not sell weapons to anyone under age 21.

However, he was able to buy guns legally from another store in Feb 2017.

Shubham KP,23-Nov,Quora is degrading day by day! What's your view on this?,"There's a famous YouTuber named Anubhav Jain.

He has 1.12M subscribers. And he's rocking the YouTube world these days with his motivational content.

But before that, he was Anubhav Bhaiya of Quora. I've seen him grow on this platform. I've been a silent spectator for a very long time.

He has 1,20,722 followers with 201M content views the moment I'm drafting this answer.

BUT.

His answers are not getting much reach these days. They don't show up on my feed. In the month of November, just one of his answers crossed 100 upvotes.

Can you believe it?

Just one answer. The person who has written 4.9k answers till now is being treated like this due to Quora's algorithm.

Result?

He doesn't write much here now. I still remember the day when he wrote 20+ answers in a day. He was that much into writing here.

But now, just like him, many good Quorans are giving up. The issue is reach.

Quora is quite ungrateful for writers now.

The good days are long gone. And I don't think it would be back. Ever.

We all are gifted,

Neal Morados,Updated 1y,What is that one picture that describes the unforgettable moment in your life?,"To you, it‚Äôs a messy hospital bed in a hospital room. To me, it‚Äôs the moment that forever changed my life. On August 12th, 2020, 5:30 P.M, at 37 years old, I had a heart attack. The doctors and nurses did not tell me the severity of the heart attack until two days later.

I was helping my dad do yard work when I felt a pain in my chest. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I thought that I was out of shape because I haven‚Äôt been to the gym. I decided to lay down, but the chest pain didn‚Äôt go away. It wasn‚Äôt until I had the sensation of having to use the bathroom and vomit at the same time that I knew something was seriously wrong. I called my mom and her exact words were, ‚ÄúYou need to call 911.‚Äù

The EMT‚Äôs came and did some tests on me, and the EMT said to me, ‚ÄúYou have all the signs of a heart attack.‚Äù They rushed me to the hospital and luckily, it was down the road from my house. I knew something was up when the doctors and nurses were working on me quickly. The doctor put overlapping stents in my heart to open up the artery. I felt better instantly.

The next three days, I was kept in the hospital for observation. My vital signs were all out of wack, because of the stress from the heart attack. The cardiologist told me how serious my heart attack was. He told me it was the left anterior descending artery, known as the LAD and the artery was 100% blocked. The heart attack I experienced is known as ‚ÄúThe Widowmaker.‚Äù What I‚Äôve read from the American Heart Association is that it kills 3 out of 4 people who experience it. I was the 1 out of 4 that survived.

I spent the next three days in the hospital, going through a wide range of emotions. I was crying for a solid 30 minutes straight, realizing how close I was to having it all be over. I did spend a lot of my time, binge watching movies on the hospital network. However, when I don‚Äôt understand something, the first thing I do is research. I had my cell phone and Google. Researching all I could on what my life is going to be like from now and what I need to do moving forward, that was and still is my focus.

I took a picture of the hospital room as a stark reminder on why I will never take life for granted. I always heard that you have plenty of time, but after that moment, I realized how short life truly is.

Updated 2/27/2022: For anyone who reads and comments on this still, thank you, thank you, thank you. I‚Äôm humbled by the response this answer is still getting. I‚Äôve seen how ugly and nasty the world of the Internet can be. Seeing how much compassion and empathy people have shown me and others who have responded is incredible. I‚Äôll share this. Before writing this answer, I told my mom that I felt bad using this situation to answer the question. My mom said to me, ‚ÄúIf you save one person‚Äôs life, then you‚Äôve done your job.‚Äù I still can‚Äôt believe how this answer has resonated with so many people. Thank you to all of you.

Updated 11/29/2021: I‚Äôm still amazed that people have read this answer and are responding the way they are. It‚Äôs been a year since that fateful day, and I‚Äôm doing much better. Seeing the cardiologist every three months and keeping a medicine regiment have been key to my progress. If at all possible, lower your probability of having a heart attack. Make your health a priority. Exercise, proper diet, and regular check ups. It sounds like the most cliche advice, but I don‚Äôt wish this experience upon anyone. I do know that heart attacks can happen at a given moment as you can see from the various responses from this answer, so err on the side of caution. Thank you all so much.

Updated 9/20/2020: I could have never predicted this response. 120k views, 3.2k upvotes, unbelievable. I‚Äôm truly humbled and honored for all the exposure this story has gotten.

To me, it‚Äôs the moment that forever changed my life. On August 12th, 2020, 5:30 P.M, at 37 years old, I had a heart attack. The doctors and nurses did not tell me the severity of the heart attack until two days later.\n\nI was helping my dad do yard work when I felt a pain in my chest. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I thought that I was out of shape because I haven‚Äôt been to the gym. I decided to lay down, but the chest pain didn‚Äôt go away. It wasn‚Äôt until I had the sensation of having to use the bathroom and vomit at the same time that I knew something was seriously wrong. I called my mom and her exact words were, ‚ÄúYou need to call 911.‚Äù\n\nThe EMT‚Äôs came and did some tests on me, and the EMT said to me, ‚ÄúYou have all the signs of a heart attack.‚Äù They rushed me to the hospital and luckily, it was down the road from my house. I knew something was up when the doctors and nurses were working on me quickly. The doctor put overlapping stents in my heart to open up the artery. I felt better instantly.\n\nThe next three days, I was kept in the hospital for observation. My vital signs were all out of wack, because of the stress from the heart attack. The cardiologist told me how serious my heart attack was. He told me it was the left anterior descending artery, known as the LAD and the artery was 100% blocked. The heart attack I experienced is known as ‚ÄúThe Widowmaker.‚Äù What I‚Äôve read from the American Heart Association is that it kills 3 out of 4 people who experience it. I was the 1 out of 4 that survived.\n\nI spent the next three days in the hospital, going through a wide range of emotions. I was crying for a solid 30 minutes straight, realizing how close I was to having it all be over. I did spend a lot of my time, binge watching movies on the hospital network. However, when I don‚Äôt understand something, the first thing I do is research. I had my cell phone and Google. Researching all I could on what my life is going to be like from now and what I need to do moving forward, that was and still is my focus.\n\nI took a picture of the hospital room as a stark reminder on why I will never take life for granted. I always heard that you have plenty of time, but after that moment, I realized how short life truly is.\n\nUpdated 2/27/2022: For anyone who reads and comments on this still, thank you, thank you, thank you. I‚Äôm humbled by the response this answer is still getting. I‚Äôve seen how ugly and nasty the world of the Internet can be.

Sanyam Kasturia,Updated 1y,What shocked you today?,"I was travelling in train.

I noticed a man from an intermediate station who boarded the train and sat on a seat near me.

He was with his small child and was not looking well off.

Actually, I was busy in my own work so I didnt notice him properly.

But when I saw him he was giving his child some thing to eat.

This was not a big deal but what made me notice was that he was keeping his hand under the pack even after refusal of his child just so that the pack may not fall.

He knew the value of money but only for the happiness of his child he bought him the pack of food.

And also he picked up one small piece and put it in his child's mouth. I was thinking that even if he was poor and does not always get to eat things like this, he will eat atleast one piece from it, HUMAN NATURE, but he didn't.

This shows the sacrifices that our parents make for us every single moment in our life. He doesn't want to waste it by eating because money is difficult to earn.

But when a child, like in this incident, grows up and asks their parents what they have done FOR HIM. Its really shocking, because I think its much beyond the scope of describing.

ITS A QUESTION ON THE FRUIT OF KARMA‚Ä¶

Abhimanyu Singh,Updated 3y,What shocked you today?,"This is Anand Kumar.

Yes, the Super 30 guy, who is famous for teaching selflessly to 30 poor students every year out of which more than 26 clear IIT-JEE. He has been recognized by various international bodies.

And this is Mr. Abhyanand, ex DGP of Bihar.

He is the Co-founder of Super 30 and without him Anand could do nothing. He was the one who paid the fee of all those poor children.

Mr. Abhyanand left Super 30 in 2008 because of Anand‚Äôs monopoly.

Basically Anand is an extremely egocentric, arrogant, cunning, and treacherous coaching mafia. He did start with a good motive but he has changed a lot.

He has another coaching named Ramanujan Classes too.

It has nearly 700 students and Anand charges hefty fee over there.

I knew this from past many years, but rarely anyone believes this.

Few years back, a guy named Arbaz, an egg seller's son cleared JEE under handicapped quota and scored rank 73. He appeared for his super 30 entrance test but couldn't qualify it.

He did self study at his home.

So when Anand got to know about it, he approached Arbaz and made him his poster boy.

Things do not end here.

Recently an investigation was done on his properties.

Behind his simple look, a crorepati is hidden having properties worth more than 100 crores.

The only thing I like about him is that he is a great mathematician however his very idea of making education a bussiness has left no difference between him and other coaching mafias who are misleading the masses.

Recently whistleblowing students from Anand's Super 30 have also claimed that last year only 3 students could clear JEE but he posted about 26 students.

Anand has completely forgotten his motive.

Akhila Johnson,Updated 3y,What shocked you today?,"This girl's plight has shocked me today.

Her name was Uthra. She was a 25 year old woman from Kerala who was married and had a child. She got married back in 2018 and everything seemed to be right until she was bitten by a viper snake at her husband's home on 2nd March, 2020. This incident obviously didn't appear in newspapers as that could be ruled out as something very natural. News about her appeared when she died on 7th May, again bitten by a snake; this time by an Indian cobra, that too at her own home while she was recuperating from her former snake bite. I still remember reading the news and feeling strange about it. I was curious if snakes would follow people and bite them to death. But here, snakes were different and it happened at two different places. So I felt it has nothing to do with the snakes. Why do I have to conjure up some non-sensical theories to ascertain my thoughts? I brushed it off as a figment of my imagination. But I was, for sure, haunted by her cause of death. Later, I came to know that her parents grew suspicious of their daughter's unnatural death and demanded a thorough investigation.

Today, this news resurfaced, but with a new twist. Now the culprit behind the curtain was caught. And the master mind behind her unusual death was none other than her husband.

Yes, you read it right.

He had been hatching a plot to murder her and was waiting for the right moment. It was his plan to kill her using a snake and for this, he even made contacts with a snake charmer. On March 2nd, he tried to kill her with a snake that he bought from the other guy. He took her to hospital with the hopes that she would die soon. But his plan was ruined when she miraculously escaped from the death.

But he didn't stop. When she went to her home for treatment and rest, he followed her. He came to the home the day before her death with a pretty big bag. Though their room was air-conditioned and there were no chances of a snake coming in, she was pronounced dead by snakebite the next morning. When asked, the husband told the officers that the window was kept open and he didn't know that she was bitten by the snake. Officers were convinced and nothing was found abnormal.

However, the family soon started having doubts over their daughter's husband.

Why did he come on the previous night of her death with a bag? If the snake sneaked in through the window, why didn't it bite him who slept close to the window? Why is that he didn't know she was bitten by the snake? Why did he wake up at 6 a.m. on that morning when he used to wake up at 8 a.m. every day? Why didn't he rush in when her mom screamed when she found her dead in their bedroom?

So many questions baffled them.

And today they got answers to their questions. Their intuitions were right. Their son-in-law killed her. He came with the snake in the bag and threw the snake on a sleeping wife. Snake bit her while he sadistically watched her dying. He is now arrested along with his accomplice. And everything is evident now.

But why did he do this?

Answer is simple. He set his eyes on her assets and all he wanted was to get rid of her at the earliest so that he could remarry and settle with the money he would get from his former wife.

Their marriage was a perfect arranged one. Or everything seemed to be so until the husband left his clerical job soon after and demanded money and material benefits from his father-in-law. The latter did everything he could do, all for the sake for his daughter's ‚Äòhappy married life'. All this was done apart from the 'dowry'. Her father now claims that even her sister-in-law's education was funded by him. Despite giving all that he had, what did he get back?
