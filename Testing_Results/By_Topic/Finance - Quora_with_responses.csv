Niklas Göke,6y,What are the most important things to know about personal finance?,"Let’s say you start investing when you’re 20. You manage to save $5,000 each year and put them into stocks and index funds, which net you 8% in returns per year on average. At 30, you stop putting in money for good, but keep the investments you’ve accumulated so far.

Now, a different scenario. You don’t want to save and invest $5,000 each year in your twenties, because hey, you’re young. You want to have fun, you can do the responsible stuff later. So, you start investing at 30, the same sum each year. However, because you started later, you don’t stop after 10 years. Instead, you put in $5,000 every year until you retire at 65.

Here’s the insane part:

The kid who invested from 20 to 30, then never again, ends up with more money.

$1,156,619, to be exact. The late bloomer, despite his continued efforts, only makes it to $930,510. That’s one nice home for $226,000 less. Or a Ferrari. Or an important surgery. Or five years of living cost in retirement, who knows.

The most important thing to know about personal finance is this:

If you don’t start playing this game today, you’ve already decided that you will lose it tomorrow.

Sumanth Patil,Updated 6y,What is the best advice you've received?,"Once my mom lost her money.

Maa: It was right here in my wallet.

Dad: How much?

Maa: 6, all thousand rupee notes.

Dad: That's ok, leave it now.

Next day,

Dad keeps 6 thousand in the cupboard. After few hours,

Dad: Hey, I found your money.

Maa: Where? (Surprised)

Dad: See, it is in the cupboard.

Maa: Oh! Maybe I had misplaced it.

When just me and my Dad came out in the evening.

Me: Why did you keep the money dad?

Dad: Sumanth, If it was me who had lost the money, I would have forgotten it by this time. I really don't have the habit of saving the money. It is your mom who does that, she values it. I value her and I can't see her being all sad about it. So I just did it. You know? Anything for your mom.

Me: Mmmm. (Thinking deep)

Dad: When you are in a relationship, don't be the reason for their tears, be the person who wipes it and be the reason for their happiness.

I can't be more thankful to him :)

Rafael Eliassen,Updated 3y,What are some financial tips that everyone should know?,"Live below your means. I used to eat cheap Ramen and Tuna fish to invest the saved money in my business. Now, I have a six-figure business. You must deprive yourself of money early, so you can invest your way to wealth.
Build a machine. An average millionaire has 7-income streams. You can’t become wealthy by your job or business alone. You need to create systems of passive income where you put invest $10k in ads and get $100k back.
Good debt vs Bad debt. Bad debt is that loses you money like credit card or high-interest loans. Good debt is that makes you more money than the interest you pay. Example: If you buy a property on debt and have the rental income higher than your loan payments.
Save 10% every month. People who don’t have money saved, are one disaster away from a debt spiral. They can lose their job or get an accidental medical bill and resort to high-interest debt. Don’t be those people’.
Invest money in you. People think they are smart to not buy a (valid) course but it’s the dumbest decision. The only place where you must spend freely is self-improvement. Because without it, your income won't increase.
Planned purchases. You can buy yourself nice things but the real enemy is impulse purchases. You order it only to find out you don’t need it that much. That’s why when you want something, the more planned the better.
Friends with savings. Don’t throw your money away with people who spend at expensive restaurants or on useless wants. You need to have friends who have the same economic-values as you do. Remember, when poor people make fun of your money choices, you are on your way to wealth.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/19t5y3ui4jbsg68d', 'title': 'What are some financial tips that everyone should know?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Live below your means.

Andrew Ferebee,Updated 5y,What is the single best financial move you have ever made in your life?,"To become a minimalist

In 2017, I found out that my business surpassed 7-figures of revenue in a 12 month period.

This translates to multiple six figures in profit personally, however, I still live like someone earning only $50,000 a year.

I own one car (a stick shift sedan), live in the same apartment I’ve lived in for the past 3 years, wear inexpensive clothes, fly coach, and generally keep my purchases and possessions very minimal.

I focus almost all of my time, money, and resources on creating new experiences and improving relationships… Not things.

And this has TRANSFORMED my financial life forever.

I no longer have to worry about money.

I don’t stress about my income or bills because I don’t spend money on material items that don’t bring me real happiness, freedom and peace of mind.

And you know what?

I’m the happiest that I’ve ever been in my life.

When you spend your money on things that bring joy into your life like healthy foods, fun experiences, travel, personal growth and time with people that you love, I can guarantee that you will be happier (and richer) than when you spent money on the latest phones, TVs, clothes and cars.

Stay Grounded,
Andrew

Anubhav Jain,Updated 2y,What are some financial tips that every student should know?,"1. A medium range smartphone with adequate speed, camera and speed is sufficient to meet your needs. The latest most expensive phones are a luxury that can be avoided until you earn on your own.

2. Going out with friends once in a while, eating at a restaurant, sharing expenses and enjoying is a great activity for students. However, showing off in front of your date or friends and recklessly spending money at an expensive restaurant is a waste of money.

3. Public mode of travel like a metro is much cheaper and convenient than being stuck alone in a car and waste huge money on the expensive fuel. Especially, just because you want to show off among your friends.

4. Invest your money in yourself, buy good books, read newspapers, use internet to learn, add skills and knowledge which will surely multiply in the future and give compounded returns and intellect.

4. Keep the infatuation for brands for your future when you earn, use your parents hard earned money to fulfil your needs to get decent clothes, moderately priced and with reasonable quality and durability. I won't say, buy a 100 rupee t-shirt, but don't waste a few thousands just to flaunt a brand.

6. Pocket money is not a free incentive but a hard earned income of someone. Don't waste it to show off your riches to attract and convince a person who will friend-zone you in future when you wouldn't be able to maintain the standards you set for yourself.

7. Learn to manage your expenses in the limited money you get from your parents, avoid borrowing aums from friends and relatives, you must learn money management, and gave self respect.

8. Whatever you have, always save some money, even if it's 100 rupees a month, this will inculcate an excellent habit for life.

9. Avoid buying the “better substitutes” of anything; the ones which are better only by a margin, but are a few times costly than the basic product.

10. Stay away from show-off culture and focus on your needs and your genuine wants, like studies is a need, food is a need, entertainment maybe a genuine want.

11. Avoid those friends who degrade you because of your financial limitations, who show off to make you feel low of yourself and those who take you on the path of highs and pleasures, the alcoholics.

12. Never waste money, for example carry a water bottle when you leave home, a handy packet of biscuits for instant hunger.

Things purchased from our own earnings can be a display of luxury but before that we must focus on necessity.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a4tgp03oy7qjh916', 'title': 'What are some financial tips that every student should know?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""1.

Vijaykumar Puri,6y,What is the single most effective piece of financial advice you've ever received?,"The best piece of financial advice was given to me by my professor of Economics.

Situation 1:

It is late night and you are walking home from office after a long and tiring day.

You are thirsty but your water bottle is empty. Your house is still far and you know that if you don’t drink water soon, you will not be able to walk.

Suddenly, you see an open shop in the distance. A convenience store!

You approach the owner and ask for a bottle of water.

He hands over a bottle of water to you

You are delighted to hold the bottle in your hand and a sense of happiness surrounds you.

You check the bottle for the MRP indication. It is Rs.10, you remove the cash and hand it over to the owner.

The owner looks at you and says “The price will be Rs. 20”

You look at him in disbelief. You know your legal rights and that the owner is unethical and wrong. There is no way out at the moment, and you eventually pay him Rs.20.

Situation 2:

It is again late night and you are walking home after a tiring day. You feel thirsty but you remember you have ample water with you.

So you remove your water bottle, quench your thirst and continue your journey home.

On the way, as you pass by a convenience store, the owner approaches you and says, “Today, we have an irresistible offer and you just cannot miss it. A water bottle of MRP Rs.10 is available at Re.1 only!!! Hurry up, offer expires midnight!”

You look at him, smile and walk away.

So what do we learn?

The principle is simple;

If there is a genuine need, it is okay to pay even Rs.20 for a thing costing Rs.10

but

if there is no need, it is not okay to pay even Re.1 for a thing costing Rs.10, no matter how good the offer seems!

This is such a basic principle that we always tend to ignore it.

So before you proceed to pounce on that next great online offer before it expires, ask yourself - “Do I really need this?”

This always helps me keep things in perspective while purchasing anything and is undoubtedly the most valuable financial advice that I have ever received.

And I would like to end by quoting Tyler Durden from Fight Club

Tiny Nair,Updated 5y,What is the greatest piece of advice you can give me?,"Theory

1 AM, book open, half groggy, I curse whoever has conceptualized MD entrance examination and MCQs. With exams being just a few days away, all we learn is mnemonics to cram complicated disease.

Hypertension

ADPKD

Berry aneurysm /

Intra Cranial Hemorrhage – 10%

Treatment – Surgical

Spleen, Liver cyst

Mnemonics – H A B I T S – HABITS, HABITS, HABITS – I repeat the ‘Mnemonic’ in my mind.

(for the ‘non-medical’ readers, these are examples of unusual disease which are asked in MCQ for entrance examination – the best we could do is to remember them with mnemonics. Sometimes during examination, all that we could remember are the mnemonic and not the fact!!!).

‘Why do they want us is to cram the rarest of the rare stuff, not testing what you know, but just what you don’t know’. Suddenly I realize that in the empty room that I was talking to myself.

May be, I am losing my mind.

I close the book, set the alarm at 6; reset it at 5 30 and go to sleep.

That’s how we learnt medicine; Knowing a lot of theory which is useless for all practical purposes. Its funny that people criticize the system till they pass out; and then they become staunch supporters of this same curriculum.

Even today, I always teach my residents and Junior doctors to learn practical medicine by the bedside which is much more important than any theory.

Life

The 40-something-old man had high blood pressure, little difficult to control and hence referred to us.

‘Do you have any symptoms’? I asked

‘Yes doctor, I have some headache, especially since last night, but I was tensed up because of the project and I did not get proper sleep’.

‘He has migraine in his family’ commented his wife.

Most people consider headache as a common signal for high blood pressure, and as physicians we know how wrong they are. Most hypertensives are asymptomatic, of course till they know they have blood pressure.

And then the headache starts; for both the patient and the doctor.

I readjusted his medicine dosage; and told him not to worry.

I reached the hospital parking place and was ready to get into my car when a young man came running.

‘sir how is ***? He is my brother; - by the way, do you remember me sir? You saw me referred by the nephrologist’.

My memory for faces is poor; I conjure up an artificial smile.

Then suddenly I remember something.

‘You were referred by the nephrologist for ADPKD right? (ADPKD stands for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease – a rare disease where kidneys are progressively replaced by grape like ‘cysts’ damaging the kidneys).

‘Yes sir, *** is my own brother’

HABITS; H A B I T S – Some old neurons fire in my subcortical brain.

‘H’ for Hypertension; ‘A’ for ADPKD; ‘B’ for berry aneurysm – berry aneurysm is a deadly kind of ‘bulges’ developing in the brain arteries; it co-exists with ADPKD.

It can present with headache, more importantly, burst and kill – anytime.

Autosomal dominant means there is high chance that his brother has ADPKD responsible for hypertension and an undetected bleeding aneurysm in the brain.

I run back to the ward; leaving the brother dumbfounded at the car park. An emergency brain CT scan is ordered, which show a leaking aneurysm in his brain.

He is taken up for neuro surgery, and he survives.

I see him on review.

A shaved head; but indeed, a close shave.

‘What did I learn?

What is my piece of advice?

Even the most logical criticism of a system, can prove us wrong one day.

The deepest, humid, claustrophobic mine can harbour a unseen high-value diamond.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/60btrgv8s9lhuwan', 'title': 'What is the greatest piece of advice you can give me?', 'score': {'original': 0.9001, 'ai': 0.0999}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Theory\n\n1 AM, book open, half groggy, I curse whoever has conceptualized MD entrance examination and MCQs.

Asim Qureshi,6y,Why isn’t gold considered to be a good investment?,"Throughout the ages, gold has been a universal currency and a great store of value.

It hasn’t really been an investment until recent times, in the same way the US$ isn’t really an investment today.

But the reason why gold isn’t a great investment today is as follows…

All the gold in the world is worth around US$7,500Bn. And it'd fit in a cube of 20m length.

Now, gold has uses, but none that are significant except jewellery, so, big picture, it’s pretty useless.

If you bought all the gold in the world for $7.5Tn after, say, 20 years, it’d be worth a little more than $7.5Tn (inflation and the global economy would push up the price).

Now sure, I'm ignoring the speculative element, but you don't invest long-term in the expectation you will sell in a speculative bubble - you look at fundamentals.

Note, you would get no dividend or yield on gold - in fact, you’d need to pay for storage.

What could you buy instead of that $7.5Tn worth of gold?

You could buy Apple ($900Bn), Facebook ($500Bn), Alibaba ($450Bn), Google ($750Bn), Amazon ($550Bn), Microsoft ($650Bn), Netflix ($80Bn), Uber ($50Bn), and Tesla ($55Bn).

That’d cost you $4Tn.

You could then buy all the property in London for $1.5Tn. Add New York for $1Tn. You would benefit from all the rent and still own it all after 20 years.

And with the $1Tn change, you could buy 250 million acres of income-producing farmland in the US. You would not only make money on the crop produced but own the land at the end.

So, 20 years down the line, which investment do you think would have been the better one?

This line of argument is exactly why the world’s best investor, Warren Buffett, doesn’t own gold.

And it’s why you shouldn’t either…","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v32jno1ya8m6trui', 'title': 'Why isn’t gold considered to be a good investment?', 'score': {'original': 0.986, 'ai': 0.014}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Throughout the ages, gold has been a universal currency and a great store of value.\n\nIt hasn’t really been an investment until recent times, in the same way the US$ isn’t really an investment today.\n\nBut the reason why gold isn’t a great investment today is as follows…\n\nAll the gold in the world is worth around US$7,500Bn.

Joy Deb,Updated 5y,What is the power of money?,"The power of money is not how much luxury or sex it could buy. It is something else.

When I was in Class XII(High School), I used to often go to this restaurant in Kota, Rajasthan which used to serve delicious vegetarian dishes.

Kota is a famous place in India, known for its coaching institutes, which prepares students for one of the toughest college entrance examinations, IIT-JEE. I was a student of a reputed coaching institute of Kota and used to live in a rented house far away from my home town.

In India, it is not mandatory to tip your waiter. Your waiter in India, will not misbehave with you if you do not tip him/her, like it happened in hundreds of American stories I have heard so far. I have seen in many big restaurants, people often dont even think of tipping their waiters let alone in that small veg restaurant that I frequently used to visit.

Most of the time, my lunch bill would come under ₹150/-(<$2.5). Vegetarian meals are really inexpensive in India. Every time, I used to tip the waiter ₹10/- (<20cents). I was a student at that time, it was a surprise for the waiter, when the first time I tipped him, as students rarely tip the waiter(saving pocket money).

Slowly with more frequent visits, all the waiters started noticing me. I can’t explain in words, the type of majestic treatment I used to get from the waiters for tipping them only Rs.10/- .

There was one waiter who used to wait on my table, most of the time.

Onetime, it was my birthday. I went there with some of my friends. The total bill came close to Rs 800/($12) . Pleased with his service, I tipped him Rs.100/-.

He asked me with a smile, “Bhaiyyaji, itna kyun de rahe ho?”(“Brother, Why are you giving me so much?”)

“Raklo bhaiyya, aaj waise bhi mera birthday hain, kuch kha lena”(Keep it bro, today’s my birthday, eat something with that)

After sometime, he became so accustomed with my orders and taste, that he almost used to write the orders by himself. He used to make sure that I get the most fresh vegetables and Paneer in my dishes.

It happened oneday, after returning to my room, I found that I forgot somewhere my backpack containing Rs.70,000/-(almost $1000). It was my coaching fees for the entire year plus my room rent. It was really a very big deal for me losing that kind of money. I got tensed and started recalling the places I had halted at, after I withdrew the amount from the bank.

I visited two to three places in search of the bag and then finally arrived at the restaurant.

Seeing me entering the restaurant, the waiter came to me quickly, with a huge smile on his face, carrying that backpack which I forgot in the restaurant that noon.

I took the bag from him, opened it to see that the small packet of cash was well sealed.

I heaved a sigh of relief.

Waiter : “Bhaiyyaji, apka bag. Main apke piche gaya tha paar tab tak jaa chuke the. Phir maine apne pass rakh liya tha isko”. (Brother, Your bag, I went after you but you had left by then. So, I kept it safe with myself.)

I smiled and replied, “Bhaiyya, aaj bacha liya tumne” (Brother, you saved me today )

That day, I understood one very important aspect of money.

Money is tremendously powerful, if you invest in the right person at the right time.

Pleased with his service, I tipped him Rs.100/-.\n\nHe asked me with a smile, “Bhaiyyaji, itna kyun de rahe ho?”(“Brother, Why are you giving me so much?”)\n\n“Raklo bhaiyya, aaj waise bhi mera birthday hain, kuch kha lena”(Keep it bro, today’s my birthday, eat something with that)\n\nAfter sometime, he became so accustomed with my orders and taste, that he almost used to write the orders by himself. He used to make sure that I get the most fresh vegetables and Paneer in my dishes.\n\nIt happened oneday, after returning to my room, I found that I forgot somewhere my backpack containing Rs.70,000/-(almost $1000). It was my coaching fees for the entire year plus my room rent. It was really a very big deal for me losing that kind of money. I got tensed and started recalling the places I had halted at, after I withdrew the amount from the bank.\n\nI visited two to three places in search of the bag and then finally arrived at the restaurant.\n\nSeeing me entering the restaurant, the waiter came to me quickly, with a huge smile on his face, carrying that backpack which I forgot in the restaurant that noon.\n\nI took the bag from him, opened it to see that the small packet of cash was well sealed.\n\nI heaved a sigh of relief.\n\nWaiter : “Bhaiyyaji, apka bag. Main apke piche gaya tha paar tab tak jaa chuke the. Phir maine apne pass rakh liya tha isko”. (Brother, Your bag, I went after you but you had left by then. So, I kept it safe with myself.)\n\nI smiled and replied, “Bhaiyya, aaj bacha liya tumne” (Brother, you saved me today )\n\nThat day, I understood one very important aspect of money.\n\nMoney is tremendously powerful, if you invest in the right person at the right time.\n\nThanks for reading :)\n\nHave a nice day.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.50075
Ajay Pruthi,4y,Why is investing important?,"My maid came to me in 2002 and was looking a bit worried. I just had completed my engineering and we four friends were living in a 2 BHK in Mumbai.

I asked her what was bothering her? The answer was very simple- I have a daughter and I want her to be educated like you guys. I do not want her to be like me, going to people houses and cooking food.

I said ok, but what are you worried about? She said- I do not know how to save or invest. I asked her, how much she can save monthly and she said around 2,000 per month. It was a good amount at that point of time.

Give me a week`s time and I will let you know, was my answer.

I was also new to investing but I researched and after a week suggested her 2 mutual funds. To my surprise, she actually started investing after 1 month.

Another 2 years, I was in the same flat and she was still investing. But time changes and so does the jobs. I got a new job in Delhi in year 2004. Before shifting to Delhi, I advised her 2 things, just 2 things- Do not withdraw this money for any other things, whatever the circumstances may be. And withdraw all the amount 3 years before your daughter`s higher education and put it in a FD.

This is my number and you can call me if you ever face any problem regarding your investments.

I never received a call from her in next 14 years.

Year 2019- I received a call from an unknown number. She called me to tell that her daughter is now an engineer. In fact, after paying for her education, she still has money left for her daughter`s marriage.(The money had grown to around 18 Lakhs)

She said thank you and it was clearly visible from her voice that she was crying.

Perhaps Tears of Happiness and that is why investing is important.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fnptlok80u394m1j', 'title': 'Why is investing important?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My maid came to me in 2002 and was looking a bit worried.

Ludwig Rose,Updated 3y,What was the biggest financial mistake you made that you still regret to this day?,"The biggest financial mistake I made is the same one most middle class Americans make as soon as they start making a little money.

Buying a German luxury sedan

This was essentially the exact car I bought, at 25 years old. Same color in and out.

Instead of focusing on paying off my student loans I thought

“Bahh, I’ll just make payments and buy this fancy expensive super fast car because I work hard and I deserve it!”

Apparently what I deserved were big monthly payments, maintenance bills, rapid depreciation and working tons of hours to fund my expensive lifestyle.

After a couple years of learning about personal finance I came to realize that one of the reasons I was broke, despite my high income, was that I was spending all my money on crap I didn’t need.

Crazy idea right?

The amount of money I was paying for my car payment + insurance + gas was about on par with my rent.

F**king financial disaster.

I eventually sold the car, got another car I quickly paid off and I’m on my journey to being 100% debt free.

I am about 3 months away currently.

I now believe I deserve peace of mind rather than expensive stuff and the accompanying headache.

Best,

Ludwig R.

P.S. as of 08/28/2020 I am officially 100% debt free!!! 238K in total debt.

Saranya Ravichandran,4y,What is your biggest financial burden at the moment?,"I have already mentioned in one of my answers about this one. It’s a huge amount that goes out from my bank account as EMI every month, and hence a burden, but I have never had a moment of regret about it until now. It’s about the house I bought for my parents in Coimbatore. This is the answer: Saranya Ravichandran's answer to What is success according to you?

I took a home loan of course to buy the house and I pay an EMI of 40,000 INR every month. After paying the installment for 2 years, I asked my father to take a statement and I was so disappointed to look at it. We hadn’t even paid 1 lakh of the loan amount, because for the first few years, it’s the interest that gets deducted more. I mean, I knew how it worked, but couldn’t help the disappointment.

So, I asked around and talked to people, especially my roommate. She had also taken a home loan several years ago to buy a house, but she finished it off way before the completion date. This is what she suggested: To put aside some money every month (in a FD or savings account) and then, by the end of the year, use that money to pre-pay part of the loan. I started doing this during the beginning of last year and paid off 2 lakhs during the end of the year. I’m planning to save more this year. Even if you put aside 10k per month, end of the year, it’s going to be 1.2 lakhs and it’ll definitely help reducing the principal amount.

After 10 years or so, I don’t think it makes sense to do the prepayment because by then, you’ll only be paying the principal anyway. So, doing these short prepayments made more sense for me.

This home loan is one of the biggest financial burdens I have right now. Actually up until one year ago, I thought it’s an amazing investment. Other than the fact that I bought the house for my parents, I was so proud of my investment skills, lol. But, last year, our director burst the bubble for me. He was talking to us about investments and it’s importance. During this session, he somehow never mentioned “real estate” as a good investment option. When I asked him, he said this, “The first house saves you from rent. Only if it’s second house, it’s an investment”. Which made sense actually.

For now, I have no plans of buying a second house, given the fact that I am still paying bills for the first house. So yes, saving as much as I can to finish this one soon. I can’t afford to quit or take a break or change jobs because of this one. But, I’m confident I will finish this off soon.

End of the day, whenever I see my father send me pictures of the house or look at him chill on the swing with my niece, the burden never seems big.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bsxdq3cvw5ae7m24', 'title': 'What is your biggest financial burden at the moment?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I have already mentioned in one of my answers about this one.

John Soroushian,6y,What is an economic bubble in layman's terms?,"Joseph Kennedy was a Wall Street titan and the father to future United States President John F. Kennedy. Legend has it that Kennedy learned his most important lesson about the stock market through an interaction with a shoeshine boy.

The boy, unfazed, tells Kennedy about a hot stock that has tripled in value and advises Kennedy to buy it. The boy further tells Kennedy how his other clients have taken his advice and already made a small fortune. Kennedy is impressed, thanks the boy, and gives him a big cash tip for this advice.

Kennedy then rushes to his office and calls his stock broker. However, instead of telling the broker to buy the hot stock recommended by the shoeshine boy, he tells the broker to pull all his money from the stock market. A surprised broker complies.

A couple weeks later the stock market crashes.

The broker is amazed at Kennedy’s foresight and asks how he knew there was a bubble. Kennedy’s response: “You know you are in a bubble when the shoeshine boy starts giving financial advice and people take it seriously.”

Corey Herbert,Updated 7y,What was a choice you made that completely changed your life?,"The doctor is looking at us patiently.

“Did you decide?”

There are three paths in front of us, all of them terrifying. We were given ten minutes to decide. Ten minutes to make the choice that would determine the rest of our lives. Ten minutes to understand something so complex, it has taken the doctor a lifetime of study.

Ten minutes which have now expired.

Ten days ago Brooke started bleeding. “Sometimes pregnant women just bleed,” we heard from the doctor. Everything looked okay on the ultrasounds. Everything sounded ok on the heart monitor. Everything was not ok.

Ten hours ago the doctor finally realized that something was wrong. That something, called TTTS, was a syndrome affecting our unborn twins. “What can we do?” we asked. “If you were my daughter,” she says, “I would advise you to terminate.”

Ten minutes ago our new doctor, the specialist, gently laid out the choices. Our boys were sick, the placenta they shared was delivering more nutrients to Baby B than Baby A. They were at stage three of the disease and progressing quickly. Stage four is the end. If we did nothing, they would both die. If we aborted one, what he called a “selective termination,” then the other would have a very high probability of a normal life. The last choice is surgery. We could try to save them both. We could try to repair the placenta. The risks were higher. Higher that something could go wrong, that maybe our children might not have the life that we had planned for them. If we wanted to do surgery, we were going to have to do it soon. As in very soon. As in today.

“I’ll let you talk it over. I’ll be back in ten minutes.”

I’d like to say it was a choice, but for us it was no choice at all. The picture of our boys was still up on the screen. The printouts were in our hands. At 18 weeks you can see the outline of their faces. You can see the shape of a hand as it caresses a cheek, our son’s cheek. I know that shape. I’ve been watching it for days now.

She has felt the impression of that hand for far longer.

She is sobbing, we both are. We are holding each other. She is looking at her stomach.

“Did you decide?”

EDIT 2

I’d just like to thank you all for sharing your own stories. I've read each of the comments and am moved by the responses written there. Several people have asked for an update, so here goes:

We went with the surgery. There were complications. Brooke ended up in the hospital on strict bed rest for 6 weeks. We tried everything we could to keep those boys in there but they were born early (24 weeks) anyway. The next 6 months were a nightmare. Maybe someday I’ll write about that too but like Churchill said, “When you’re going through Hell, keep going.”

There are and will be lifelong repercussions to the choice we made. Baby A (our little Jayden) has Epilepsy, Cerebral Palsy and Autism Spectrum Disorder. He takes this in stride and I am awed by his grace some days. Other days I want to crawl into a cave. Our boys are doing great but they will always have challenges that were dictated by the circumstances of their birth. Having said that, I’ve never regretted our choice, even for a second. And if I could go back, with full knowledge, I would make the same choice happily and wait with open arms for the chance to smile at their little faces for the first time again.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1xyvu9ptebg38o67', 'title': 'What was a choice you made that completely changed your life?', 'score': {'original': 0.95, 'ai': 0.05}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The doctor is looking at us patiently.\n\n“Did you decide?”\n\nThere are three paths in front of us, all of them terrifying.

Palkesh Asawa,7y,What are some of the mind blowing facts about stock markets?,"An interesting case of how superstitions work in real life!

In the Bombay Stock Exchange, there is a statue of a bull in front of the second gate of the building. People in the market have this superstition that whenever that gate is opened, the markets crash.

This is the famous stock market bull statue -

The door was first opened in 1992, and the infamous Harshad Mehta scam happened soon after it.
In 2001, the door was opened again during US President Clinton’s visit, and there was a major crash in the stock exchange.
Again, in 2008 when the gate was opened to install a new statue, the markets crashed suddenly.

Read these articles to know more:

Bull on Dalal Street seems to be jinxed - Hindustan Times
BSE brokers blame bull vaastu for bear maul - The Economic Times
BSE bronze bull caused crash?

What is going on here?

Are we meant to believe that the bull statue really caused a crash in the stock exchange? I mean, do superstitions work in real life?

In order to understand this better, let me tell you a story…

Akbar and Birbal decided to conduct a social experiment. They announced that every person in the kingdom should donate one glass of milk to the royal treasury during the night time.

But in the morning, they saw that the tank was actually full of water, not milk! Nobody gave a drop of milk. What was happening?

To find out, they decided to disguise themselves and ask around.

One person said, “Oh, everyone else was going to put milk. Who will find out if I added one glass of water? I saved money!”

It was a genius idea, but alas, everybody thought the same. Everyone thought that everyone else is going to put milk, and hence it would benefit them if they put water instead. In thinking so, everyone eventually ends up putting water.

This is interesting, right? It happens in the stock markets too.

Imagine that you hold some shares in the stock market and you get to know that gate number 2 of the Bombay Stock Exchange has recently been opened. What are you thinking right now?

“Holy shit! Whenever they open that bloody gate, the market crashes. Man! I have a lot of money invested in the market. I better sell my shares before the market falls”

That’s a fantastic idea, except that everybody is thinking the same thing.

Everyone is afraid that the markets may fall. As a result of this, everyone wants to sell their shares and leave, before the price falls. What happens then? This is basic economics. When the supply rises, prices fall.

Imagine! Markets crash because people believe that they are going to crash.

Such is the power of a superstition!

Asim Qureshi,6y,What is the best financial advice for young people?,"Some advice for those still in education. And while it may not sound financial, it is…

There is a MASSIVE shortage of technologists across the world, and it’s only going to get more acute.

Half of jobs paying over US$57k in the US require coding skills. HALF!

And in this space, no-one cares what degree you have. They want skills.

So, if the following apply to you…

You’re unlikely to get a tier 1 job (doctor, investment banking, lawyer, etc..)
…but you’d like to as you want lots of money
You have no particular career passions in life (like most people)

…then do this. Forget your degree. And go on an intensive coding course instead. You’ll probably get a solid job in 3–6 months.

Or if you have a degree, seriously think about getting into coding.

Around 5–10 years from now you’ll be able to command an annual pay of US$25–60k in today’s terms sitting in a village in India so long as you have a laptop and internet connection, and have worked hard.

If you work from an office in a developed country you’ll get a lot more.

And if you’re exceptional, there is nothing stopping you making US$300k+ at Google, Facebook, etc…

The thing is, the flexibility you’ll have is amazing, and you’ll always find it piss easy to get a well paid job - there is just so much demand for coders.

And programming is a great skill to learn if you want to be an entrepreneur.

Coding is the way forward. It is still a massively underestimated skill…","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a42k61ytml5pi9q0', 'title': 'What is the best financial advice for young people?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Some advice for those still in education.

Rays Solas,1y,How wealthy was Rakesh Jhunjhunwala?,"Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s life is a lesson that good health is the ultimate wealth. Because beyond a few crores, wealth is just a number.

Walking in the Sun daily is a must. 62 is definitely not the age to die.

In the process his blood sugars went haywire, developed ESRD (End Stage Renal Disease), survived on HD (haemo dialysis) till his ultimate demise. Had a bad diabetic foot. He was unable to rise from his chair even in presence of PM Modi, for which he was trolled badly on social media, until real reason for his act was revealed.

John Soroushian,5y,What are some good investments?,"A Wall Street tycoon invites a college student interested in finance to visit her. The student has no real connections and comes from the same impoverished town as her, so she wants to help mentor him.

After some pleasantries, the young man asks her, “What do you think are some good investments?”

“I am glad you asked,” the woman smiles.

“I recommend three—they have all worked well for me.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 3y,How do I improve my personal finances?,"Imagine you’re in the middle of the desert.

Imagine that when you work, you get paid in water.

The first problem you will bump into will be how to store your water.

Solution?

Use a glass instead of your hands.

Second problem?

The water will evaporate with time, correct?

To solve this you need a canteen with a cap to prevent evaporation.

Great!

The next challenge will be to resolve long term reserves.

This seems like a simple solution; you get multiple canteens and build up your store.

Amazing!

Next problem…

When you lose your strength to work, you will need to start consuming those canteens. Your life expectancy in the desert will be determined by the number of canteens you were able to accumulate during your work life.

Some people in the desert may have accumulated enough to drink during their elder years, some won’t.

Ideal solution?

Own a water well in the desert.

(Source of all images: Google)

Interpretation of the analogy:

Water = Money (cash)
Water in a glass that evaporates = Cash in a bank.
Water in a canteen = Assets that appreciate with inflation. They maintain their value over time. Some examples are commodities like oil, gold and silver.
Accumulated water in canteens = Savings in assets.
Losing strength to work = Retirement.
Water well = Cash flowing assets.

Lesson of the analogy:

Money is only a mechanism of exchange that holds a temporary storage of value.
If you save cash, time will ‘evaporate’ its current value.
Some assets protect us from monetary volatility. This is specially important in third world countries like my Mexico.
Accumulating assets may not be enough to guarantee your retirement because you will need to liquidate them to pay for your needs.
The water well represents cash flowing assets. These assets produce passive income, meaning they produce cash even while you sleep.

To answer your question, how can you improve your personal finances?

One of the best ways to improve your personal finances is by investing intentionally in cash-flowing assets.

The most common are real estate rentals, businesses and royalties.

Your first step is to protect your savings from the external influence of monetary policies that will “evaporate” the value of your hard work.

Alessandra Rao,Updated 3y,What is the single best financial move you have ever made in your life?,"I never spent a dime on education, and I got an offer from Google straight out of college.

Growing up, many of my friends went to expensive private high schools, but I went to a specialized arts public high school called LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts which had less than 10% acceptance rate. How? When I was in middle school I would constantly draw. I drew everything — friends, flowers, landscapes, self portraits. I even had my own portrait business in the school yard where I sketched my friends for a few bucks. Getting accepted to the prestigious LaGuardia Arts High School was my first great financial decision. It taught me that it is possible to get a world class education for free.

LaGuardia was a dream school. They played guitar in the halls and the musicals were of Broadway caliber. There were celebrity students like Madonna's daughter. All students took 3 arts classes on top of the standard high School subjects. As a high school kid, I was pretty resourceful. I would go to any free classes I could find: Yoga to the People in Manhattan, Summer Art classes in Stuyvesant High School, free SAT prep classes, museum classes…I was a full on nerd. I even enrolled myself in a free after school program that taught us about careers in advertising at the Art Directors Club in NYC. Although high school was amazing, the best education was adventuring in New York City for free.

I decided I wanted a career in marketing; it was the perfect blend of art and business. While my friends partied, I would stay up all night with my SAT books and write college application essays. Soon, the acceptance letters came in the mail — $50K a year tuition on average for the creative schools. Finally, I got an interesting offer: a full ride scholarship to a public business school in NYC via the Macaulay Honors College Program, along with $7.5K to study abroad and a free MacBook Pro. Can you guess which offer I went with? ;-)

I used the $7.5K to study in Barcelona and Paris with zero out of pocket. They even covered food. I hustled my way through college with 4 internships and freelance design work. I lived at home, had a 4 hour daily commute, and the 'campus life' was non-existent. I graduated with zero debt and an honors degree, without any financial help from my parents.

I got a job offer from Google straight out of college and I am absolutely loving it.

And yes, I still get free food. ;-)

Sahil Bhadviya,Updated 5y,What is the most poorly understood area of personal finance?,"Have you invested in life Insurance plans to get returns on maturity in future?

Did your insurance advisor/agent persuade you to buy ULIP insurance for your child education or retirement?

If yes, you are trapped under one of the poorly understood areas of personal finance: Mixing Life Insurance with Investment.

I once did my internship in a life insurance firm where my role was to do market research to understand why people buy life insurance. I did surveys and personal interviews with a lot of people and was surprised by my findings:

90% people do not understand the difference between various life insurance products: Term Plan, Endowment Plan, ULIP plan, etc.
Most of the people want to buy an insurance plan because they want to save tax.
They think insurance is one of the safest investment options where you get decent returns on your investment.

I was shocked!

Let’s understand in detail…

Q. Do you really need life insurance? If yes, why?

A. Yes, you need life Insurance to financially protect your family in case of death.

But…

Unfortunately, most of the people fall victim to Insurance Agents.

Most of the people do not understand that the fundamental reason behind life insurance is to provide life insurance and not investment.

Let’s see what are the plans available in India’s biggest Life Insurance Company:

Can you observe something?

Most of the plans are in the category of Endowment plans and Money back plans. Only 2 plans are in Term Insurance category.

This is because Term Insurance is the least profitable category for LIC. In this category, people pay premiums just for financial support to their family in case of death. Since people in this category do not mix life insurance with investment, they pay less premium for a specific amount of life insurance.

Whereas, an endowment plan, people pay a huge amount of premium for the same amount of life insurance in term plan. The only difference is they get a specific amount of money on the maturity of the policy.

Let’s understand the calculations of LIC Endowment vs Term Plan:

Endowment Plan:

Term Plan:

Source: licpremiumcalculator

Did you observe anything?

In order to get minimum sum assured of Rs 50 lakh on death, you have to pay an annual premium of Rs 2,27,167 in endowment plan whereas in term plan you just need to pay Rs 8,496!
If you compare monthly premium, you need to pay Rs 19,333 in an endowment plan whereas just Rs 708 in term plan.
You are paying a total premium of Rs 35,61,310 in endowment plan and just Rs 2,12,400 in term plan. A difference of Rs 33,48,910.

Now you will say that in endowment plan, you will get Rs 1.35 crore on maturity after 25 years and you will not get anything in term plan. In this case, if we take the difference between endowment plan and term plan premium and invest that amount in better options like mutual fund then we will get much higher returns.

Monthly difference in total premium for 16 years: Rs 18,625 ( 19,333–708)

Note: We are replicating investment strategy of endowment plan where the premium has to be paid for 16 years.

If you make a SIP of Rs 18,625 in mutual fund and expect a return of 12% then after 16 years you will get Rs 1.1 crore. Now, you keep that amount in the mutual fund without any further investment and keep getting 12% return for another 9 years, then by the end of 25 years, you will have Rs 3 crore which is Rs 1.65 crore more than endowment plan return!

Source: easycalculation

Conclusion: When it comes to life insurance, you should never mix it with investment and always opt for term plan.

In case we are meeting for the first time,

Now, you keep that amount in the mutual fund without any further investment and keep getting 12% return for another 9 years, then by the end of 25 years, you will have Rs 3 crore which is Rs 1.65 crore more than endowment plan return!\n\nSource: sipcalculator\n\nSource: easycalculation\n\nConclusion: When it comes to life insurance, you should never mix it with investment and always opt for term plan.\n\nIn case we are meeting for the first time,\n\nHi, I am Sahil and I educate people on personal finance.\n\nThanks for reading my answer.\n\nFollow me for more answers on money management: Sahil Bhadviya', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.66035

Rick,Updated 1y,What is the single most effective piece of financial advice you've ever received?,"We were newlyweds. My wife moved into my rented apartment because the rent was cheap. Months later, a new landlord doubled our rent. Of course, both of us made very little money at the time. So we planned to save our money, and someday… maybe in 10 or 20 years… we would have a reasonable down payment to put on our own house.

While spending the weekend with older and more successful friends, we mentioned our plan. Our friend said, “No! By the time you save for that huge down payment, house prices will have skyrocketed! Get your hands on every penny you can. Cash in insurance policies if you have to. But figure out where you want to live and buy now!”

We decided on where we wanted to live. We hadn’t spent our “wedding money” yet, so we added every dollar we could afford to put aside… and bought a lovely 5-room house a few blocks from the ocean for $35,000. (1984). A year later, it was valued at more than $100,000. because AT&T built an office building in our town, its executives wanted to live near the ocean. Twenty years later, we sold it for $250,000, which bought our home in Maine. Ten years later, we sold our house in Maine, which paid for our present home in Santa Fe, NM.

…all because we trusted a friend’s advice and bought a $35,000 house in 1984.

Sean Kernan,1y,How exactly did Bernie Madoff pull off his scam?,"For the uninformed, Madoff pulled off the biggest Ponzi Scheme in history.

Here’s how a Ponzi scheme works.

Company 1 offers you a 2% return on your investment.
Company 2 offers you a 10% return.
Company 3 offers you a 50% return.

It’s clear that company 3 is a ridiculously good option and you take it.

Company 3 is the Ponzi scheme.

The owner is not actually investing your money. He’s taking the money and, basically, spending it.

To ensure people can pull their money out when they need it, he keeps taking on more and more investors.

It has a snowball effect. He has to continually take on bigger and bigger investors to cover people’s withdrawals and his business expenses.

A Ponzi scheme is intrinsically destined to fail eventually if the owner goes in too deep.

Madoff went very, very deep. The scheme lasted decades.

He got away with it because he was clever about hiding his tracks but—mostly—because regulators were shockingly incompetent. They were given leads several times by competing investors who spelled out precisely why it was a Ponzi scheme. Analysts knew the returns Madoff was promising were statistically impossible.

Eventually, of course, it all came crumbling down. Billions of dollars went up in smoke. The incident destroyed many people’s life savings.

The Madoff family was devastated. One of his sons committed suicide on the anniversary of his father’s arrest (a clear middle finger to his father on the way out). His only other son died of cancer a year after that.

Madoff’s former wife is completely broke now and barely getting by.

Madoff was sentenced to 150 years and died behind bars in 2021. He caused unbelievable hardship to innocent people. Elderly retirees lost much of their hard earned savings.

Madoff deserved to die in prison.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8n5khv7ie2pycs4f', 'title': 'How exactly did Bernie Madoff pull off his scam?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'For the uninformed, Madoff pulled off the biggest Ponzi Scheme in history.\n\nHere’s how a Ponzi scheme works.\n\nCompany 1 offers you a 2% return on your investment.\nCompany 2 offers you a 10% return.\nCompany 3 offers you a 50% return.\n\nIt’s clear that company 3 is a ridiculously good option and you take it.\n\nCompany 3 is the Ponzi scheme.\n\nThe owner is not actually investing your money.

Ross.Lederhman,3y,Has procrastination turned out to be beneficial for you in the stock market?,"Yes.

Many folks, who are proclaimed professional daytraders, feel they have to trade every day. Every fucking day. With their massive setups like this;

And shoutout to the world, how tough it is, how much hours it takes every day, so much stress, yada yada. The above is nonsense. You don't require all this rubbish. You don't need fixed daily goals, it makes, mathematically, no sense. One should trade when an opportunity arises, not the other way around. I am a “lazy” trader. I don't trade frequently, and when I do, I don't require 50 screens, ha.

I was busy working on an old algorithm of mine when someone of Quora name dropped me random firms (Jake). Chegg and Six Flags were one of em'. I put Chegg in my algorithm and was purely checking how it was working out.

Due to its results, I wanted to know more. Doing some reading about it made me realize, before earnings, I should put in a short, textbook example of a fat bastard of a company, earnings are likely going to be disappointing, the rest is probably going to indicate massive growth (book company, we are in the middle of the pandemic). It was the perfect moment for folks to exit some of their positions. And on that I anticipated. They published earnings after closing, made an absolute killer.

And why? Purely because someone fetched me the name of a firm I never investigated, they had earnings coming up, I did my research and felt a position should be taken.

And all on 1 small laptop, while I did my positions through the phone. Manually.

Being “lazy” is another word for waiting for what seems the right moment. You don’t need to trade. Heck, I never have to trade again, but I can, and it gives me time and clarity to research what I think is worth investing in.

I felt absolute no pressure, and I am convinced that helps me in my trading activities.

Hector Quintanilla,3y,"In a tight economic time, what can middle class people do to stay middle class?","Imagine catching a Coca-Cola top executive drinking a Pepsi-Cola!

That would be just priceless, wouldn't it?

Ohh, I can't express enough how much I desired to accomplish this prank on my friend! Each time I invited him home for dinner or a family event, I made sure I had a Pepsi bottle ready. My goal was to find the opportunity to distract him, have him grab the Pepsi bottle, and take a picture!

I never succeeded; it was impossible! My friend was unbelievably loyal and proud to work for Coca-Cola.

Ever since my friend graduated college, he had been super lucky to find this job. That was almost 25 years ago. The opportunity to scale the corporate ladder in this corporation was huge.

My friend consistently exceeded expectations. With discipline and hard work, he found success and grew a good reputation inside the corporation. In fact, he was so successful in his area of expertise, that he recently was promoted to run a new division in the United States.

Then, the unimaginable happened!

Early in May, he called me. He was torn in pieces. I could sense a tremor in his voice. Devastated, he told me, “Hector, I don’t know what I am gonna do. I lost my job!”

With millions of restaurants closed and all social events canceled, the beverage industry has been tremendously impacted by the pandemic. His division was severely damaged. The company leaders were swift and decisive, sending hundreds of people in his area home.

He was included.

Coca-Cola laying off people? Really? Who could imagine that! I know he didn't. Personally, I never thought it could ever happen. I mean, his job was supposed to be probably one of the “safest” jobs I had in mind.

Now, to answer your question, in a tight economic time, what can middle class people do to stay middle class?

Today, the biggest problem my friend has is the fact that he has zero income. He lost his job, and his paycheck was his ONLY source of income, a mistake that nobody of us could have predicted.

What is the lesson?

In the words of Mr. Warren Buffett, “Never depend on a single source of income.”

Most members of the middle class rely on a single source of income. This is a HUGE mistake. The best way to secure this economic status is by diversifying risk.

Never trust your future entirely to a paycheck in today's rapidly-changing world. The risk of disruption is growing exponentially.

I’ve been guiding my friend on how to diversify and generate multiple sources of income. I’ll be revealing these experiences very soon to my clients and students.

Sean Kernan,2y,What was the biggest decision taken by you that changed your life?,"Writing on this site—because of what it’s led to.

After my divorce, I knew I’d have a lot more free time on my hands. I needed a hobby that would be productive.

I am very intense and passionate about anything I do. I was a hardcore gamer for years and was a high-level league of legends player at one point. Not good enough to go pro, but maybe just below the level at which people make money. But it was a problematic hobby that ate up too much time.

As a child, my dad had often said, “Wow imagine if you put as much time into your studies as you did into those games.”

I decided no more hobbies that will consume me.

I figured writing on Quora would be a quasi-productive, quasi-fun hobby, that wouldn’t consume me too much.

Everything except that last part was true. It spun into this whole big thing that I never expected. I got obsessed with writing. I think in the first 3 years I wrote 4000+ answers.

This love of writing led to opportunities to make money. I was able to work at the craft.

Writing also made me realize how much I hated my corporate job. I would liken it to when you are in a terrible relationship and some great, attractive person who has their shit together asks you out on a date.

You start to wonder, “What if there is more to my life than this crap relationship?”

Quitting my job was a huge decision that changed my life for the better. I have freedom. The money is great so far. I have control of my life.

It’s amazing what can happen if you just listen to your parents.

Shubham KP,1y,What is the one piece of advice you would give to anyone?,"Do you hate studying?

Do you hate waking up day after day to do the thing you dread the most? If yes, I’m afraid you need a change. I don’t intend to sound like your father. But the thing is, we all need to study one thing or the other.

I’m not talking about those 0.1% who’re lucky enough to follow their passion and make money out of it. You need to do things you hate. You need to do it every day until you get a better opportunity to escape from it.

Life doesn’t give you the time you grow up. One day you’re enjoying the farewell and the very next day you’re unemployed. You’re not a student anymore.

If that’s happening with you, too, don’t dread the process.

Fall in love with the process. Enjoy giving the mock tests. And if your result sheet is going to pop out after two years of college life, or three, enjoy the journey. Nothing happens once you clear the examinations. You get passed. Your parents get happy. And you start doing a job that a lot of people are doing.

What defines you is the things you do outside work/study. Make good friends. Help people. Listen to people who don’t want to live anymore. Travel. Dance. Sing. Read. Make someone believe in kindness. I don’t know what else you can do— but there has to be a life beyond work and study.

And that’s the real life.

You’re not a robot. The moment you realise that part, you become grateful for a lot of things in life.

We all are gifted,

Ross.Lederhman,4y,Why is there no solid corporate finance course or degree taught at a university?,"Because corporate finance is a segment within finance you don't learn at university, but in the field.

The world of academia couldn't have it more wrong when it comes to the teachings of corporate finance and private equity. The certificates you can study for (and pay a hefty price for), are often provided by failed investment bankers because they know dozen of gullible naive students are dying to put a “corporate finance certificate” on their CV.

I studied Quantitative Finance in university which was pure maths. 90% of my class went into investment banking and sales and trading.

I became a quant, and hopped over to investment banking later.

From what I've gathered of my friends, myself, and all the years thereafter, the introduction process hasn't changed much. You are all pooled together as grads and simply go through tough thick material lessons. I know, I've been through quite a few myself, and helped design a few.

Shubham Bhatt,4y,Why would you invest in yourself?,"There was a guy in my college who used to live for others and never gave time to himself.

He was one the favoritos among boys and girls.

He got good marks in first semester but it deteriorated in coming semesters due to the same investment of time and energy for others instead of himself.

He used to love a girl from his class. When he came to know about a guy who used to love her, he made her a sister.

After the college, many of our friends got selected in various companies but he didn't. He scored a low percentage due to which he had to face “Not selected” tag.

“No problem, I have friends and family” he came out of the interview panel after last rejection.

What he saw?

Those friends and family of college got engaged with each other ignoring the guy who invested his whole graduation time, energy and money for them.

No one remembers the failure person once they get successful (except few ones). This is a harsh reality of today's society.

We should invest time, money and energy for others as much as we can but give priority to ourself in order to reach a stage from where few others might hear us as a “successful person”.

Here are a few tips:

Nikhil Jain,2y,What’s the best financial decision that you’ve ever made?,"Invest in assets, not in liabilities.

I learned the above quote when I started learning about personal finance a couple of years back. And this learning stayed with me.

Last year, I wanted to learn car driving. I had enrolled in a driving school, but I felt it was not enough. I needed to practice more, practice consistently. So, I thought of buying a car. But I didn’t want to shell out a lot of money in buying a new car for two reasons.

I didn’t know how to drive properly.
I stay alone in Delhi, so I don’t require a big car.

So, I started looking for a second-hand car and eventually bought a second-hand Nano. It cost me around 55k.

Image Source: My Phone Gallery

I drove Nano every day for around two months and eventually started feeling comfortable driving. Now, it’s been a year since I bought it, and I feel proud of that decision. It has been serving my purpose pretty well. I drive it comfortably all around the city at negligible maintenance cost. It saves a lot of time and money for me. Moreover, I enjoy driving that car.

Though some of my colleagues mock me for driving such a cheap car, I don’t mind it. I don’t find it cheap at all. To me, a car is a utility product that helps me comfortably travel from one place to another. As long as it fits the bill, I have no qualms about driving it. I won’t invest a huge amount in a depreciating asset as long as I don’t really need to do it.

That said, I feel buying a second-hand car has been one of the great financial decisions I have made in my life in recent times.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8zygtwhx4jensv9k', 'title': 'What’s the best financial decision that you’ve ever made?', 'score': {'original': 0.9981, 'ai': 0.0019}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Invest in assets, not in liabilities.\n\nI learned the above quote when I started learning about personal finance a couple of years back.

Gopal Kavalireddi,5y,What is the biggest financial mistake that you have ever made and what lesson did you learn from that?,"My life has been a big bouquet of many mistakes, one bigger than the other. These wide array of mistakes encompass academics, career, finances, friends & family and continue to give rise to constant doubts on every current step & future thoughts.

But since the query relates only to financial mistakes, I will address accordingly. It is difficult to pick which was a bigger mistake. The reason being that, when I made them, they looked smaller but due to passage of time, the repercussions have become exponential, in some instances.

Let me start writing my mistakes and by the end of the answer, we might actually end up with the biggest mistake of all.

I come from an upper middle class family. I started earning (on my own, in a proper job) since 1998 and I never knew what to do with the salary. My parents always provided me with everything and since they had sufficiently earned & saved, never seriously taught me about the importance of saving, investing or wealth building. It was always that they built wealth and I spent & spent - not wasteful spending on social life (I am not into drinking, clubbing, or womanizing) but spent it away on friends (guys) - giving expensive gifts, going on trips etc, with my money.

I used to be so generous that, when I was studying in US, I paid for the boarding & lodging of my friend for a period of 2 years! I even bought a car, so that he can go to his college campus, instead of walking. (We used to live together, but my campus was at a walking distance, while his was 4–5 miles away). This was 1999 and no Uber/Ola existed then.

I had a full scholarship to study M.S. which was a good $18,000 per year (1999), and additionally, used to get a good stipend as a Research Assistant, working at Florida International University, before I started working full time with the U.S. Department of Energy on nuclear decontamination projects.

So, between 1998–2003, whatever I earned (a lot in dollars), I spent it all away and didn’t have even Rs. 1 of saving, when I finally returned to India, to pursue entrepreneurship (I wrote my failures, twice, as an entrepreneur in a separate query).

Lesson learnt: Earning is like a merry go-round, once you stop it, you better be ready to meet your lifestyle on your own dime. If not, life will turn out to be a nightmare.

In a summer semester (studying in US), I wanted to take an additional independent study (summer semesters are not covered in scholarship), I didn’t have $2800 to pay for the course. My father said that he would send me the money but it would take a few days to make the arrangement. So, he told me to ask a family friend (my father supported her to go to US & study), who along with her husband were earning $300,000/year (in 2001), to provide temporary support.

The answer those ‘family friends’ gave me was that, they didn’t have sufficient money with them, as they had planned to buy a brand new BMW X1 (SUV) and had to pay in 2 days.

I asked my friends to pool some money atleast, they said that they were not made of money like I was, and I should have saved without spending it all away, unnecessarily.

Lesson Learnt: When the going is good, everyone is your ‘friend’. When hardships, especially financial come about, each one is on his own. So, learn to save, save, save.

BTW, I couldn’t pay for the course and my graduation was delayed by a semester.

Continuing from earlier, after wasting a couple of years trying to start a business, I set myself up again, with a fresh education (MBA), followed by a campus interview at a very reputed Co and started earning. This was 2005.

Since I was single at the time and my expenses were limited, I was saving (but not investing) sufficiently. I used to leave money in fixed deposits and recurring deposits. One day, a friend of mine (classmate from MBA) introduced me to investments in stocks and said that they are ‘money minting’ machines and easy money.

I was a graduate of operations & marketing, with limited knowledge of finance. I didn’t even understand a financial statement thoroughly, and I relied on stock tips from everyone to buy shares of companies, traded severely and hardly made any profit. Then some ‘wise’ people told me that I need to invest, hold and then only I can see good gains. As part of that philosophy, I was ‘advised’ to buy Unitech, which I think I bought around Rs. 450 or so, everyone knows that happened after the global financial crisis of 2008. I had many stocks like this, which lost as much as 80% in no time and haven’t made a come back.

In less than 6–8 months of investing, I lost 3 years of earnings/savings - completely wiped clean.

Lesson Learnt: Never, ever, trust anyone for your investments. No one is looking out for your well-being, anytime. They are only good for gossip, not for serious investment advice.

Summary till now, worked for 10 years between 1998 - 2009, but Zero saved, Zero wealth built.

Since 2009, having learnt sufficient lessons, I made a lot of changes.

I stopped spending on others unnecessarily - none of my friends in the 4 decades of my life, helped me or offered any worthwhile advice/support, while they kept enjoying mine as well as my parent’s money.
I invested my money, time & effort in understanding businesses, economic as well as internal and external factors that affect investments, returns in general.
I started allocating my savings into various pockets - PPF, FD, mutual funds, stocks, bonds etc in a slow and steady manner.
I learnt not to be perturbed by market corrections which have no rhyme or reason, but to study the situation and take appropriate decisions, or at times, NOT to take any decisions.

Over a 5 year period, between 2009 - 2014, I saved quite a bit, invested most of it, accumulated sizable portfolio of diversified investments. But, was that the end of my mistakes?

No, no, not at all.

Remember Dr. Strange’s words to Tony Stark in The Avengers: Infinity War? “I see only 1 possible victorious outcome, out of a possible 14,000,605 future outcomes”.

Lesson learnt: Taking a fresh path is not an explicit indication of a rose-petal-paved journey. New paths give rise to new issues.

In 2014, I quit an amazing job (Take home monthly salary was Rs. 300,000) to pursue entrepreneurship again. This time, I had enough capital, network, business idea and everything going in my favor. How it failed and all is another story, but getting back to the point of financial mistakes.

I used to do so much research on companies, that on any given day, I could identify 2–3 stocks which were cheap, with average financials & un-leveraged balance sheets, which could do amazingly well if the tide turned in their favor.

I had conviction on all of them but I had a different problem - problem of aplenty. So I bought most of them (>25 companies) but spread out in small quantities. At that time, I didn’t think it was a mistake, but, after what happened in the stock market over the last 16 months or so, I feel disappointed.

Why? I wanted to invest in all of them, but I knew I couldn’t get sizable quantities in all of them due to insufficient capital. So, whatever stocks I bought in during the years 2014–15–16–17, out of them,

stocks which have risen by 3X, 4X, 5X, 10X and fallen now to 2014, 15 levels, I have in large quantities, making my returns negligible (after holding for so long but at Zero Cost). Many of them hit my stop loss (purchase prices) in recent times and had to sell them at cost - Meghmani, Tata Global, Fineotex, Marksans Pharma & many more. Take the example of Bombay Burmah - I invested at Rs. 817 in 2017 (picked the stock at the right time), then the stock went on to hit Rs. 2115 (didn’t sell - Long term investing theory) and is now back at Rs. 1181. What is the use of investing!

Lesson Learnt: Need to sell and take profits at regular intervals, on a continuous basis. There is nothing called invest and forget. It is invest, review, take profit, invest, review, take profit, and repeat the exercise regularly.

Stocks which have risen well & which continue to do well, I have in small quantities and haven’t been able to add more, in a timely manner. So, even if the gains are great, the quantities are small, where the absolute returns missed a chance to be awesome. For eg: Look at Bajaj Finance, my original investment was much earlier, but after making money buying & selling so many times, I finally stayed invested in 2016 with 300 shares at a price of Rs. 860. Today, the stock is at Rs. 2700.

Instead of buying 750 shares of Suven LifeSciences at Rs. 174.50 in Sep 2014, I could have bought Bajaj Finance 503 shares additionally, at a price of Rs. 260 for the same investment amount.

Today, instead of having a paltry Rs. 29,588 as profit on Suven, I could have had Rs. 12,27,320 as profit (by investing in Bajaj Finance).

Lesson Learnt: Never spread yourself or your capital too thin. If you have conviction, then go full steam ahead, with periodic reviews.

There is an irony in my investments too. While investing for myself, I made these mistakes, whereas whenever my father or siblings or family members sought my views on buying/selling & investment prices, times, I have given them excellent opinions and they have been able to make superb gains. Unfortunately, I seem to be lazy or inertial when it comes to doing it on my own (Ofcourse, one of the reasons has been lack of sufficient capital, another reason is that I am away at times on consulting projects & miss taking action at the right time & missed the proverbial bus).

Do remember: Mistakes might be small but the depth & duration of an impact can last a life time!

So, as you can see, it is difficult to judge which is a bigger mistake and my list of mistakes continue. They are more than a mile long and I continue to make newer and newer mistakes, consistently & constantly.

But that hasn’t stopped my learning process and have sincerely tried not to repeat the same mistakes again! Like I said, my life has been a bouquet of mistakes, many in the financial arena & hence, continue to still try my best to build wealth, while I could have retired by now!

Karma in progress!

It was always that they built wealth and I spent & spent - not wasteful spending on social life (I am not into drinking, clubbing, or womanizing) but spent it away on friends (guys) - giving expensive gifts, going on trips etc, with my money.\n\nI used to be so generous that, when I was studying in US, I paid for the boarding & lodging of my friend for a period of 2 years! I even bought a car, so that he can go to his college campus, instead of walking. (We used to live together, but my campus was at a walking distance, while his was 4–5 miles away). This was 1999 and no Uber/Ola existed then.\n\nI had a full scholarship to study M.S. which was a good $18,000 per year (1999), and additionally, used to get a good stipend as a Research Assistant, working at Florida International University, before I started working full time with the U.S. Department of Energy on nuclear decontamination projects.\n\nSo, between 1998–2003, whatever I earned (a lot in dollars), I spent it all away and didn’t have even Rs. 1 of saving, when I finally returned to India, to pursue entrepreneurship (I wrote my failures, twice, as an entrepreneur in a separate query).\n\nLesson learnt: Earning is like a merry go-round, once you stop it, you better be ready to meet your lifestyle on your own dime. If not, life will turn out to be a nightmare.\n\nIn a summer semester (studying in US), I wanted to take an additional independent study (summer semesters are not covered in scholarship), I didn’t have $2800 to pay for the course. My father said that he would send me the money but it would take a few days to make the arrangement. So, he told me to ask a family friend (my father supported her to go to US & study), who along with her husband were earning $300,000/year (in 2001), to provide temporary support.\n\nThe answer those ‘family friends’ gave me was that, they didn’t have sufficient money with them, as they had planned to buy a brand new BMW X1 (SUV) and had to pay in 2 days.\n\nI asked my friends to pool some money atleast, they said that they were not made of money like I was, and I should have saved without spending it all away, unnecessarily.\n\nLesson Learnt: When the going is good, everyone is your ‘friend’. When hardships, especially financial come about, each one is on his own. So, learn to save, save, save.\n\nBTW, I couldn’t pay for the course and my graduation was delayed by a semester.\n\nContinuing from earlier, after wasting a couple of years trying to start a business, I set myself up again, with a fresh education (MBA), followed by a campus interview at a very reputed Co and started earning. This was 2005.\n\nSince I was single at the time and my expenses were limited, I was saving (but not investing) sufficiently. I used to leave money in fixed deposits and recurring deposits. One day, a friend of mine (classmate from MBA) introduced me to investments in stocks and said that they are ‘money minting’ machines and easy money.\n\nI was a graduate of operations & marketing, with limited knowledge of finance. I didn’t even understand a financial statement thoroughly, and I relied on stock tips from everyone to buy shares of companies, traded severely and hardly made any profit. Then some ‘wise’ people told me that I need to invest, hold and then only I can see good gains. As part of that philosophy, I was ‘advised’ to buy Unitech, which I think I bought around Rs. 450 or so, everyone knows that happened after the global financial crisis of 2008. I had many stocks like this, which lost as much as 80% in no time and haven’t made a come back.\n\nIn less than 6–8 months of investing, I lost 3 years of earnings/savings - completely wiped clean.\n\nLesson Learnt: Never, ever, trust anyone for your investments. No one is looking out for your well-being, anytime. They are only good for gossip, not for serious investment advice.\n\nSummary till now, worked for 10 years between 1998 - 2009, but Zero saved, Zero wealth built.\n\nSince 2009, having learnt sufficient lessons, I made a lot of changes.\n\nI stopped spending on others unnecessarily - none of my friends in the 4 decades of my life, helped me or offered any worthwhile advice/support, while they kept enjoying mine as well as my parent’s money.\nI invested my money, time & effort in understanding businesses, economic as well as internal and external factors that affect investments, returns in general.\nI started allocating my savings into various pockets - PPF, FD, mutual funds, stocks, bonds etc in a slow and steady manner.\nI learnt not to be perturbed by market corrections which have no rhyme or reason, but to study the situation and take appropriate decisions, or at times, NOT to take any decisions.\n\nOver a 5 year period, between 2009 - 2014, I saved quite a bit, invested most of it, accumulated sizable portfolio of diversified investments. But, was that the end of my mistakes?\n\nNo, no, not at all.\n\nRemember Dr. Strange’s words to Tony Stark in The Avengers: Infinity War? “I see only 1 possible victorious outcome, out of a possible 14,000,605 future outcomes”.\n\nLesson learnt: Taking a fresh path is not an explicit indication of a rose-petal-paved journey. New paths give rise to new issues.\n\nIn 2014, I quit an amazing job (Take home monthly salary was Rs. 300,000) to pursue entrepreneurship again. This time, I had enough capital, network, business idea and everything going in my favor. How it failed and all is another story, but getting back to the point of financial mistakes.\n\nI used to do so much research on companies, that on any given day, I could identify 2–3 stocks which were cheap, with average financials & un-leveraged balance sheets, which could do amazingly well if the tide turned in their favor.\n\nI had conviction on all of them but I had a different problem - problem of aplenty. So I bought most of them (>25 companies) but spread out in small quantities. At that time, I didn’t think it was a mistake, but, after what happened in the stock market over the last 16 months or so, I feel disappointed.\n\nWhy? I wanted to invest in all of them, but I knew I couldn’t get sizable quantities in all of them due to insufficient capital. So, whatever stocks I bought in during the years 2014–15–16–17, out of them,\n\nstocks which have risen by 3X, 4X, 5X, 10X and fallen now to 2014, 15 levels, I have in large quantities, making my returns negligible (after holding for so long but at Zero Cost). Many of them hit my stop loss (purchase prices) in recent times and had to sell them at cost - Meghmani, Tata Global, Fineotex, Marksans Pharma & many more. Take the example of Bombay Burmah - I invested at Rs. 817 in 2017 (picked the stock at the right time), then the stock went on to hit Rs. 2115 (didn’t sell - Long term investing theory) and is now back at Rs. 1181. What is the use of investing!\n\nLesson Learnt: Need to sell and take profits at regular intervals, on a continuous basis. There is nothing called invest and forget. It is invest, review, take profit, invest, review, take profit, and repeat the exercise regularly.\n\nStocks which have risen well & which continue to do well, I have in small quantities and haven’t been able to add more, in a timely manner. So, even if the gains are great, the quantities are small, where the absolute returns missed a chance to be awesome. For eg: Look at Bajaj Finance, my original investment was much earlier, but after making money buying & selling so many times, I finally stayed invested in 2016 with 300 shares at a price of Rs. 860. Today, the stock is at Rs. 2700.\n\nInstead of buying 750 shares of Suven LifeSciences at Rs. 174.50 in Sep 2014, I could have bought Bajaj Finance 503 shares additionally, at a price of Rs. 260 for the same investment amount.\n\nToday, instead of having a paltry Rs. 29,588 as profit on Suven, I could have had Rs. 12,27,320 as profit (by investing in Bajaj Finance).\n\nLesson Learnt: Never spread yourself or your capital too thin. If you have conviction, then go full steam ahead, with periodic reviews.\n\nThere is an irony in my investments too. While investing for myself, I made these mistakes, whereas whenever my father or siblings or family members sought my views on buying/selling & investment prices, times, I have given them excellent opinions and they have been able to make superb gains. Unfortunately, I seem to be lazy or inertial when it comes to doing it on my own (Ofcourse, one of the reasons has been lack of sufficient capital, another reason is that I am away at times on consulting projects & miss taking action at the right time & missed the proverbial bus).\n\nDo remember: Mistakes might be small but the depth & duration of an impact can last a life time!\n\nSo, as you can see, it is difficult to judge which is a bigger mistake and my list of mistakes continue. They are more than a mile long and I continue to make newer and newer mistakes, consistently & constantly.\n\nBut that hasn’t stopped my learning process and have sincerely tried not to repeat the same mistakes again! Like I said, my life has been a bouquet of mistakes, many in the financial arena & hence, continue to still try my best to build wealth, while I could have retired by now!\n\nKarma in progress!\n\nImage credits: Author’s Moneycontrol Portfolio Manager.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.4555
Dheeraj Jain,Updated 4y,What important financial rule do most people break?,"A friend of mine recently bought a BMW 3 series that costs approx Rs 50 lakhs

Everyone in our group was crazily congratulating him and his Facebook post was full of congratulatory comments.

He was happy as hell in his success

This is the biggest financial mistake that people make, Buying things that they don’t need, for the sake of social prestige, impulse emotions and show off

The ecstasy of a depreciating asset is momentary

But the pain of the Rs 75,000/month EMI that he would be paying for the next 8 years is going to be permanent, which is exactly half his monthly salary

Half the salary on Car EMI ?

Its not a mistake, its financial suicide that is becoming so mainstream

After paying 75k for 8 years, what will be the value of his prized possession ?

20 % maybe

Which effectively means 40 lakh rupees of hard earned money blown away in thin air

The most Important financial rule that people break requires no Knowledge of finance

Prajwal,4y,Why is investment important for the future?,"This is Vijayalakshmi.

She is a famous South Indian actress. She has acted in around 37 movies including Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.

She has acted with almost all the big names of every South Indian film industry like Vishnuvardhan, Shivarajkumar, Raghavendra Rajkumar, Upendra, Mohan Lal, Vijay, Suriya, Arjun Sarja and so on.

She has also acted in a number of serials and hosted quite a few successful game shows.

Basically, every South Indian movie buff would be quite familiar with her.

Today, she is admitted in a hospital and is seeking monetary help from anyone she can. She says she doesn’t even have a house to go back to.

What happened?

How did such a successful actress fall from her grace?

Simple. When you are riding the high horse, you wouldn’t think of what would happen if the saddle comes loose. Basically, no investment for the future.

Sure, an actress has to splurge a considerable amount of money in terms of fashion and status to keep herself employable. But what happens when you are no more employable?

This situation can be averted by judicial investment of your finances.

A supporting actor for a serial today is paid around 3000 per episode excluding food and transport. So the main character will be obviously paid at least twice of that. For simplicity sake, lets consider it as 6000. Multiply that with 500 episodes (one of her serials ran for 845 episodes). 30 lakh rupees. And this is a conservative estimate. Main actresses get paid a lot more than that.

A 30lac investment over a period of 10 years in an SBI mutual fund would have generated 94lacs!

She is crying and blaming all her co stars that no one is helping her. They probably should, but how can you think that they owe you something?

Hopefully she gets better and gets back to the stardom she had achieved and this time build a better future.

And that’s why investment is important.

Barrie Levine,Updated 4y,What was life like in 2008?,"Ten years ago, another lifetime.

I was in my early sixties. Feeling healthy, immortal.

Married for thirty five beautiful years.

Managing a full caseload and court schedule of divorces and mediations.

My husband PAUL operated a busy beauty salon, master of the precision haircut and raconteur extraordinaire, another secret of his success.

I visited my elderly mom Rose three times a week, buying groceries, doing laundry, then bringing her home for a weekend stay when meals were not served at her senior residence.

I texted daily with my legal mentor and Best Friend Forever, Neila.

The seasons unfolded as they usually did in New England, a brutal winter with blizzards and power outages, then spring a long time coming, summer lush and bright with vegetables filling the garden and then the salad bowl, autumn deeply colorful from the backyard to the mountains in northern Vermont.

Ten years later, in 2018, my life is unrecognizable.

I am into my seventies, widowed.

My law practice no more. Of all the work/family balancing acts I successfully achieved early on—raising children and building my career—it didn’t work this time. Retirement didn’t turn into financial security and going on cruises. Necessity meant setting all else aside to take on the privilege of caregiver to my life partner.

Paul’s shop, the pride and joy of a talented Dorchester boy who quit high school to go to hairdressing school, is closed. He worked mightily to maintain his identity as a hairdresser but a severe dementia disease took him down hard by the end of 2013.

Rose is gone too, but I’ve been told that is in the natural scheme of things. Her sweet and loving nature was so powerful that it casts a warm and gentle light over my life to this day. She told me not to double down on grief on her account. I respected her wisdom and carried out her wish for me.

Neila died last year due to a freak accident on a cruise ship near Puerto Rico. She shepherded me through tough times when grief was on my daily plate. Who will help me next time?

But the distinct seasons play out, same as they did in 2008.

Today I am in New York City on a crisp autumn morning, walking with my SIL, daughter, and little grandson in Riverside Park, along the Hudson.

The wide paths lined with shade trees and wrought-iron framed park benches remind me of Paris. Central Park not our venue today as it is crowded with spectators waiting for the marathon runners.

So much that is irreplaceable has been taken away from me in the past ten years.

Yet much has been added too. Called upon to deal with loss, resilience has been my gift.

Letting in memory, acceptance, and gratitude eventually conquered the dark and hopeless days when healing seemed unattainable, for a long time only a foreign concept to me.

Blessed with a sweet grandson, an unexpected new relationship, and a perfect autumn day in New York City, I open my heart again.

I feel like a cat who has claimed one more of its nine lives.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/inm92bk1at3ugr0o', 'title': 'What was life like in 2008?', 'score': {'original': 0.49715, 'ai': 0.50285}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Ten years ago, another lifetime.\n\nI was in my early sixties.

Swatanshu Shekhar Singh,3y,Do you know any particular great person about whom you have hardly heard before?,"One day a woman came to meet Jawaharlal Nehru and gave him a notebook and a bag. When Nehru opened that bag, it had 35 lakh rupees in it and there was a full account of the rupees in that notebook.

That amount was the capital of the Congress organization. The woman's father used to keep accounts for this. After her father's death, the woman gave that amount to Nehru without keeping a single rupee with her and she went to her house.

That woman who always travelled in the general class coaches of the railways, and wearing her handmade clothes.

She was a woman - long forgotten after independence - daughter of the great leader of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel - ""Maniben patel""

These are immortal symbols of independence. Patel has done selfless service to the nation and it was the invaluable jewel for our country.

Michael W.,1y,Why did RadioShack go bankrupt?,"Radio Shack was the place to go for hobbyists - they sold electronic parts of all kinds, and not just for the hobbyist who was soldering things together. If you needed a COAX extension cable for your TV, that was just about the only place to go.

That “only place to go” gave the stores - the parent company - an overinflated sense of self. They sold “Realistic” brand stereo equipment at prices that were comparable to the name brands of the day. People tended to only buy it when it was on sale, or when taking advantage of the store’s layaway or payment plan options.

But I will never forget walking into Radio Shack here in Canada in 1990, and asking for a box of 3.5″ HD 1.44MB floppy disks. At the time, they were running anywhere between $35 and $45 for a box of 10, with SONY branded disks being the most expensive, but having an over-the-counter warranty for exchange on any defective floppy.

Radio Shack wanted $100 for a box of 10 “Tandy” brand 3.5″ HD disks. More than double the best name brand out there. The clerk at the counter made it sound like they were jumping off the shelves. So much so that they didn’t even stock any other brands.

But dealing with Radio Shack became difficult. They wanted your name and address on any purchase including small cash purchases, and they peddled an extended warranty on everything, including individually packaged batteries. Imagine being offered a warranty on a $3 watch battery - one that is identical to every other battery. How do you expect to get a refund or replacement on a battery, that is expected to wear out, when it’s not uniquely identifiable?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/guwei54l9hpta0f3', 'title': 'Why did RadioShack go bankrupt?', 'score': {'original': 0.9983, 'ai': 0.0017}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Radio Shack was the place to go for hobbyists - they sold electronic parts of all kinds, and not just for the hobbyist who was soldering things together.

Kevin Riemer,Updated 7y,"Has a bank teller ever made a mistake with your deposit, and are there any security measures banks take to ensure accuracy with such transactions?","I was about 20. I noticed that I had $175,000 in my bank account. Went to a teller:

Me: I think someone made a mistake in a bank deposit.
Teller: We are a Bank, we never make mistakes of that sort!
Me: I am pretty sure there is an error.
Teller: It is so improbable as to be a virtual impossibility.
Me: As I said, I’m pretty sure there is an error; this is my checking account, and I would never deposit $175,000 in my checking account.
Teller (red faced): Let me check on that sir.

Edit:

In my mind, honesty was not my only motivation. I believed, and still do, that at some point in time, the error would have been realized, and I would have had to pay the money, with interest, back. Also, I had recently received my Canadian landed immigrant status, and was hyper-vigilant (paranoid) about not getting involved with the police, to the point that I did not dispose of my cigarette butts on the streets.

Doug Armey,4y,"When a stock market crashes and everyone is desperately selling, who is actually willing to buy?","I am. And thrilled to.

Of course, I’ve been accused of being a little off kilter, too.

2009, in the Great Recession, investors fled the stock market like rats off a burning boat.

They couldn’t sell fast enough.

Pundits cried, “It’s the end of the financial world. Get out while you can. Buy gold.”

I fielded phone calls morning to night from scared clients. I did my best to convince them not to bail.

Most followed my advice. A couple of them jumped overboard right at the height of the hurricane.

If you didn’t live through it as an investor you just can’t comprehend how frightening it was. And the level of panic that engulfed the markets.

In the midst of the carnage I analyzed underlying values. Stock prices had been decimated. But earnings of most large companies were fine. Their prices had plummeted and their values skyrocketed.

The stock market was like Macy’s having the “White Sale of the Century.”

Warren Buffett announced he was buying stocks.

He was asked, “Aren’t you worried they could go down more?

He replied, “Sure, prices might go down more. But they’re cheap now. Eventually they’ll go up.”

And every month I maxed out my 401k and bought stocks, also.

Me and Uncle Warren together. Of course, he has no idea that I’m his self adopted nephew.

Kind of like buying patio furniture on sale during a winter blizzard. I know spring is coming and it’s cheap now.

I look back at those investments and they’re some of the best I’ve ever made. They’ve increased exponentially.

And I’m giddy every time Macy’s has another “White Sale”. I load up on bargains again.

Of course, I’ve been accused of being a little off kilter.

Charlotte Vogel,Updated Oct 10,What are the biggest money secrets that rich people keep from us?,"It’s common knowledge that millionaires handle their money differently than many, but what’s their secret? I’ve come to discover that the super wealthy have a different set of beliefs, philosophies and strategies. Their secret to getting rich isn’t merely in the mechanics of money; rather, in their values and level of thinking.

These are some of the secrets the rich adopt that you can also put into practice in your own life;

The rich get richer by saving and investing early then using that money to make even more money for themselves. While this is true, those who invest online without exercising due diligence usually lose their money in the process. In most cases, said stolen investment can be retrieved when you employ the proficiency of authorities like Scamreveal/net as they have a record of mitigating the influence of fraudulent practices and reversing situations that would have otherwise resulted in financial setbacks.
Millionaires don’t always look like millionaires. That’s because they spend their money modestly instead of pretentiously. Think crockpot meals at home instead of trendy restaurant dinners, a 28-cent cup of coffee from home instead of a $4.95 Starbucks grande mocha.
If you use a credit card for convenience and emergencies, be sure to pay it off every month. The average person owes $4,717 in credit card debt. And the average interest rate on credit cards is 15 percent. If you paid the minimum payment of $189 every month for 10 years, you’d end up paying $18,155 in interest. Pay off the balance right away and you get that extra $18,155 in your pocket.
Spend some time thinking about your future goals. Maybe you’re hoping to travel, send your kids to college, retire comfortably or all of the above. Just remember that a little short-term sacrifice can pay big dividends in the future. With your goals in mind and some figures to work with, a retirement savings calculator can give you a better understanding of what you’ll need to meet your future financial goals.

Achieving massive goals is never a walk in the park. Those who push forward get rewarded. Consider making a list of five things you must do today that may be uncomfortable, but will get you a few steps closer to great wealth.

Good luck.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cszxg6m8uf1boj47', 'title': 'What are the biggest money secrets that rich people keep from us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9918, 'ai': 0.0082}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It’s common knowledge that millionaires handle their money differently than many, but what’s their secret?

Jonathan Jones,Updated 6y,"What are some cool unknown facts and stories from Wall Street, investment banking, and hedge funds in general. or about execs and other known figures?","Some years ago, I was responsible for Goldman Sachs’s recruiting program at Harvard College. Throughout the fall, I would travel back and forth to Cambridge, week in and week out, for events, interviews and other recruiting-related activities in and around the school.

As a result of all that time spent on campus, I would typically get to know some of the students interested in our firm quite well. They tended to show up at all the events, after all.

One of them was a particularly promising candidate for Goldman’s sales & trading internship program. Having come through many of the events I ran at Harvard that year and then successfully navigating the first round interview on campus in January, he….went dark. Members of our team tried a number of times to reach him by phone and email but heard nothing.

At around this time, I was due to go back to Harvard for an event of some sort, so the team back in New York asked me if I could somehow try to track him down and see if we could get him down to our office for his ‘superday’ (final round interview). I duly agreed and headed to campus.

Several hours later I happened to be sitting in the lounge at one of Harvard’s final clubs at the invitation of another student I knew. And who should walk in but the very candidate we’d been trying to reach.

He looked distinctly frazzled, like someone who had been through some intense or stressful experience recently. Or a walking unmade bed.

“Eduardo, hi!” I said. “What’s up? You’re a very hard guy to get hold of.”

“I’m so sorry,” he replied. “It’s just that some buddies and me had this business idea and we launched it a couple of nights ago. And it’s been completely crazy since then. I haven’t slept in three days. I know I need to call you guys back, and…I promise I’ll do that soon.”

I told him not to worry and that we’d look forward to hearing from him soon.

Some time went by without word from him. Then, just when we figured he was done, he called out of the blue and politely withdrew his candidacy, mentioning that he had decided to spend the summer in Palo Alto working on this business idea with his friends.

I thought it seemed a rather rash decision, frankly. Turning down the opportunity of a prestigious summer internship to work on some random startup?

But it turned out that he most certainly had the last laugh. Because that was Eduardo Saverin, who is now worth over $10 billion. It was February 2004, and his friends were Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz and others.

Aviral Bhatnagar,5y,What's your best piece of advice?,"Minimize the number of times you make decisions, every day

I’ve found this to be highly useful, but something few people talk about - largely because people don’t even realize they are doing it.

Decision making is one of our most mentally taxing activities and can add to undue stress. Most of us don’t realize how many decisions we end up making in a day, and it is an unnoticed drain on bodily resources.

We face decisions from the innocuous “what do I wear today?”, to the more pertinent “what do I do now?”, to the impactful “where do I take my life next?”. I have gone through these feelings of being frozen, and immobile, because you’re stuck with deciding what do next.

How do you minimize the number of decisions you make every day? You bunch together similar types of decisions in dedicated time slots.

How do you resolve “what do I wear today”? Spend 30 minutes once a week to decide, and organize your wardrobe. How do you resolve “what do I do now?”. Spend 60 minutes at the beginning of the week to decide, and put it on your calendar. How do you resolve “where do I take my life next”? Spend dedicated time once a quarter to meditate on this question.

This can be literally extended to everything you do. Should you reply to a just arrived email or not? Dedicate time every day to decide on email behaviour. Should you eat something or not? Decide at the beginning of the week. And so on.

What this allows us to do is become incredibly productive. We get focused on the action of the task, rather than the inaction of decision making. There are obviously decisions that need to be taken within a certain period of time, but those are few. The regular decisions go from being instinctive and emotional to being well thought out and objective.

Avoid life’s drama of decision making.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6ltfdsg0cz53x9wu', 'title': ""What's your best piece of advice?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Minimize the number of times you make decisions, every day\n\nI’ve found this to be highly useful, but something few people talk about - largely because people don’t even realize they are doing it.\n\nDecision making is one of our most mentally taxing activities and can add to undue stress.

Ross.Lederhman,6y,What does a quantitative research role at a quant hedge fund entail?,"Math and programming go hand in hand in a way. I'll provide an example I've had to model in the past as a quant.

In one of my first jobs I had to model a basic PGP algorithm. This is an asset allocation model which picks up the ideal allocation based on mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis which could be used for live trading:

That needed to be optimised (you obviously want max mean, low variance, high skewness and low kurtosis).

You bring this together in 1 function (P6) and allow the investor to seek his own preference for one of the four moments of distribution:

At the time, the maths was easy to understand, how to model this in MATLAB was not so straightforward (dimension curse given you worked with higher moments became a real pain), but more important was to get the simple minimum of the constrained nonlinear multivariable function. At the time I didn't know this could be achieved through the fmincon function in MATLAB:

I simply found this out by trial and error. Plus Google is your friend. The only thing is that you have to convince your boss in the team of why you are using certain functions. For this particular one, I was the junior, and all I had to convince was my senior. He was more than happy when he saw the finalised script.

When you finally got to a proper working model for the bank, you obviously needed a risk adjusted performance metric. Modelling the Sharpe ratio is 1st year BSc work, but given you work with higher moments, a Sharpe ratio means nothing. Hence you had to look further. I eventually used the Stutzer index:

And the omega ratio:

As both give a better idea of risk adjusted performance than Sharpe ratio. When you start to program this in Matlab, it's simply trying to convert maths in to a programming language. It's not rocket science. Ultimately you should be able to convert all maths you to know to a few pieces of code. We had to add one utility function to “academically” justify and compare our earlier results:

We gave a presentation, model got approved by management and started to pitch it to clients.

Ultimately you see that you should be able to convert all maths into lines of code. That's the easy part. The tricky part is to then refine your code to make it run more efficiently, less computing time, and so forth. The real struggle comes at that point, but you are not expected to know all that when you start. Hope all of this gave some insight.

Craig Fechter,5y,What is a financial rule you will never break?,"Never, ever over-commit yourself to fixed lifestyle choices.

As a practicing tax CPA I get to often examine the lifestyle choices that clients and potential clients have made. While much of the time I have no idea how much clients spend on a day to day basis, what I can see are the most expensive fixed lifestyle choices people make -

Cost and size of housing
Transportation choices

Much of the time most people live their lives today as if the circumstances they find themselves in will never change. It’s especially easy to forget financial pain when the goings are good, even with the recent severe recession still in the rear view mirror.

After having spent 17 years analyzing many aspects of personal finance, the worst choices people make are in regards to fixed lifestyle choices. As in, deciding and committing yourself to situations that you cannot easily change.

My family and I enjoy going to Disneyland. A lot. Most of our friends think we are crazy. We end up spending a bit too much each year visiting there, but in the end if our personal economic situation were to ever change and we were no longer able to afford it, we could simply stop going to Disneyland.

In the summer times we end up sending our kids to some pretty cool day camps, such as “ranch camp” where our 10 and 7 year old daughters were able to ride horses and help tend to a ranch every day for 8 hours. It included even picking up horse poop! It was a blast for them and I’m glad we were able to afford it. In the end, though, if things ever changed we could simply stop sending our kids to these types of camps.

Fixed lifestyle choices, however, are different. The choice of the house you buy and where you live can dramatically impact your month to month expenses. I know of a family who recently chose to relocate from a city to a suburb which will take the breadwinner’s commute from 7 miles per day to over 30. IN addition the house is in a more expensive part of the region so overall, this life style choice will cost the family 800 more per month. While the goings are good this is not a huge concern but should things ever tighten up the extra money each month to buy a nicer house in a more expensive part of town will prove difficult to undo.

And this is nothing to say of transportation options - I see people buy cars for 50k when a car for 20k would do - while cars do retain equity much better than they have in the preceding decades, buying the more expensive car is a true sunk cost that you will never, ever get back. In addition to that, the monthly payment for the time period you have it is also FIXED which can’t be gotten out of without selling the car or defaulting.

So yeah - the financial rule I will never break is that of over-committing our family to fixed lifestyle choices that may go beyond our means should our economic circumstances ever change. We live in an older home in a modest neighborhood and we drive cars several notches below where we could if we wanted to be super cool, but the freedom we have bought ourselves through doing so is priceless.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nk8xmsaj0hw5podv', 'title': 'What is a financial rule you will never break?', 'score': {'original': 0.93615, 'ai': 0.06385}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Never, ever over-commit yourself to fixed lifestyle choices.\n\nAs a practicing tax CPA I get to often examine the lifestyle choices that clients and potential clients have made.

Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund,4y,What is the difference between mutual funds and bank deposits?,"Bank deposits or fixed deposits are a more traditional way of investing. Here is a comparison between mutual funds and traditional instruments.

Returns-

The returns in an FD are fixed. Irrespective of the market situation, you shall earn a fixed interest on your funds. In comparison, mutual funds returns are dynamic in nature and thus, they can provide the investor with an opportunity to earn potentially higher returns over a period of time. Also, depending on the type of the Scheme you are invested in, your rate of return might differ as compared to that of an FD.

Lock-in period/Liquidity-

Even though, FDs now come with flexible maturity periods; premature withdrawals might cost you a penalty. Most Mutual Funds (except ELSS funds) do not come with a lock-in period. However some mutual funds schemes have an exit load charged if the redemption is made before a certain stipulated time. Hence, you may compare the charges.

Taxation-

Mutual funds are taxed basis your holding period- long-term capital gain and short-term capital gain. The definition of long-term and short-term may vary with the type of fund you are invested in. There are also indexation benefits to avail that might help you reduce the tax you pay. Usually, LTCG on equity funds is taxed at 10% if your gain is above Rs 1 lac and STCG is taxed at 15% without indexation. However, for a bank deposit, every penny earned becomes your income and is taxed as per the tax slab you qualify to be in.

If your reason to invest is low risk, you may want to invest in liquid funds or short-duration funds that are basically debt funds and come with relatively lower risk and higher liquidity. However, if you are willing to invest for a longer horizon, you can also include some equity-oriented funds in your portfolio that might give you access to comparatively higher returns than debt funds.

Bradley Betts,Updated 2y,Which billionaires have their billions in cold cash? Is that even possible?,"Which billionaires have their billions in cold cash? Is that even possible?

None of them.

It is possible to have $1 billion in cash, but… well, recently an Austrian artist created an artwork
 which consists simply of $1 billion in $100 notes stacked on pallets. It looks like this:

And that’s in hundreds; a note that is difficult enough to change that they’re a pain in the arse to carry. Imagine what it would look like in useful notes.

Billionaires don’t literally have a billion dollars in cash, or even in the bank. A billionaire is someone whose net worth equals 1 billion dollars or more.

In reality that money is tied up in assets. Jeff Bezos for example is worth $189.2 billion, but that’s because he owns a controlling share of Amazon… which is valued at $1.7 trillion.

In other words, if Jeff Bezos sold his shares in Amazon and everything else he owned, then he would have 189.2 billion dollars. But he doesn’t have it right now.

This isn’t unusual. Most people’s net worth is tied up in assets, such as a house or a car. If you own a $500k house and a $30k car and have $10k in the bank and have no debt then you’re worth $540,000. But you still only have $10k in the bank, and you sure as hell don’t have your net worth stashed under your mattress in cold hard cash.

It’s the same for billionaires.

But you still only have $10k in the bank, and you sure as hell don’t have your net worth stashed under your mattress in cold hard cash.\n\nIt’s the same for billionaires.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis answer is not for monetisation.

Vijar Kohli,3y,Is it worth buying a Lamborghini or is there a fancier status symbol out there?,"Unless you are an enthusiast it is not worth buying a Lamborghini. The maintenance costs alone will eat you alive. They will be enough to support a small family in a developing nation.

Exotic cars are beautiful and fun to drive. Top cars like the Lamborghini Huracan are high performance everyday cars. But they come at a cost.

Everyone is watching you - from strangers to cop cars.

Plus each of these cars are molded for racing. They are uncomfortable for long drives. They can be hard to get in and out for many people.

Do yourself a favor and rent one. Go on Turo and visit an exotic car rental dealership.

For example, I rented this Porsche while speaking at a conference in California one time. It cost $150 for the day and was an absolute blast. It was better than staying in a hotel and a lot more fun. Even in the rain.

Another time in NYC I approached the Ferrari dealership for a weekend rental. This doesn’t happen often...

Abinash Mishra,Updated 2y,What was the biggest decision taken by you that changed your life?,"Keeping patience in the most difficult circumstance when you are almost about to give up. Its not easy. Not at all easy. But ‘often it gives good results.

Just after 12th I could not get selected in CPMT ( NEET now). I was aspiring for a Career in Medicine and expecting a good rank & medical college . But i could not. But out of nowhere i got a good rank in AIEEE ( that time instead of IIT mains Advanced AIEEE was for NITs)& got a premier NIT then. But then i decided to take a drop and choose between Medicine or IIT and i chose IIT and eventually cracked it. Probably God was extra merciful that year. I cracked medical too.

Same situation appeared again. I failed unexpectedly in UPSC. I was about to quit. I had a good offer from an Ed Tech giant. Life was in turmoil: personal and professional both and then i took a hard stand. I chose to give one more shot in UPSC and cleared it.

Ian Williams,4y,Do bankers treat you differently if your bank account has a large balance?,"Oh boy do they! I worked for a year in the City of London in a small investment bank. My job was to make payments to suppliers on behalf of our customers. Not something investment banks normally do, but it paid well so I didn't care. I don't know why we did it and not them, but I guess there was some mechanism in play which meant it was cheaper to pay us to do it.

I would get an invoice, confirm with the client and the supplier, cut a cheque, get it countersigned if above a certain amount and send it off to the supplier. Sometimes we would do it electronically, but for record keeping, we would still cut a cheque and stamp it with a big “Electronic Payment” stamp. The cheque was stapled to our copy of the invoice and filed once the payment was made.

Our main client was Iran Khodro, the largest car manufacturer in the middle east. Because of this company, I learned that very few manufacturers make their own vehicles, and those that do, also subcontract building them in certain regions to other companies. IK was one of those companies, but they also made their own branded cars and trucks.

A lot of our payments were made in US dollars, because that's what the invoice requested. We actually kept payment balances in many different currencies as we were making payments to suppliers all over the world.

When the US first placed financial sanctions on Iran, we were banned from using the US dollar to make payments. Our dollar payment account was all but useless. I requested a bankers draft in Euros for the full amount in our Dollar account at that days interbank exchange rate from our relationship manager because they refused to transfer the money into another account without a massive pile of paperwork we could provide, but I couldn't be bothered to fill out. The draft was a little under €9 billion. At the time we banked with HSBC. Their main branch was a few minutes walk from our building. I walked into the branch, one of the oldest in the City, with it's almost Victorian interior and stood in line, just another city worker in a cheap suit.

When it was my turn to see a teller, I mentioned I was depositing a large amount and wanted to speak with the manager to make sure it was all done properly. We'd had some problems with theft internally and I was paranoid something would go wrong and we'd lose €9b, for which I would get the blame. She told me I could do it at the counter, but I was insistent. She obviously clocked the cheap suit, the even cheaper digital watch and the general “this guy's got no money” air about me and decided I wasn't worth the managers time.

I gave her our GBP account number, which held a balance of a few billion pounds. She was still suspicious and tried to get me to answer security questions. When was the account opened? No idea. Who opened it? Not a clue. What was the last payment made from the account? Honestly can't remember as we rarely used it. I reminded her it was a business account and I doubt anyone at the company could answer those questions. I also told her to check the signatories on the account, of which I was one. I gave my company ID and my driving licence as proof of who I was, both of which also contained my signature, which was obviously also on file.

I was getting quite pissed off at her attitude so I rather loudly demanded a manager immediately. A man came running from behind a desk almost immediately and asked me what was wrong. I told him I wanted to make a deposit, that I had proven who I was and that this officious little woman didn't think I was worth dealing with. He took me into a private waiting area and the manager saw me shortly afterwards. Sat at his desk I made a complaint about the woman teller, then pushed an envelope across his desk. On it was written our Euro account number and inside was the draft. You could tell he thought I was wasting his time until he opened the envelope and saw the amount on the cheque.

Once he had the cheque in his hands it was all “I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience, Mr Williams”, “is there anything else I can do for you, Mr Williams?”, “Can I offer you a drink, Mr Williams”. If his nose could have been any further up my arse it would have been indecent.

Every time I went in after that I was given the absolute best service. I never had to stand in the queue, I was welcomed by name as I walked in, I had full use of the private banking lounge etc. Here I was, a lowly city worker on £35k a year and I was being treated like a billionaire. I usually only went in there to cash a cheque for £500 a time for petty cash in the office, but I was treated like Royalty until I left the job.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lczaxb287oipt4je', 'title': 'Do bankers treat you differently if your bank account has a large balance?', 'score': {'original': 0.29695, 'ai': 0.70305}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Oh boy do they!

Ankur Gupta,Updated 9y,How do I decide between a career in finance and consultancy?,"There's a quantitative way to help you make a choice.

Due to the absence of details, I will try to provide a generalized answer.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of fields in Finance – Trading, Investment Banking, Corporate Finance, Commercial Banking, Hedge Funds, Insurance, etc. (Financial Career Options For Professionals
)

The following are my assumptions for your answer –
1) Top firms will represent the 2 domains – McKinsey, Bain, BCG for Consulting and GS, JPM, Morgan Stanley for Finance
2) For Finance, let’s assume that the fields in consideration are Investment Banking and Trading (as per your comment on the question)
3) In both cases, back-end roles like analysts, research associates, etc. will be ignored. Representative roles of a client-facing Consultant, IBanker, and a Trader will be considered. This implicitly assumes that such roles are available to you.


Another huge advantage of consulting is that if you aren't sure about which industry to choose for your career from a long term perspective, you can work on projects in various sectors/industries and then make a much more informed choice.

If you are an alpha male/female who wants the adrenaline rush, power, a penthouse at SoHo with a collection of sports cars that you can drive up to your 83rd Floor office on the Wall Street, then Trading/I-Banking is the way to go for you.

Now that you have a rough flavor of the options, it’s time to make a choice.

You could go in with a gut feeling. But a decision based on quantitative analysis is always better.

The best tool in such situations is what we call a BVOA – Best Value Option Analysis. This is how it works -

1) Step 1 – List down all the parameters that are important to you in a job
2) Step 2 – Assign weights according to your personal preferences
3) Step 3 – Assign scores to each option on each attribute (say out of 5)
4) Step 4 – Sum up the weighted scores. The highest score wins.

Here’s a sample if I were to decide between the 3 options based on my personal preferences.

Hence, for me, given my personal preferences, Consulting is a clear winner. You can also tinker with the weights to do a sensitivity analysis to check if your results changes.

To help you with choosing factors and assigning weights, let me introduce you to a chart showing a combination of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg’s Two-Factor Model. It explains the hierarchy of factors that motivate us in our lives. A big surprise is that money is just a hygiene factor i.e. if absent, it leads to dissatisfaction, but its presence doesn't guarantee satisfaction.

Read up more on the same and choose your factors and their weights wisely.

(Graphic taken from Google. No copyright violation intended)

I hope that you now have a sound basis for making a decision. The methodology is very general and you can use this for making other personal /professional decisions in your life.

Phew! Hope this was helpful.

The highest score wins.\n\nHere’s a sample if I were to decide between the 3 options based on my personal preferences.\n\nHence, for me, given my personal preferences, Consulting is a clear winner. You can also tinker with the weights to do a sensitivity analysis to check if your results changes.\n\nTo help you with choosing factors and assigning weights, let me introduce you to a chart showing a combination of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg’s Two-Factor Model. It explains the hierarchy of factors that motivate us in our lives. A big surprise is that money is just a hygiene factor i.e. if absent, it leads to dissatisfaction, but its presence doesn't guarantee satisfaction.\n\nRead up more on the same and choose your factors and their weights wisely.\n\n(Graphic taken from Google. No copyright violation intended)\n\nI hope that you now have a sound basis for making a decision. The methodology is very general and you can use this for making other personal /professional decisions in your life.\n\nPhew! Hope this was helpful.\n\nGodspeed!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9972

World needs some currency system to handle trade. It can be anything (stones, metals, water, food, etc.). So, why gold? Gold was used by almost all the major civilizations in the world. Can the whole world be crazy for 1000s of years? Here is why gold is golden:





It is extremely dense. Meaning it is easier to carry & handle than a sack of rice or a barrel of oil. In fact, anybody could put their entire family's wealth in a small bag and carry away (in times of crisis, disaster or migration).

It is quite inert and doesn't corrode. Meaning it doesn't lose value. Thus, generations could hand over their gold to their next ones. Can you do that with paper or iron? Can your grandma give her savings in some crumbled notes to you (that her great grandmother gave)? Unless you are a philatelist or history students, those notes will have no worth to you.
It is very easy to test purity anywhere in the world at almost zero cost. How easy is it to test a foreign counterfeit note? How easy is it to value land or diamonds?
The supply of gold is stable across centuries. Very unlikely to produce new mines any time soon. How easy is to print currency & debase value? How likely is to find a newer mine for another metal? No government can cheekily steal your saving's value by increasing production.
Gold has only one grade and thus single pricing. Meaning it is very liquid. If you were to trade in diamonds or oil, you have to deal with myriad range of grades & quality. Can you get the same value for your diamond ring if you were to sell it now at the price you bought it?
Gold is recognized all over the world. This means flexibility and trust. No other material is this recognized across the world. Will your Yuans or Rupees or Reals work this way?
Unlike silver or platinum, gold has very little industrial use (only about 100t annually is used in industries such as semiconductors).

Steven Haddock,3y,What is happening in Wall Street right now?,"The technical term for this is a “short squeeze” and it’s an old stock manipulation strategy based on old stock manipulation strategies. One of these attempts in 1907 almost brought down the United States economy and led to the creation of the Federal Reserve.

Panic of 1907 - Wikipedia

So in case you want more depth, here’s another Wikipedia link to an article about short squeezes and their effect on markets.

Short squeeze - Wikipedia

So let’s start with a “short”. At its heart, a “short” is a bet a stock price will go down. In order to execute a short, you borrow stock from a broker and sell it on the market, pocketing the cash. Technically, you have five days to “close” the transaction with the broker and replace the stock you borrowed. If you can buy the stock back at a lower price, you buy it, give the broker back the stock, and take the profit. However, if you can’t, you lose money.

So let’s take an example with an imaginary stock called “Trump International Corporation” (Ticker symbol TIC). It’s selling for $5 a share but has been trending downwards. Even worse, there’s news in the market that its facing a cash crunch because lots of its debt is coming due and it’s having trouble finding financing.

So, I borrow 1,000 shares from a broker and sell them for $5,000. Over the next five days, TIC falls to $4 a share. I buy the 1,000 shares for $4,000, give them back to the broker and pocket $1,000, minus transaction costs.

However, let’s say the price rises to $6 a share. I have to pay $6,000 to replace the shares so I’m out $1,000 plus transaction costs.

But let’s extrapolate. My maximum upside is $5,000 if the shares fall to zero. However, there’s no maximum price for shares, so my downside is effectively infinite. If TIC rises to $100 a share, I have to pay $100,000 so I’m out $95,000.

The thing is, the broker is unlikely to let it get that far unless I have $95,000 in my account. Long before that they will make a demand for the shares, which means I will have to get out at any cost. I’ve been “squeezed”.

The thing is, you can do this deliberately if there are a lot of short sellers. Now, in theory short sellers can’t sell shares they haven’t borrowed and, since there are a finite number of shares, the number of outstanding shares should theoretically be able to cover all the shorts.

However, people cheat. There’s something called a “naked short”. It’s illegal now, but it’s still possible to sell shares that you don’t possess because you have five days to deliver them under clearing rules.

So, let’s get back to TIC. Let’s say a hedge fund has decided to massively short the stock. They borrow every share they can get their hands on and sell them into the market at $4.50 to $5.00 each. During this frenzy, a few more hedge funds get in on the action. They borrow shares and start selling them too. Now, because the “sold” shares are real shares they can be borrowed too, so they borrow sold shares and sell them too.

So here’s where the squeeze comes in. A few private investors see all the activity in TIC and realize they can buy those shares and “require delivery”. They start buying during the selling frenzy. Because the shares are so cheap, they start to push the price up.

Now, the shorters realize they have to buy the stock back, so the private investors hold onto the stock. That reduces the number of shares available on the market. Because the squeezers have a limited downside (they can only lose the total amount of their investment) they can afford to wait. The price starts to rise. Private investors start to buy more to keep this going. They hold onto that stock too.

If all goes well for the private investors (as it has with shares in Gamestop, AMC and other businesses hurting due to the pandemic) the short sellers find themselves in a negative position that just keeps getting worse. Now the shares hit $6 so all the short sellers are in a negative position. However, when they go to close out, they find there aren’t enough shares in the market available to close out their position. They panic and bid up the price until the private investors feel they’ve made enough profit. This drives up the price and puts other short sellers under pressure. They soon realize that the later they get out, the more it will cost. They also realize that, eventually, the price may rise high enough to wipe them out entirely.

It’s pretty much a stock market panic in reverse, except that investors are desperate to buy instead of sell.

Ironically, people don’t learn. When TIC hits $100 some other short sellers figure that this virtually worthless stock has to collapse soon. They short sell at $100 only to see the price rise to $105 because private investors who bought in at $4 a share are in no hurry to sell. Again, the private investor now has only $4,000 invested and that’s all they can lose. The person selling short at $100 will lose $1 for every share they own for every $1 increase in the price of the stock.

Now, the private investors aren’t stupid. If I buy 1,000 at $4 and the price goes to $8, I sell 500 and I’m guaranteed to break even. I hold onto the other 500 as long as I want knowing that no matter what I do I’m making money. If it goes to $16, I sell another 250 and “lock in” profits and still have 250.

So, what you have right now is private investors who invested very little holding big investors who invested a lot hostage. The underlying value of the shares is very little, but the hedge funds who shorted them need to buy them or die.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b0puz23dcm7xw568', 'title': 'What is happening in Wall Street right now?', 'score': {'original': 0.9972, 'ai': 0.0028}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The technical term for this is a “short squeeze” and it’s an old stock manipulation strategy based on old stock manipulation strategies.

If I buy 1,000 at $4 and the price goes to $8, I sell 500 and I’m guaranteed to break even. I hold onto the other 500 as long as I want knowing that no matter what I do I’m making money.

The underlying value of the shares is very little, but the hedge funds who shorted them need to buy them or die.', 'result': {'fake': 0.9112, 'real': 0.0888}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 11, 'credits': 1981781, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'The technical term for this is a “short squeeze” and it’s an old stock manipulation strategy based on old stock manipulation strategies. One of these attempts in 1907 almost brought down the United States economy and led to the creation of the Federal Reserve.\n\nPanic of 1907 - Wikipedia\n\nSo in case you want more depth, here’s another Wikipedia link to an article about short squeezes and their effect on markets.\n\nShort squeeze - Wikipedia\n\nSo let’s start with a “short”. At its heart, a “short” is a bet a stock price will go down. In order to execute a short, you borrow stock from a broker and sell it on the market, pocketing the cash. Technically, you have five days to “close” the transaction with the broker and replace the stock you borrowed. If you can buy the stock back at a lower price, you buy it, give the broker back the stock, and take the profit. However, if you can’t, you lose money.\n\nSo let’s take an example with an imaginary stock called “Trump International Corporation” (Ticker symbol TIC). It’s selling for $5 a share but has been trending downwards. Even worse, there’s news in the market that its facing a cash crunch because lots of its debt is coming due and it’s having trouble finding financing.\n\nSo, I borrow 1,000 shares from a broker and sell them for $5,000. Over the next five days, TIC falls to $4 a share. I buy the 1,000 shares for $4,000, give them back to the broker and pocket $1,000, minus transaction costs.\n\nHowever, let’s say the price rises to $6 a share. I have to pay $6,000 to replace the shares so I’m out $1,000 plus transaction costs.\n\nBut let’s extrapolate. My maximum upside is $5,000 if the shares fall to zero. However, there’s no maximum price for shares, so my downside is effectively infinite. If TIC rises to $100 a share, I have to pay $100,000 so I’m out $95,000.\n\nThe thing is, the broker is unlikely to let it get that far unless I have $95,000 in my account. Long before that they will make a demand for the shares, which means I will have to get out at any cost. I’ve been “squeezed”.\n\nThe thing is, you can do this deliberately if there are a lot of short sellers. Now, in theory short sellers can’t sell shares they haven’t borrowed and, since there are a finite number of shares, the number of outstanding shares should theoretically be able to cover all the shorts.\n\nHowever, people cheat. There’s something called a “naked short”. It’s illegal now, but it’s still possible to sell shares that you don’t possess because you have five days to deliver them under clearing rules.\n\nSo, let’s get back to TIC. Let’s say a hedge fund has decided to massively short the stock. They borrow every share they can get their hands on and sell them into the market at $4.50 to $5.00 each. During this frenzy, a few more hedge funds get in on the action. They borrow shares and start selling them too. Now, because the “sold” shares are real shares they can be borrowed too, so they borrow sold shares and sell them too.\n\nSo here’s where the squeeze comes in. A few private investors see all the activity in TIC and realize they can buy those shares and “require delivery”. They start buying during the selling frenzy. Because the shares are so cheap, they start to push the price up.\n\nNow, the shorters realize they have to buy the stock back, so the private investors hold onto the stock. That reduces the number of shares available on the market. Because the squeezers have a limited downside (they can only lose the total amount of their investment) they can afford to wait. The price starts to rise. Private investors start to buy more to keep this going. They hold onto that stock too.\n\nIf all goes well for the private investors (as it has with shares in Gamestop, AMC and other businesses hurting due to the pandemic) the short sellers find themselves in a negative position that just keeps getting worse. Now the shares hit $6 so all the short sellers are in a negative position. However, when they go to close out, they find there aren’t enough shares in the market available to close out their position. They panic and bid up the price until the private investors feel they’ve made enough profit. This drives up the price and puts other short sellers under pressure. They soon realize that the later they get out, the more it will cost. They also realize that, eventually, the price may rise high enough to wipe them out entirely.\n\nIt’s pretty much a stock market panic in reverse, except that investors are desperate to buy instead of sell.\n\nIronically, people don’t learn. When TIC hits $100 some other short sellers figure that this virtually worthless stock has to collapse soon. They short sell at $100 only to see the price rise to $105 because private investors who bought in at $4 a share are in no hurry to sell. Again, the private investor now has only $4,000 invested and that’s all they can lose. The person selling short at $100 will lose $1 for every share they own for every $1 increase in the price of the stock.\n\nNow, the private investors aren’t stupid. If I buy 1,000 at $4 and the price goes to $8, I sell 500 and I’m guaranteed to break even. I hold onto the other 500 as long as I want knowing that no matter what I do I’m making money. If it goes to $16, I sell another 250 and “lock in” profits and still have 250.\n\nSo, what you have right now is private investors who invested very little holding big investors who invested a lot hostage.

Jonathan Jones,Updated 5y,Is Larry Fink the most powerful guy on Wall Street?,"You could make a credible argument that he is.

Why?

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with $6.3 trillion (that’s ‘trillion’, with a ‘T’) of client assets under management (AUM). To put that in perspective, that is larger than the GDP of every economy in the world except China and the United States. Granted, that’s not a particularly meaningful statistic but it gives a little taste of just how large that AUM number is.

What does it mean?

It means, as a very practical matter, that if you look at just about every major publicly traded company in the world you’ll find that BlackRock is invariably its first, second or third largest shareholder. Go on, try it

See?

A major reason for this is that BlackRock is one of the largest providers of so-called passive investment products, such as mutual funds and ETFs, which are designed to track indices or predetermined baskets of securities. Consequently, they are obliged to own the stock of many companies in prescribed amounts, calculated to ensure that the fund replicates the underlying index as closely as possible. That, combined with the enormous amount of money they have to put to work, means the positions they take in these stocks are huge.

What that all means is that there is likely no major CEO in the world that Larry can’t get on the phone more or less right away. (As a CEO, when your largest shareholder calls, you tend to pick up).

Pravin Gupta,Dec 15,What is the one piece of advice you would give to anyone?,"Three days ago, a girl messaged me out of nowhere. After a very long time.

I knew her. We had talked before too.

But this time, I sensed something odd. The way she talked…it lacked life.

I asked her if she’s good.

Suppressing my gut feeling, I changed the topic. We talked about each other's professional activities and also a bit about our personal standings.

I again asked her to open up if she isn't okay. She again convinced me she was fine.

Then at a point, my inner voice rebounded. Stronger than ever.

“Be honest, are you good?” I asked with finality.

She broke down. Till half an hour she went on elaborating what was going wrong in her life.

I patiently listened.

A person who did her best to convince me she is doing great suddenly came out as someone standing on the verge of death.

Seriousness of her mental status left me in awe. Couldn't believe it took me three tries before she finally spoke up.

Trust me, by doing this, you won't intrude into his personal life. You won't make him feel uncomfortable.

Ahmed Moor,4y,What is the best way to invest money in the spring of 2019?,"If there was a lesson to be learned in the first quarter, it was the value of staying invested.

More than an investment, cryptocurrencies are an ongoing technology and socioeconomic experiment. As a result, the blockchain space is booming with new opportunities like being able to invest on Platform like Cryptobroker Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptobroker.store) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 30days. With an approximate market cap of $280 billion, rest assured that this industry is here to stay. This new industry is constantly evolving, therefore the earlier you get acquainted with it, the higher your chance are of benefiting from its future development.

The S&P 500 rose 12% through March 28, nearly erasing the gauge’s 14% decline in the three months ending Dec. 31, 2018. That means investors who resisted the urge to sell when U.S. stocks seemed to be careening toward a bear market late last year have now almost recouped those losses, as the S&P 500 is less than 4% below its all-time high.

Staying invested doesn’t mean you need to stay idle, however. Here are some tactical ideas for how to invest money in the second quarter:

IRA all the way

If you ever find yourself in need of a Friday night activity, check out Google search trends for the term IRA for the past several years. You’ll see a noticeable spike leading up to mid-April and then a huge slump thereafter.

The reason is simple: The IRS allows taxpayers to make contributions to an IRA for the prior tax year up until the tax return filing deadline (April 15 this year). Because traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible, people looking for last-minute tax breaks inevitably want to find out all they can about IRAs this time of year — hence, all those Google searches.

Whether or not that cutoff date is a factor for you, don’t forget about this account once April’s over. Instead, devote time this quarter to answering the following questions:

What assets are you invested in and why?
What fees are you paying on investments, and are cheaper alternatives worth considering?
What’s your asset allocation (the mix of various investments you’re invested in), and do you need to make some changes?
What other accounts do you have hanging around (like a 401(k) from a former employer), and should you roll over to an IRA?

These questions may seem a bit underwhelming as an actual investment strategy, but looking under the hood of your IRA will provide valuable insight to make well-informed decisions.

You don’t need to make changes to your IRA just for the sake of it; in fact we’ve outlined some simple portfolios to achieve your retirement goals. But your strategy likely will shift over time, so you may find opportunities to tweak how to invest your money.

For example, if a fund in your portfolio has an expense ratio (management fee) that’s noticeably higher than the rest, you might want to shop around for a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund with a similar investment objective and lower fees. Or, if your target asset allocation is 70% stocks and 30% bonds, and that ratio has shifted, you’ll need to rebalance your portfolio by buying or selling investments to restore it.

Thanks to the tax-related deadline for contributions, there’s a lot of springtime buzz about IRAs, so use it as a reminder to go all-in understanding yours.

Buy in May?

There’s a famous saying on Wall Street: “Sell in May and go away.” The adage suggests investors sell stocks in May and return to the market after September to avoid the less-active summer months when people are on vacation and volatility can spike.

But one of the strongest three-month stretches of the year for the S&P 500 historically is June through August, suggesting investors may want to buy rather than sell in May. Combined, the June-August period has seen cumulative average returns of 2.9% going back to 1928, according to data from Yardeni Research. The only three-month stretch that’s better is November to January.

Some experts anticipate this year could be a historic one for IPO activity, which will bring out new and seasoned investors alike.

At NerdWallet, we generally recommend you don’t try to time the market (bet when it’s peaked or bottomed) and instead regularly add money to your investments with a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging. However, if you’ve got some extra money this spring — from a tax refund, for example — betting that history could repeat itself (could, of course, being the key word) is an opportunity to zig when others zag. Or in this case, buy when other investors sell.

Since that historical data centers on the S&P 500, an easy and low-cost way to implement this strategy is with an ETF that tracks this index. We’ve broken down how to evaluate your options (spoiler alert: there are only three) when buying an S&P 500 ETF.

Finally, the months ahead likely will bring a whole slew of initial public offerings to market, including rideshare companies Uber and Lyft, the latter of which is expected to start trading this week. Some experts anticipate this year could be a historic one for IPO activity, which will bring out new and seasoned investors alike.

Investing in the early days of a new publicly traded company is alluring because of the prospect the stock price will quickly spike higher. As with anything investing-related, however, there are no guarantees, and you should do your research before investing in IPOs and take note of the potential risks.

If you undertake a new investment strategy this quarter, make sure you can afford to lose money on bets that are more speculative, and be mindful of the higher associated trading costs you’ll incur, in addition to tax liabilities.

Checking their trustworthiness is vital because unethical or inept financial advisors can destroy a lifetime of effort and investments, which is emotionally demanding, harmful, and expensive.

Cross-checking planners on two levels is the finest method for locating competent and dependable financial advisors.

● Foresightful

● Patience

Ahmed Moor,4y,Will Ethereum reach $1000 this year due to what is happening in May 2019?,"In light of this skepticism, what factors may come into play to send the price of Ethereum climbing again?

Ethereum’s Inflating Supply
Bitcoin, with its long-term supply cap of 21M coins, has managed to achieve a $1000+ price, which it seems unlikely to ever drop below in the future. Ethereum, on the other hand, currently has 102M coins with 3 new Ether (soon to drop to 2) “minted” every 15 seconds. This forever-inflating supply has been a major criticism of Ethereum’s investment case, yet those who dig a little deeper will find that Ethereum’s supply inflation is not all it seems.

I definitely do increasingly think that in the long run, dropping issuance to zero is a good idea.

The quote above received almost no attention at all.

Given that the supply inflation rate of Ethereum and Bitcoin today is very similar, with Bitcoin trending towards zero over the long-term and Ethereum with a significant chance of doing the same, we can now compare the two assuming a capped supply. On the basis that Ethereum does end up capping the supply of Ether to – let’s say – 110M, what implications does that have on the price? Given equal demand to Bitcoin, with this supply cap we can expect ETH/BTC to sit roughly at 0.2 – or $1300 at today’s prices. Should there be greater demand for Ethereum (which I will argue for below), then the price could well exceed that amount given a fixed supply cap.

Before i continue, let me introduce you to a platform i discovered where you can sell your Bitcoin and other top Cryptocurrencies at the exact rate in dollars any where in the world. The website is IBUYCRYPTO (www.ibuycrypto.store). It is safe and secure. The interesting part of it is that, you don’t have to drop your vital informations before you sell to them. You sell and get your money directly sent to your bank account immediately your deposit is confirmed. You can also sell and request the money is sent to someone else. Thank me later after using this platform.

Network Demand
Ethereum has been rightly criticised for its poor user experience (UX) and high transaction costs; these are two factors which have certainly stifled demand of the platform. However, for the purposes of looking at the price of Ethereum over the long-run, these factors can be largely ignored given their decreasing marginal effect (these problems are organically solved over time). This leaves us looking at the demand of Ether with respect to its applications – are they solving a problem and to what extent? Can decentralized apps bring about a level of demand that would justify a $1,000 Ether?

The main application types that can be built on Ethereum today cover:

Decentralized Governance
Digital Asset Storage
Decentralized Exchange
Gambling

Within each of these categories are a handful of early-stage apps. For Decentralized Governance we have MakerDAO, where users can create the stablecoin DAI by putting up collateral. With Digital Asset Storage we have CryptoKitties and others including the soon to launch GamerToken for storing and trading in-game items. Decentralised Exchange has the likes of IDEX, LocalEthereum and ForkDelta, all providing non-custodial exchange services that provide a clear benefit over their centralized counterparts. And for the Gambling category, the list of apps is the longest; after all this was one of the first obvious use-cases for a decentralized computer like Ethereum.

The reason why these applications aren’t driving demand through the roof comes back to the two issues that I said had very little weight in the long term: cost and UX. Another stranglehold on the market is the speed at which businesses and users can transition to Ethereum. Ethereum makes markets more efficient, which in lay terms means that profit margins are slashed – the above use-cases are all less profitable than their centralized alternative. As such, the move to Ethereum will be a user-driven one, which means that the cost and UX problems must be solved before we’ll see any real signs of mainstream adoption.

The best route for an investor to interpret this future demand is to get hands on with some dApps: breeding a CryptoKitty, generating some DAI or making a trustless bet. It is those investors who can look through the awkward UX to envisage the platform in 5-10 years who stand to make the best long-term decision.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ayu04hs5lxjv7nzo', 'title': 'Will Ethereum reach $1000 this year due to what is happening in May 2019?', 'score': {'original': 0.61615, 'ai': 0.38385}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In light of this skepticism, what factors may come into play to send the price of Ethereum climbing again?\n\nEthereum’s Inflating Supply\nBitcoin, with its long-term supply cap of 21M coins, has managed to achieve a $1000+ price, which it seems unlikely to ever drop below in the future.

On the basis that Ethereum does end up capping the supply of Ether to – let’s say – 110M, what implications does that have on the price? Given equal demand to Bitcoin, with this supply cap we can expect ETH/BTC to sit roughly at 0.2 – or $1300 at today’s prices. Should there be greater demand for Ethereum (which I will argue for below), then the price could well exceed that amount given a fixed supply cap.\n\nBefore i continue, let me introduce you to a platform i discovered where you can sell your Bitcoin and other top Cryptocurrencies at the exact rate in dollars any where in the world. The website is IBUYCRYPTO (www.ibuycrypto.store). It is safe and secure. The interesting part of it is that, you don’t have to drop your vital informations before you sell to them. You sell and get your money directly sent to your bank account immediately your deposit is confirmed. You can also sell and request the money is sent to someone else. Thank me later after using this platform.\n\nNetwork Demand\nEthereum has been rightly criticised for its poor user experience (UX) and high transaction costs; these are two factors which have certainly stifled demand of the platform. However, for the purposes of looking at the price of Ethereum over the long-run, these factors can be largely ignored given their decreasing marginal effect (these problems are organically solved over time). This leaves us looking at the demand of Ether with respect to its applications – are they solving a problem and to what extent? Can decentralized apps bring about a level of demand that would justify a $1,000 Ether?\n\nThe main application types that can be built on Ethereum today cover:\n\nDecentralized Governance\nDigital Asset Storage\nDecentralized Exchange\nGambling\n\nWithin each of these categories are a handful of early-stage apps. For Decentralized Governance we have MakerDAO, where users can create the stablecoin DAI by putting up collateral. With Digital Asset Storage we have CryptoKitties and others including the soon to launch GamerToken for storing and trading in-game items. Decentralised Exchange has the likes of IDEX, LocalEthereum and ForkDelta, all providing non-custodial exchange services that provide a clear benefit over their centralized counterparts. And for the Gambling category, the list of apps is the longest; after all this was one of the first obvious use-cases for a decentralized computer like Ethereum.\n\nThe reason why these applications aren’t driving demand through the roof comes back to the two issues that I said had very little weight in the long term: cost and UX. Another stranglehold on the market is the speed at which businesses and users can transition to Ethereum. Ethereum makes markets more efficient, which in lay terms means that profit margins are slashed – the above use-cases are all less profitable than their centralized alternative. As such, the move to Ethereum will be a user-driven one, which means that the cost and UX problems must be solved before we’ll see any real signs of mainstream adoption.\n\nThe best route for an investor to interpret this future demand is to get hands on with some dApps: breeding a CryptoKitty, generating some DAI or making a trustless bet. It is those investors who can look through the awkward UX to envisage the platform in 5-10 years who stand to make the best long-term decision.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.61615
Matthew Bates,2y,What piece of financial advice did you receive at a young age that has stuck with you ever since?,"“It’s only worth that much if you can find someone to buy it for that much.”

My father told me that when I was 11 years old and spending every dollar he’d give me on basketball cards and comic books. I’d get a new pack of cards for $3, and it would have a card that was worth, according to the $5 buyers guide I also bought, $3. “See,” I’d say, “I actually made money by buying this pack. These cards are worth more than what I paid for them. Just that one card is worth the price of the pack. The rest are profit.”

That’s when he hit me with the facts. Unless I could find someone who would actually pay me what the buyer’s guide said the cards were worth, they aren’t worth anything.

I think about that a lot when I want to buy something. Am I going to get my money’s worth out of this? Because the chances of me selling it and recouping even some of what I spent on it are low. Even with things like Facebook marketplace or eBay, unless it’s a house you’re trying to sell, chances are you’ll struggle to find a buyer, and you won’t get nearly as much as you think you will for it.

Ten years ago, I bought a gym-quality treadmill for about $2,500. I kept it well maintained, including a $750 professional overhaul about three years ago. Last month, I tried to sell it for just $200, because I had to get it and everything else out of my basement for a remodel. I couldn’t find a buyer for it, and it was too heavy for me to get in my car to put in storage. I ended up putting it in the alley for the scrap metal collectors. I still feel like I got my money’s worth out of it, but still… it seemed like a waste of a perfectly good, high-quality treadmill. Even though that treadmill was still worth something, in theory at least, it was only worth that much to someone who was willing to pay that much for it.

I’ve had similar experiences with other items over the years. I end up just donating them to charity or throwing them away when I no longer need them, even though they still work and still have value, because it’s not worth my time and trouble to find someone willing to pay for them. I max out the tax write-off charitable contributions I can claim by about April every year. Even afterwards, I make at least one trip per month to the donation site with a van full of stuff I no longer need, but someone else could use. It’s just not worth my time to try and sell it, even if it still has value.

It is always easier to buy than to sell.

In the last few years, I’ve began collecting vinyl records and comic books (again). Now, I’m not collecting them with an eye on their resell value. I’m collecting them for my own enjoyment. If, when I die, my wife is able to sell them for a profit, good for her. According to my comic book collecting app, my collection is valued at $2,150.

Indira Securities,3y,What is yeild to maturity in debt mutual funds and how it affects us?,"Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the total returns that are anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until its maturity period. Yield to maturity is long term bond yield but it is expressed as an annual rate. To put it in simple words, yield to maturity means the internal rate of return (IIR) of the investment made in bonds and held till maturity along with payment made as per the schedule with reinvestment at the same rate.

The debt mutual funds have a good track record of generating higher returns for the investors. Debt funds give returns to the investors through investment in various securities like non-convertible debentures, certificates of deposits, commercial papers and money market instruments, G-securities, etc. In comparison to fixed deposits, the debt funds also provide higher liquidity and tax efficiency.

While investing in debt funds, investors look for getting high returns by chasing funds having higher yield to maturity. They forget and underestimate the other risks that are associated with the debt funds. While investing in higher yield to maturity funds, you must know that you may be getting higher returns due to risky investments. The mutual funds often invest in risky papers that offer higher yields to give you higher returns.

Therefore, any fund that provides higher yield to maturity would have face the risk of default as well. The investors have to bear the losses in that case. This is because the fund has to write off such papers and the net asset value (NAV) takes a deep cut. The recent Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco is an apt example of such a case.

Sidharth Sharma,5y,What are the modes of financing for a startup?,"(i)Bootstrapping

An individual is said to be boot strapping when he or she attempts to found and build a company from personal finances or from the operating revenues of the new company.

Here are some of the methods in which a startup firm can bootstrap:

(a)Trade Credit

When a person is starting his business, suppliers are reluctant to give trade credit. They will insist on payment of their goods supplied either by cash or by credit card. However, a way out in this situation is to prepare a well-crafted financial plan. The next step is to pay a visit to the supplier’s office. If the business organization is small, the owner can be directly contacted. On the other hand, if it is a big firm, the Chief Financial Officer can be contacted and convinced about the financial plan.

Communication skills are important here. The financial plan has to be shown. The owner or the financial officer has to be explained about the business and the need to get the first order on credit in order to launch the venture. The owner or financial officer may give half the order on credit and balance on delivery. The trick here is to get the goods shipped and sell them before paying to them. One can also borrow to pay for the good sold. But there is interest cost also. So trade credit is one of the most important ways to reduce the amount of working capital one needs. This is especially true in retail operations.

b)Factoring

This is a financing method where accounts receivable of a business organization is sold to a commercial finance company to raise capital.The factor then got hold of the accounts receivable of a business organization and assumes the task of collecting the receivables as well as doing what would’ve been the paperwork. Factoring can be performed on a non-notification basis. It means customers may not be told that their accounts have been sold.

Merits to Factoring: The process of factoring may actually reduce costs for a business organization. It can actually reduce costs associated with maintaining accounts receivable such as bookkeeping, collections and credit verifications.
In addition to reducing internal costs of a business, factoring also frees up money that would otherwise be tied to receivables. This is especially true for businesses that sell to other businesses or to government; there are often long delays in payment that this would offset. This money can be used to generate profit through other avenues of the company. Factoring can be a very useful tool for raising money and keeping cash flowing.

(c)Leasing

Another popular method of bootstrapping is to take the equipment on lease rather than purchasing it. It will reduce the capital cost and also help lessee (person who take the asset on lease)to claim tax exemption. So, it is better to a take a photocopy machine, an automobile or a van on lease to avoid paying out lump sum money which is not at all feasible for a startup organization.

(ii)Angel Investors

Despite being a country of many cultures and communities traditionally inclined to business and entrepreneurship, India still ranks low on comparative ratings across entrepreneurship, innovation and ease of doing business. The reasons are obvious. These include our old and outdated draconian rules and regulations which provides a hindrance to our business environment for a long time. Other reasons are redtapism, our time consuming procedures, and lack of general support for entrepreneurship. Off course, things are changing in recent times.

As per Investopedia, Angel investors invest in small startups or entrepreneurs. Often, angel investors are among an entrepreneur’s family and friends. The capital angel investors provide may be a one-time investment to help the business propel or an ongoing injection of money to support and carry the company through its difficult early stages.

Angel investors provide more favorable terms compared to other lenders, since they usually invest in the entrepreneur starting the business rather than the viability of the business. Angel investors are focused on helping startups take their first steps, rather than the possible profit they may get from the business. Essentially, angel investors are the opposite of venture capitalists.

Angel investors are also called informal investors, angel funders, private investors, seed investors or business angels. These are affluent individuals who inject capital for startups in exchange for ownership equity or convertible debt. Some angel investors invest through crowdfunding platforms online or build angel investor networks to pool in capital.

Angel investors typically use their own money, unlike venture capitalists who take care of pooled money from many other investors and place them in a strategically managed fund. Though angel investors usually represent individuals, the entity that actually provides the fund may be a limited liability company, a business, a trust or an investment fund, among many other kinds of vehicles.

Angel investors who seed startups that fail during their early stages lose their investments completely. This is why professional angel investors look for opportunities for a defined exit strategy, acquisitions or initial public offerings (IPOs).

(iii) Venture Capital Funds

Evolution
Venture Capital in India stated in the decade of 1970, when the Government of India appointed a committee to tackle the issue of inadequate funding to entrepreneurs and start-ups. However, it is only afterten years that the first all India venture capital funding was started by IDBI, ICICI and IFCI.

Formation of venture capital has been depicted in the diagram below:

Investors in venture capital funds are shown in the following diagram:

Structure of Venture Capital Fund in India

Three main types of fund structure exist: one for domestic funds and two for offshore ones:
(a)Domestic Funds:
-Domestic Funds raises funds domestically.
-They are usually structured as:
(i) a domestic vehicle for the pooling of funds from the investor, and
(ii) a separate investment adviser that carries those duties of asset manager.
-Domestic Vehicle may be a trust and a company.India, unlike most developed countries does not recognize a limited partnership.
-Trust form is considered best due to its operational flexibility.

(b)Offshore Funds: Two common alternatives available to offshore investors are: the “offshore structure” and the “unified structure”.

Offshore structure:
-Under this structure, an investment vehicle having jurisdiction outside India is created.
-It can be an LLC or an LP.[Limited Liability Company or Limited Partnership]
-It makes investments directly into Indian portfolio companies.
-Typically, the assets are managed by an offshore manager, while the investment advisor in India carries out the due diligence and identifies deals.

Unified Structure:
-When domestic investors are expected to participate in the fund, a unified structure is used.
-Overseas investors pool their assets in an offshore vehicle that invests in a locally managed trust, whereas domestic investors directly contribute to the trust.
-This structure is deviced to make the local portfolio investments.

Concept of Venture Capital Fund

Venture capital means funds made available for startup firms and small businesses with exceptional growth potential. Venture capital is money provided by professionals who

alongside management invest in young, rapidly growing companies that have the potential to develop into significant economic contributors.

Venture Capitalists generally:
.Finance new and rapidly growing companies
.Purchase equity securities
.Assist in the development of new products or services
.Add value to the company through active participation.

Characteristics of Venture Capital Financing:

(i) Long time horizon:-The fund would invest with a long time horizon in mind. Minimum period of investment would be 3 years and maximum period can be 10 years.

(ii)Lack of liquidity: When VC invests, it takes into account the liquidity FACTOR.IT
 assumes that there would be less liquidity on the equity it gets and accordingly it would be investing in that format.They adjust this liquidity premium against the price and required return.

(iii)High Risk: VC would not hesitate to take risk. It works on principle of high risk and high return. So, high risk would not eliminate the investment choice for a venture capital.

(iv)EquityParticipation: Most of the time, VC would be investing in the form of equity of a company. This would help the VC participate in the management and help the company grow. Besides, a lot of board decisions can be supervised by the VC if they participate in the equity of a company.

Advantages of bringing VC in the company:

(1)It injects long- term equity finance which provides a solid capital base for future growth.
(2)The venture capitalist is a business partner, sharing both the risks and rewards. Venture capitalists are rewarded with business success and capital gain.
(3)The venture capitalist is able to provide practical advice and assistance to the company

based on past experience with other companies which were in similar situations.
(4)The venture capitalist also has a network of contacts in many areas that can add value to the company.
(5)The venture capitalist may be capable of providing additional rounds of funding should it be required to finance growth.
(6)Venture capitalists are experienced in the process of preparing a company for an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares onto the stock exchanges or overseas stock exchange such as NASDAQ.
(7)They can also facilitate a trade sale.

Stages of funding for VC:

(1)Seed Money: Low level financing needed to prove a new idea.
(2)Start-up: Early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development.
(3)First-Round: Early sales and manufacturing funds.
(4)Second-Round: Working capital for early stage companies that are selling product, but not yet turning in a profit.
(5)Third Round: Also called Mezzanine financing, this is expansion money for a newlyprofitable company.
(6)Fourth-Round- Also called bridge financing, it is intended to finance the “goingpublic”process.

Risk in each stage is different. An indicative Risk matrix is given below:

Financial Period(Funds RiskPerception Activity to be financed
Stage locked in
years)
Seed 7-10 Extreme For supporting a concept or idea or R&D
Money for product development
Start Up 5-9 Very High Initializing prototypes operations or
developing
First 3-7 High Start commercials marketing

Stage production
Second 3-5 Sufficientlyhigh Expand market and growing working
Stage capital need

Third 1-3 Medium Market expansion, acquisition & product

They will insist on payment of their goods supplied either by cash or by credit card. However, a way out in this situation is to prepare a well-crafted financial plan. The next step is to pay a visit to the supplier’s office. If the business organization is small, the owner can be directly contacted. On the other hand, if it is a big firm, the Chief Financial Officer can be contacted and convinced about the financial plan.\n\nCommunication skills are important here. The financial plan has to be shown. The owner or the financial officer has to be explained about the business and the need to get the first order on credit in order to launch the venture. The owner or financial officer may give half the order on credit and balance on delivery. The trick here is to get the goods shipped and sell them before paying to them. One can also borrow to pay for the good sold. But there is interest cost also. So trade credit is one of the most important ways to reduce the amount of working capital one needs. This is especially true in retail operations.\n\nb)Factoring\n\nThis is a financing method where accounts receivable of a business organization is sold to a commercial finance company to raise capital.The factor then got hold of the accounts receivable of a business organization and assumes the task of collecting the receivables as well as doing what would’ve been the paperwork. Factoring can be performed on a non-notification basis. It means customers may not be told that their accounts have been sold.\n\nMerits to Factoring: The process of factoring may actually reduce costs for a business organization. It can actually reduce costs associated with maintaining accounts receivable such as bookkeeping, collections and credit verifications.\nIn addition to reducing internal costs of a business, factoring also frees up money that would otherwise be tied to receivables. This is especially true for businesses that sell to other businesses or to government; there are often long delays in payment that this would offset. This money can be used to generate profit through other avenues of the company. Factoring can be a very useful tool for raising money and keeping cash flowing.\n\n(c)Leasing\n\nAnother popular method of bootstrapping is to take the equipment on lease rather than purchasing it. It will reduce the capital cost and also help lessee (person who take the asset on lease)to claim tax exemption. So, it is better to a take a photocopy machine, an automobile or a van on lease to avoid paying out lump sum money which is not at all feasible for a startup organization.\n\n(ii)Angel Investors\n\nDespite being a country of many cultures and communities traditionally inclined to business and entrepreneurship, India still ranks low on', 'result': {'fake': 0.0166, 'real': 0.9834}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'comparative ratings across entrepreneurship, innovation and ease of doing business. The reasons are obvious. These include our old and outdated draconian rules and regulations which provides a hindrance to our business environment for a long time. Other reasons are redtapism, our time consuming procedures, and lack of general support for entrepreneurship. Off course, things are changing in recent times.\n\nAs per Investopedia, Angel investors invest in small startups or entrepreneurs. Often, angel investors are among an entrepreneur’s family and friends. The capital angel investors provide may be a one-time investment to help the business propel or an ongoing injection of money to support and carry the company through its difficult early stages.\n\nAngel investors provide more favorable terms compared to other lenders, since they usually invest in the entrepreneur starting the business rather than the viability of the business. Angel investors are focused on helping startups take their first steps, rather than the possible profit they may get from the business. Essentially, angel investors are the opposite of venture capitalists.\n\nAngel investors are also called informal investors, angel funders, private investors, seed investors or business angels. These are affluent individuals who inject capital for startups in exchange for ownership equity or convertible debt. Some angel investors invest through crowdfunding platforms online or build angel investor networks to pool in capital.\n\nAngel investors typically use their own money, unlike venture capitalists who take care of pooled money from many other investors and place them in a strategically managed fund. Though angel investors usually represent individuals, the entity that actually provides the fund may be a limited liability company, a business, a trust or an investment fund, among many other kinds of vehicles.\n\nAngel investors who seed startups that fail during their early stages lose their investments completely. This is why professional angel investors look for opportunities for a defined exit strategy, acquisitions or initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\n(iii) Venture Capital Funds\n\nEvolution\nVenture Capital in India stated in the decade of 1970, when the Government of India appointed a committee to tackle the issue of inadequate funding to entrepreneurs and start-ups. However, it is only afterten years that the first all India venture capital funding was started by IDBI, ICICI and IFCI.\n\nFormation of venture capital has been depicted in the diagram below:\n\nInvestors in venture capital funds are shown in the following diagram:\n\nStructure of Venture Capital Fund in India\n\nThree main types of fund structure exist: one for domestic funds and two for offshore ones:\n(a)Domestic Funds:\n-Domestic Funds raises funds domestically.\n-They are usually structured as:\n(i) a domestic vehicle for the pooling of funds from the investor, and\n(ii) a separate investment adviser that carries those duties of asset manager.\n-Domestic Vehicle may be a trust and a company.India, unlike most developed countries does not recognize a limited partnership.\n-Trust form is considered best due to its operational flexibility.\n\n(b)Offshore Funds: Two common alternatives available to offshore investors are: the “offshore structure” and the “unified structure”.\n\nOffshore structure:\n-Under this structure, an investment vehicle having jurisdiction outside India is created.\n-It can be an LLC or an LP.[Limited Liability Company or Limited Partnership]\n-It makes investments directly into Indian portfolio companies.\n-Typically, the assets', 'result': {'fake': 0.075, 'real': 0.925}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'are managed by an offshore manager, while the investment advisor in India carries out the due diligence and identifies deals.\n\nUnified Structure:\n-When domestic investors are expected to participate in the fund, a unified structure is used.\n-Overseas investors pool their assets in an offshore vehicle that invests in a locally managed trust, whereas domestic investors directly contribute to the trust.\n-This structure is deviced to make the local portfolio investments.\n\nConcept of Venture Capital Fund\n\nVenture capital means funds made available for startup firms and small businesses with exceptional growth potential.

Minimum period of investment would be 3 years and maximum period can be 10 years.\n\n(ii)Lack of liquidity: When VC invests, it takes into account the liquidity FACTOR.IT\n assumes that there would be less liquidity on the equity it gets and accordingly it would be investing in that format.They adjust this liquidity premium against the price and required return.\n\n(iii)High Risk: VC would not hesitate to take risk. It works on principle of high risk and high return. So, high risk would not eliminate the investment choice for a venture capital.\n\n(iv)EquityParticipation: Most of the time, VC would be investing in the form of equity of a company. This would help the VC participate in the management and help the company grow. Besides, a lot of board decisions can be supervised by the VC if they participate in the equity of a company.\n\nAdvantages of bringing VC in the company:\n\n(1)It injects long- term equity finance which provides a solid capital base for future growth.\n(2)The venture capitalist is a business partner, sharing both the risks and rewards. Venture capitalists are rewarded with business success and capital gain.\n(3)The venture capitalist is able to provide practical advice and assistance to the company\n\nbased on past experience with other companies which were in similar situations.\n(4)The venture capitalist also has a network of contacts in many areas that can add value to the company.\n(5)The venture capitalist may be capable of providing additional rounds of funding should it be required to finance growth.\n(6)Venture capitalists are experienced in the process of preparing a company for an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares onto the stock exchanges or overseas stock exchange such as NASDAQ.\n(7)They can also facilitate a trade sale.\n\nStages of funding for VC:\n\n(1)Seed Money: Low level financing needed to prove a new idea.\n(2)Start-up: Early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development.\n(3)First-Round: Early sales and manufacturing funds.\n(4)Second-Round: Working capital for early stage companies that are selling product, but not yet turning in a profit.\n(5)Third Round: Also called Mezzanine financing, this is expansion money for a newlyprofitable company.\n(6)Fourth-Round- Also called bridge financing, it is intended to finance the “goingpublic”process.\n\nRisk in each stage is different.

Bharat Chandani,4y,"If the economy is really in a slowdown, why can't I see it?","Because you haven't seen it from the perspective of the manufacturing industries. I keep visiting the ceramic tiles and sanitary ware industry in Morbi (the town which supplies more than 80% of tiles in India, it’s my current posting) and most of the industrialist here are willing to sell down their plant even by taking some loss.

Reason : domestic market is down and they dont have sufficient funds even for day to day working of their industry.

If ceramic tiles industry is under distress that means that real estate must be in distress too, as they are their main buyers. And if real estate is in distress that means that Steel, Cement sectors must also be distress, you know the reason why. And if cement and steel industry is in distress that means that coal sector which supplies mainly to cement, steel and power industry must be in distress. And if ceramic, coal, cement, steel industries are in distress that means there allied industry i.e. packaging, transportation, power sector must be in distress. And if all of them are in distress that simply means the people working in these industries might not be able to afford luxury hence automobiles, garment sector and real estate sector is in distress.

So you can see that a complete wheel of economy has stopped primarily due to demonetization ( because most of the funds flowing in India's real estate was black money and demonetization stopped that to a large extent.) What govt really needs is to start this wheel again, if not through domestic consumption than atleast by promoting exports.

Ross.Lederhman,5y,What are things that people get wrong about investment banking?,"That investment banking is this high end, passionate and intellectual journey to make the perfect deal and make a lot of money.

It is not.

I remember our partner one day came to the floor after they fired a junior and they needed a replacement.

Some colleagues handed in some CVs of friends and a particular chap who was studying a MSc in Applied Mathematics joined in a week.

He was excited, well dressed. A million dollars. Exciting new job! Smile on his face.

The partner came in and ordered him to make a x-amount of pitch books with another guy. He worked himself around the clock, doing all sorts of unnecessary analysis, making it a late night and the following morning presented the work. The partner didnt care about all the additional analysis and information it had, it didnt look good enough. This client really likes pretty slides.

Do it again!

He realized he'll be doing this for a long time.. You saw his face go from excited little boy when he entered a while back on his first day

Kavita,4y,What are 10 financial tips you would give a 21 year old who passed out of college?,"My answer mainly focuses on Tier-3 college students, so please judge it accordingly!

Here are 10 points I really wanted to spread -

Invest in your Skill,
Since you just graduated, you still have a lot to learn. Try to invest time and money to learn and improve your skill. Most student start spending salaries and time to buy latest gadgets, trips, fancy restaurants.

Make sure to Invest and improve your skill.
I have seen student spending literally thousands on restaurants during Birthdays, reunion and meetups but think 100 time before spending few hundred on courses.

You want to learn something, just do it, delaying it for few hundred bucks cost you time, which I guess is more important.
Talk with family members about monthly finance,
This will help you to understand how much money you require to run a family in your location. It also give you perspective about your lifestyle and saving.
Don’t pick habit of EMI’s at this early stage,
E-Commerce giants literally changed user habits to spend for basic and luxury items through easy EMI options. Now you have option to pay for your shoes, smart phones, shirt and even speaker through EMIs.

This converts a Rs.30000 phone to just Rs.1500 per month for next 2 years. Remember now you are in a trap paying Rs.1500 every single month for next 24 months, paying 15% extra amount. Chances are you don’t even require that Rs.30000 phone, you still can work with Rs.15000 phone which have decent features now a days!
Entertainment is important,
You are working 5 days every week, 2 days of hustling, you require some entertainment for sure. Don’t subscribe to every Digital platform and also stop using Torrent on regular basis.

Here is the problem with Torrent,
Firstly, when things are free you actually don’t value them.
Secondly, since now you know things are free, you starting watching them more and now you don’t value your time.

In this circle, your are investing your time!
Go to Business Meetups,
You will find lot of free meetups happening around cities on regular basis, just go there and listen to people. Meeting and listening them in real life is way different than watching a YouTube video (You understand and react differently in real life meetups for same sessions).
Try to read at least 1 Financial book every year. If reading regularly is hard for you try Audiobooks, listen may be 30 minutes weekly.
Read weekly startup and business report,
I know you don’t understand them but just read them every week for once. This will keep you updated with other fields and how they are performing.
Join LinkedIn,
Follow 2–3 new people from your field. You will get information about new Job openings and other opportunities.
Its easy to install app and order.
Digital Currency is easy to spend, learn to control yourself.
Learn about Stocks, Fixed Deposits, Mutual Funds, Real Estate. (I recently start learning-reading about them).

This is literally golden age for many!
Mostly don’t have family finance responsibility, you can adjust with different lifestyle, your mind is fresh with ideas, you can easily adapt new habits, learn about new fields, and adjust with all kind of people.

Ratnamala Kamath,3y,Should we share financial information with a spouse where she is a nominee?,"My father was a very secretive person regarding financial matters. Though all accounts were in joint names with my mother, he never told her about his investments. For that matter he didn't trust anybody in money matters. Even though he was approaching his 80th year he didn't confide anything with my mother.

Suddenly he was diagnosed with end stage cancer. He underwent an operation for the same but never recovered and passed away within 3 months of diagnosis.

After the operation, he called my husband (his son in law) and took an assurance from him that he will take care of my father's financial matters and set it right for my mother so that she does not face any problems, in case he didn't recover.

After his passing away it took us 6 months to set everything in order so that my mother doesn't face any problems. So though my mother is financially stable, she doesn't know abcd of what is to be done even today. Perhaps if my father had taught her or apprised her of his investments when she was younger she may have understood. Today she is dependent on us to help her with it. She is lucky that we are honest and upright and would never dream of cheating her. But in case there are no children or children are not nearby then there is every chance of her being cheated by so called friends or relatives and sometimes even own children.

So whether or not to share financial information is upto you. If you trust your spouse you can share it. Else you can write everything on paper along with a letter addressed to your spouse and keep it where your spouse can find it just in case something untoward happens to you. This is to ensure that your spouse is aware of your investments and gets what should rightfully go to him/her.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rzq3tyw4nsmcb798', 'title': 'Should we share financial information with a spouse where she is a nominee?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""My father was a very secretive person regarding financial matters.
