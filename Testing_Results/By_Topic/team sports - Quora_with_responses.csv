Robert Puckett,4y,What is it like playing on a high school sports team with someone who eventually went pro? Were they noticeably better than other teammates/opponents?,"There was this basketball team in our conference that was always the best team.

They were so good, they literally didn’t lose a game in the 4 years I played high school ball.

I don’t mean it was just us that never beat them. I mean they had a perfect season for at least 4 years.

The coach was extremely aggressive in his recruiting to say the least.

My junior year, rumors started circulating this team just recruited the best player they’ve ever had. Awesome. The unstoppable team just became even more unstoppable.

This guy (Mo if I remember right) was living up to his hype. The school was experiencing record attendance to their games and Mo had already been offered full scholarships to several major colleges.

It was actually exciting when we saw them coming up on the schedule. Everyone on our team wanted to see this guy in action.

He didn’t disappoint. He left us all speechless with what he was able to do.

The most memorable part of his performance was when he sprinted out on a fast break. Our point guard was already ahead of him and trying to set himself in the paint to disrupt his shot.

Mo literally just jumped over him, like he was nothing more than a mild nuisance, and slammed down a two-hander.

The crowd erupted.

Our point guard laughed it off and said he could see the Nike Swoosh on the bottom of his shoe when he jumped over him.

Every other team in our conference had a similar story to that one. It became a point of conversation from then on.

“So what did Mo do to embarrass you guys when you played him?”

A few of my teammates kept up with his progress after graduation.

According to them, Mo accepted a full-ride scholarship, played all 4 years, and then got drafted to the NBA… As a bench player.

As good as he was, he was still no match for the caliber of players that get minutes in the NBA.

I guess that goes to show that even the “bad” professional sports players are still very, very good.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zou68gpyhsjvxeal', 'title': 'What is it like playing on a high school sports team with someone who eventually went pro?

Colin Riegels,3y,What are some examples of disgraceful though not illegal tactics employed by sports teams in a game?,"Probably one of the most egregious examples in history not only came from the nation of gentlemen (England) but also the sport of kings (cricket). I refer of course to the infamous ‘bodyline’ bowling scandal.

During England’s 1930 series against Australia the Australians had hammered England’s bowlers. Don Bradman alone averaged nearly 140 runs per game. Desperate to find a way to overcome the Australian attack in the 1932–33 tour, England’s captain, Douglas Jardine developed ‘bodyline’ bowling. Put simply, instead of aiming at the stumps to try and get the batsman out, they aimed at his head. The idea is that as the batman reflexively tries to protect himself, he would pull up his bat and give away an easy catch. Given that English pace bowlers like Harold Larwood could send the ball at over 100 miles an hour, there would be no inconsiderable risk to the batsman. Someone could be hurt. Someone could be killed.

But they did it. And they won.

To say that the Australians were not pleased was a majestic understatement. The crowd in the Adelaide Oval grew so incensed that the English players feared that they were going to invade the pitch and actually attack them. After the test was over cricket officials in both countries agreed that bodyline bowling was a scourge that needed to be stamped out.

What is particularly amazing was the time period that this occurred in. These were amateur players in an era when proper conduct was taken as definitive - it wasn’t whether you won or lost, but how you played the game. Today professional athletes doing whatever is necessary to win is more accepted. Back then, this was unheard of.

Mercifully nobody was seriously hurt, and no real damage was done other than to sportsmanship. The legend of Australia’s infamous batting lineup grew rather than shrank because of their shock defeat. But today it remains the biggest scandal in cricket, and one of the biggest scandals in British sport.

Colin Riegels,4y,Have you ever played sport for a team who were beating another team so badly that your coach asked you to let them score? How did you feel about that and what did you do?,"No, but I did see it happen in one of the greatest acts of humanity I have seen from children.

It was a primary school football (soccer) match and one team was absolutely hammering the other - it got to something like 20–0 or something like that. Now, the team that was getting hammered had a child sitting on the bench who was mentally slow - might have been down syndrome - might have been something else. I’m not sure. But the coach usually put him on for about 2 minutes at the end of the game to help his self esteem, and in a normal game he would never get anywhere close to the ball.

In this case the coach went to the opposing coach and basically asked him - given the score was essentially irrelevant - if they could see their way to letting this kid score a goal. The other coach agreed and somehow this plan was communicated to the players during a water break.

Well the young lad is duly substituted on, and the ball is passed to him and he gamely dribbles forward with a look of intense concentration on his face. It looked like one of those terrible football movies from the 70s as he just jogged by everybody as they made lame and highly ineffectual attempts at tackling. When he got close enough he kicked the ball towards goal, and the goal keeper dived decisively the wrong way and the ball trickles into the net. Well there weren’t many parents on hand, but they cheered like he had won the world cup.

His team mates all crowded round clapping him on the back and lifted him up onto their shoulders. The smile beaming from that boy’s face lit up like the sun. The score ended something like 30–1 but I can’t imagine that little boy forgot that day for the rest of his life. It was just a beautiful day for humanity.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ov6m4zpcatunijy1', 'title': 'Have you ever played sport for a team who were beating another team so badly that your coach asked you to let them score?

Scott MacFeeters,1y,"How can the USA, with a population of 330 million, be beaten in the World Cup by the Netherlands with the population of 17 million? Are there any international team sports where American men are successful?","There is no culture for European football in the USA. Every few years, someone in America will say that soccer is the next big thing. People go to watch a game or two, then they stop showing up. Nobody cares. The game itself is contrary to American culture. We want big scores and plenty of action while soccer is generally low scoring and players can sometimes walk on the pitch while the ball is in play away from them.

The fact that the USA has 330M people is why they usually make it out of the group. They’re just good enough to beat the bad teams, but when they have to play a good team in the elimination rounds they don’t have the talent or coaching for it. Sometimes they get lucky in the first elimination round, but their luck quickly runs out.

We look at today’s game and see an overmatched US team playing against a sound Dutch team. The Americans were completely out-coached. They brought their typical game to the match and the Dutch said they weren’t going to play that game. Why would they play a run and gun style against the USA when they had so many more quality players? The Americans never countered what the Dutch were doing and it showed on the three Netherlands goals - each of which was more or less the same. Through 90+ minutes the USA never changed the tactics which allowed the Dutch goals, and that is on the coach.

If there was a world cup for American football, the Dutch would be destroyed by the USA, because there is no culture for American football in the Netherlands. Even if there was a matching population, the Dutch would still lose. The USA would even easily beat China and India, both of whom have over four times as many people as the USA. If China had a hundred years of American football culture under their cleats then yes - they would win.

The USA has over a hundred and fifty years of soccer history, but it has never been part of the American culture.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dcj6pi2ot0fah7lk', 'title': 'How can the USA, with a population of 330 million, be beaten in the World Cup by the Netherlands with the population of 17 million?

Greg Gumeringer,Updated 4y,What is it like playing on a high school sports team with someone who eventually went pro? Were they noticeably better than other teammates/opponents?,"I played with one of the best defensive linemen/linebackers of this generation in high school.

He was, genuinely, a full grown man when I met him my sophomore year. He was the kind of person that never had to lift weights and was completely ripped. This man among boys didn’t start on defense, however, as he was my running back. I played left tackle and was the worst starter on the offensive line but that didn’t matter since our running back could level any defender on the field.

The issue started late in the season though when colleges wanted us to show his defensive prowess as well as on offense. This either caused fatigue or we as an offensive line failed to make a crease for him and we were drummed out of the playoffs in the second round. That was 1999 and Mr Terrell Suggs, 2011 defensive player of the year is still in the NFL. I ran into Terrell in a convenience store a while back and he still had a strong but warm personality.

Not too shabby Terrell. Come home to the desert where you should have been drafted. It will be a shorter trip to the 20th reunion.

EDIT - looks like Terrell did indeed choose to come home!

EDIT (3/14/19) - with a return home, high school football pictures were back in the paper. That put me in “news” in an almost-famous-kind-of-way (#57)

Gary Hart,1y,"Why do some states (Texas, Florida, and California) have 2 teams of each sport?","Texas, Florida, and California have several teams in many team sports. But I suppose your ill-stated question refers to major league professional sport in the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB, right?

Ben Poole,3y,How do I stop being a ball hog? (in team sports like basketball/football),"Here’s the number one thing you need to understand:

Being a ball hog isn’t always a bad thing.

If you’re averaging 50 points and your team is winning, then you don’t need to stop ball hogging. It’s obvious it’s helping your team. If your team is weak, then ball hogging is sometimes a last resort.

If your team isn’t winning, but you’re averaging 50 points, then you have a problem. It’s your job as a ball hog, to recognise whether your ball hogging is helping or hurting the team.

If it’s hurting the team and you want to stop ball hogging, then the obvious solution is to pass the ball.

George Regnery,4y,Are there any interesting stories behind how certain NFL teams got their name?,"The Packers were originally sponsored by the Indian Packing Company, so they were named after their corporate sponsor.

The Baltimore Ravens are so named because Edgar Allen Poe, who lived in Baltimore, wrote a poem called “The Raven” (“Nevermore”). The other Baltimore sports team, the MLB Baltimore Orioles, is also named after a bird.

The Arizona Cardinals were originally in Chicago. The team’s owner bought faded maroon jerseys from the University of Chicago, and due to the color, named his team the Cardinals.

The Los Angeles Rams, which were in Cleveland when they were founded, chose the name Rams in a nod to Fordham University’s team.

New Orleans was awarded an NFL team on November 1st, All Saints Day, and they also chose the name because jazz is big music in NO and “When the Saints go Marching In” is probably the best known jazz piece.

The Eagles were named after the Eagle in the NRA (National Recovery Act), a new deal administration.

Some team names were influenced by Baseball teams:

The Washington Redskins were originally based in Boston. Originally, the team was named the Boston Braves, the same as the baseball team (which later moved to Atlanta). The football Braves also played on Braves Field in Boston. However, the NFL team moved to Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox, so the Braves name no longer made sense. However, to keep the Indian theme, and to tie its name closer to the Red Sox, the team became the Boston Redskins. According to many accounts, the nickname was also meant to honor head coach and Native American William Henry “Lone Star” Dietz. The team later moved to Washington.

The New York Giants (officially, the “New York Football Giants”) were named after the baseball team, which later moved to San Francisco.

The Bears were originally called the “Staleys” after the starch company that supported them, but they changed the name to the Bears because they played in Wrigley Field, and wanted to keep the bear theme.

The Cowboys were originally going to be called the Steers, but I guess someone pointed out that steers are castrated, so not a good choice. They then chose Rangers, but thought that would be confusing with the baseball team, so decided on the Cowboys.

The Detroit Lions were probably named to be somewhat consistent with the Tigers.

However, most of the team names were decided by various contests — Raiders, Titans, Bucaneers, Steelers and a few others were chosen in this manner.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/umsb1pyfxnd0ojra', 'title': 'Are there any interesting stories behind how certain NFL teams got their name?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The Packers were originally sponsored by the Indian Packing Company, so they were named after their corporate sponsor.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens are so named because Edgar Allen Poe, who lived in Baltimore, wrote a poem called “The Raven” (“Nevermore”).

Thomas Xydias,Updated 1y,What is the greatest team not have won the World Cup?,"I think there are a few teams that probably deserved to win the World Cup. I would say though that the Netherlands in 1974 is probably the best team never to win it. I will first go through some honourable mentions. Actually in fact I can’t decide between the Netherlands in 1974 and Hungary in 1954. Both teams were spectacular and each deserves to have been put in the history books as winners.

In 1974 the Netherlands had developed their total football system and it was completely brilliant. Cruyff led the team and they got all the way to the final. It seemed they could cruise past West Germany as before “Die Mannschaft” had even touched the ball Cruyff went down and won a penalty in the 3rd minute. It was put away but the Germans managed to overturn the game. They did this by their aggressive man-marking. Since total football relied on space and change of position West Germany watched each Dutch player immensely not allowing them any space. Furthermore, the defence led by Franz Beckenbauer would always be hard to break. 20 years prior West Germany also denied Hungary’s golden generation a Jules Rimet trophy. Over the last four years, Hungary had dominated international football and I think they were unbeaten for a long period of time. In the group stage, the Hungarians battered West Germany 8–3 and when Hungary were 2–0 in the final it looked like it would be a similar result. However, West Germany managed to turn the game around and so it was dubbed “Das wonder von Bern”. There is a German film with that same title and their recreation of that game is incredible. I watched it for our German class and I strongly recommend you watch it as well.

In summary, it is too difficult to decide but I have gone with Hungary 1954 and the Netherlands 1974 as the greatest teams not to win a World Cup.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h3r46lmtbgyn57k0', 'title': 'What is the greatest team not have won the World Cup?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think there are a few teams that probably deserved to win the World Cup.

Vibhakar T S (ವಿಭಾಕರ್ ಟಿ ಎಸ್),1y,Which sports has seen the most one-sided dominance by any team for a reasonably long period of time?,"India's dominance in Hockey, 1928–1964.

Let's recall the fact that in 1920s and 1930s, India used to be a colonial state ruled by the British. They had to manage all their expenses themselves. They had no aid from British. They had to develop infrastructure, equipments, and other necessary things by themselves.

And in such a situation, they played their first Olympics in 1928 in Amsterdam. India were in Division A, that had the teams like Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria. In their four group matches, the Indian team beat,

Austria 6–0.
Belgium 9–0.
Denmark 5–0.
Switzerland 6–0.

The goal difference of India was 26–0. And in final, they beat the home team Netherlands 3–0 and sealed the gold medal in their very first appearance. Major Dhyan Chand, the star of the show, had claimed a whopping 14 goals to his name (The second highest goal scorer had a mere 7 goals to his name). Even Firoze Khan had scored 5 goals in the tournament.

In 1932, the Indian hockey team landed in Los Angeles for their second Olympics. The tournament had lack of participation due to many teams boycotting the tournament. India were grouped with Japan and USA. India beat Japan 11–1 and USA 24–1. They bagged their second consecutive gold medal in field hockey in Olympics.

1936 posted a tougher challenge for the team. They weren't in the best of the form. Some very strong teams like Germany and Netherlands took part in the tournament. So, it was gonna be a tough task for the Indian team. India played in Group A that had the teams like Japan, Hungary and United States. In their three group stage matches, they beat,

Hungary 4–0.
USA 7–0.
Japan 9–0.

The goal difference of India was 20–0. Much like 1928, they hadn't conceded a goal till the knockouts. Even in semifinals, they beat France comfortably by 10–0. They met Germany in the finals. They trashed the home side 8–1 and won their third consecutive gold medal in Hockey Olympics. Throughout the tournament, India conceded just a goal and scored a whopping 38 of them.

From 1936 to 1948, no Olympic games took place due to World war 2. By 1948, a lot of things were changed. The then colonial India was split into two nations, India and Pakistan, both of which were the top Hockey teams. The Great Britain also had a really good team. So, Olympics was to witness the Hockey glory yet again.

India were in the Group A that had the likes of Argentina, Spain and Austria. In their group stage matches, they beat,

Austria 8–0.
Argentina 9–1.
Spain 2–0.

They finished group stage with no loss and a goal difference of 18. In semifinals, they beat The Netherlands 2–1 in a close counter. In finals, they faced the home side Britain and trashed them 4–0 to claim their fourth consecutive gold medal. India had defeated all the home sides in their final appearances, which was interesting. And this was the team without Dhyan Chand (As he had retired) and yet had the quality to dominate the sport.

The 1952 Olympics in Helsinki had an interesting Tennis type knockout rounds. In the preliminary round, India had gotten a bye. In quarterfinals, they faced Austria and beat them 4–0. In semifinals, they beat The Great Britain 3–1. In finals, India beat The Netherlands 6–1 and claimed their fifth consecutive gold medal in Hockey Olympics.

The 1956 Olympics in Melbourne had the traditional groups. India were in the group that had the likes of Singapore, Afghanistan, and USA. In the group stage matches, India didn't break much sweat as expected. They beat,

Afghanistan 14–0.
USA 16–0.
Singapore 6–0.

With a goal difference of 36 (No goal conceded), they played semifinals against Germany. They beat them 1–0 and made it to the finals. In the finals, they beat Pakistan 1–0 and clinched their sixth consecutive gold medal in Hockey. Yep, Sixth consecutive gold medal !!

1960 Olympics took place in Rome. India were the defending champions and had won all their finals in the last 6 appearances. India was in Group A that had the likes of New Zealand, Netherlands and Denmark. In their group stage matches, they beat,

Denmark 10–0.
The Netherlands 4–1.
New Zealand 3–0

In quarterfinals, India beat Australia 1–0. In semifinals, India beat The Great Britain 1–0. In finals, India lost (!!!!????) to Pakistan 1–0 and settled for Silver. It was the first ever loss for India in an Olympics Hockey final. India's gold medal streak was over. Yet, they claimed the silver medal.

The 1964 Olympics took place in Tokyo. India were in Pool B that had six other teams like Spain, The Netherlands, Germany, Malaysia, Belgium, Canada and Hong Kong. In their group stage matches, they won five games and held on for two draws. It was the first instance of an Indian team drawing an Olympic match.

They beat Belgium 2–0.
They drew 1–1 with Germany.
They drew 1–1 with Spain.
They beat Hong Kong 6–0.
They beat Malaysia 3–1.
They beat Canada 3–0.
They beat The Netherlands 2–1.

They topped their group with 5 wins and 2 draws. In semifinals, India beat Australia 3–1 and qualified for their eighth final in a row. In finals, they had a rematch of 1960 Olympics with Pakistan. India beat Pakistan 1–0 and got back their gold medal. It was their seventh instance of winning the gold medal in Hockey Olympics.

From 1928 to 1964,

India won 7 gold medals
India won a silver medal
They had won 30 consecutive games in Olympics from 1928 to 1960.
They won a total of 40 games, drew only 2 games and lost just one game.
They scored a whopping 219 goals and conceded just 14 goals in the period.

That's simply an incredible level of dominance.

They had to manage all their expenses themselves. They had no aid from British. They had to develop infrastructure, equipments, and other necessary things by themselves.\n\nAnd in such a situation, they played their first Olympics in 1928 in Amsterdam. India were in Division A, that had the teams like Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria. In their four group matches, the Indian team beat,\n\nAustria 6–0.\nBelgium 9–0.\nDenmark 5–0.\nSwitzerland 6–0.\n\nThe goal difference of India was 26–0. And in final, they beat the home team Netherlands 3–0 and sealed the gold medal in their very first appearance. Major Dhyan Chand, the star of the show, had claimed a whopping 14 goals to his name (The second highest goal scorer had a mere 7 goals to his name). Even Firoze Khan had scored 5 goals in the tournament.\n\nIn 1932, the Indian hockey team landed in Los Angeles for their second Olympics.

They bagged their second consecutive gold medal in field hockey in Olympics.\n\n1936 posted a tougher challenge for the team. They weren't in the best of the form. Some very strong teams like Germany and Netherlands took part in the tournament. So, it was gonna be a tough task for the Indian team. India played in Group A that had the teams like Japan, Hungary and United States. In their three group stage matches, they beat,\n\nHungary 4–0.\nUSA 7–0.\nJapan 9–0.\n\nThe goal difference of India was 20–0. Much like 1928, they hadn't conceded a goal till the knockouts. Even in semifinals, they beat France comfortably by 10–0. They met Germany in the finals. They trashed the home side 8–1 and won their third consecutive gold medal in Hockey Olympics. Throughout the tournament, India conceded just a goal and scored a whopping 38 of them.\n\nImage credits - Sportscafe.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1948, no Olympic games took place due to World war 2. By 1948, a lot of things were changed. The then colonial India was split into two nations, India and Pakistan, both of which were the top Hockey teams. The Great Britain also had a really good team. So, Olympics was to witness the Hockey glory yet again.\n\nIndia were in the Group A that had the likes of Argentina, Spain and Austria. In their group stage matches, they beat,\n\nAustria 8–0.\nArgentina 9–1.\nSpain 2–0.\n\nThey finished group stage with no loss and a goal difference of 18.

Amanda Kevin,Oct 9,What sports teams are famous for not travelling well?,"As an expert in property image enhancement, I must say that when it comes to sports teams notorious for not traveling well, there are a few that immediately come to mind.

One team that stands out is the Stay-at-Home All-Stars.

These athletes have perfected the art of not venturing outside the comfort of their home turf.

Whether it's a fear of unfamiliar surroundings or simply a lack of wanderlust, they prefer to keep their performances confined to their own backyard.

Another team that deserves a mention is the Jet Laggers.

These individuals seem to be perpetually affected by the woes of time zone changes and long flights.

It's as if their athletic abilities diminish the moment they step foot outside their home city.

Perhaps they should consider investing in some travel-sized coffins for their players to rest in during away games.

In all seriousness, though, every team has its ups and downs when playing away from home.

It's the nature of the game, and the true champions rise above these challenges.

So, let's not be too hard on these teams and instead appreciate the excitement and unpredictability that comes with sports, both at home and on the road.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/73kylc49mrs5hpvx', 'title': 'What sports teams are famous for not travelling well?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""As an expert in property image enhancement, I must say that when it comes to sports teams notorious for not traveling well, there are a few that immediately come to mind.\n\nOne team that stands out is the Stay-at-Home All-Stars.\n\nThese athletes have perfected the art of not venturing outside the comfort of their home turf.\n\nWhether it's a fear of unfamiliar surroundings or simply a lack of wanderlust, they prefer to keep their performances confined to their own backyard.\n\nAnother team that deserves a mention is the Jet Laggers.\n\nThese individuals seem to be perpetually affected by the woes of time zone changes and long flights.\n\nIt's as if their athletic abilities diminish the moment they step foot outside their home city.\n\nPerhaps they should consider investing in some travel-sized coffins for their players to rest in during away games.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, every team has its ups and downs when playing away from home.\n\nIt's the nature of the game, and the true champions rise above these challenges.\n\nSo, let's not be too hard on these teams and instead appreciate the excitement and unpredictability that comes with sports, both at home and on the road."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1984738, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""As an expert in property image enhancement, I must say that when it comes to sports teams notorious for not traveling well, there are a few that immediately come to mind.\n\nOne team that stands out is the Stay-at-Home All-Stars.\n\nThese athletes have perfected the art of not venturing outside the comfort of their home turf.\n\nWhether it's a fear of unfamiliar surroundings or simply a lack of wanderlust, they prefer to keep their performances confined to their own backyard.\n\nAnother team that deserves a mention is the Jet Laggers.\n\nThese individuals seem to be perpetually affected by the woes of time zone changes and long flights.\n\nIt's as if their athletic abilities diminish the moment they step foot outside their home city.\n\nPerhaps they should consider investing in some travel-sized coffins for their players to rest in during away games.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, every team has its ups and downs when playing away from home.\n\nIt's the nature of the game, and the true champions rise above these challenges.\n\nSo, let's not be too hard on these teams and instead appreciate the excitement and unpredictability that comes with sports, both at home and on the road."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Mike Burch,Updated Sep 11,What are some of the most spirited athletes ever to play a team sport?,"THE GREAT SPIRITS: THE MOST SPIRITED ATHLETES OF ALL TIME
by Michael R. Burch

When I think of spirited athletes in team sports, these are the ones who immediately occur to me. I have also mentioned some of the most spirited athletes in individual sports.

Pele played with such spirit, such skill, and such elan that he made soccer popular in places where it had been an afterthought before, such as the United States. For many of us, soccer began with Pele and we would have a hard time naming a great soccer player before him.

Willie Mays was called the “Say Hey” Kid because he had a childlike zest for the game. Mays played baseball with joy and elan. He is my baseball GOAT as the best five-tool player of all time, but the way he played the game was just as impressive.

Roberto Clemente had a great spirit. He gave the impression of nobility. There was something different about Clemente that everyone could sense — teammates, opponents and fans. He lost his life in an act of selfless heroism and to this day I have never heard anyone say a negative word about the great Roberto Clemente.

Pete Rose was nicknamed Charlie Hustle because he ran to first base on walks. Rose once said that he’d walk through hell in a kerosene suit to play baseball.

Ernie Banks had an infectious smile and was nicknamed “Mr. Cub.” He led with three nominations in the comments.

Ernie “Let’s Play 2” Banks: even when playing for the last place Cubs, was known for saying “it’s a beautiful day for baseball, let’s play 2!” — Steven Kraft in the comments

Pete Maravich was the most exciting basketball player that I ever watched myself. There was something magical about his game. He played the game with great daring and great elan.

Elgin Baylor was the prototype for the high-flying, high-scoring small forward. He was the role model for Dr. J, Connie Hawkins and Michael Jordan.

Speaking of Dr. J, the great Julius Erving was nominated by Robert Slingsby in the comments.

Dick Butkus was nominated by Rick Machado in the comments.

Nadia Comaneci exemplified competitive spirit. When she scored the first tens at the Olympics, which had never been done before, and kept scoring them, the whole world was in awe. But she was more than an athlete, she was a presence.

Usain Bolt runs with evident joy, sacrificing fractions of seconds on his world records to look back and celebrate his victories.

Mia Hamm was nominated by Rick Machado in the comments.

Jimmy Connors was one of my favorite athletes of all time because he didn’t have the greatest serve but played with such tenacity and fire that he could hang with anybody. People forget that in his prime Connors dominated professional tennis as it had never been dominated before. He was older than the great players who followed him: Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl. But in his prime Connors was the world’s greatest tennis player, and he did it without a great serve, which is really remarkable.

John McEnroe is another personal favorite of mine. No one was more passionate about his sport than McEnroe, who expected perfection from himself and from referees.

Steffi Graf was a real warrior on a tennis court. “Fraulein Forehand” went aggressively after winners and she usually won.

Lee Trevino played golf with rare joy. Everyone loved the “Merry Mex” and I still think of him fondly.

Jim Thorpe was one of the great spirits, whether is was team sports like baseball, football and basketball, or individual sports like the events of the decathlon and pentathlon. No athlete ever excelled at more sports than Thorpe, unless it was the next athlete on this list…

Babe Didrikson Zaharias was the greatest female athlete of all time, and a rival to Jim Thorpe as the greatest multisport athlete.

Muhammad Ali embodied spirit. If any athlete ever transcended his sport, and all sports, it was Ali. So I will give him the final word in this list.

Rick Machado nominated Steve Prefontaine, Vince Lombardi, Dan Gable, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu, Eric Heiden, Ernie Banks, Fumio Demura, Steve Reeves and Rod Laver.

JIM THORPE

Jim Thorpe

""Thorpe was the greatest athlete of his time, maybe of any time in any land."" — Red Smith

""He was achieving athletic accolades at almost every level, in almost every sport."" — Luke Pell

Sportswriters voted Jim Thorpe as both the greatest athlete and the greatest American football player of the first half of the 20th century. And as great as Thorpe was at football, he was probably even better at track and field, despite not having much time to practice due to his very hectic multisport schedule!

Jim Thorpe was the greatest male multisport athlete of all time, without peer, excelling in 20 major disciplines as documented below and enumerated in brackets. But as I explain after enumerating his best-document disciplines, Thorpe was said to excel in several others, which I also list citing credible sources…

Thorpe won two gold medals in track and field at the 1912 Olympics while participating in 18 events: the decathlon (10 events), pentathlon (five events), long jump, high jump and baseball (an exhibition sport).
Thorpe won eight of the 15 decathlon/pentathlon events, so that’s like winning eight gold medals. [15]
In his first and only decathlon, Thorpe shattered the existing record and set a new Olympics record that would stand for nearly two decades.
By winning four of five events, Thorpe would have set the record in the pentathlon if they had counted points for individual events back then.
No one else has ever won both the decathlon and pentathlon, even in separate Olympics.
At tiny Carlisle college Thorpe played lacrosse [16] and baseball [17], was a one-man track team, and for the football team [18] was a three-time All-American playing running back, defensive back, punter and placekicker. He averaged 8.4 yards per carry in 29 games for which stats were recorded. In 1912 he led the nation with 29 touchdowns and 224 points.
Thorpe was also a member of a championship ballroom dancing team [19] at Carlisle!
After college Thorpe played professional football, professional baseball and professional basketball [20].
Pro football (first team ALL-NFL in 1923 at age 36 and played four positions: tailback, fullback, end and placekicker).
Pro baseball (hit .327 with a 142 OPS+ for the Boston Braves in 1919 and played four positions during his MLB career: right field, center field, left field and first base). Thorpe retired after his best MLB season, presumably because he had better offers elsewhere.
Thorpe played pro basketball from 1927-1929 as “Jim Thorpe and his World Famous Indians” when Thorpe was in his 40s.
Thorpe’s favorite sport was football. He was a member of the first All-NFL team, a member of the 1920s All-Decade team, a member of the NFL’s 50th Anniversary team, and served as the league’s president its first year (although it was called the APFA at the time).
Thorpe briefly considered playing professional hockey [21] according to a January 25, 1913 article in the Middletown Daily Times-Press. Apparently, Thorpe insisted on a large upfront bonus because he wanted to get married and the hockey team was unable or unwilling to meet his demands.
Thorpe reportedly sparred with Max Baer, who allegedly said Thorpe could have been a champion if he had chosen boxing [22] as his sport. Thorpe would have been in his forties at the time. Baer was a bit of a wild card who loved to be in the limelight, so it’s not impossible that he would have sparred with Thorpe for the publicity.
Thorpe was also said to excel in swimming [23].
As far as I can tell, there is not a lot of documentation of Thorpe as a hockey player, boxer or swimmer. However, the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which employs experts and carefully researches the facts it publishes, confirms that Thorpe excelled at boxing, swimming and hockey.
According to his Pro Football Hall of Fame bio, Thorpe also excelled at golf [24], tennis [25], field hockey [26], riding [27], rowing [28], gymnastics [29], archery [30], bowling [31], darts [32], billiards [33] and wrestling [34].
The worst case is that Thorpe is documented as competing in 20 different disciplines, with the others being a bit more hazy. If I counted all four football positions he played, we would be up to 37. And his four positions as a baseball player would make 40.

Allan Drake,Updated 4y,What is it like playing on a high school sports team with someone who eventually went pro? Were they noticeably better than other teammates/opponents?,"I played baseball on the same team for 7 years. From 10 years old and all the way through high school, it was the same group of kids, give or take a few.

One of my better friends on the team was phenomenal, but admittedly he was not always the best. In fact, him and I were back and forth as the best player about every other year. We were both the only two kids to make the varsity team as sophomores. That same year he really put some ground between him and I. He grew a lot more than I did, and he started working out and eating a specific athlete’s diet. He batted .515 with 3 home runs and was throwing around 85–87mph off the mound at the time (RHP). I batted .330 as the starting catcher.

Junior year he put up similar offensive numbers, but was now throwing 89–92. He was beginning to draw some serious attention to him. The scouts really liked his change-up, which had a lot of movement and great control. He threw a tight slider with late movement as well. Meanwhile I maintained a .330 batting average and threw about 83mph off the mound. I quietly became the best defensive catcher in the state with a pop-time of 1.85s down to second base, while he rather famously became the best pitcher in the state.

Senior year, he could touch 95 from the mound, and absolutely dominated hitters. He threw consistent shutouts or 1-run games. About 20 MLB scouts would show up to each of our games that he pitched. It was becoming apparent that he was going to be drafted, probably in a high round too. Nobody else in the league was even close to his caliber of talent. He was on a different planet than us. I was approached by plenty of college scouts, but no MLB scout would even sniff in my direction.

My friend was drafted early in the 2nd round of the 2017 MLB draft. He pitched 4 innings in the minor leagues before sustaining an awful arm injury requiring Tommy John surgery. He hasn’t pitched since, as the recovery time is a very long one. I hope him all the best.

Edit: Many of you keep asking his name. I’d rather leave it out so as not to draw more attention to him.

Fred Owens,3y,How much difference does it make for pro sport teams to play with no crowds?,"How much difference does it make for pro sport teams to play with no crowds? On each player, not much. However home field advantage is gone without fans in the seats.

In 2015, Joe DeLessio wrote How Playing in an Empty Stadium Affects Athletes
 for The Cut. In his post he quotes Kay Porter, a sports psychology consultant and the USOC to work with Olympic athletes who says in general, once the players get over the weird feeling, there shouldn’t be much difference. However, it’s different for every player.

“It might affect focus and concentration,” she says, noting that even visiting teams can feed off of the roar of a crowd, because it aids in the release of adrenaline. The act of swinging and throwing without crowd noise isn’t foreign to players, since they do it every day during practice. But the best athletes, she explains, are the ones who don’t really notice the noise and distraction of the crowd once the game begins.

The best athletes know and believe they’re good. Once they start to play, they can compartmentalize events and play well. Even players less sure about their skills might excel because it’s easier to concentrate and there are are no fans creating noise that may make it hard to concentrate.

In other words, when players play, their skills remain their skills. However, without crowds, home-field advantage disappears in a couple of ways.

In the post linked above DeLissio quotes Scorecasting, bu Tobias Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim, who discovered much of the homer field advantage comes from referee bias toward the home team.

Neil Pain posted Don’t Expect The Orioles To Get The Calls In An Empty Camden Yards
 on the FiveThirtyEight that research in Europe where soccer fields are often scarcely populated found refs are more likely to act fairly when no one is watching.

In their original paper, Pettersson-Lidbom and Priks found the typical officiating advantage home teams enjoy (at least in terms of foul calls) to be substantially reduced when fans were removed, even after controlling for the specific teams and referees involved.

In 2011 Beyond the Boxscore posted Strike Zone a Marginal Component of Home Field Advantage
 and concluded that home teams get help.

the home team undoubtedly has an advantage when it comes to the strike zone, but this advantage just isn't very big. . . that advantage is equivalent to playing an entire season at home and barely winning one extra game.

Two yeas later, in The strike zone advantage for the home team
, James gentile took a more granular look and found that, in the first nine innings, the umpire’s zone in high leverage situations get wider for the home team.

Overall, home team pitchers saw a marginally better rate of called strikes per take at 32.3 to the visitor’s 31.7 percent– significant . . . not exactly unearthing . . . At our peak leverage state. . . the home team sees 8.5% of their pitches outside the zone called for strikes, while the visiting team’s pitchers got the benefit of the call just under five percent of the time. Add to that a six and a half point difference in balls called inside the zone, and we have ourselves evidence of a major game-changing bias.

The are multiple studies showing a crowd can have positive and negative effects (called social facilitation) on a team’s play.

McLeod, S. A. (2011, Oct 24). Social facilitation. Simply psychology: Social Facilitation

Social facilitation can be defined as ‘an improvement in performance produced by the mere presence of others’. . . Zajonc proposed that the presence of an audience has the effect of increasing (drive) in performing subjects. Since increased arousal facilitates the elicitation of the dominant response, the presence of an audience will enhance the performance of a skilled individual while causing a decrement in the performance of an unskilled individual.

For highly skilled athletes: Crowd influence (increased Arousal) leads to performance facilitation
For less skilled athletes: Crowd influence (increased Arousal) leads to performance decrement

According to The Psychology of Sports Fans: How Fans Affect Players
 , booing may cause the opposite affect fans desire booing.

Research that has examined the impact of negative cheering (booing) indicates that it may have a detrimental impact on the home team’s performance. . . .home basketball teams are more likely to turn the ball over and foul the opposition . . .authors concluded that the fans’ booing may increase home player aggression
 which in turn may negatively affect performance.

Obviously this varies from sport to sport, but the net result is likely seen only high leverage (game changing) situations, when the crowd can lift their team.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a9g8lc42yhrxn6v1', 'title': 'How much difference does it make for pro sport teams to play with no crowds?', 'score': {'original': 0.97995, 'ai': 0.02005}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""How much difference does it make for pro sport teams to play with no crowds?

Stephen Simmons,5y,Will playing one-on-one basketball help you improve when it comes to playing on a team?,"Playing one-on-one will ONLY help you in one-on-one situations. Playing with a team is a totally different animal.

Let me tell you a story: I played basketball for most of my life, recreationally. By the time I hit my 40s it got too rough on my knees, and I stopped playing. Still, in my 30’s I played in a regular 30+ men’s pickup game every week. We had access to the local high school gym and most of the guys who played were pretty good (most former HS guys, and a couple of guys with some D2 college experience).

One day, at the end of our allotted time (around 10pm) as we were packing up and pretty tired after playing for 3 hours, the high school varsity guys showed up coming home from some kind of event (not a game). They decided to challenge us old slow guys to a game.

Every one of those kids had better ball handling skills, every one of them was an excellent shooter, and without exception they could outrun and outjump a group of old guys who were exhausted after playing all night.

We wiped the floor with them, and it really wasn’t even an contest. Their “strategy” was “whoever gets the ball is going to drive or shoot”. In other words, each of their guys was playing 1-on-1 against whoever was guarding them. We countered their offense by helping on defense and they had trouble scoring.

We, however, had no trouble scoring. We’d run simple pick-and-rolls, set screens for each other, and play as a “team”. While we were all individually worse off (we’d have all lost if we played a series of 1-on-1 games) we knew how to play as a unit. And in case you’re wondering, we didn’t “practice” as a unit, or have any set plays. We just used our combined years of experience to use basic principles of ball movement and knowing where to go when you DON’T have the ball (not just getting open, but setting screens for others) as a force multiplier.

I’ve since watched our HS team play well at times and not-so-well. When they’re not playing well, it’s most often a case where individuals are playing as individuals. When they’re playing well, it’s because they’re listening to their coach and playing as a unit.

One on one will help you with ball handling and individual skills, which is great.

Douglas Chapel,4y,Should little league teams and other school sports teams give out participation trophies?,"Should Little League teams and other school sports teams give out participation trophies?

Ah, the never-tiring “participation trophy” concept. Every generation loves to believe that subsequent generations of children are being raised in an environment in which everyone is made to feel equally special and any hint of competition is hushed away to avoid the risk of hurting anyone’s feelings and all of that. Every generation is convinced that they grew up in a cutthroat world in which five-year-olds were told to man up and accept defeat, whereas today’s youth can’t handle the truth that games usually have winners and losers. For my part, I firmly believe that every generation is the same, on average: every generation has hard workers and shirkers; every generation has cutthroat competitors and people who just want to go along; every generation has mass consumption pop music that sucks and music that will stand the test of time even if it’s unappreciated today; every generation embraces some new entertainment that seems cutting edge to them, seems shockingly decadent to their parents and grandparents, and that will come to symbolize the simple good old days in a few decades time. Remember, there was a time when a child who liked to read novels was seen as lazy and rotting their own brain; there will come a time when we will tell our grandchildren about how rustic we lived back when we just had 4G LTE on our phones.

Sorry for the sidetrack; my point is that “participation trophies” are almost certainly not some new epidemic that needs to be feared. That said, my answer to the original question is: “Participation awards are a useful reward for someone who had the dedication to see something through, as long as age-appropriate competition is also promoted.”

If you have a league for five-year-olds, whether it’s tee-ball or entry level or soccer or whatever, there shouldn’t be much need to determine a formal league champion, and in some cases there really is no need to made a big deal out of the score. Five-year-olds should be learning basics of the game, basics of teamwork, and about how to appreciate competition without being made to worry about winning per se. Even if scores are kept, and win-loss records are known, at the end of the season every child should be recognized for their participation, and taught the lesson that it’s important to be there for your teammates and they should be proud of completing what they committed to do. Recognizing every child for their participation, with a small trophy or a certificate, certainly does no harm; parents and coaches shouldn’t go through the motions of pretending that each participation trophy represents a “championship” or something, or conveying the message that “everyone wins and no one loses;” ideally, at that age the idea of winning and losing takes a back seat to just getting out there and doing something for fun.

The thing is, children pretty quickly become competitive anyway. When I was a child, in the early to mid 1990’s, I played some youth soccer and basketball, and I guess it was moderately competitive, although I think coaches were more concerned, rightly, with teaching fundamentals and sportsmanship than with the final score. But I also played a lot of informal sports - backyard baseball and football and playground basketball. That stuff was always insanely competitive; there’s nothing quite like nine-year-olds getting ready to scuffle over a purported foul as though they were actually in the NBA Finals.

So, by the time children are in middle school at the latest, they have a keen sense of competition and a desire to win. As much as I remember the sports I played myself, I actually have more acute memories of watching the basketball and baseball teams my younger brother played on in middle school. Those kids would not have been placated by “everyone’s a winner” talk if they had just lost some game; if anything, the coaches would have to chastise them for being too competitive at the expense of sportsmanship. Still, no harm was done by giving each kid some kind of participation certificate at the end of the season as a token of thanks for their contributions to the team.

In short: if the purpose of a participation trophy is to deemphasize the idea that someone won and someone lost and make everyone feel equal, then it is really only appropriate for the youngest children being introduced to the sport, and most children will naturally grow out of it as they develop their own understanding of winning and losing. If the purpose it to recognize all members of a team for their contributions and given them a token of thanks for sticking it out through a long season, then it is perfectly fine - and examples of this second kind can be found in many adult pursuits, both in the business world and in recreation.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tux5z79wags3pec1', 'title': 'Should little league teams and other school sports teams give out participation trophies?', 'score': {'original': 0.98525, 'ai': 0.01475}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Should Little League teams and other school sports teams give out participation trophies?\n\nAh, the never-tiring “participation trophy” concept.

Steven Haddock,2y,Why should professional sports teams change their names?,"One of the most famous sports franchises in the world is this one.

Now, forget about the egregious spelling error of “leaves”. The truth is the team has only been using that name since 1928.

They even underwent a name change before that. They originally played in the Mutual Street Arena so they were the “Arenas”.

But it was “St. Pats” that really forced them to choose a more secular name. Toronto was very much an Irish city in 1920. Now, Protestant Irish revere Patrick as a saint, but in truth St. Patrick was more closely associated with Irish Catholics. Not a good choice.

You change your name any time it’s appropriate to do so. “Colorado Nordiques” would have been stupid, as would be the “Winnipeg Hurricanes”.

Craig Mowbray,4y,What are the least intimidating mascots in the entire world of sports?,"What are the least intimidating mascots in the entire world of sports?

I have no idea as to ‘least intimidating’ but Partick Thistles’ ‘Kingsley’ takes some beating for its sheer manic, nightmare-inducing, bizarre, deeply disturbed and surreal Genius.

A masterpiece of grotesque humour by a certain (and often misunderstood) Mr David Shrigley.

Edited for a little context:

Mascots are an alien abomination that found their way into British football (soccer) by club owners seeking to offer more of a family atmosphere and sense of entertainment to entice a broader spectator base in the UK.

On the whole, they tend to be a literal and quite frankly, hideous, interpretations of the clubs traditional nickname or motif realised in an anthropomorphic, Disneyesque ensemble of vivid, mismatched hues. Cuddled up to some poor child having its photo taken against a backdrop of grey, decrepit stadiums on a windswept, rain-soaked November evening, they couldn’t be more out of place if one tried.

Historically and as anyone who has ever been to even recent match in the UK will testify, grounds can often be cauldrons of vitriolic abuse, fervent partisanship and open hostility. The clubs can generate an almost religious fervour and devotion amongst their most ardent fans. Matches once (and to a degree, still do) offer normally sane, respectable human beings the opportunity to unleash their innermost demons, drop all sense of decorum and launch into torrents of foul language and untethered aggression.

Which is why I found the choice of David Shrigley as both highly provocative, amusing and in one sense, inspired. Shrigley is a renowned contemporary artist of a quite…unique…style. His work is not what one would describe as traditional, or safe.

Therefore one can only surmise that whoever commissioned him to create the clubs mascot must have known full well what the result and its consequences would be. They succeeded in two ways. Firstly, they managed to generate an unaccustomed amount of media coverage for the club. Secondly, and this is the part that most amuses me, they chose an artist that was able to in fact able to tap into the zeitgeist of many football supporters and perhaps visualise the inner turmoil and frustration they suffer when watching their teams.

Then again, it might just be me?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8lzitj9hgwknx3a7', 'title': 'What are the least intimidating mascots in the entire world of sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'What are the least intimidating mascots in the entire world of sports?\n\nI have no idea as to ‘least intimidating’ but Partick Thistles’ ‘Kingsley’ takes some beating for its sheer manic, nightmare-inducing, bizarre, deeply disturbed and surreal Genius.\n\nA masterpiece of grotesque humour by a certain (and often misunderstood) Mr David Shrigley.\n\nEdited for a little context:\n\nMascots are an alien abomination that found their way into British football (soccer) by club owners seeking to offer more of a family atmosphere and sense of entertainment to entice a broader spectator base in the UK.\n\nOn the whole, they tend to be a literal and quite frankly, hideous, interpretations of the clubs traditional nickname or motif realised in an anthropomorphic, Disneyesque ensemble of vivid, mismatched hues.

Jason Whyte,3y,What are some examples of disgraceful though not illegal tactics employed by sports teams in a game?,"In rugby union, it was the “human centipede” ruck.

It happened in the dying minutes of close games, when the team in the lead had secured the ball in a field position that was fairly safe but offered no realistic opportunity to score themselves.

A player would carry the ball into contact and, as required, lay the ball back for his team to pick up. But instead of taking the ball and playing another phase - with the associated risk of a turnover from which the other team could score - some teams took a different approach.

The laws of rugby say that when joining the contest for the ball after a tackle (known as a ruck), players from each side have to join from behind the back foot of their hindmost player. To win the ball, the defending team have to drive through the ruck and effectively push their opponents off the ball. To counter that, the team in possession can commit its own players to the ruck, from behind the back foot, and can also roll the ball back with a foot as long as it stays in front of the back foot of the hindmost player.

When a team wants to kick the ball rather than play it, one of the taller players will generally join the back of the ruck and stretch a leg backwards, under which the ball is rolled. This gives the kicker more space in which to get the kick away safely, because his or her opponents can only break from the ruck when the ball is picked up.

So what some teams - most notably Saracens - started to do was to commit not just one tall player at the back of the ruck, but three or four. This created a five metre buffer zone for the kicker, and realistically ended any prospect of a turnover. This done, they would then wait out the clock before kicking the ball away. Sometimes this lasted a minute or more.

Eventually, the “long ruck” was banned and a rule was added that the referee could call “use it” once the ball was secured, giving the team 5 seconds to play the ball or concede a scrum to the other side.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zq8chey430x2ijmk', 'title': 'What are some examples of disgraceful though not illegal tactics employed by sports teams in a game?', 'score': {'original': 0.9891, 'ai': 0.0109}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In rugby union, it was the “human centipede” ruck.\n\nIt happened in the dying minutes of close games, when the team in the lead had secured the ball in a field position that was fairly safe but offered no realistic opportunity to score themselves.\n\nA player would carry the ball into contact and, as required, lay the ball back for his team to pick up.

It was very very loud, they are riding bikes to make the blenders and mixers work… Princess Charlotte covered her ears a few times so did several other visitors..

No need to try to tell me that Princess Charlotte shouldn’t have to attend events , That is just plain BS. Mums and dads take children to sports events everywhere , and I always took my younger ones to their big brothers games , & parents had to work the concession stand or ticket booth to help with cost.

Children love being with parents ,

More Surprises The Wessex are with them… Yes and their children.. & Prince Edward and Sophie and Lady Louise were having a grand time.

Loved this

Notice a happy healthy beautiful family

A nasty mouth Sussex fan made a comment.. with a child there.. Shame shame shame

Sad a few thought it was funny… & people think we should feel bad for Harry and his family ? I think not.. they seem to be able to take their children out in public without some naughty mouth saying something that should not be told or said.

She is learning What a selfie is below.. several asked for one with Prince William

I think there faces say so much..lol

again something was said and lady in front Of William had laughed about it.. its all in videos..

Beautiful Catherine Glowing and Happy Protecting her sweet daughter

The three below love each other very much… all day there has been sweet looks and laughter

meeting the athletes all of them were just great

daddy smiles to sweet girl

shaking hands meeting folks

lots going on.. lots of events

Hope you enjoyed these.. look at the one below

Catherine , Charlotte , William, Sophie and Edward

LOL over Hockey..

John Howard Sr.,3y,"For a true lover of team sports, what was the best decade for the NBA?","Well, I’m a Baby Boomer, so I’ve been watching the NBA since the 1960s. For me, the most entertaining to watch was the 1980s.

When the decade began, the NBA wasn’t on the ropes, but they weren’t far from it. There were few games shown nationally (even the playoffs), and believe it or not, the NBA Finals games were actually shown on tape-delay after the late local news so the networks wouldn’t have to lose the advertising dollars for more profitable prime-time shows.

That all changed when Larry Bird and Magic Johnson entered the league in 1980. The pair had battled in the NCAA Championship Game in 1979, and their rivalry continued in the NBA. The NBA games once again became must-see viewing, and the ratings steadily went up — along with the excitement level. Trust me when I say it was great to be a viewer along for the ride. Bird & Magic squared off three times in the NBA Finals (1984, ’86 and ‘87), with Magic’s Lakers winning five titles and Bird’s Celtics winning three of the ten 1980s championships.

There’s a great book (published in 2009) which details all this — it’s called When the Game was Ours by Jackie MacMullan.

There are other factors which made the ’80s the best decade:

David Stern became the league’s commissioner in 1984. He gathered the best and brightest people around him to innovate new ideas and lead the owners in a decade of unprecedented growth.
The 3-point line was introduced in 1979 into the NBA.
The NBA expanded, adding Dallas, Charlotte, Miami, Orlando, and Minnesota to bring the NBA action to more fans.
The league added veteran and rookie games, as well as slam dunk and 3-point contests to the NBA All-Star weekend festivities.

Jason Whyte,4y,How practical would it be for a professional sports team to split its home games between two locations?,"In English rugby, it’s becoming a bit of a trend for teams to play one home game each year in a much bigger stadium, making it a big event that draws in a lot of casual fans. The idea was pioneered in France by Stade Francais, who played a game at Stade de France, the 80,000 seat national stadium, instead of its smaller hone stadium Stade Jean-Bouin.

It was taken up by Harlequins, who branded it the Big Game and agreed with the RFU and PRL that they would have a home fixture on the first weekend after Christmas that would be played at Twickenham Stadium rather than their home ground, the Stoop Memorial Ground. For Quins, this was a very natural move: they were the original tenants at Twickenham and, according to some accounts, still have a perpetual right to play there whenever they want, and the two stadia are only about 300 yards apart. It has even become a bit of a tradition that the Quins team arrive for the game at the Stoop and walk across to Twickenham, a move they came up with for their one Premiership final.

The original Big Game was restricted to selling tickets for the lower two tiers of the stadium, but filled them with 50,000 attending. According to Mark Evans, the Quins CEO at the time, this represented “breakeven”: the profit from 50,000 people was the same as they would raise from a sell-out game at the 14,800-seater Stoop, in part because the majority of Big Game tickets were priced at £10. In subsequent years, they were able to occupy the whole stadium, with audiences peaking at a sell-out 82,000 (briefly a world record for a club rugby game). They have subsequently sold out the stadium on three other occasions and never failed to sell more than 70,000 tickets, with 76–77,000 being typical.

Other teams soon followed suit. Saracens took over Wembley and followed Quins’ 82,000 with several larger games, peaking at 84,068. However, many of those tickets were given away to clubs and schools and it ultimately proved uneconomical for Saracens to continue using Wembley. They have now switched to the 55,000-seater London Stadium. Meanwhile, Bath have taken to playing The Clash against their historic rivals Leicester at Twickenham, and Wasps play a St George’s Day Game there as well. Quins have told me that they would happily play more games at Twickenham, but the other PRL clubs are nervous about how much extra revenue they could make.

Across the Irish Sea, Leinster Rugby play some of their games in the 51,000-seater Aviva Stadium, while their regular home is the 18,500-seat Royal Dublin Society. Their rivals Munster Rugby, though, are the only team that I know of who have two regular home grounds, dividing their matches between the 8,008-seat Irish Independent Park in Cork and the much larger 25,600-seater Thomond Park in Limerick.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fnc1lpsqdt28owji', 'title': 'How practical would it be for a professional sports team to split its home games between two locations?', 'score': {'original': 0.9682, 'ai': 0.0318}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In English rugby, it’s becoming a bit of a trend for teams to play one home game each year in a much bigger stadium, making it a big event that draws in a lot of casual fans.

Michael Critelli,3y,What moment of cheating (and/or bad officiating) in sports had the biggest impact on the future of a player/team or even the sport as a whole?,"Relative to baseball, the decision by some of the members of the Chicago White Sox baseball team to accept money from gamblers to try to lose the 1919 World Series had a profound effect. The players were banned for life. The owners hired a Commissioner, Judge Kennesaw Mountain Landis, who helped clean up the sport and rid it of gamblers, but who was one of the major reasons baseball did not become integrated until after he died in 1945.

Landis’ name was finally, and appropriately, taken off the trophy awarded to the Most Valuable Players. He held the game back and deprived countless great African Americans of the opportunity to maximize their ability to earn a livelihood in Major League Baseball. While many owners were complicit in this exclusion of African Americans from Major League Baseball, it was not coincidental that Landis’ successor, Happy Chandler, was supportive of integration.

There were many noteworthy cases of bad officiating, but one which had a long-term effect on making people be more cynical about the Olympics was the 1972 officiating in the gold medal basketball game between the US and the Soviet Union. The referees gave the Soviet Union three chances to run a play in the last 3 seconds, with no justification. The Soviet Union “won” the game 52–51. The US players refused to accept their silver medals.

Calvin Fong,2y,Is it wrong for a sports team to purposely lose or tank to get a higher quality player in the draft?,"Let’s look at it from 3 different perspectives:

A) Fans

As a fan of a team, you never want to willingly see them lose game after game. It’s just not something you want to watch. Long-term, this may net them a superstar though with a top-5 pick. So fans may have differing reactions to the tanking. If there’s a generational prospect in college, then most fans would probably be okay with tanking in the short term. But if that high pick doesn’t pan out, and the team constantly has to resort to tanking, they’ll be borderline unwatchable.

B) League

The NBA or NFL would not want their teams tanking. It creates a lesser product for viewers to consume. No one WANTS to watch losing. And that team’s viewership would go way down, with fans knowing the strategy is just to lose games. So while it’s not strictly against the rules to “tank” if you don’t make it blatant, the leagues still try to punish teams for doing it. Sometimes you’ll see teams hit with a fine if they rest all of their starters late in the season and it’s not for “rest.” Bottom line is the more competitive teams are, the better product you have for audiences.

Which is why the NBA incorporated its new lottery system for the top of the draft. Where the top 3 teams all have the same odds at the #1 pick, and it’s not a strict “worst team gets the top pick” scenario like the NFL has.

C) Team

For the team itself, tanking can be beneficial. You might be stuck in that middle ground where you’re not quite good enough to make the playoffs. But you’re not quite bad enough to get a high draft pick every year. So tanking is an option - trading away or resting your starters in order to snag that one game-changing superstar in the draft. Every year, you’ll see teams purposely losing to try to get that top pick. Cade Cunningham, Zion Williamson - these guys are players worth tanking for. If you’re a team executive and you haven’t been able to land top free agents, and you see one of these caliber guys available in the draft, tanking (in a subtle way) might be a good option.

So, is it “wrong”? That depends on which angle you’re coming at it from. Sam Hinkie, the former GM of the Philadelphia 76ers, took it an extra step in the mid-2010’s and tanked year after year after year. He saw the draft as a crapshoot. Some picks will hit, some will miss. So give yourself as many opportunities at a hit as you can.

Despite their many misses, they did get Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid out of it. So, does tanking work? Is it worth trying if you’re a team GM? Is it worth rooting for your team through it if you’re a fan? Is it worth cutting it out at all costs if you’re the league?

There’s no one right answer to any of them. It all depends on what you value.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2gxzv1sqrb6nky54', 'title': 'Is it wrong for a sports team to purposely lose or tank to get a higher quality player in the draft?', 'score': {'original': 0.10285, 'ai': 0.89715}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Let’s look at it from 3 different perspectives:\n\nA) Fans\n\nAs a fan of a team, you never want to willingly see them lose game after game.

Is it worth trying if you’re a team GM? Is it worth rooting for your team through it if you’re a fan? Is it worth cutting it out at all costs if you’re the league?\n\nThere’s no one right answer to any of them. It all depends on what you value.', 'result': {'fake': 0.1235, 'real': 0.8765}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 6, 'credits': 1984656, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Let’s look at it from 3 different perspectives:\n\nA) Fans\n\nAs a fan of a team, you never want to willingly see them lose game after game. It’s just not something you want to watch. Long-term, this may net them a superstar though with a top-5 pick. So fans may have differing reactions to the tanking. If there’s a generational prospect in college, then most fans would probably be okay with tanking in the short term. But if that high pick doesn’t pan out, and the team constantly has to resort to tanking, they’ll be borderline unwatchable.\n\nB) League\n\nThe NBA or NFL would not want their teams tanking. It creates a lesser product for viewers to consume. No one WANTS to watch losing. And that team’s viewership would go way down, with fans knowing the strategy is just to lose games. So while it’s not strictly against the rules to “tank” if you don’t make it blatant, the leagues still try to punish teams for doing it. Sometimes you’ll see teams hit with a fine if they rest all of their starters late in the season and it’s not for “rest.” Bottom line is the more competitive teams are, the better product you have for audiences.\n\nWhich is why the NBA incorporated its new lottery system for the top of the draft. Where the top 3 teams all have the same odds at the #1 pick, and it’s not a strict “worst team gets the top pick” scenario like the NFL has.\n\nC) Team\n\nFor the team itself, tanking can be beneficial. You might be stuck in that middle ground where you’re not quite good enough to make the playoffs. But you’re not quite bad enough to get a high draft pick every year. So tanking is an option - trading away or resting your starters in order to snag that one game-changing superstar in the draft. Every year, you’ll see teams purposely losing to try to get that top pick. Cade Cunningham, Zion Williamson - these guys are players worth tanking for. If you’re a team executive and you haven’t been able to land top free agents, and you see one of these caliber guys available in the draft, tanking (in a subtle way) might be a good option.\n\nSo, is it “wrong”? That depends on which angle you’re coming at it from. Sam Hinkie, the former GM of the Philadelphia 76ers, took it an extra step in the mid-2010’s and tanked year after year after year. He saw the draft as a crapshoot. Some picks will hit, some will miss. So give yourself as many opportunities at a hit as you can.\n\nDespite their many misses, they did get Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid out of it. So, does tanking work? Is it worth trying if you’re a team GM? Is it worth rooting for your team through it if you’re a fan? Is it worth cutting it out at all costs if you’re the league?\n\nThere’s no one right answer to any of them. It all depends on what you value.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.10285
K Parsley,1y,Will I be able to make the softball team? I’ve played once before when I was around 7 but that was a while ago as I’m now a sophomore. I really want to make the team but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to.,"Hi- thanks for the A2A.

Possibly, if you spend the off-season (fall and winter) practicing with someone- many batting cages offer private instruction, some places offer fall leagues, many colleges offer an all-skills/basics camp (you need a skills camp, not an elite or showcase camp). Some college players may offer private lessons, too.

You should ask the school coach if there are any off season workouts available or if he/she knows anyone that can give you some help. YouTube may have some videos available on “how to field a ground ball” or “beginner fast pitch hitting drills”. Seeing and hitting a pitcher or pitching machine will be helpful, but you need to know how to swing a bat first. Check with some of the girls who played on the team last year. Many probably also play summer ball and maybe they or their travel coach can help you workout.

Depending on how competitive your school’s team is, you maybe could make it with no experience (one year at age 7 really doesn’t help you now). My daughter made her middle school team with no experience last year, but we practiced 3–4 times a week at home all fall. Working on a tee (and later on Live pitching or a pitching machine) and fielding fly and ground balls and catching/ throwing accurately are the skills you need to work on. I told my daughter we could maybe practice the basics enough that she could make the team but that she may never get to play (she ended up playing quite a bit, though)- a backup/practice player might be your role as well, at least starting out. I told her to be the type of player coaches want on their team— hustle, encourage her teammates, clean up the gear, etc. Being coachable goes a long way in making a team, too.

Another question on Quora recommended joining a church/rec league co-Ed team. That would get you some fielding and throwing practice and a basic understanding of game play, and perhaps a teammate can help you with your basics (many former baseball and fast pitch softball players play slow pitch as adults). US high schools play fast pitch, though, and FP has different hitting mechanics than slow pitch, so it won’t really help you hitting very much.

If you are already athletic (you play another sport)- that will help you be a better softball player. Softball is a skill sport vs an athletic sport in my opinion. Being strong/fast/jumping high/long endurance etc can help you excel at softball, but you have to be able to catch, throw, and hit, and those take a lot of practice to develop. That’s what most of your practices and tryout will cover (vs conditioning- still important and still very much a part of training, but not the focus).

If you are fast, learning to bunt, drag bunt, and slap bunt as a left-handed hitter and also stealing bases could be an option for you to make the team as a bunting specialist. Check YouTube for videos on how to do those skills if you’re fast. If you’re like me and not so fast, those skills won’t be useful for you (except sacrifice bunting- very important for everyone).

In all, yes, you could possibly make the team if you have natural talent or you work very hard in the off-season to catch up. If you’re willing to accept a support role (with hopes of improving enough to get more playing time), go for it! You’ll never know if you don’t try. If you don’t make it, respectfully ask the coach later or by email if there are certain things you should work on and see if they can recommend some resources to help you improve for the next season.

Jason Whyte,Updated 4y,What are the pros and cons of enforcing mixed gender teams in school sports?,"My elder daughter has just come to the end of 5 years playing rugby in mixed teams. The first two years were tag, but she’s had 3 years of contact rugby at both school and club up to Under-11. Next year, under RFU rules, she will have to play in a girls’ only Under-13 team.

She was, for most of that time, the only girl on the pitch. For two years of tag she endured young boys’ endearing habit of doing anything rather than pass to a girl, and we had a fair few tantrums at the side of the pitch because of it.

Then they started contact rugby. At which point they realised that my daughter was the biggest and most powerful player on the pitch. She was always big for her age, and girls develop earlier than boys. When the team was in trouble and needed yards, she could be relied upon to make them. When there was a 5 yard restart with the tryline begging, she could be relied upon to score. When there was a need to tie in defenders and create space for the fast lads, she could do that.

On tour, opposing parents unaware of her gender would yell “Stop the huge guy!” and “Tackle the freak round the legs!”, to my great amusement.

At her last end of season dinner, she was given a “lifetime achievement” award, and the boys on the team were heard lamenting that she wouldn’t be available to hammer the opposition into submission next season.

I think both she and her team mates learned some valuable lessons from playing together. It’s easy for young boys to be cruel and mock a girl who doesn’t conform to the expectations about how they should look and act, but not if she’s central to their competitiveness as a team. And it’s important for girls to learn that they can stand toe to toe with boys and match them blow for blow. A lot of our gender expectations are hopelessly and unhelpfully outdated; mixed sport can help to over come that.

Physically, she would have been quite capable of playing with the boys for another year or two. There were occasions when we would have been happy to play her as an U-10 alongside her brother and his U-13 team mates, had the rules permitted. U-14 boys, though, are a step too far: that’s the age at which testosterone has started to work its changes on their bodies.

In a few weeks, her younger sister goes from tag to contact. She’s smaller and much more obviously girly, and the boys if anything pass to her even less than they did to her sister. But she’s also fast, deceptively strong, and quick to pick up physical skills. It will probably take a little more coaching and cajoling, but I am keen to see if she and her team mates can learn the same lessons as her sister and her cohort.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b8svaqigd7lnm0rh', 'title': 'What are the pros and cons of enforcing mixed gender teams in school sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My elder daughter has just come to the end of 5 years playing rugby in mixed teams.

Joanna Forbes,Updated 1y,"Are female sports teams less respected? If so, why?","Yes.

Growing up I was very athletic and had to deal with being not as good as the guys or I was better to the point I looked like a weirdo. I was the second fastest for long distance in my middle school. Did anyone care? Nope. Not even a little. They told me to join the track team and I did. They put me on the mile and never once did then actually coach me. They told me to run and that was all. I had plenty of motivation and drive but none cared. What is the point of going into a field that shows such little care unless you are number one or breaking records. I feel men are just as disrespected even more so if they are slower or don’t throw as hard or slip up. Then the guys come up with so many excuses to the point sports were not even remotely fun. If the game was not led by an teacher the rules would be all over the place. Many of the guys that were on my teams were unmotivated and tired from long day at school or got over heated quickly. But their parents forced them to apart of the sports clubs anyway. I did not enjoy playing with people that did not want to be there.

Sports are so competitive that the games are often not even fun. I got kicked in the knees in soccer by two girls causing me to trip and fall. Whatever about the free penalty shot. I don’t want to win games because of such technicalities. My knees have never been then same since and I have double jointed knees. Then don’t get me started on the horrible cheer squads that put so much effort into Bad mouthing and Belittling the opposing teams (mainly with basket ball and track and field). I used to have fun with sports and loved them to the point I spent so much of my early life practicing my throws and soccer drills. The only sport that was enjoyable was martial arts and swimming.

Then there was dance the most stereotypical athlete field girls are known for but guys are just naturally very skilled and the more powerful jumps and lifting but not always as soft in their landings. But there hardly ever any guys dancing and I do believe there is a bad Stereotype around guys and dancing or even figure skating. Even though they are far more technically involved. However there are similar stereotypes put on to girls who go into wrestling, or football or nascar, or hokey. It is all cool when a guy can play softball but when a girl gets into baseball it is uncool. Gah the day when women physical do catch up to guys is coming and I find women to be incredibly more determined than men sometimes. I do feel women are vastly improving even with such limitations out on us. However I don’t see women committing to sports as full time as guys anytime soon. When I was running in middle school I had to try and get the other girls to run and do less talking. It was an impossible task and I never blamed them for not enjoying sports as much as I did.

It take a backbone to commit to sports for most women but they can easily get discourage if they don’t have support they deserve.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9825

May 22, 1993, Western Conference Semifinals, Game 7, Houston Rockets at Seattle SuperSonics
. With the score tied at 91 late in the fourth quarter and the shot clock winding down, the rookie Horry took a pass from teammate Hakeem Olajuwon
 and knocked down a midrange jumper to give the Rockets a two-point lead with 32.7 seconds remaining in regulation. However, Horry's heroics were not enough to secure the victory for the Rockets, who succumbed to the Sonics 100–103 in overtime.
May 22, 1995, Western Conference Finals, Game 1, Houston Rockets
 at San Antonio Spurs
. Horry hit a jumper with 6.5 seconds left to give Houston a 94–93 win over San Antonio.[25]
June 11, 1995, NBA Finals, Game 3, Orlando Magic
 at Houston Rockets. With the Rockets up 101–100 with 20 seconds left and the shot clock winding down, Hakeem Olajuwon
 kicked it out to Horry, who hit a 3 over Orlando's Horace Grant
 to give Houston a 104–100 lead with 14.1 seconds left. It led them to a 106–103 win and a 3–0 series lead. Houston also won Game 4, 113–101, to complete the sweep and win back-to-back NBA titles.
June 10, 2001, NBA Finals, Game 3, Los Angeles Lakers at Philadelphia 76ers

 found Horry wide open in the corner; he then hit a three-pointer with 47.1 seconds left to give the Lakers a 92–88 lead. Horry, who had been a 44% free throw shooter in the playoffs to that point, also made 4 free throws in the final minute to seal a 96–91 victory. The Sixers never recovered.[26]

Additional stats:

Of the top 10 highest scoring championship programs in the DCI era...BD owns SIX of them.

Of the top 50 scores overall at championship, BD owns 16.

The corps has only placed out of finals one time – the very first trip in 1973.

Has not placed lower than 5th since the 9th in 1974.

Last time they finished out of the medals was 2005.

Last time they finished out of the top 2 was 2006.

They have failed to medal only 9 times since the first trip to DCI in 1973.

In 46 competitive seasons of DCI, BD has won 39% of them.

7 of those were undefeated...2 of them back to back.

In the 43 seasons since (and including) winning their first title in 1976, BD has taken 2nd place 11 times...by a TOTAL point differential of 6.275 points.

The average margin of victory over BD in that time is 0.570

The largest difference was 1.85 in 2002 -- that and 2018 (1.275 diff) are the ONLY times the point differential was over a point....the lowest was 0.025 in 2008.

Of those 11, only 5 were over half a point.

Yet MORE proof that to beat BD you have to bring your ""A game""...on steroids.

I can't imagine that any other corps in the DCI era can match this record. Un-effing-real!

Quite frankly, you’d be VERY hard-pressed to find a major pro sports team or other competitive org in a large activity with a record anywhere NEAR this.

Couple this with the fact that BD loses a fairly large percentage of their membership (about 35% on average) to ageout at the end of every season – 60 members aging out after 2017 ALONE (that’s 40% of the corps...no WAY a major sports team could recover from that between seasons) – yet they continually maintain the competitive quality year after year after year and it’s pretty damn clear that the Blue Devils are, across the board, quite possibly the most dominant competitive organization in any large-scale competitive environment....period.

Game Zone,8mo,Which is the most difficult sport to make it as a professional?,"When it comes to professional sports, there are countless factors that come into play when determining which sport is the most difficult to make it in. However, there are a few key factors that can help us narrow down which sports are the most competitive and challenging for athletes.

One of the main factors that makes a sport difficult to make it in is the level of competition. The more people that are competing for a limited number of spots, the more difficult it will be to stand out and make it to the top. For example, sports like soccer, basketball, and football have extremely competitive professional leagues with hundreds or even thousands of players vying for just a few dozen spots. This high level of competition means that athletes need to not only be incredibly talented, but also have a strong work ethic, dedication, and perseverance in order to succeed.

Another factor that can make a sport difficult to make it in is the physical demands of the sport. Sports that require a high level of physical fitness, strength, and endurance can be especially challenging for athletes. For example, sports like marathon running, Ironman triathlons, and boxing all require extreme levels of physical fitness and endurance in order to compete at a professional level. Athletes in these sports not only need to train for hours every day, but also need to have a strong mental and emotional fortitude in order to push through the pain and exhaustion that comes with intense physical exertion.

In addition to physical demands, some sports are also mentally challenging. Sports like golf, tennis, and chess require a high level of mental focus and concentration in order to succeed. These sports require athletes to not only be physically fit, but also have strong problem-solving skills, strategic thinking, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. Athletes in these sports need to be able to maintain their focus and concentration for hours on end in order to make it to the top.

Finally, some sports are difficult to make it in simply because they are less well-known or popular than others. For example, sports like curling, synchronized swimming, and fencing may not have the same level of mainstream appeal as sports like football or basketball, which can make it more difficult for athletes to gain recognition and support.

In conclusion, there are many factors that can make a sport difficult to make it in as a professional athlete. From high levels of competition and physical demands to mental challenges and lack of popularity, each sport presents unique challenges and obstacles for athletes to overcome. Ultimately, the most difficult sport to make it in will depend on a variety of factors, including an athlete’s individual strengths and weaknesses, their level of commitment and dedication, and the specific challenges of the sport they are pursuing.

K Parsley,2y,Should I join a softball team? I used to play for a while 3 years ago and I miss it but I have a lot of anxiety about it. The team I’d be joining is not competitive and is just for fun but there are a lot of cons:,"Thank you for the A2A.

I read your cons in the comments. I have some questions-

There isn’t a teenage league nearby?

Is this slow pitch or fast pitch?

You’d be the only female?

I can agree that playing on a team full of men could be less enjoyable than playing on a true Co-Ed team or a girls/women’s team.

Are there many players— meaning will everyone get to play? How are your softball skills? If you are inexperienced, you might not get to play very much, especially on a big team unless there were mandatory co Ed rules. If your skills are still developing, I also don’t know if I’d want to be the “weak link” in some of their eyes, either. I would not want to be the catcher blocking the plate against grown men- can you safely hold your own in the game against them?

Finally— do you know these men (would you be comfortable from a safety point of view)? Is it a church league or a park league (in regards to language and joking around)? Is the dugout atmosphere going to be appropriate?

If you feel you would have fun and that this is a safe environment for you as a young woman and think that you’d get to play in enough games to justify your time, go for it. But I totally understand if you don’t think this would be a good fit, too. As you get older, I would expect you’ll be able to find a women’s team somewhere in your area.

Frank Cuzzocrea,Updated 4y,How practical would it be for a professional sports team to split its home games between two locations?,"Here is a short list of teams that have split venues in Major North American Sports:

KC-Omaha Kings 72-75: both locations struggled to put butts in seats (both under 10k arenas to begin with). The Kings abandoned Omaha for the Kemper Arena in KC for about a decade before moving to Sacramento.

New Orleans-OKC Hornets 05-07: This was always, officially, a temporary move to OKC until the situation in New Orleans could be restored after Hurricane Katrina. Privately the league was looking to OKC as a potential landing spot for the Hornets or another team. While most of the games were played in OKC staff was generally located in Louisiana. If games had been truly split i don't think it would have been successful, but OKC did embrace this temporary franchise and got the Sonics a few seasons later.

Green Bay Packers 20s-94 with Milwaukee: Green Bay played 2–4 games a season, sometimes even a playoff game, in Milwaukee. For much of the team's early history Milwaukee had a far bigger stadium and the city is always several times larger than Green Bay. Eventually the Packers have grown into a team that attracted fans from throughout Wisconsin and Stadium Capacity at Lambeau and other improvements have removed the need for a sister city. Milwaukee is still the only city the NFL treats as a “home town"" for broadcast purposes without a team.

Montreal Expos 03-04 with San Juan, PR: MLB never had the intention of keeping the team in Montreal; the goal was to contract the team and the Minnesota Twins before the MLBPA and the Metrodome sued MLB in 2002. MLB owned the team and felt possible relocation to Puerto Rico might make sense. Most of the PR games were played in the early summer, and fans back in Montreal (which was already low) didn't return when the team returned later in the year with MLB spending nothing to improve baseball operations. Attendance in San Juan wasn't great; the league permanently moved the team to DC and was renamed the Washington Nationals.

Montreal Alouettes and Montreal Impact between Saputo Stadium and Olympic Stadium (commonly called The Big O or The Big Owe): The Big Owe, which cost the Province of Quebec billions to complete and wasn't paid for for almost 3 decades, was the original home of the 3rd version of the CFLs Alouettes. Inspite of having the perfect dimensions for CFL Football and indoors during Montreal's crippling winters, it is a cavern filled with horrible site lines for fans. Eventually the Alouettes moved into the much smaller Saputo Stadium and only returning for playoff games and big event days… and then just stopped that arrangement as putting in more seats made more sense than changing locations. The Impact, upon moving up to the MLS, had the same agreement until abandoning The Big O altogether as well.

New York Islanders 18-Present: The Islanders needed a modern arena to replace the outdated Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. In 2015, the move to Barclay's in Brooklyn was complete… and disastrous. Older fans didn't want to make the commute into Brooklyn from Long Island with the limited parking of the Arena and the sightlines are horrible with many obstructed seats. Attendance plummeted (despite making the playoffs) and both the franchise and Barclay's wanted out. After minor flirtations with relocation to Quebec City and Hartford, the team is splitting its schedule between Brooklyn and the old Nassau Coliseum until a new arena is complete in Elmont, Long Island. The team and the fans love Nassau and hate Brooklyn (attendance is higher in Nassau even though the arena holds 5k less) and the team's record is better in Nassau. If it was feasible; every game would be back at the Coliseum.

In conclusion: Is it possible that this proposed split between St. Pete and Montreal for the Tampa Bay Rays could work… sure. Anything is possible. But is it remotely likely to work? History says no. Eventually one space will win out (or neither will and the team still moves).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1a8t2mncqglvu7ro', 'title': 'How practical would it be for a professional sports team to split its home games between two locations?', 'score': {'original': 0.4187, 'ai': 0.5813}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Here is a short list of teams that have split venues in Major North American Sports:\n\nKC-Omaha Kings 72-75: both locations struggled to put butts in seats (both under 10k arenas to begin with).

The Kings abandoned Omaha for the Kemper Arena in KC for about a decade before moving to Sacramento.\n\nNew Orleans-OKC Hornets 05-07: This was always, officially, a temporary move to OKC until the situation in New Orleans could be restored after Hurricane Katrina. Privately the league was looking to OKC as a potential landing spot for the Hornets or another team. While most of the games were played in OKC staff was generally located in Louisiana. If games had been truly split i don\'t think it would have been successful, but OKC did embrace this temporary franchise and got the Sonics a few seasons later.\n\nGreen Bay Packers 20s-94 with Milwaukee: Green Bay played 2–4 games a season, sometimes even a playoff game, in Milwaukee. For much of the team\'s early history Milwaukee had a far bigger stadium and the city is always several times larger than Green Bay. Eventually the Packers have grown into a team that attracted fans from throughout Wisconsin and Stadium Capacity at Lambeau and other improvements have removed the need for a sister city. Milwaukee is still the only city the NFL treats as a “home town"" for broadcast purposes without a team.\n\nMontreal Expos 03-04 with San Juan, PR: MLB never had the intention of keeping the team in Montreal; the goal was to contract the team and the Minnesota Twins before the MLBPA and the Metrodome sued MLB in 2002. MLB owned the team and felt possible relocation to Puerto Rico might make sense. Most of the PR games were played in the early summer, and fans back in Montreal (which was already low) didn\'t return when the team returned later in the year with MLB spending nothing to improve baseball operations. Attendance in San Juan wasn\'t great; the league permanently moved the team to DC and was renamed the Washington Nationals.\n\nMontreal Alouettes and Montreal Impact between Saputo Stadium and Olympic Stadium (commonly called The Big O or The Big Owe): The Big Owe, which cost the Province of Quebec billions to complete and wasn\'t paid for for almost 3 decades, was the original home of the 3rd version of the CFLs Alouettes. Inspite of having the perfect dimensions for CFL Football and indoors during Montreal\'s crippling winters, it is a cavern filled with horrible site lines for fans. Eventually the Alouettes moved into the much smaller Saputo Stadium and only returning for playoff games and big event days… and then just stopped that arrangement as putting in more seats made more sense than changing locations. The Impact, upon moving up to the MLS, had the same agreement until abandoning The Big O altogether as well.\n\nNew York Islanders 18-Present: The Islanders needed a modern arena to replace the outdated Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. In 2015, the move to Barclay\'s in Brooklyn was complete… and disastrous. Older fans didn\'t want to make the commute into Brooklyn from Long Island with the limited parking of the Arena and the sightlines are horrible with many obstructed seats. Attendance plummeted (despite making the playoffs) and both the franchise and Barclay\'s wanted out. After minor flirtations with relocation to Quebec City and Hartford, the team is splitting its schedule between Brooklyn and the old Nassau Coliseum until a new arena is complete in Elmont, Long Island. The team and the fans love Nassau and hate Brooklyn (attendance is higher in Nassau even though the arena holds 5k less) and the team\'s record is better in Nassau. If it was feasible; every game would be back at the Coliseum.\n\nIn conclusion: Is it possible that this proposed split between St. Pete and Montreal for the Tampa Bay Rays could work… sure.

Evo9x In USA,6mo,What impact do you think participating in team sports has on personal growth and development?,"Participating in team sports can have a significant impact on personal growth and development in various ways. The following are some of the key benefits:

Physical Health: Team sports involve regular physical activity, which promotes overall health and well-being. Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, improves cardiovascular health, and strengthens muscles and bones.
Social Skills: Team sports require interaction and collaboration with teammates, coaches, and opponents. This fosters the development of social skills like communication, teamwork, cooperation, and conflict resolution.
Leadership Skills: Being part of a team provides opportunities to develop leadership skills. Players may take on captain roles or become vocal and supportive leaders on and off the field.
Discipline and Time Management: Participating in team sports often demands commitment, regular practice, and adherence to schedules. This cultivates discipline and time management skills, as players learn to balance their sporting activities with other responsibilities.
Resilience and Perseverance: Sports involve both successes and failures. Experiencing setbacks and learning to bounce back from defeats can build resilience and perseverance in individuals.
Goal Setting and Achievement: Team sports often involve setting and striving for individual and collective goals. Achieving these objectives fosters a sense of accomplishment and motivation to set higher targets.
Self-Confidence: As players improve their skills and contribute to the team's success, their self-confidence grows. This newfound confidence often carries over into other aspects of life.
Emotional Regulation: Team sports can be emotionally charged environments. Learning to manage emotions, cope with pressure, and handle both success and failure gracefully can lead to better emotional regulation.
Cultural Awareness: Team sports often bring together people from diverse backgrounds, fostering cultural awareness, tolerance, and respect for different perspectives.
Healthy Competition: Engaging in healthy competition teaches individuals how to compete fairly, respect opponents, and understand that winning and losing are both parts of life.
Stress Relief: Sports provide a constructive outlet for stress and anxiety, promoting mental well-being.
Long-lasting Friendships: The bonds formed with teammates and coaches can lead to long-lasting friendships and valuable support networks.

So, participating in team sports offers a holistic learning experience, contributing to physical, emotional, and social development. It instills important life skills and values that can positively impact individuals throughout their lives. However, it's essential to strike a balance and ensure that the sports environment remains positive and supportive to maximize these benefits.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ito1mdgqv85x6skn', 'title': 'What impact do you think participating in team sports has on personal growth and development?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Participating in team sports can have a significant impact on personal growth and development in various ways.

Marc Schneider,4y,Will the state of Iowa get a major pro sports team in the next 20 years?,"I was going to say “doubtful” as well, but I think the real answer is just a plain NO, Iowa is not going to get a major professional team this decade or next or the following one. The reasons are:

We are surrounded by bigger, better markets, including Chicago to the east; Minneapolis to the north; Kansas City to the South-West and St. Louis to the South-East.
If and when (or if) the current major leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL) expand, there are already quite a few bigger cities and markets on the list way ahead of Iowa. For example, in the NFL St. Louis lost its team, San Diego lost theirs, Oklahoma City wants a team, Portland wants a team, etc. Baseball seems pretty well set. Hockey has expanded quite a bit in recent times and can work in smaller markets but I don’t think it is really itching to expand. The NBA is probably similar to hockey.
Iowan’s don’t like spending tax dollars anymore than we have to, so the likelihood of Iowa building a major stadium to attract a team is pretty small.
Iowa doesn’t have any cities (or entire state) with a rapidly growing population. We are pretty static in terms of population.
Iowa doesn’t have a city or region that is a major media market. Adding Iowa to a professional league is not going to add much ad revenue for them. Omaha (on Iowa’s western border) is the 69th largest market; Des Moines-Ames is the 75th largest market; Cedar Rapids-Iowa City is 87th; and the Quad Cities is 98th.
Iowa does not have a major airport to support traveling teams (or fans).
Iowa’s weather is not real conducive to landing such an enterprise. Yes, other northern (cold winter) cities have major professional teams, but all the new teams are down south (usually).

The more likely outcome is the continued growth of minor league teams in Iowa (hockey, arena football, Triple A and double A baseball teams, etc.) and continued strong support of college teams.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wqsmn24t61i7uveg', 'title': 'Will the state of Iowa get a major pro sports team in the next 20 years?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I was going to say “doubtful” as well, but I think the real answer is just a plain NO, Iowa is not going to get a major professional team this decade or next or the following one.

Frank Cuzzocrea,4y,Why do professional sports teams typically change cities?,"In the early days a sports league (or with newer franchises in existing leagues), it is typically because the team cannot make money

This happened a lot in all for major sports (even baseball, as the Baltimore Orioles became the NY Highlanders (Yankees) and Milwawkee Brewers to St. Louis Browns <later Baltimore Orioles 3>). In the early days of a league it is usually find a new owner, move, or die.

The NHL “Original Six Era” had more than 6 teams, many founded after the league started, and many of those other teams moved locations (though the O6 teams we know of today stayed in the same metro era since each teams founding). Even in recent times, the Vancouver Grizzles left for Memphis in 2001 because they were losing money hand over fist in the pacific northwest and the same was true for the Quebec Nordiques to Colorado Rockies in 95 and the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg Jets-2 in 2011.

As leagues become more established, teams would move because of competition in their own market and they were usually the #2 team

The Chicago Cardinals to St. Louis (eventually Arizona) and Cleveland Rams to LA (after the Browns joined the NFL from the AAFC) did this in the NFL. The Dallas Texans took their AFL Championship to KC since the Cowboys dominated at the gate; same for the Baltimore CFLers to Montreal Alouettes 3 when the Ravens moved to town. Most of the 50–60s MLB Franchise moves lefts duel markets to new vacant cities, and the ABA-NBA and NHL-WHA duel city problems usually forced one team out of the market so both wouldn’t fold. To a lesser extent this also happens between sports; The Buffalo Braves become the San Diego Clippers because the Sabres were more profitable with better dates, same with Basketball teams in Pittsburgh in the 60s-70s, and the Oakland/California/Golden Seals to Cleveland Barons (later merged with Minnesota North Stars) because of the Warriors.

In well established and prosperous leagues; they move for two reasons

First, teams move because existing owners are looking to sell and new ownership wants the club to move to a bigger or more financially prosperous city. A lot of times a buying group represents a different city that wants the team (Seattle Supersonics to OKC Thunder, Winnipeg Jets 1 to Phoenix Coyotes, Montreal Expos to Washington Nationals) or a minority owner takes control and wants to relocate to his base of operations (Philadelphia Warriors to San Fran (Golden State), KC-Omaha Kings to just Kansas City (later moved to Sacramento for financial reasons), Colorado Rockies NHLers to New Jersey Devils). The San Jose Sharks and the Austin MLS expansion team were created from existing clubs (Minnesota North Stars and Columbus Crew) when ownership groups split and were rewarded new teams.

The second is because they can make more money then were they already are (usually with new stadium deal) even in a smaller market. This would include both the moves out of LA in 1994 and the moves into LA in the late 2010s for the NFL, the Minnesota North Stars to the Dallas Stars, and Houston Oilers to Tennessee Titans.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/min1wyeod9qslafk', 'title': 'Why do professional sports teams typically change cities?', 'score': {'original': 0.47475, 'ai': 0.52525}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In the early days a sports league (or with newer franchises in existing leagues), it is typically because the team cannot make money\n\nThis happened a lot in all for major sports (even baseball, as the Baltimore Orioles became the NY Highlanders (Yankees) and Milwawkee Brewers to St. Louis Browns <later Baltimore Orioles 3>).

Tony Twillie,2y,Is a pitcher in baseball the most difficult position of all team sports?,"All of team sports? Don’t know. Tough call to make.

Catcher is equally tough to me and more demanding physically.
Goal keeper in soccer isn’t tough much of the time, but when it’s time, it’s definitely tough.
Football linemen have it tough, particularly the center.

Colleen McCloskey,4y,What qualities would a new sport need to have to successfully compete for attention and participation with soccer and basketball?,"The sport has to be exciting. Exciting to watch, exciting to play.
The sport has to be easy to learn difficult to master
It has to be available around the country, not just a local sport.
It has to have professionals for the younger players to follow.
It has to be played in school. Clubs are OK, but taught in schools is better.

OK. so I follow rugby. Let’s see how this compares.

Excitement - all the contact of American football, with the constant action of basketball or soccer.
You may see blood.
Easy - keep the ball away from the other guys. Pass it when you will get tackled. Kick it to gain a lot of ground.
This is what they teach four-year-olds, and it comes naturally.
Everything else is refinement.
They play it in Alaska, Hawaii and all the rest of the states.
They play it at the beach (Beach Rugby). They play it without tackling (Touch Rugby). They play it in wheelchairs.
It’s everywhere.
There are professional leagues around the world. The Premiership. The Guinness PRO, Top 14 and D2 in France. SuperRugby.
We have the MLR (Major League Rugby) in the United States, with two conferences (East/West) and twelve different teams, and expanding rapidly.
We have our national teams for 7s (short form) and 15s. The 7s team plays in the Olympics (yes, next year), the 15s team plays in the Rugby World Cup. Both the men’s and women’s teams came home with bronze in the Pan-Am games last week.
Plenty of players for the kids and fans of all ages to follow.
Rugby started as a schools game, like soccer. It is played in independent schools, local age-grade clubs, and, hopefully, in public schools.
It is played in many colleges across the country, just not with the funding that football gets.

Did I mention women’s rugby?
It’s the exact same game, same rules, same fields. You just play against other women, is all. It is gaining traction in the USA from women who have seen football all their lives and want to give it a try, that is, playing where contact is allowed and expected. Women’s rugby goes to the Olympics, other international events like the Pan-Am games, and have their own World Cup. It is played in colleges, for sure, and in club play after that.

Rugby games are shown on NBC Sports, CBS Sports, ESPN and, at the local level, on YouTube.
There will be cacaphonous viewing parties at pubs across the country for this year’s Rugby World Cup games.

There is a huge rugby sub-culture. If you look for it, you will find it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jxvs40gtdlf56p1u', 'title': 'What qualities would a new sport need to have to successfully compete for attention and participation with soccer and basketball?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The sport has to be exciting.

Harley Vague,4y,What qualities would a new sport need to have to successfully compete for attention and participation with soccer and basketball?,"What qualities would a new sport need to have to successfully compete for attention and participation with soccer and basketball?

The real answer to this question is that any minor sport needs huge backing to get that sport the promotion and media attention that currently is focussed on major sports. there are some highly popular localised sports that are much more popular than either soccer or basketball. If people had the choice of these domestically popular sports then we would see a completely different mix of sports around the world. yes, soccer and basketball would still be popular but they would be joined by a number of popular domestic sports.

There is a sport that is highly popular in Europe in the form of Handball that is extremely similar to basketball in a number of ways. If Handball was available around the world and promoted then Handball’s popularity would extend globally. There is less emphasis on height in Handball so theoretically it could overtake basketball.

There is a sport that is highly popular in Commonwealth countries with women and that is netball. Netball is more popular than basketball where it is played and would obviously have a much higher profile if played by men. Netball could easily be taken to the world.

There is sport in Ireland in the form of Gaelic Football that was played before soccer that has a lot more options than soccer. In simple terms a player can use their hands in Gaelic Football. Gaelic Football is highly popular with the Irish diaspora and more. I have long thought that a simplified game of Gaelic Football could successfully be taken to the world without needed a huge amount of promotion. The reason why Gaelic Football is not more popular around the world is that the Irish are content to keep the game to themselves and not widely promote the game. There are already variations of Gaelic Football coming from Australian Football influences that are gaining significant popularity.

Again, it is the availability of choice that determines the popularity of different sports, especially sports that are already highly popular in localised regions. If we look at Australia, we can see that it is a virtual “melting pot” of sports. Cricket is still the favourite small ball team sport but baseball has huge junior participation and field hockey is well represented. It wouldn’t take much to lift baseball and field hockey in Australia. As for football, Australia has them all. Australian Football is the most popular by choice. Rugby league is popular professionally as well as rugby union. Soccer is not well represented at professional level. As well American Football and Gaelic Football is played at amateur level. There is no Handball to my knowledge in Australia and that is a pity as IMO it could do well as another sporting alternative.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j8t0pbiq71yeu2wf', 'title': 'What qualities would a new sport need to have to successfully compete for attention and participation with soccer and basketball?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'What qualities would a new sport need to have to successfully compete for attention and participation with soccer and basketball?\n\nThe real answer to this question is that any minor sport needs huge backing to get that sport the promotion and media attention that currently is focussed on major sports. there are some highly popular localised sports that are much more popular than either soccer or basketball.

James Keenley,4y,Why is soccer a great sport for little children to start playing team organized sports?,"I’m very biassed, since I love soccer, I’ve played soccer in one form or another for about 40 years, I have refereed about 1,000 soccer matches, and I am a huge supporter of youth soccer.

In spite of my clear bias, I think soccer is a great sport for younger kids to start playing for several reasons:

The can begin playing the game at its most basic level pretty much from the time they begin to run.
Starting out, they have to know only two rules: Go that way, and don’t use your hands. In fact, my boys started playing in a very unorganized local league when they were 3 and 4, and before each game, the man running the league would say, “You guys go that way, and you guys go that way, and try not to use your hands.”
Their skills and their knowledge of both tactics and soccer’s laws will develop organically as they play. The American football rule book runs for hundreds of pages of densely packed information. Soccer’s Laws of the Game are contained in a pamphlet that has wide margins and lots of illustrations.
Things expand as they grow older and more experienced. There are several size balls (typically in the U.S., 3, 4, and 5); the number of players per team will increase; and the size of the field will grow larger and larger. Thus, the ball, field, and number of players is always suited to their age at the time.
It’s cheap. For little kids, all you really need is some cones and a ball. And you don’t even need that. When he was a youngster, Pele used to play with a “ball” comprised of stole laundry wrapped into a tight bundle.
They’re outside running and around and getting exercise.
Most important, they learn teamwork naturally, simply by playing. As I said, the starting tactic is “Go that way, and don’t use your hands.” Shortly after that, they learn how to pass, which is the essence of teamwork in soccer.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sdte1r3a4b7hm0zu', 'title': 'Why is soccer a great sport for little children to start playing team organized sports?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I’m very biassed, since I love soccer, I’ve played soccer in one form or another for about 40 years, I have refereed about 1,000 soccer matches, and I am a huge supporter of youth soccer.\n\nIn spite of my clear bias, I think soccer is a great sport for younger kids to start playing for several reasons:\n\nThe can begin playing the game at its most basic level pretty much from the time they begin to run.\nStarting out, they have to know only two rules: Go that way, and don’t use your hands.

Andrew McKenzie,4y,How practical would it be for a professional sports team to split its home games between two locations?,"It isn’t terribly practical, so teams don’t do it unless there is a large potential gain.

By that I mean: Money.

For instance, for 20 years (1975–1995), the Boston Celtics used to play a number of games each season in Hartford. Occasionally they’d play in Providence as well. There were three basic reasons for this:

To expand the fanbase to be a “New England” team, and apart from the Connecticut area near New York that wasn’t difficult. Some teams would play in other cities to make up for low attendance at home, but the Celtics didn’t have that problem.
To expand the team’s territorial rights. The NBA, like other North American pro sports leagues, operates as a cartel, where each franchise gets protected TV and other rights in its home area. By playing in Hartford, the Celtics could and did lay claim to the entire state of Connecticut, even its lucrative corner counties, which were in the NY metro area and should have been Knicks territory.
Cost. The Celtics leased the Boston Garden, and got a decent rate for that. But the Civic Center offered a lower rate and a larger capacity, so the Celtics made more money every time they played there. A few times a year, they did.

By the mid-90s, that had changed. Courts broke the Celtics hold on TV rights, they had a new arena in Boston that they didn’t have to lease, and the league was going global rather than looking local anyways.

Timothy Seeley,Updated 4y,Who is the best in American team sports history?,"In my mind the best single season team in American team sports history was a high school football team. The 1914 Everett Tide went 13–0 and scored six hundred points. Their opponents that season? Zero points as in nothing. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL'S BEST TEAM MAY HAVE BEEN EVERETT, MASS., 1914

Century later, Tide’s title still shine

I feel their are too many undefeated teams in NCAA history in too many sports for me to make legitimate assertion as to the best ever single season team in NCAA history.

Now if we are talking about College teams over time I feel that the North Carolina Lady Tar Heels Division I woman’s soccer team having won Twenty One national championships since 1982 and have played in Twenty four runs away with the title. That’s a 58% winning percentage and of the total 69% of title games reached.

The Kenyon Lords Division III Men’s and Women’s Swimming and Diving teams were more dominant over the same general period of time however the quality of competition is generally far lower at the Division III level the incredible success of the Women’s program as well argues that Kenyon invested in both of it’s swimming and diving programs far more than it’s competitors, as North Carolina’s men’s soccer team has been to three total national championships with a 2–1 record since 1959 indicating the Division I women’s team is a massive outlier.

As additional proof of the quality difference between the NCAA divisions 12 U.S. swimming national records have been set at the Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships at the Division I level and none at the Division II and Division III levels.

For Professional Sports the best team over time is far and away the New York Yankees. They have the most world championships of any team in all North American professional sports with 27 which is nearly 25% of all the world championships ever played in Major League Baseball and have gotten into the playoffs a whopping 51% of the time over a century’s worth of time.

In terms of the best single season American professional sports team I have to select the 1989 San Francisco 49ers, they had the league’s toughest strength of schedule but still came out on top with 14 regular season wins and absolutely dominated the post season while having the number one offense and number three defense that season and they did all of this with a rookie head coach.

"Cracker Barrel, Lead Macaque on Duty in Treehouse",1y,Can you give some examples of bad ownership in sports teams?,"The 15 Worst Owners in Sports

Frackers, racists and robbers – you don't need to be a bad person to own a pro franchise, but it certainly helps and if you lose – I mean, really lose – there is no argument more fulfilling than that of who has the worst owner. Because if you can make that one stick, then everything else explains itself: bad players, coaching, drafting, trades, talent evaluation, conditioning? Well, you know what, the owner picked those assholes, or he picked the asshole who picked those assholes. He is Lord High Asshole of His Asshole Realm.

Each asshole’s sports kingdom doesn’t exist in a vacuum, however. If sports were the only criterion, then the worst owner would be the one with the worst winning percentage every year. These people live in the real world, too. They bilk the public for tax breaks, exemptions and steep discounts on policing; they ignore impact and destroy surrounding infrastructure; they hold municipalities hostage; and they sit on their asses and reap millions annually in shared revenue while plundering young men (often of color and often from poor backgrounds) of their health and condemning them for wearing baggy pants, having tattoos, being “greedy” and “wrecking the game.”

As such, the correct answer to who is the worst owner in sports is all of them. Unfortunately, pulling the ripcord and racecard here and floating out of the frame is not a practical response. There are rules. The following are the worst owners in American sports, in more or less increasing levels of boobery, mismanagement and personal/social vileness.

Steve Spagnuolo Career Winning Percentage: 0.211

Can you imagine how much Marv Levy must hate Steve Spagnuolo? Levy is a Hall of Fame head coach who never won a Super Bowl ring, while Spagnuolo is one of the worst head coaches in NFL history, and yet he still has three Super Bowl rings.

After overseeing a New York Giants’ defense that helped orchestrate one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, Spagnuolo became the hottest head coaching during the 2008 offseason, the (then) St. Louis Rams won the “race” to secure Spagnuolo’s services as their next head coach… but that’s about the only winning they would enjoy for the foreseeable future. In three seasons as the Rams’ head coach, Spagnuolo won a grand total of 10 out of a possible 48 games, finishing with a 1–15 record in 2009 (the worst record in Rams’ franchise history) and a 2–14 record in 2011.

When the Rams dismissed him at the end of the 2011 season, he had compiled the second-lowest winning percentage for a non-interim coach in franchise history.

Marty Mornhinweg Winning Percentage: 0.156

Marty Mornhinweg didn’t even make it to 40 games as head coach of the Detroit Lions — mercifully for him, and even more mercifully for fans of the Lions.

As we all know, Mike Holmgren’s “coaching tree” has gone on to produce several very successful coaches. And as we all know, Mornhinweg — a former offensive assistant under Holmgren and Andy Reid — was not one of them. It quickly became very clear to members of the 2001 and 2002 Detroit Lions that the only thing Mornhinweg knew how to do was recycle ideas and concepts he had learned from Holmgren, without actually having any original ideas of his own.

Add in the fact that the Lions did a horrific job with their on-field personnel in his two years there, and it’s not hard to see how or why Mornhinweg finished with a 5–27 record in two seasons in Detroit

Wang could almost be replaced here with Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment for their commitment to simultaneously beclown four different sports franchises, but they've recently murmured the right things about using advanced hockey stats
. Also, the Leafs aren't moving.

In 2006, Wang used a statistical outlier season
 to sign a goalie to an astonishingly ludicrous 15-year $67.5 million contract. (The team finally bought out the contract in 2013.) He hired Neil Smith as general manager, fired him 40 days later and replaced him with a backup goalie. For the day-to-day operations, he created an absurd executive structure that routed all personnel decisions through a committee that included non-hockey people who had no idea how to scout, manage or evaluate personnel. Lastly, he's watching the Islanders vacate their home to move to Brooklyn because, aw, shucks, somehow a guy with a lot of money who knew a lot of other people with a lot of money couldn't get an affordable deal worked out. Insert shrugging emoticon here. He's technically still the owner, so Long Island can technically still tell him to fuck off while his franchise chuckles its way to a tonier location.

The Wilpons, New York Mets

The Wilpons are the only baseball ownership group to share a factoid with the nation of Albania, in that they were both nearly ruined by a Ponzi scheme. Twice
.

The Wilpons repeatedly structured deferred payments into player contracts
 and handed over the funds to fraudster and family friend Bernie Madoff to invest in the meantime, making money before the bills came due. Whoops. They also built the cavernous Citi Field at the tail end of a high-offense era, then were surprised to find that fans were pissed they didn't get to see any dingers. At the same time, Fred Wilpon is so enamored of old Ebbets Field – he played with Sandy Koufax in high school – that he designed Citi Field to celebrate Ebbets and was further surprised when Mets fans suggested he should think of having any Mets memorabilia there instead.

Thanks to wise investment, the Wilpons have lived on a shoestring budget for six years, taking profits from their ownership in SNY to make up team shortfalls and hoping that a tight budget and crossed fingers can arrest the team cratering that began in 2009. The Wilpons have seemingly never met a problem for which an absence of a solution will do, unless they have a solution worse than the problem, and that solution is invariably ""them.""
 As a distraction, they've repeatedly used the Daily News as their mouthpiece to trash players and deflect attention from complaints. The limits of that strategy were exposed when a former team executive sued Jeff Wilpon 
for allegedly firing her for having a baby out of wedlock.

The Ricketts Family, Chicago Cubs

The Ricketts have rehabilitated themselves in the last few years by making smart moves, like hiring Theo Epstein as president of baseball ops and Joe Maddon as manager. But these are all moves they want to get almost anyone but them to pay for: They demanded $150 million in public subsidies in addition to a cut of amusement-tax revenue in perpetuity
. They went to war against rooftop owners across from Wrigley for the ability to put up billboards to ""fund renovations"" that they could easily fund out-of-pocket instead, then floated a minority share ownership
 scheme because, hey, other suckers!

During the 2012 election, they funded a colossally stupid Jeremiah Wright attack ad complete with a casting call for a ""Metrosexual Black Abe Lincoln
."" The ad was never completed. Maybe they'd have more spending cash if they didn't also fund Dinesh ""Thank God I'm Not in Gen-Pop!"" D'Souza's shithead book and even more incompetent documentary. Lastly, despite telegenic public tiffs with Hizzoner Rahm Emanuel that pit entrepreneurs against the predation of BIG GUBMINT, the family that made its money off securities and online brokerage is otherwise behind-the-scenes chummy
 with that union-busting creep who just got dinged for accepting illegal donations from pension managers
.

Woody Johnson, New York Jets

The Woodster made his money the old fashioned way, by being the great-grandson of the co-founder of Johnson & Johnson. He was so inspired by his history of personal toil that he spent 2012 backing Mitt Romney
 and emitting poor-shaming thinkbarf about people who don't work hard. Recently he hosted a get-together of high-powered Republican fundraisers at his Metropolis-esque New York City penthouse to listen to whether bullying, still barely unindicted dickhead Chris Christie or Rand ""I Don't Believe in the Civil Rights Act
"" Paul would be better at talking to minorities and poor people
. As for crimes against sports, it's worth mentioning that the team he owns is the New York Jets.

Jerry Richardson, Carolina Panthers

Looks like someone molded a human shape out of an unguent containing racist e-mail forwards, Greek yogurt and hatred, although he may also be Mumbles from 
Dick Tracy
. Richardson got $87.5 million in public money (and may get $50 million more
) for renovations to a then 17-year-old stadium financed with $50 million in public land and relocation fees. A true no-nonsense ethicist, he didn't lift a finger about Greg Hardy's domestic abuse until well after Ray Rice's beating of his fiancée in an elevator ruined the optics for every other give-no-fuck NFL owner. Richardson was also a hardliner over locking out both the players and the referees for their out-of-control salaries despite pocketing millions in profit
 the preceding two seasons. He also reportedly once sneeringly responded
 to Peyton Manning's concerns about concussions with, ""What do you know about player safety?"" Later, heading into the 2011 lockout, he harnessed every wealthy Tea Party victim stereotype by saying that it was time for the owners to ""take back our league."" As a former NFL player, that makes him both a hypocrite and a vampire.

David Glass, Kansas City Royals

Don't let recent success
 blind you to an ample history deserving of scorn. After running arguably the worst non-arms-manufacturing company in the world, Walmart, Glass became sole owner of the Royals in 2000 and immediately treated baseball the way Walmart treats people.

Amid a jackal pack of ownership that included a (future) commissioner guilty of collusion
 to fix player salaries, Glass – then the team's president and CEO – stood out as an anti-labor hardliner during the 1994 strike, wanting to bring in scab players for a monstrously un-telegenic spectacle summarizing the kind of fuck-you tactics Glass learned at the Bentonville, Arkansas smile-time sociopathy juggernaut. He simultaneously advocated a hard salary cap in baseball, not to create an even playing field with large-market teams but to have a paper excuse to wave in doubters' faces explaining why he didn't spend anything on his team. Glass went ahead without one, with team payrolls routinely languishing in the bottom half of the league during his tenure, with notable years like 2000 (28th), 2003 (29th), 2005 (29th) and 2011 (30th). That's out of 30. The last two years, Royals payroll has leapt to 19th in the league, but don't let the 2014 World Series run fool you. Fans have every reason to expect them to regress, and every expectation that Glass won't spend to correct that (Goodbye, Billy Butler
.) After all, four seasons of 100 losses and an average of 92 losses per season under his tenure is a much bigger sample size.

Last, in 2006, Glass was all about that entrepreneurial spirit when renovations to Kauffman Stadium were furnished by a countywide sales tax, in exchange for discounts at certain games. Rolling back prices every day
!

Mike Brown, Cincinnati Bengals

Sometimes futility and incompetence are enough without the real world intruding too much. Consider Mike Brown, son of legendary coach Paul Brown, whose tenure has been so awful that all joy seems like accident.

Coming into this year, the Bengals were a combined 145-222-1 since 1991, a winning percentage of .394. Since that time, they've had four head coaches, the most successful of which, Marvin Lewis, has a .522 winning percentage and still doesn't understand how timeouts, challenges or offenses work. They have had 15 starting quarterbacks, and Andy Dalton is considered a bright spot here, not just in terms of his albedo. Brown's first move as Bengals owner was to fire the well-liked Sam Wyche, presumably for having taken the Bengals to the Divisional Round the year before. He immediately replaced him with Dave Shula, perhaps because when you owe your football job to your dad, game recognizes game. (And somewhere in America, Kyle Shanahan stubbed his finger against the TV tube and said, ""One day that will be me."") Brown employs himself as the head of talent operations, leaving the General Manager position empty and the Bengals' front office a league-wide joke exceeded only by the Cowboys' Jerry Jones.

Meanwhile, despite the sort of loyalty that saw Brown stand by Shula (19-52, .268) and a slew of felonious players, he used a flimsy excuse to declare his lease with Cincinnati broken and that he was considering moving the team to Baltimore. Cincinnati blinked and awarded him what The Wall Street Journal described as ""one of the worst professional sports deals ever struck by a local government
,"" one that was ""unusually lopsided and risky"" and soared over budget. Debt has ballooned to over $1 billion on the project, which also includes the Reds' Great American Ball Park, while other public space development has ground to a halt, child services and juvenile justice budgets have been slashed, sheriff's department and school funding have been cut and property tax cuts bundled with the stadium project as a selling point have been rescinded. That's a high price for sucking.

Jimmy Haslam, Cleveland Browns

Let's stay in Ohio with poor Jimmy Haslam, who grew up on the rough and tumble sheets of a bed paid for by the corporation his dad founded and of which he's now CEO. (Both the bed and the company.)

Jimmy, a man so lonely that he has to travel all the way to Tennessee to see family (his brother is the governor) or Washington, D.C. to see a friend (his college roommate is a senator), recently got in trouble with the law, and he probably got by with a little help from them. In response to a systemic company policy to defraud customers on gas rebates
, Jimmy's Pilot Flying J truck stop corporation paid $92 million in penalties and over $56 million in restitution for customers. Jimmy evidently ruled the company with the iron-colander mind of a true leader, claiming he didn't know what was going on. Thankfully, he avoided jail time!

Meanwhile, Flying J is the ""the Number One [fuel] supplier to the drilling and fracking [industries]
,"" and Jimmy and his governor brother (a Flying J shareholder
) are behind a plan to frack the Cumberland National Forest
. And in case you were wondering how he does with the team, Jimmy was the reason for both the rapid hiring of Rob Chudzinski after Chip Kelly passed on the Browns coaching job and the rapid firing of Chud after one season, a move that was almost universally panned. He then oversaw an embarrassing coaching search where candidate after candidate rejected the job in the media, further poisoning whatever appeal the perennially doomed position might have had. He then tried to mortgage the future by trading multiple picks for 49ers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh
, then did a little of the same by trading up in the draft for Johnny Manziel, supposedly because a homeless man told him to
. That's using' your One Percent.

Dan Gilbert, Cleveland Cavaliers

We don't even need to stray from Cleveland now (congrats, Ohio!) to talk about Dan Gilbert. When he hoists a Larry O'Brien Trophy sometime in the next few years, it's going to be really easy for fans to forget that Gilbert is a massive dick, but hopefully haters will always be around to remind us. That's what history is, haters with long memories. It even comes from the Greek word for haters.

Anyhow, despite having the best player in the world, Gilbert never evinced interest in supplying him with good teammates. (Zydrunas Ilgauskas! The decomposing body of Shaquille O'Neal, a.k.a. ""The Big Corpse."") Every offseason, the NBA narrative was, ""Will Gilbert get LeBron any help?"" And every year the answer was, ""Nah."" When LeBron took a pay cut to join friends Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, Gilbert was robbed of the convenient ""unlike me, this player is greedy!"" narrative and instead wrote the most screwheaded Dear John rebuttal letter possible. In Comic Sans, the font reserved for form letters from moms. (Read it
. The entire thing sounds like an insane missive you'd find on the ground amid a mass suicide of people in personalized track suits.) Gilbert argued that LeBron had ""quit"" on the Cavs, ignoring how James had played through an elbow injury during the playoffs and how he'd just offered that same quitter a $120 million contract. Now LeBron has bailed his ass out, through no fault of his own. The Heat are aging like the Nazi who drinks from the wrong grail, and the Cavs are young, will be able to pay him and play in a place near LeBron's mom. That's it.

Meanwhile, Gilbert, like all rich swine, paints himself as a moral and responsible businessman. That his team occupies a taxpayer-funded arena, and he grew rich peddling reverse mortgages and allegedly misleading loan offers
 makes him a perfect oligarch stereotype. It gets worse when you note that, in the spirit of free-market competition, he waged the most expensive electoral campaign in Ohio history to win a casino monopoly that drains the local economy
. He verges on cartoonishly evil territory when you also realize that he is one of the largest private landowners in Detroit and last year was pushing for the city's unelected Emergency Manager to default on $3.5 billion in unpaid, earned employee pensions
.

Clayton Bennett and Aubrey McClendon, Oklahoma City Thunder Steve Spagnuolo Career Winning Percentage: 0.211

Can you imagine how much Marv Levy must hate Steve Spagnuolo? Levy is a Hall of Fame head coach who never won a Super Bowl ring, while Spagnuolo is one of the worst head coaches in NFL history, and yet he still has three Super Bowl rings.

After overseeing a New York Giants’ defense that helped orchestrate one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, Spagnuolo became the hottest head coaching during the 2008 offseason, the (then) St. Louis Rams won the “race” to secure Spagnuolo’s services as their next head coach… but that’s about the only winning they would enjoy for the foreseeable future. In three seasons as the Rams’ head coach, Spagnuolo won a grand total of 10 out of a possible 48 games, finishing with a 1–15 record in 2009 (the worst record in Rams’ franchise history) and a 2–14 record in 2011.

When the Rams dismissed him at the end of the 2011 season, he had compiled the second-lowest winning percentage for a non-interim coach in franchise history.

Rod Marinelli Career Winning Percentage: 0.208

Make no mistake: Rod Marinelli is one hell of a defensive coach, and perhaps one of the best defensive line coaches in the history of the game.But as Marinelli — among many others — proved, there’s a huge difference between being an assistant coach and the head coach. For all of the success he enjoyed as an assistant coach alongside Tony Dungy and Monte Kiffin in Tampa Bay, he clearly was overmatched when elevated to the head position himself.Case in point? If you’re one of the three head coaches in NFL history to lead your NFL team to a completely winless season, you’re unfortunately going to make this list.

Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys

Again, sometimes incompetence and/or looking and behaving like a hungover albino scrotum lurching into its eighth decade on Earth trumps social evil. Sure, Jerry made his money in oil, which is probably why just looking at the bloated monstrosity of a stadium he built can suck another 1,000 barrels out of the earth before you blink, but his brand of toxicity remains acting as the sybaritic embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger Effect
.

Like Mike Brown, Jerry is both the owner and General Manager of his team, which is the football version of the attorney who represents himself: He has an idiot for a client. Jerry immediately fired the Cowboys' only head coach, Hall of Famer Tom Landry, and GM Tex Schramm, the man who'd effectively run everything for the previous 29 years. Though their ouster was overdue, Jerry handled it about as smoothly as excommunicating a nun on her name day by punching her through a stained glass window. Luckily, the even more incompetent Minnesota Vikings handed him the worst trade in football history
 just months later, giving the Cowboys the building blocks of their dynasty. Not messing up someone else's unforced error probably marks the last smart thing Jerry's done, with one playoff victory since 1996 to the team's name.

Claiming ""disloyalty,"" he parted ways with two-time Super Bowl winning coach Jimmy Johnson, later stating that ""any one of 500 coaches"" could have won with the Cowboys. He handed the reins to Barry Switzer, the Admiral Stockdale of the NFL, and Barry rode the last gasp of Cowboys inertia to a third title. It's all been downhill from there. Coaches Dave Campo, Chan Gailey, Wade Phillips. Quarterbacks Chad Hutchinson, Quincy Carter, retreads Drew Bledsoe and Vinny Testaverde. Jones even hired walking schtick Bill Parcells to chew gum and say ""c'mon!"" real loud, despite the growing sense that Parcells' bullshit doesn't work under a salary cap and without defensive coordinator Bill Belichick.

Jerry passed on drafting Randy Moss, gave two first-round picks for veteran Joey Galloway (the Seahawks used one on Shaun Alexander), and three picks for Roy Williams, who went on to catch 13 TDs in 40 games. And then there's all the other hands-on stuff: from walking down to the field and seeming to supervise Tony Romo's medical diagnosis when the man fractures his spine, to sexual harassment
. All this before mentioning Arlington's $325 million contribution
 (or everyone else's) to building ""Jerry World,"" a stadium that on game day uses more energy than Liberia
. Drill, Jerry, drill.

James Dolan, New York Knicks

A recent poll of over 200 ESPN panelists
 named James Dolan the worst owner in the NBA, and it's not hard to see why. The Knicks posted losing seasons from 2001 to 2010, and they've won only one playoff series since 2000. Most of that can be put down to Dolan's colossal mismanagement.

Where to begin? Maybe something like, a good indicator that you are a legendary fuckup is when an NBA rule is created and named after something you did. That'd be the Allan Houston Rule, based on the Knicks extending the seven-year veteran a further six years and $100 million, despite the next highest contract offer being only $75 million. Teams can now release one player without having that player's salary weighed against the league luxury tax, although the salary still counts against the cap. Oddly, the Knicks bet that the injured, miserable Houston would retire, instead using the Houston Rule against the atrocious Jerome Williams contract they'd just traded for.

Or what about five years and $30 million for center Jerome James, based on an eye-catching postseason run that belied mediocre regular season numbers? James showed up the next year like he'd spent the offseason practicing Golden Tee at Golden Corral, then played 86 games for the Knicks in his first two seasons and four in his last two. Then there's the Eddy Curry trade
 – which, I mean, Jesus Christ. Or not re-upping Donnie Walsh as GM after he started cutting out the Knicks' deadwood contracts and adding parts still contributing to the recent winning seasons. Or firing Larry Brown with four years and $40 million left on his contract when everyone knows you only have to wait another year or so for Brown to get bored and quit. Or replacing Larry Brown with GM Isiah Thomas, who continued his GM duties just as badly. Or Dolan's company and Thomas losing a lawsuit to Anucha Browne Sanders, who claimed that not only did Thomas sexually harass her but that Dolan fired her in retaliation.

And then there's everything about Dolan outside the Knicks to loathe. Like his running the New York Rangers into the ground for a decade, despite high payroll. Or the fact that he came to his exalted position at Madison Square Garden by working for his dad's company, Cablevision. Or the fact that on November 6th, the National Labor Relations Board charged Dolan with ""illegally threatening to withhold employee pay unless the employees voted against joining a union
."" Or finally, spare us, O Lord – being so wholly immunized from taste, accountability and objective-fucking-reality that he not only performs live with a band called ""JD & the Straight Shot"" but released a blues single called ""Under That Hood"" about Trayvon Martin. JD & the Straight Shot also booked themselves to open for the Eagles
 at Madison Square Garden.

Jeffrey Loria, Miami Marlins

If you live outside the tax base of Miami, the most despicable thing Jeffrey Loria ever did came on the heels of one of the smartest things a sporting municipality every did: say no.

After an initial investment of $12 million in the Montreal Expos, Loria triggered a series of showdowns with fellow team owners and local government until he wound up with 94 percent control, an alienated fanbase and a sweetheart ride out of town. Loria sold the Expos to ""Expos Baseball, LP,"" essentially Major League Baseball, for $120 million. He then bought the Marlins for $158.5 million, with the $38.5 million difference ponied up by MLB in an interest-free loan. After that, he committed to a strategy of cost-control with cheap young talent, selling off everything else
, letting revenue sharing do the work of profit-making
 and crying poverty to the City of Miami, while resorting to the same threat game as in Montreal. (""San Antonio is a very viable market, and they're very serious. Read my lips: They're very serious."") It worked. Loria erected a white-and-pastel mausoleum massively underserved by public transportation, one so empty that the retail spaces in and surrounding it as well as parking remain un- or under-leased, cratering any illusion of the ""revenue"" that a publicly financed stadium would bring. In exchange, through 2048, the City of Miami is on the hook for $2.4 billion
. With a B.

To complete the illusion that Loria would now use his new stadium to field a competitive team, he bought a lot of free agents, signed them to backloaded deals, then shipped them out within the year in a stunning 12-player trade that reduced his payroll obligations by $160 million. He even lied and told Jose Reyes to buy a house in Miami four days before exporting his ass to Canada. (So many awful things happened that year that you might as well just click this
.) Loria is going to eschew free agents, trade away good players for prospects at the height of their value and keep ""rebuilding"" and pocketing revenue-sharing checks until he dies. Here's what baseball fans get in exchange: Go fuck yourself. In the meantime, he'll also probably continue meddling in baseball operations, switching starting pitchers and holding up talent moves, like he does already.

And he's already started on the competitiveness shell game again, signing slugger Giancarlo Stanton to a heavily backloaded $325 million contract
 that Keith Olbermann sublimely tore to bits just a day later
. But you get to make those decisions when you're someone who got a start in this world buying art for Sears. Who are we to judge a baseball man who has drunk so deep from the cup of life? After all, besides immiserating and plundering two baseball towns and every fan in them, Loria's great contribution to the world is a book of philosophy based on Peanuts comic strips where he assures us that the pre-teen characters of that world aren't into wife-swapping
.

Daniel Snyder, Washington Redskins

If you've been paying attention to football this last year, you probably know Snyder as the staunch defender of an unambiguously racist name who can't stop putting a loafer in his mouth every time he opens it.

Snyder has marshaled every resource of the rich white asshole invoking tradition to defend the indefensible. There's this pro-Redskins AstroTurf campaign
 from a giant PR firm. There's Snyder co-opting any local media
 going knives-out on the name or the fact that his team is stupendously mismanaged. There's Snyder trying to buy silence
 from Indian tribes. There's Snyder trotting out multiple Indian defenders of the name
 who aren't even Indians
, when he's not sitting in his luxury box with a Navajo Nation leader
 recently kicked out of office under corruption allegations and in disgust at partnering with Snyder's ""Original Americans Foundation
,"" a disingenuous whitewash PR group. There's Snyder sticking his fingers in his ears and pretending the Redskins were named to ""honor"" an ""Indian"" coach who turned out to be a German-American misrepresenting his race to avoid the WWI draft
. Or sometimes he decides the name is meant to ""honor"" Indian ""heritage"" in general, and not as a marketing gimmick by their legendarily racist owner
 to identify the team with a much more popular baseball franchise.

And that's just the name. You could go on for pages about the paranoid, Hitler-in-the-bunker mentality of the team, or the blithe unconcern with a shredded field and player health that already nearly Cuisinarted RG III's knee. And you could go on for pages and pages and pages of what a clusterfuck of tire fires the Redskins have become under Snyder's tenure, all set ablaze by the flaming sack of dogshit that is what passes for his conscience. In fact, someone already has. Dave McKenna of the Washington City Paper wrote a devastatingly hysterical A-to-Z guide
 to every contemptuous, miserly, greed-headed, soul-dead move Snyder has pulled in D.C., every bit of it true. Snyder sued McKenna and the paper anyway
, because he wanted to see if the size of his war chest would back them down. Because he could. Because he's Daniel Snyder a failure who needs to rest in peace in the swamp somewhere.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7tusz3pnfw2h9xj0', 'title': 'Can you give some examples of bad ownership in sports teams?', 'score': {'original': 0.62635, 'ai': 0.37365}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The 15 Worst Owners in Sports\n\nFrackers, racists and robbers – you don't need to be a bad person to own a pro franchise, but it certainly helps and if you lose – I mean, really lose – there is no argument more fulfilling than that of who has the worst owner.

The ad was never completed. Maybe they\'d have more spending cash if they didn\'t also fund Dinesh ""Thank God I\'m Not in Gen-Pop!"" D\'Souza\'s shithead book and even more incompetent documentary. Lastly, despite telegenic public tiffs with Hizzoner Rahm Emanuel that pit entrepreneurs against the predation of BIG GUBMINT, the family that made its money off securities and online brokerage is otherwise behind-the-scenes chummy\n with that union-busting creep who just got dinged for accepting illegal donations from pension managers\n.\n\nWoody Johnson, New York Jets\n\nThe Woodster made his money the old fashioned way, by being the great-grandson of the co-founder of Johnson & Johnson. He was so inspired by his history of personal toil that he spent 2012 backing Mitt Romney\n and emitting poor-shaming thinkbarf about people who don\'t work hard. Recently he hosted a get-together of high-powered Republican fundraisers at his Metropolis-esque New York City penthouse to listen to whether bullying, still barely unindicted dickhead Chris Christie or Rand ""I Don\'t Believe in the Civil Rights Act\n"" Paul would be better at talking to minorities and poor people\n. As for crimes against sports, it\'s worth mentioning that the team he owns is the New York Jets.\n\nJerry Richardson, Carolina Panthers\n\nLooks like someone molded a human shape out of an unguent containing racist e-mail forwards, Greek yogurt and hatred, although he may also be Mumbles from \nDick Tracy\n. Richardson got $87.5 million in public money (and may get $50 million more\n) for renovations to a then 17-year-old stadium financed with $50 million in public land and relocation fees. A true no-nonsense ethicist, he didn\'t lift a finger about Greg Hardy\'s domestic abuse until well after Ray Rice\'s beating of his fiancée in an elevator ruined the optics for every other give-no-fuck NFL owner. Richardson was also a hardliner over locking out both the players and the referees for their out-of-control salaries despite pocketing millions in profit\n the preceding two seasons. He also reportedly once sneeringly responded\n to Peyton Manning\'s concerns about concussions with, ""What do you know about player safety?"" Later, heading into the 2011 lockout, he harnessed every wealthy Tea Party victim stereotype by saying that it was time for the owners to ""take back our league.""

After running arguably the worst non-arms-manufacturing company in the world, Walmart, Glass became sole owner of the Royals in 2000 and immediately treated baseball the way Walmart treats people.\n\nAmid a jackal pack of ownership that included a (future) commissioner guilty of collusion\n to fix player salaries, Glass – then the team\'s president and CEO – stood out as an anti-labor hardliner during the 1994 strike, wanting to bring in scab players for a monstrously un-telegenic spectacle summarizing the kind of fuck-you tactics Glass learned at the Bentonville, Arkansas smile-time sociopathy juggernaut. He simultaneously advocated a hard salary cap in baseball, not to create an even playing field with large-market teams but to have a paper excuse to wave in doubters\' faces explaining why he didn\'t spend anything on his team. Glass went ahead without one, with team payrolls routinely languishing in the bottom half of the league during his tenure, with notable years like 2000 (28th), 2003 (29th), 2005 (29th) and 2011 (30th). That\'s out of 30. The last two years, Royals payroll has leapt to 19th in the league, but don\'t let the 2014 World Series run fool you. Fans have every reason to expect them to regress, and every expectation that Glass won\'t spend to correct that (Goodbye, Billy Butler\n.) After all, four seasons of 100 losses and an average of 92 losses per season under his tenure is a much bigger sample size.\n\nLast, in 2006, Glass was all about that entrepreneurial spirit when renovations to Kauffman Stadium were furnished by a countywide sales tax, in exchange for discounts at certain games. Rolling back prices every day\n!\n\nMike Brown, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nSometimes futility and incompetence are enough without the real world intruding too much. Consider Mike Brown, son of legendary coach Paul Brown, whose tenure has been so awful that all joy seems like accident.\n\nComing into this year, the Bengals were a combined 145-222-1 since 1991, a winning percentage of .394. Since that time, they\'ve had four head coaches, the most successful of which, Marvin Lewis, has a .522 winning percentage and still doesn\'t understand how timeouts, challenges or offenses work. They have had 15 starting quarterbacks, and Andy Dalton is considered a bright spot here, not just in terms of his albedo. Brown\'s first move as Bengals owner was to fire the well-liked Sam Wyche, presumably for having taken the Bengals to the Divisional Round the year before. He immediately replaced him with Dave Shula, perhaps because when you owe your football job to your dad, game recognizes game. (And somewhere in America, Kyle Shanahan stubbed his finger against the TV tube and said, ""One day that will be me."") Brown employs himself as the head of talent operations, leaving the General Manager position empty and the Bengals\' front office a league-wide joke exceeded only by the Cowboys\' Jerry Jones.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the sort of loyalty that saw Brown stand by Shula (19-52, .268)', 'result': {'fake': 0.7988, 'real': 0.2012}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'and a slew of felonious players, he used a flimsy excuse to declare his lease with Cincinnati broken and that he was considering moving the team to Baltimore. Cincinnati blinked and awarded him what The Wall Street Journal described as ""one of the worst professional sports deals ever struck by a local government\n,"" one that was ""unusually lopsided and risky"" and soared over budget. Debt has ballooned to over $1 billion on the project, which also includes the Reds\' Great American Ball Park, while other public space development has ground to a halt, child services and juvenile justice budgets have been slashed, sheriff\'s department and school funding have been cut and property tax cuts bundled with the stadium project as a selling point have been rescinded. That\'s a high price for sucking.\n\nJimmy Haslam, Cleveland Browns\n\nLet\'s stay in Ohio with poor Jimmy Haslam, who grew up on the rough and tumble sheets of a bed paid for by the corporation his dad founded and of which he\'s now CEO. (Both the bed and the company.)\n\nJimmy, a man so lonely that he has to travel all the way to Tennessee to see family (his brother is the governor) or Washington, D.C. to see a friend (his college roommate is a senator), recently got in trouble with the law, and he probably got by with a little help from them. In response to a systemic company policy to defraud customers on gas rebates\n, Jimmy\'s Pilot Flying J truck stop corporation paid $92 million in penalties and over $56 million in restitution for customers. Jimmy evidently ruled the company with the iron-colander mind of a true leader, claiming he didn\'t know what was going on. Thankfully, he avoided jail time!\n\nMeanwhile, Flying J is the ""the Number One [fuel] supplier to the drilling and fracking [industries]\n,"" and Jimmy and his governor brother (a Flying J shareholder\n) are behind a plan to frack the Cumberland National Forest\n. And in case you were wondering how he does with the team, Jimmy was the reason for both the rapid hiring of Rob Chudzinski after Chip Kelly passed on the Browns coaching job and the rapid firing of Chud after one season, a move that was almost universally panned. He then oversaw an embarrassing coaching search where candidate after candidate rejected the job in the media, further poisoning whatever appeal the perennially doomed position might have had. He then tried to mortgage the future by trading multiple picks for 49ers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh\n, then did a little of the same by trading up in the draft for Johnny Manziel, supposedly because a homeless man told him to\n. That\'s using\' your One Percent.\n\nDan Gilbert, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nWe don\'t even need to stray from Cleveland now (congrats, Ohio!) to talk about Dan Gilbert. When he hoists a Larry O\'Brien Trophy sometime in the next few years, it\'s going to be really easy for fans to forget that Gilbert is a massive dick, but hopefully haters will always be around to remind us. That\'s what history is, haters with long memories. It even comes', 'result': {'fake': 0.52, 'real': 0.48}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'from the Greek word for haters.\n\nAnyhow, despite having the best player in the world, Gilbert never evinced interest in supplying him with good teammates. (Zydrunas Ilgauskas! The decomposing body of Shaquille O\'Neal, a.k.a. ""The Big Corpse."") Every offseason, the NBA narrative was, ""Will Gilbert get LeBron any help?"" And every year the answer was, ""Nah."" When LeBron took a pay cut to join friends Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, Gilbert was robbed of the convenient ""unlike me, this player is greedy!"" narrative and instead wrote the most screwheaded Dear John rebuttal letter possible. In Comic Sans, the font reserved for form letters from moms. (Read it\n. The entire thing sounds like an insane missive you\'d find on the ground amid a mass suicide of people in personalized track suits.) Gilbert argued that LeBron had ""quit"" on the Cavs, ignoring how James had played through an elbow injury during the playoffs and how he\'d just offered that same quitter a $120 million contract. Now LeBron has bailed his ass out, through no fault of his own. The Heat are aging like the Nazi who drinks from the wrong grail, and the Cavs are young, will be able to pay him and play in a place near LeBron\'s mom. That\'s it.\n\nMeanwhile, Gilbert, like all rich swine, paints himself as a moral and responsible businessman. That his team occupies a taxpayer-funded arena, and he grew rich peddling reverse mortgages and allegedly misleading loan offers\n makes him a perfect oligarch stereotype. It gets worse when you note that, in the spirit of free-market competition, he waged the most expensive electoral campaign in Ohio history to win a casino monopoly that drains the local economy\n. He verges on cartoonishly evil territory when you also realize that he is one of the largest private landowners in Detroit and last year was pushing for the city\'s unelected Emergency Manager to default on $3.5 billion in unpaid, earned employee pensions\n.\n\nClayton Bennett and Aubrey McClendon, Oklahoma City Thunder Steve Spagnuolo Career Winning Percentage: 0.211\n\nCan you imagine how much Marv Levy must hate Steve Spagnuolo? Levy is a Hall of Fame head coach who never won a Super Bowl ring, while Spagnuolo is one of the worst head coaches in NFL history, and yet he still has three Super Bowl rings.\n\nAfter overseeing a New York Giants’ defense that helped orchestrate one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, Spagnuolo became the hottest head coaching during the 2008 offseason, the (then) St. Louis Rams won the “race” to secure Spagnuolo’s services as their next head coach… but that’s about the only winning they would enjoy for the foreseeable future. In three seasons as the Rams’ head coach, Spagnuolo won a grand total of 10 out of a possible 48 games, finishing with a 1–15 record in 2009 (the worst record in Rams’ franchise history) and a 2–14 record in 2011.\n\nWhen the Rams dismissed him at the end of the 2011 season, he had compiled the second-lowest winning percentage for a non-interim coach in franchise history.\n\nRod Marinelli Career Winning Percentage: 0.208\n\nMake', 'result': {'fake': 0.0214, 'real': 0.9786}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'no mistake: Rod Marinelli is one hell of a defensive coach, and perhaps one of the best defensive line coaches in the history of the game.But as Marinelli — among many others — proved, there’s a huge difference between being an assistant coach and the head coach. For all of the success he enjoyed as an assistant coach alongside Tony Dungy and Monte Kiffin in Tampa Bay, he clearly was overmatched when elevated to the head position himself.Case in point? If you’re one of the three head coaches in NFL history to lead your NFL team to a completely winless season, you’re unfortunately going to make this list.\n\nJerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys\n\nAgain, sometimes incompetence and/or looking and behaving like a hungover albino scrotum lurching into its eighth decade on Earth trumps social evil. Sure, Jerry made his money in oil, which is probably why just looking at the bloated monstrosity of a stadium he built can suck another 1,000 barrels out of the earth before you blink, but his brand of toxicity remains acting as the sybaritic embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger Effect\n.\n\nLike Mike Brown, Jerry is both the owner and General Manager of his team, which is the football version of the attorney who represents himself: He has an idiot for a client. Jerry immediately fired the Cowboys\' only head coach, Hall of Famer Tom Landry, and GM Tex Schramm, the man who\'d effectively run everything for the previous 29 years. Though their ouster was overdue, Jerry handled it about as smoothly as excommunicating a nun on her name day by punching her through a stained glass window. Luckily, the even more incompetent Minnesota Vikings handed him the worst trade in football history\n just months later, giving the Cowboys the building blocks of their dynasty. Not messing up someone else\'s unforced error probably marks the last smart thing Jerry\'s done, with one playoff victory since 1996 to the team\'s name.\n\nClaiming ""disloyalty,"" he parted ways with two-time Super Bowl winning coach Jimmy Johnson, later stating that ""any one of 500 coaches"" could have won with the Cowboys. He handed the reins to Barry Switzer, the Admiral Stockdale of the NFL, and Barry rode the last gasp of Cowboys inertia to a third title. It\'s all been downhill from there. Coaches Dave Campo, Chan Gailey, Wade Phillips. Quarterbacks Chad Hutchinson, Quincy Carter, retreads Drew Bledsoe and Vinny Testaverde. Jones even hired walking schtick Bill Parcells to chew gum and say ""c\'mon!"" real loud, despite the growing sense that Parcells\' bullshit doesn\'t work under a salary cap and without defensive coordinator Bill Belichick.\n\nJerry passed on drafting Randy Moss, gave two first-round picks for veteran Joey Galloway (the Seahawks used one on Shaun Alexander), and three picks for Roy Williams, who went on to catch 13 TDs in 40 games. And then there\'s all the other hands-on stuff: from walking down to the field and seeming to supervise Tony Romo\'s medical diagnosis when the man fractures his spine, to sexual harassment\n.

Drill, Jerry, drill.\n\nJames Dolan, New York Knicks\n\nA recent poll of over 200 ESPN panelists\n named James Dolan the worst owner in the NBA, and it\'s not hard to see why. The Knicks posted losing seasons from 2001 to 2010, and they\'ve won only one playoff series since 2000. Most of that can be put down to Dolan\'s colossal mismanagement.\n\nWhere to begin? Maybe something like, a good indicator that you are a legendary fuckup is when an NBA rule is created and named after something you did. That\'d be the Allan Houston Rule, based on the Knicks extending the seven-year veteran a further six years and $100 million, despite the next highest contract offer being only $75 million. Teams can now release one player without having that player\'s salary weighed against the league luxury tax, although the salary still counts against the cap. Oddly, the Knicks bet that the injured, miserable Houston would retire, instead using the Houston Rule against the atrocious Jerome Williams contract they\'d just traded for.\n\nOr what about five years and $30 million for center Jerome James, based on an eye-catching postseason run that belied mediocre regular season numbers? James showed up the next year like he\'d spent the offseason practicing Golden Tee at Golden Corral, then played 86 games for the Knicks in his first two seasons and four in his last two. Then there\'s the Eddy Curry trade\n – which, I mean, Jesus Christ. Or not re-upping Donnie Walsh as GM after he started cutting out the Knicks\' deadwood contracts and adding parts still contributing to the recent winning seasons. Or firing Larry Brown with four years and $40 million left on his contract when everyone knows you only have to wait another year or so for Brown to get bored and quit. Or replacing Larry Brown with GM Isiah Thomas, who continued his GM duties just as badly. Or Dolan\'s company and Thomas losing a lawsuit to Anucha Browne Sanders, who claimed that not only did Thomas sexually harass her but that Dolan fired her in retaliation.\n\nAnd then there\'s everything about Dolan outside the Knicks to loathe. Like his running the New York Rangers into the ground for a decade, despite high payroll. Or the fact that he came to his exalted position at Madison Square Garden by working for his dad\'s company, Cablevision. Or the fact that on November 6th, the National Labor Relations Board charged Dolan with ""illegally threatening to withhold employee pay unless the employees voted against joining a union\n."" Or finally, spare us, O Lord – being so wholly immunized from taste, accountability and objective-fucking-reality that he not only performs live with a band called ""JD & the Straight Shot"" but released a blues single called ""Under That Hood"" about Trayvon Martin. JD & the Straight Shot also booked themselves to open for the Eagles\n at Madison Square Garden.\n\nJeffrey Loria, Miami Marlins\n\nIf you live outside the tax base of Miami, the most despicable thing Jeffrey Loria ever did came on the heels of', 'result': {'fake': 0.3175, 'real': 0.6825}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'one of the smartest things a sporting municipality every did: say no.\n\nAfter an initial investment of $12 million in the Montreal Expos, Loria triggered a series of showdowns with fellow team owners and local government until he wound up with 94 percent control, an alienated fanbase and a sweetheart ride out of town. Loria sold the Expos to ""Expos Baseball, LP,"" essentially Major League Baseball, for $120 million. He then bought the Marlins for $158.5 million, with the $38.5 million difference ponied up by MLB in an interest-free loan. After that, he committed to a strategy of cost-control with cheap young talent, selling off everything else\n, letting revenue sharing do the work of profit-making\n and crying poverty to the City of Miami, while resorting to the same threat game as in Montreal. (""San Antonio is a very viable market, and they\'re very serious. Read my lips: They\'re very serious."") It worked. Loria erected a white-and-pastel mausoleum massively underserved by public transportation, one so empty that the retail spaces in and surrounding it as well as parking remain un- or under-leased, cratering any illusion of the ""revenue"" that a publicly financed stadium would bring. In exchange, through 2048, the City of Miami is on the hook for $2.4 billion\n. With a B.\n\nTo complete the illusion that Loria would now use his new stadium to field a competitive team, he bought a lot of free agents, signed them to backloaded deals, then shipped them out within the year in a stunning 12-player trade that reduced his payroll obligations by $160 million. He even lied and told Jose Reyes to buy a house in Miami four days before exporting his ass to Canada. (So many awful things happened that year that you might as well just click this\n.) Loria is going to eschew free agents, trade away good players for prospects at the height of their value and keep ""rebuilding"" and pocketing revenue-sharing checks until he dies. Here\'s what baseball fans get in exchange: Go fuck yourself. In the meantime, he\'ll also probably continue meddling in baseball operations, switching starting pitchers and holding up talent moves, like he does already.\n\nAnd he\'s already started on the competitiveness shell game again, signing slugger Giancarlo Stanton to a heavily backloaded $325 million contract\n that Keith Olbermann sublimely tore to bits just a day later\n. But you get to make those decisions when you\'re someone who got a start in this world buying art for Sears. Who are we to judge a baseball man who has drunk so deep from the cup of life? After all, besides immiserating and plundering two baseball towns and every fan in them, Loria\'s great contribution to the world is a book of philosophy based on Peanuts comic strips where he assures us that the pre-teen characters of that world aren\'t into wife-swapping\n.\n\nDaniel Snyder, Washington Redskins\n\nIf you\'ve been paying attention to football this last year, you probably know Snyder as the staunch defender of an unambiguously racist name who can\'t stop putting a loafer in his mouth every time he opens it.\n\nSnyder has marshaled', 'result': {'fake': 0.2744, 'real': 0.7256}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'every resource of the rich white asshole invoking tradition to defend the indefensible. There\'s this pro-Redskins AstroTurf campaign\n from a giant PR firm. There\'s Snyder co-opting any local media\n going knives-out on the name or the fact that his team is stupendously mismanaged. There\'s Snyder trying to buy silence\n from Indian tribes. There\'s Snyder trotting out multiple Indian defenders of the name\n who aren\'t even Indians\n, when he\'s not sitting in his luxury box with a Navajo Nation leader\n recently kicked out of office under corruption allegations and in disgust at partnering with Snyder\'s ""Original Americans Foundation\n,"" a disingenuous whitewash PR group. There\'s Snyder sticking his fingers in his ears and pretending the Redskins were named to ""honor"" an ""Indian"" coach who turned out to be a German-American misrepresenting his race to avoid the WWI draft\n. Or sometimes he decides the name is meant to ""honor"" Indian ""heritage"" in general, and not as a marketing gimmick by their legendarily racist owner\n to identify the team with a much more popular baseball franchise.\n\nAnd that\'s just the name. You could go on for pages about the paranoid, Hitler-in-the-bunker mentality of the team, or the blithe unconcern with a shredded field and player health that already nearly Cuisinarted RG III\'s knee. And you could go on for pages and pages and pages of what a clusterfuck of tire fires the Redskins have become under Snyder\'s tenure, all set ablaze by the flaming sack of dogshit that is what passes for his conscience. In fact, someone already has. Dave McKenna of the Washington City Paper wrote a devastatingly hysterical A-to-Z guide\n to every contemptuous, miserly, greed-headed, soul-dead move Snyder has pulled in D.C., every bit of it true. Snyder sued McKenna and the paper anyway\n, because he wanted to see if the size of his war chest would back them down. Because he could.

Because if you can make that one stick, then everything else explains itself: bad players, coaching, drafting, trades, talent evaluation, conditioning? Well, you know what, the owner picked those assholes, or he picked the asshole who picked those assholes. He is Lord High Asshole of His Asshole Realm.\n\nEach asshole’s sports kingdom doesn’t exist in a vacuum, however. If sports were the only criterion, then the worst owner would be the one with the worst winning percentage every year. These people live in the real world, too. They bilk the public for tax breaks, exemptions and steep discounts on policing; they ignore impact and destroy surrounding infrastructure; they hold municipalities hostage; and they sit on their asses and reap millions annually in shared revenue while plundering young men (often of color and often from poor backgrounds) of their health and condemning them for wearing baggy pants, having tattoos, being “greedy” and “wrecking the game.”\n\nAs such, the correct answer to who is the worst owner in sports is all of them. Unfortunately, pulling the ripcord and racecard here and floating out of the frame is not a practical response. There are rules. The following are the worst owners in American sports, in more or less increasing levels of boobery, mismanagement and personal/social vileness.\n\nSteve Spagnuolo Career Winning Percentage: 0.211\n\nCan you imagine how much Marv Levy must hate Steve Spagnuolo? Levy is a Hall of Fame head coach who never won a Super Bowl ring, while Spagnuolo is one of the worst head coaches in NFL history, and yet he still has three Super Bowl rings.\n\nAfter overseeing a New York Giants’ defense that helped orchestrate one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, Spagnuolo became the hottest head coaching during the 2008 offseason, the (then) St. Louis Rams won the “race” to secure Spagnuolo’s services as their next head coach… but that’s about the only winning they would enjoy for the foreseeable future. In three seasons as the Rams’ head coach, Spagnuolo won a grand total of 10 out of a possible 48 games, finishing with a 1–15 record in 2009 (the worst record in Rams’ franchise history) and a 2–14 record in 2011.\n\nWhen the Rams dismissed him at the end of the 2011 season, he had compiled the second-lowest winning percentage for a non-interim coach in franchise history.\n\nMarty Mornhinweg Winning Percentage: 0.156\n\nMarty Mornhinweg didn’t even make it to 40 games as head coach of the Detroit Lions — mercifully for him, and even more mercifully for fans of the Lions.\n\nAs we all know, Mike Holmgren’s “coaching tree” has gone on to produce several very successful coaches. And as we all know, Mornhinweg — a former offensive assistant under Holmgren and Andy Reid — was not one of them. It quickly became very clear to members of the 2001 and 2002 Detroit Lions that the only thing Mornhinweg knew how to do was recycle ideas and concepts he had learned from Holmgren, without actually having any original ideas of his own.\n\nAdd in the fact that the Lions did a horrific job with their on-field personnel in his two years there, and it’s not hard to see how or why Mornhinweg finished with a 5–27 record in two seasons in Detroit\n\nWang could almost be replaced here with Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment for their commitment to simultaneously beclown four different sports franchises, but they\'ve recently murmured the right things about using advanced hockey stats\n. Also, the Leafs aren\'t moving.\n\nIn 2006, Wang used a statistical outlier season\n to sign a goalie to an astonishingly ludicrous 15-year $67.5 million contract. (The team finally bought out the contract in 2013.) He hired Neil Smith as general manager, fired him 40 days later and replaced him with a backup goalie. For the day-to-day operations, he created an absurd executive structure that routed all personnel decisions through a committee that included non-hockey people who had no idea how to scout, manage or evaluate personnel. Lastly, he\'s watching the Islanders vacate their home to move to Brooklyn because, aw, shucks, somehow a guy with a lot of money who knew a lot of other people with a lot of money couldn\'t get an affordable deal worked out. Insert shrugging emoticon here. He\'s technically still the owner, so Long Island can technically still tell him to fuck off while his franchise chuckles its way to a tonier location.\n\nThe Wilpons, New York Mets\n\nThe Wilpons are the only baseball ownership group to share a factoid with the nation of Albania, in that they were both nearly ruined by a Ponzi scheme. Twice\n.\n\nThe Wilpons repeatedly structured deferred payments into player contracts\n and handed over the funds to fraudster and family friend Bernie Madoff to invest in the meantime, making money before the bills came due. Whoops. They also built the cavernous Citi Field at the tail end of a high-offense era, then were surprised to find that fans were pissed they didn\'t get to see any dingers. At the same time, Fred Wilpon is so enamored of old Ebbets Field – he played with Sandy Koufax in high school – that he designed Citi Field to celebrate Ebbets and was further surprised when Mets fans suggested he should think of having any Mets memorabilia there instead.\n\nThanks to wise investment, the Wilpons have lived on a shoestring budget for six years, taking profits from their ownership in SNY to make up team shortfalls and hoping that a tight budget and crossed fingers can arrest the team cratering that began in 2009. The Wilpons have seemingly never met a problem for which an absence of a solution will do, unless they have a solution worse than the problem, and that solution is invariably ""them.""\n As a distraction, they\'ve repeatedly used the Daily News as their mouthpiece to trash players and deflect attention from complaints. The limits of that strategy were exposed when a former team executive sued Jeff Wilpon \nfor allegedly firing her for having a baby out of wedlock.\n\nThe Ricketts Family, Chicago Cubs\n\nThe Ricketts have rehabilitated themselves in the last few years by making smart moves, like hiring Theo Epstein as president of baseball ops and Joe Maddon as manager. But these are all moves they want to get almost anyone but them to pay for: They demanded $150 million in public subsidies in addition to a cut of amusement-tax revenue in perpetuity\n. They went to war against rooftop owners across from Wrigley for the ability to put up billboards to ""fund renovations"" that they could easily fund out-of-pocket instead, then floated a minority share ownership\n scheme because, hey, other suckers!\n\nDuring the 2012 election, they funded a colossally stupid Jeremiah Wright attack ad complete with a casting call for a ""Metrosexual Black Abe Lincoln\n."" The ad was never completed. Maybe they\'d have more spending cash if they didn\'t also fund Dinesh ""Thank God I\'m Not in Gen-Pop!"" D\'Souza\'s shithead book and even more incompetent documentary. Lastly, despite telegenic public tiffs with Hizzoner Rahm Emanuel that pit entrepreneurs against the predation of BIG GUBMINT, the family that made its money off securities and online brokerage is otherwise behind-the-scenes chummy\n with that union-busting creep who just got dinged for accepting illegal donations from pension managers\n.\n\nWoody Johnson, New York Jets\n\nThe Woodster made his money the old fashioned way, by being the great-grandson of the co-founder of Johnson & Johnson. He was so inspired by his history of personal toil that he spent 2012 backing Mitt Romney\n and emitting poor-shaming thinkbarf about people who don\'t work hard. Recently he hosted a get-together of high-powered Republican fundraisers at his Metropolis-esque New York City penthouse to listen to whether bullying, still barely unindicted dickhead Chris Christie or Rand ""I Don\'t Believe in the Civil Rights Act\n"" Paul would be better at talking to minorities and poor people\n. As for crimes against sports, it\'s worth mentioning that the team he owns is the New York Jets.\n\nJerry Richardson, Carolina Panthers\n\nLooks like someone molded a human shape out of an unguent containing racist e-mail forwards, Greek yogurt and hatred, although he may also be Mumbles from \nDick Tracy\n. Richardson got $87.5 million in public money (and may get $50 million more\n) for renovations to a then 17-year-old stadium financed with $50 million in public land and relocation fees. A true no-nonsense ethicist, he didn\'t lift a finger about Greg Hardy\'s domestic abuse until well after Ray Rice\'s beating of his fiancée in an elevator ruined the optics for every other give-no-fuck NFL owner. Richardson was also a hardliner over locking out both the players and the referees for their out-of-control salaries despite pocketing millions in profit\n the preceding two seasons. He also reportedly once sneeringly responded\n to Peyton Manning\'s concerns about concussions with, ""What do you know about player safety?"" Later, heading into the 2011 lockout, he harnessed every wealthy Tea Party victim stereotype by saying that it was time for the owners to ""take back our league."" As a former NFL player, that makes him both a hypocrite and a vampire.\n\nDavid Glass, Kansas City Royals\n\nDon\'t let recent success\n blind you to an ample history deserving of scorn. After running arguably the worst non-arms-manufacturing company in the world, Walmart, Glass became sole owner of the Royals in 2000 and immediately treated baseball the way Walmart treats people.\n\nAmid a jackal pack of ownership that included a (future) commissioner guilty of collusion\n to fix player salaries, Glass – then the team\'s president and CEO – stood out as an anti-labor hardliner during the 1994 strike, wanting to bring in scab players for a monstrously un-telegenic spectacle summarizing the kind of fuck-you tactics Glass learned at the Bentonville, Arkansas smile-time sociopathy juggernaut. He simultaneously advocated a hard salary cap in baseball, not to create an even playing field with large-market teams but to have a paper excuse to wave in doubters\' faces explaining why he didn\'t spend anything on his team. Glass went ahead without one, with team payrolls routinely languishing in the bottom half of the league during his tenure, with notable years like 2000 (28th), 2003 (29th), 2005 (29th) and 2011 (30th). That\'s out of 30. The last two years, Royals payroll has leapt to 19th in the league, but don\'t let the 2014 World Series run fool you. Fans have every reason to expect them to regress, and every expectation that Glass won\'t spend to correct that (Goodbye, Billy Butler\n.) After all, four seasons of 100 losses and an average of 92 losses per season under his tenure is a much bigger sample size.\n\nLast, in 2006, Glass was all about that entrepreneurial spirit when renovations to Kauffman Stadium were furnished by a countywide sales tax, in exchange for discounts at certain games. Rolling back prices every day\n!\n\nMike Brown, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nSometimes futility and incompetence are enough without the real world intruding too much. Consider Mike Brown, son of legendary coach Paul Brown, whose tenure has been so awful that all joy seems like accident.\n\nComing into this year, the Bengals were a combined 145-222-1 since 1991, a winning percentage of .394. Since that time, they\'ve had four head coaches, the most successful of which, Marvin Lewis, has a .522 winning percentage and still doesn\'t understand how timeouts, challenges or offenses work. They have had 15 starting quarterbacks, and Andy Dalton is considered a bright spot here, not just in terms of his albedo. Brown\'s first move as Bengals owner was to fire the well-liked Sam Wyche, presumably for having taken the Bengals to the Divisional Round the year before. He immediately replaced him with Dave Shula, perhaps because when you owe your football job to your dad, game recognizes game. (And somewhere in America, Kyle Shanahan stubbed his finger against the TV tube and said, ""One day that will be me."") Brown employs himself as the head of talent operations, leaving the General Manager position empty and the Bengals\' front office a league-wide joke exceeded only by the Cowboys\' Jerry Jones.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the sort of loyalty that saw Brown stand by Shula (19-52, .268) and a slew of felonious players, he used a flimsy excuse to declare his lease with Cincinnati broken and that he was considering moving the team to Baltimore. Cincinnati blinked and awarded him what The Wall Street Journal described as ""one of the worst professional sports deals ever struck by a local government\n,"" one that was ""unusually lopsided and risky"" and soared over budget. Debt has ballooned to over $1 billion on the project, which also includes the Reds\' Great American Ball Park, while other public space development has ground to a halt, child services and juvenile justice budgets have been slashed, sheriff\'s department and school funding have been cut and property tax cuts bundled with the stadium project as a selling point have been rescinded. That\'s a high price for sucking.\n\nJimmy Haslam, Cleveland Browns\n\nLet\'s stay in Ohio with poor Jimmy Haslam, who grew up on the rough and tumble sheets of a bed paid for by the corporation his dad founded and of which he\'s now CEO. (Both the bed and the company.)\n\nJimmy, a man so lonely that he has to travel all the way to Tennessee to see family (his brother is the governor) or Washington, D.C. to see a friend (his college roommate is a senator), recently got in trouble with the law, and he probably got by with a little help from them. In response to a systemic company policy to defraud customers on gas rebates\n, Jimmy\'s Pilot Flying J truck stop corporation paid $92 million in penalties and over $56 million in restitution for customers. Jimmy evidently ruled the company with the iron-colander mind of a true leader, claiming he didn\'t know what was going on. Thankfully, he avoided jail time!\n\nMeanwhile, Flying J is the ""the Number One [fuel] supplier to the drilling and fracking [industries]\n,"" and Jimmy and his governor brother (a Flying J shareholder\n) are behind a plan to frack the Cumberland National Forest\n. And in case you were wondering how he does with the team, Jimmy was the reason for both the rapid hiring of Rob Chudzinski after Chip Kelly passed on the Browns coaching job and the rapid firing of Chud after one season, a move that was almost universally panned. He then oversaw an embarrassing coaching search where candidate after candidate rejected the job in the media, further poisoning whatever appeal the perennially doomed position might have had. He then tried to mortgage the future by trading multiple picks for 49ers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh\n, then did a little of the same by trading up in the draft for Johnny Manziel, supposedly because a homeless man told him to\n. That\'s using\' your One Percent.\n\nDan Gilbert, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nWe don\'t even need to stray from Cleveland now (congrats, Ohio!) to talk about Dan Gilbert. When he hoists a Larry O\'Brien Trophy sometime in the next few years, it\'s going to be really easy for fans to forget that Gilbert is a massive dick, but hopefully haters will always be around to remind us. That\'s what history is, haters with long memories. It even comes from the Greek word for haters.\n\nAnyhow, despite having the best player in the world, Gilbert never evinced interest in supplying him with good teammates. (Zydrunas Ilgauskas! The decomposing body of Shaquille O\'Neal, a.k.a. ""The Big Corpse."") Every offseason, the NBA narrative was, ""Will Gilbert get LeBron any help?"" And every year the answer was, ""Nah."" When LeBron took a pay cut to join friends Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, Gilbert was robbed of the convenient ""unlike me, this player is greedy!"" narrative and instead wrote the most screwheaded Dear John rebuttal letter possible. In Comic Sans, the font reserved for form letters from moms. (Read it\n. The entire thing sounds like an insane missive you\'d find on the ground amid a mass suicide of people in personalized track suits.) Gilbert argued that LeBron had ""quit"" on the Cavs, ignoring how James had played through an elbow injury during the playoffs and how he\'d just offered that same quitter a $120 million contract. Now LeBron has bailed his ass out, through no fault of his own. The Heat are aging like the Nazi who drinks from the wrong grail, and the Cavs are young, will be able to pay him and play in a place near LeBron\'s mom. That\'s it.\n\nMeanwhile, Gilbert, like all rich swine, paints himself as a moral and responsible businessman. That his team occupies a taxpayer-funded arena, and he grew rich peddling reverse mortgages and allegedly misleading loan offers\n makes him a perfect oligarch stereotype. It gets worse when you note that, in the spirit of free-market competition, he waged the most expensive electoral campaign in Ohio history to win a casino monopoly that drains the local economy\n. He verges on cartoonishly evil territory when you also realize that he is one of the largest private landowners in Detroit and last year was pushing for the city\'s unelected Emergency Manager to default on $3.5 billion in unpaid, earned employee pensions\n.\n\nClayton Bennett and Aubrey McClendon, Oklahoma City Thunder Steve Spagnuolo Career Winning Percentage: 0.211\n\nCan you imagine how much Marv Levy must hate Steve Spagnuolo? Levy is a Hall of Fame head coach who never won a Super Bowl ring, while Spagnuolo is one of the worst head coaches in NFL history, and yet he still has three Super Bowl rings.\n\nAfter overseeing a New York Giants’ defense that helped orchestrate one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, Spagnuolo became the hottest head coaching during the 2008 offseason, the (then) St. Louis Rams won the “race” to secure Spagnuolo’s services as their next head coach… but that’s about the only winning they would enjoy for the foreseeable future. In three seasons as the Rams’ head coach, Spagnuolo won a grand total of 10 out of a possible 48 games, finishing with a 1–15 record in 2009 (the worst record in Rams’ franchise history) and a 2–14 record in 2011.\n\nWhen the Rams dismissed him at the end of the 2011 season, he had compiled the second-lowest winning percentage for a non-interim coach in franchise history.\n\nRod Marinelli Career Winning Percentage: 0.208\n\nMake no mistake: Rod Marinelli is one hell of a defensive coach, and perhaps one of the best defensive line coaches in the history of the game.But as Marinelli — among many others — proved, there’s a huge difference between being an assistant coach and the head coach. For all of the success he enjoyed as an assistant coach alongside Tony Dungy and Monte Kiffin in Tampa Bay, he clearly was overmatched when elevated to the head position himself.Case in point? If you’re one of the three head coaches in NFL history to lead your NFL team to a completely winless season, you’re unfortunately going to make this list.\n\nJerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys\n\nAgain, sometimes incompetence and/or looking and behaving like a hungover albino scrotum lurching into its eighth decade on Earth trumps social evil. Sure, Jerry made his money in oil, which is probably why just looking at the bloated monstrosity of a stadium he built can suck another 1,000 barrels out of the earth before you blink, but his brand of toxicity remains acting as the sybaritic embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger Effect\n.\n\nLike Mike Brown, Jerry is both the owner and General Manager of his team, which is the football version of the attorney who represents himself: He has an idiot for a client. Jerry immediately fired the Cowboys\' only head coach, Hall of Famer Tom Landry, and GM Tex Schramm, the man who\'d effectively run everything for the previous 29 years. Though their ouster was overdue, Jerry handled it about as smoothly as excommunicating a nun on her name day by punching her through a stained glass window. Luckily, the even more incompetent Minnesota Vikings handed him the worst trade in football history\n just months later, giving the Cowboys the building blocks of their dynasty. Not messing up someone else\'s unforced error probably marks the last smart thing Jerry\'s done, with one playoff victory since 1996 to the team\'s name.\n\nClaiming ""disloyalty,"" he parted ways with two-time Super Bowl winning coach Jimmy Johnson, later stating that ""any one of 500 coaches"" could have won with the Cowboys. He handed the reins to Barry Switzer, the Admiral Stockdale of the NFL, and Barry rode the last gasp of Cowboys inertia to a third title. It\'s all been downhill from there. Coaches Dave Campo, Chan Gailey, Wade Phillips. Quarterbacks Chad Hutchinson, Quincy Carter, retreads Drew Bledsoe and Vinny Testaverde. Jones even hired walking schtick Bill Parcells to chew gum and say ""c\'mon!"" real loud, despite the growing sense that Parcells\' bullshit doesn\'t work under a salary cap and without defensive coordinator Bill Belichick.\n\nJerry passed on drafting Randy Moss, gave two first-round picks for veteran Joey Galloway (the Seahawks used one on Shaun Alexander), and three picks for Roy Williams, who went on to catch 13 TDs in 40 games. And then there\'s all the other hands-on stuff: from walking down to the field and seeming to supervise Tony Romo\'s medical diagnosis when the man fractures his spine, to sexual harassment\n. All this before mentioning Arlington\'s $325 million contribution\n (or everyone else\'s) to building ""Jerry World,"" a stadium that on game day uses more energy than Liberia\n. Drill, Jerry, drill.\n\nJames Dolan, New York Knicks\n\nA recent poll of over 200 ESPN panelists\n named James Dolan the worst owner in the NBA, and it\'s not hard to see why. The Knicks posted losing seasons from 2001 to 2010, and they\'ve won only one playoff series since 2000. Most of that can be put down to Dolan\'s colossal mismanagement.\n\nWhere to begin? Maybe something like, a good indicator that you are a legendary fuckup is when an NBA rule is created and named after something you did. That\'d be the Allan Houston Rule, based on the Knicks extending the seven-year veteran a further six years and $100 million, despite the next highest contract offer being only $75 million. Teams can now release one player without having that player\'s salary weighed against the league luxury tax, although the salary still counts against the cap. Oddly, the Knicks bet that the injured, miserable Houston would retire, instead using the Houston Rule against the atrocious Jerome Williams contract they\'d just traded for.\n\nOr what about five years and $30 million for center Jerome James, based on an eye-catching postseason run that belied mediocre regular season numbers? James showed up the next year like he\'d spent the offseason practicing Golden Tee at Golden Corral, then played 86 games for the Knicks in his first two seasons and four in his last two. Then there\'s the Eddy Curry trade\n – which, I mean, Jesus Christ. Or not re-upping Donnie Walsh as GM after he started cutting out the Knicks\' deadwood contracts and adding parts still contributing to the recent winning seasons. Or firing Larry Brown with four years and $40 million left on his contract when everyone knows you only have to wait another year or so for Brown to get bored and quit. Or replacing Larry Brown with GM Isiah Thomas, who continued his GM duties just as badly. Or Dolan\'s company and Thomas losing a lawsuit to Anucha Browne Sanders, who claimed that not only did Thomas sexually harass her but that Dolan fired her in retaliation.\n\nAnd then there\'s everything about Dolan outside the Knicks to loathe. Like his running the New York Rangers into the ground for a decade, despite high payroll. Or the fact that he came to his exalted position at Madison Square Garden by working for his dad\'s company, Cablevision. Or the fact that on November 6th, the National Labor Relations Board charged Dolan with ""illegally threatening to withhold employee pay unless the employees voted against joining a union\n."" Or finally, spare us, O Lord – being so wholly immunized from taste, accountability and objective-fucking-reality that he not only performs live with a band called ""JD & the Straight Shot"" but released a blues single called ""Under That Hood"" about Trayvon Martin. JD & the Straight Shot also booked themselves to open for the Eagles\n at Madison Square Garden.\n\nJeffrey Loria, Miami Marlins\n\nIf you live outside the tax base of Miami, the most despicable thing Jeffrey Loria ever did came on the heels of one of the smartest things a sporting municipality every did: say no.\n\nAfter an initial investment of $12 million in the Montreal Expos, Loria triggered a series of showdowns with fellow team owners and local government until he wound up with 94 percent control, an alienated fanbase and a sweetheart ride out of town. Loria sold the Expos to ""Expos Baseball, LP,"" essentially Major League Baseball, for $120 million. He then bought the Marlins for $158.5 million, with the $38.5 million difference ponied up by MLB in an interest-free loan. After that, he committed to a strategy of cost-control with cheap young talent, selling off everything else\n, letting revenue sharing do the work of profit-making\n and crying poverty to the City of Miami, while resorting to the same threat game as in Montreal. (""San Antonio is a very viable market, and they\'re very serious. Read my lips: They\'re very serious."") It worked. Loria erected a white-and-pastel mausoleum massively underserved by public transportation, one so empty that the retail spaces in and surrounding it as well as parking remain un- or under-leased, cratering any illusion of the ""revenue"" that a publicly financed stadium would bring. In exchange, through 2048, the City of Miami is on the hook for $2.4 billion\n. With a B.\n\nTo complete the illusion that Loria would now use his new stadium to field a competitive team, he bought a lot of free agents, signed them to backloaded deals, then shipped them out within the year in a stunning 12-player trade that reduced his payroll obligations by $160 million. He even lied and told Jose Reyes to buy a house in Miami four days before exporting his ass to Canada. (So many awful things happened that year that you might as well just click this\n.) Loria is going to eschew free agents, trade away good players for prospects at the height of their value and keep ""rebuilding"" and pocketing revenue-sharing checks until he dies. Here\'s what baseball fans get in exchange: Go fuck yourself. In the meantime, he\'ll also probably continue meddling in baseball operations, switching starting pitchers and holding up talent moves, like he does already.\n\nAnd he\'s already started on the competitiveness shell game again, signing slugger Giancarlo Stanton to a heavily backloaded $325 million contract\n that Keith Olbermann sublimely tore to bits just a day later\n. But you get to make those decisions when you\'re someone who got a start in this world buying art for Sears. Who are we to judge a baseball man who has drunk so deep from the cup of life? After all, besides immiserating and plundering two baseball towns and every fan in them, Loria\'s great contribution to the world is a book of philosophy based on Peanuts comic strips where he assures us that the pre-teen characters of that world aren\'t into wife-swapping\n.\n\nDaniel Snyder, Washington Redskins\n\nIf you\'ve been paying attention to football this last year, you probably know Snyder as the staunch defender of an unambiguously racist name who can\'t stop putting a loafer in his mouth every time he opens it.\n\nSnyder has marshaled every resource of the rich white asshole invoking tradition to defend the indefensible. There\'s this pro-Redskins AstroTurf campaign\n from a giant PR firm. There\'s Snyder co-opting any local media\n going knives-out on the name or the fact that his team is stupendously mismanaged. There\'s Snyder trying to buy silence\n from Indian tribes. There\'s Snyder trotting out multiple Indian defenders of the name\n who aren\'t even Indians\n, when he\'s not sitting in his luxury box with a Navajo Nation leader\n recently kicked out of office under corruption allegations and in disgust at partnering with Snyder\'s ""Original Americans Foundation\n,"" a disingenuous whitewash PR group. There\'s Snyder sticking his fingers in his ears and pretending the Redskins were named to ""honor"" an ""Indian"" coach who turned out to be a German-American misrepresenting his race to avoid the WWI draft\n. Or sometimes he decides the name is meant to ""honor"" Indian ""heritage"" in general, and not as a marketing gimmick by their legendarily racist owner\n to identify the team with a much more popular baseball franchise.\n\nAnd that\'s just the name. You could go on for pages about the paranoid, Hitler-in-the-bunker mentality of the team, or the blithe unconcern with a shredded field and player health that already nearly Cuisinarted RG III\'s knee. And you could go on for pages and pages and pages of what a clusterfuck of tire fires the Redskins have become under Snyder\'s tenure, all set ablaze by the flaming sack of dogshit that is what passes for his conscience. In fact, someone already has. Dave McKenna of the Washington City Paper wrote a devastatingly hysterical A-to-Z guide\n to every contemptuous, miserly, greed-headed, soul-dead move Snyder has pulled in D.C., every bit of it true. Snyder sued McKenna and the paper anyway\n, because he wanted to see if the size of his war chest would back them down. Because he could. Because he\'s Daniel Snyder a failure who needs to rest in peace in the swamp somewhere.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.62635

Sean Quinn,2y,"Should sports teams for children under 14 have ""mercy rules,"" which end games sooner once one team is leading by an insurmountable margin?","Most youth sports do have mercy rules. I’ll address youth baseball because “Little League Baseball” has been tagged and it’s the sport I’m most familiar with because my son plays it in a recreational league, PONY which is similar to Little League, and on a competitive travel ball club.

In my son’s rec league there’s a four run per inning rule and after four innings there’s a 15 run rule and after five innings a 10 run rule. If the team that’s losing has batted, and had a chance to answer and score runs to be losing by 10 or 15 runs, and is still losing the game is called. They don’t like to call it “mercy” but that’s what it is.

In reality our league rarely enacts this rule because they want to let the kids to just have time to play, but because there’s a four run per inning rule it’s tough to run the score up by that much. To be up by 15 runs at the end of the 4th means the winning team needs to max out the 4 runs per inning rule while keeping the other team to 1 run or less.

The fields where we live are also booked back to back and you can’t start a new inning after 1 hour and 20 minutes into the game (if the game starts at 12 a new inning isn’t started after 1:20) so it’s tough to complete the 5th inning or get into the 6th innings where a game could get into that 10 run rule so it rarely comes into effect.

In my opinion the four runs per inning rule is much better because it’s more demoralizing for a team to be stuck on the field without being able to get three outs, especially for a pitcher that just keeps walking kids home.

My son’s travel ball games depend on the tournament rules although none have per inning run limits. Generally mercy rules are 18 runs in the 1st and 2nd innings (or the middle of the inning if the home team is up by 18 and that’s true for the following innings), 15 in the 3rd, 10 or 12 in the 4th, and 8 in the 5th or 6th.

It doesn’t happen often, especially before the 5th inning 8 run limits, because most tournaments try to have teams that can compete against each other and not be blow outs but the same thing happens with time limits. In most tournaments you can’t start new innings after 1.5 hours because another game is happening at 2 hours but during the championship games there’s no time limit and a team can have a big late inning and be up by 8 at the end of the 5th, or middle of the 5th as the home team. My son’s team mercy’d a team in the 5th by being up by 10 to win the tournament a few weeks ago but I hadn’t seen that happen before.

High school baseball has similar rules and they differ by state. Baseball is a unique US sport for scoring because there’s no set time limit like football or basketball. A baseball team needs to get three outs to end an inning and a game is a set number of innings depending on the age, but that means that in theory a team can score an infinite number of runs if the opposing team can’t get three outs. A team can’t run out the clock.

I’m not as familiar with current rules for other sports, but for youth and high school football the mercy rule usually entails that after a certain difference in points scored there’s a “running clock rule.” In California CIF rules state if one team is up by 35 at the end of the 3rd quarter the clock doesn’t stop when it normally would so the game is severely shortened, limiting how much the leading team can score.

After a quick look at

Mercy rule - Wikipedia
Rule that ends a sports event due to an insurmountable lead A mercy rule , slaughter rule , knockout rule , or skunk rule ends a two-competitor sports competition earlier than the scheduled endpoint if one competitor has a very large and presumably insurmountable scoring lead over the other. It is called the mercy rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser. It is common in youth sports in North America , where running up the score is considered unsporting. It is especially common in baseball and softball in which there is no game clock and a dominant team could in theory continue an inning endlessly. The rules vary widely, depending on the level of competition, but nearly all youth sports leagues and high school sports associations and many college sports associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball, softball, American football and association football. However, mercy rules usually do not take effect until a prescribed point in the game (like the second half of an association football game). Thus, one team, particularly if it is decidedly better than a weaker opponent, can still ""run up the score"" before the rule takes effect. For instance, in American football , one team could be ahead by 70 points with three minutes left in the first half; in baseball, the better team could have a 20-run lead in the second inning, but the game would still continue. American football [ edit ] Middle and high school football [ edit ] At the middle- or high-school level, 34 states use a mercy rule that may involve a ""continuous clock"" (the clock continues to operate on most plays when the clock would normally stop, such as an incomplete pass) once a team has a certain lead (for example, 35 points) during the second half ( Louisiana adopted a rule in 2022 which states the running clock is invoked when the margin reaches 42 points at any time during the game). That greatly decreases the amount of time taken for a game to complete, which reduces the leading team's chances to score more and the time that the trailing team must spend in facing an insurmountable deficit. In most states, the clock stops only for scores, timeouts (officials', injury, or charged), or the end of the quarter. Plays that would normally stop the clock, such as penalties, incomplete passes, going out of bounds, or change of possession, would not stop the clock. The rule varies by state; for example, the clock does not stop upon a score in Colorado , Indiana , Kansas (regular-season games only), or Missouri (fourth quarter only). In most states, once the point differential is reduced to below the mercy rule-invoking amount, normal timing procedures resume until either the end of the game or the mercy rule-invoking point differential is re-established; in Colorado, Georgia, Kansas and Louisiana, the clock continues to run even if the differential falls below the threshold. Most states that have mercy rules waive this rule for a championship game.

it looks like most youth through college sports have some sort of mercy rules on the books to keep the losing team from being completely demoralized.

I think youth sports, especially under 14, absolutely should have mercy rules. Contrary to what some parents think youth sports should be about building fundamentals of the sport, learning how to compete, win, and lose, build character, and most importantly be fun. That’s not going to happen when the final score in baseball is 25–0, or in football is 75–0, especially because youth teams can be so disparate in talent.

It is called the mercy rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser. It is common in youth sports in North America , where running up the score is considered unsporting. It is especially common in baseball and softball in which there is no game clock and a dominant team could in theory continue an inning endlessly. The rules vary widely, depending on the level of competition, but nearly all youth sports leagues and high school sports associations and many college sports associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball, softball, American football and association football. However, mercy rules usually do not take effect until a prescribed point in the game (like the second half of an association football game). Thus, one team, particularly if it is decidedly better than a weaker opponent, can still ""run up the score"" before the rule takes effect. For instance, in American football , one team could be ahead by 70 points with three minutes left in the first half; in baseball, the better team could have a 20-run lead in the second inning, but the game would still continue.

In the 1988 regular season, Hatcher only started 41 games, and was used as a pinch hitter 43 times. He only hit 1 home run in 202 plate appearances, while filling in as a utility player between the outfield, first base, and third base.

In the NL Championship Series, Hatcher got to play quite a bit, but did nothing outstanding. He hit .238 with no home runs, and committed 2 errors, tying for the team lead in errors committed for the series. He did have a 2-RBI double off David Cone in game 2, but was otherwise forgettable.

In the 1988 World Series, the Dodgers won over the Oakland A’s in 5 games. Pitcher Orel Hershiser was the MVP, and deservedly so, and the series is remembered for Kirk Gibson’s clutch home run ending Game 1.

However, Mickey Hatcher was the offensive star of the Series, leading all batters in hits (7), runs scored (5), home runs (2), and extra base hits (3). He tied Jose Canseco for the most RBIs with 5. He also played error-free ball in the field, playing almost all five games; he only sat out a total of 3 innings late in Games 4 and 5.

Rod Rishworth,3y,Do people who didn't play sports as kids have the opportunity to as adults? It seems like you can't join any teams or try any sports without having any experience.,"Of course; everybody has to start at some time, and better late than never. Tennis and golf are good examples of sports that are sometimes taken up only after retirement, possibly paying a pro for lessons to get some of that experience, but a friend of mine started playing rugby - a team sport if ever there was one - only in his forties, after a long time focussed purely on his studies and work and family.

There’s an important distinction to be made between majority sports and minority sports, by which I mean their popularity in your country. The most extreme example of a majority sport in the US is perhaps American Football, which is played massively at high schools, but much less by adults that have left college. So it is very understandable that experience is a requirement.

On the other hand, Rugby in many countries isn’t that popular at all, and thus not offered in schools, which means that many clubs cater primarily to people that are starting as adults rather than as kids. These clubs might be community-based, or alternatively as part of a university or college. I had the privilege of leading a series of free introductory training rugby trainings twice per academic year for some seasons, with as many as a hundred total newbies at the beginning of one year, and well over fifty in the others. Student sides need to replace losses due to graduates leaving, and some new players - admittedly with experience of other sports - quite often were playing competition matches before Christmas.

Most team sports are as much about training together as playing games. Serious amateurs should probably train together a couple of times per week, which is quite often going to be more than many experienced players with other commitments such as work and family can be available for in addition to the match day.

A contact sport like rugby will tend to have trainings that use game skills in game-like scenarios, but without being full contact intensity. So for example, touch rugby to warm up, then three against two combined attack and defence drills, and so on, perhaps culminating in a short game with modified rules so that players that are new or recovering from injury can take part.

The one disadvantage of minority sports is that the nearest opponents may be some distance away, but you should figure on a first season of mostly just training and at least being at home matches to provide moral support. Of course, if you can supply transport to away matches that others cannot, you may get a game on that basis too! But there are plenty of such sports, and there must be more than one that both appeals to you and is not completely closed to newcomers near you - if you can find them.

Another avenue open to parents in particular, but also to keen other adults, is being a match official. It is particularly easy to be fitter than the players when the players are under the age of ten or so, and as you gain experience you can move up the age groups. Again, you can start just in training, and only move to real matches when you do have the necessary experience.

Just ask around amongst friends and acquaintances when “pre-season training” starts for any sports that they play and that you are potentially interested in. Remember that the other adults potentially playing for the team - and the coach in particular - all love their sports just as much as I love rugby, and are probably happy to “make a convert” of you.

There are a heck of a lot of sports where physical fitness and mental strength are just as important as experience if not more so, and you can get that experience from training regularly with the team surprisingly quickly if you are committed.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v7ituydgpw5mhcf0', 'title': ""Do people who didn't play sports as kids have the opportunity to as adults?

Of course, if you can supply transport to away matches that others cannot, you may get a game on that basis too! But there are plenty of such sports, and there must be more than one that both appeals to you and is not completely closed to newcomers near you - if you can find them.\n\nAnother avenue open to parents in particular, but also to keen other adults, is being a match official. It is particularly easy to be fitter than the players when the players are under the age of ten or so, and as you gain experience you can move up the age groups. Again, you can start just in training, and only move to real matches when you do have the necessary experience.\n\nJust ask around amongst friends and acquaintances when “pre-season training” starts for any sports that they play and that you are potentially interested in. Remember that the other adults potentially playing for the team - and the coach in particular - all love their sports just as much as I love rugby, and are probably happy to “make a convert” of you.\n\nThere are a heck of a lot of sports where physical fitness and mental strength are just as important as experience if not more so, and you can get that experience from training regularly with the team surprisingly quickly if you are committed.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.57035
TheSports API,2y,What are some examples of disgraceful though not illegal tactics employed by sports teams in a game?,"It's not whether you win or lose but how you play the game. But still, many sportsmen chase the scores rather than maintaining the quality of competition.

Controversy erupted during the second ODI between South Africa and Pakistan at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on April 4, 2021. Having lost the toss, the Proteas were invited to bat first and openers Aiden Markram and Quinton de Kock gave a fiery start to the Proteas innings. Markram departed in the last over of the first powerplay but de Kock carried his onslaught and so did Temba Bavuma and David Miller, as all three of them scored half-centuries to help South Africa post 341 runs for the loss of 6 wickets in their 50 overs.

But Fakhar Zaman carried Pakistan’s hopes on his shoulders as he came up with a scintillating century.

However, as Fakhar Zaman was leading Pakistan to a victory, he was run-out by Aiden Markram and Quinton de Kock as de Kock dismissed him by fooling him that the throw was coming at the other end.

George Etteridge,Updated 5y,What is the most dominant single season sports team in history?,"McLaren-Honda, 1988.

The words “McLaren-Honda”, have been somewhat tarnished by the three inglorious years between 2015 and 2017, but before all of that they were associated with total dominance.

1988 is the reason why.

In the preceding years, Formula One had been dominated by cars with powerful turbocharged engines. In qualifying trim, with their engines turned all the way up they could generate around 1,500 horsepower, but since reliability was not as good as it is today they reduced the power substantially for the actual race. One of these engine manufacturers was Honda, who supplied Williams for the 1987 season. They were convinced to switch from Williams to McLaren for 1988, leaving Williams with Judd engines. If you have never heard of Judd engines before, there is a good reason for that.

Along with the new engines, McLaren also signed a new driver, a Brazilian you may have heard of called Ayrton Senna. He partnered the by then two time World Champion Alain Prost, driving the very impressive McLaren-Honda MP4/4 chassis.

Senna in the MP4/4

The results were spectacular.

Prost won in Brazil, then Senna in San Marino, where the two McLarens qualified three and a half seconds faster than anybody else. In Monaco, Senna absolutely blew everybody else out of the water in Qualifying, even scaring himself, then drove off into the distance in the race before crashing and handing the win to Prost. Prost then won again in Mexico, before Senna claimed victory in Canada and the USA. Prost won a home victory in France before Senna won four races on the trot, in Britain, Germany, Hungary and Belgium.

We interrupt this tale of sheer dominance for the Italian Grand Prix. Prost faced mechanical unreliability and so never really stood a chance, but Senna was winning until he tried to lap a backmarker in a Williams, failed and got taken out of the lead. This handed the victory to Gerhard Berger in his Ferrari, who won the first F1 race after the death of Enzo Ferrari.

Normal operations were resumed in Portugal and Spain, both of which were Prost victories, before F1 arrived in Japan. This was the big one; the title decider. Senna stalled it off the line and dropped down to 14th place, while Prost streaked off into the distance. However, Senna was not going to be denied. He fought his way up past everybody else, then caught and passed Prost to win the race and the championship.

With the championship decided, the last race took place in Adelaide, Australia, where Prost won and Senna took second.

There was sixteen races in the 1988 F1 season; McLaren-Honda won fifteen of them. It would have been a clean sweep too, if it wasn’t for those meddling backmarkers.

McLaren and Honda stayed together and kept winning for several years after that, but they never quite achieved the same level of dominance again. First Ferrari, and then Williams managed to catch up and Williams ultimately surpassed McLaren in 1992.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ce7qwydmg6429lnb', 'title': 'What is the most dominant single season sports team in history?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'McLaren-Honda, 1988.\n\nThe words “McLaren-Honda”, have been somewhat tarnished by the three inglorious years between 2015 and 2017, but before all of that they were associated with total dominance.\n\n1988 is the reason why.\n\nIn the preceding years, Formula One had been dominated by cars with powerful turbocharged engines.

James Keenley,4y,What qualities would a new sport need to have to successfully compete for attention and participation with soccer and basketball?,"It depends on which country you’re referring to, but I assume you’re talking about the U.S. Given that, a look at the recent success of professional lacrosse goes a long way to answering the question.

Lacrosse has exploded in popularity in the U.S., and on both the professional and amateur levels. When I was growing up in the 70s, lacrosse was seen as a sport played by rich kids at snooty prep schools. And it pretty much was. Back in the late 90s, I lived one town over from Ridgewood, New Jersey, a very affluent suburb of New York City. In downtown Ridgewood there a lacrosse store that exclusively sold lacrosse gear (and a quick check shows it’s still there).

Since then, lacrosse has grown enormously. It has become a staple sport in many American high schools across the country, many local recreation leagues have formed to support young lacrosse players, and there are now two professional lacrosse leagues, Major League Lacrosse (MLL) for men, and the Women’s Professional Lacrosse League (WPLL) for women, which played its first season last year.

That would have been unheard of 30 or 40 years ago!

While lacrosse certainly isn’t a “new sport.” It was developed by Native Americans at least 600 years ago (and perhaps longer), and lacrosse clubs began forming in North America around 1870. By the 1880s, it became popular as a college sport (and it remains a popular college sport today), and it began to grow popular in other parts of the world. Lacrosse became an Olympic Sport in 1904, and though it’s no longer played there, there are still international competitions today.

Most important, for American audiences, the sport lends itself to TV broadcasts. It has breaks in play with time to air TV commercials, bringing in revenue that U.S. soccer broadcasts can’t touch.

Lacrosse is not even close in popularity to the Big 4 sports, and it likely will never be as popular as those sports. But it is, perhaps a model for the introduction of a new sport.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sdgytm4heakr8qp2', 'title': 'What qualities would a new sport need to have to successfully compete for attention and participation with soccer and basketball?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It depends on which country you’re referring to, but I assume you’re talking about the U.S. Given that, a look at the recent success of professional lacrosse goes a long way to answering the question.\n\nLacrosse has exploded in popularity in the U.S., and on both the professional and amateur levels.

Alexander Jordan,4y,What is it like playing on a high school sports team with someone who eventually went pro? Were they noticeably better than other teammates/opponents?,"If you’re on their team, it’s relatively boring and almost always a safe win.

Against them is more fun, especially when you have good teammates, but at a certain point in game, you kind of know you lost.

I practiced basketball for a bit over 10 years, and did so with a friend who is now playing pro, for a decent salary that is only going to improve.

When I started, I was quite short (always the shortest guy on the field) and never really played anything but a point guard. For the first 4 years my ball control and agility along with speed were enough for me to dominate. That kind of playstyle was also what my ‘pro-friend’ relied on as well.

However, as years passed and I stayed short and didn’t really improve my skills so much as to compensate for the 20cm height difference, my friend hit his growth spurt and also continued to improve rapidly.

His father was a pro player in Europe back in his day, and was one of our coaches. He pushed him relentlessly, pro-friend loved basketball, had the genes, the talent — him going pro was almost inevitable.

Three of my closest friends (including the pro one) are all from my basketball days.

Growing up we played 2v2 and 3v3 pick-up games regularly. And I pretty much knew, whenever I was playing with him, it’d be our win.

He was much more advanced than any of us and it was painfully obvious. The other two friends (who also hit their growth spurts sooner, while I stayed short. The physical effects of puberty hit me at, like, 16…) could parry him for a while, but by the time we were all sixteen, there really was no match for him in our whole city on his position.

As I said, his father pushed him, he trained mercilessly and loved the sport he chose. He practiced with guys two-three-four years older than him and even there he was almost always in the starting five.

Ironically, now that I’ve outgrown most of my friends and developed my physique, when we play (which is, admittedly, very very rare) the difference is even more evident.

He’s much more explosive, his technique is levels above any of ours, he can pull up a jump shot from almost any spot inside the 3-point range, and on the rare occasion that he misses he’s on the board before you have the time to react.

What I can’t stress enough is that the people he played with and/or against are not uncoordinated, spastic, two-left-feet idiots. We all trained basketball intensely for more than 10 years and were proper players for our age group and it was still rare that we’d win more than one game without losing the next.

Those that are gonna go pro, diverge and stand out crystally clear by the time they’re in high school.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/il3qbcuhz7dn2s59', 'title': 'What is it like playing on a high school sports team with someone who eventually went pro?

I’m too lazy to go look up all the details, but what strikes me is: these sports owners of today, their egos notwithstanding, would do well to follow the qualities below, which I claim to be no “source” on. I give thanks to guys like the above for clarifying the big “WHAT’s,” the enduring qualities, of good management.

Here’s what I think most applies to sports owners:

-Delegation — Decentralize decision making. Keep out of the way of the day to day FOOTBALL, BASEBALL, BASKETBALL, or whatever the sport may be’s, decision making for on the field. Focus on visioning and strategy for the organization, instead. The culture. Let the GMs and coaches do their day to day jobs. This extends greatly into drafting and other staffing, operational and personnel decisions. Jerry Jones, for example, has done a great job in establishing the Cowboy brand. Look at Dallas’s country-wide fan base. The valuation of the team under him has been amazing. But his performance as a GM?? Maybe, after 25 years of not great playoff “progress,” THAT job, in hindsight, should have gone to someone else? Should still now go to someone else?

-Social Responsibility — The era of “just win, baby,” was catchy but it ended long ago. The era of “just for the boys” is gone, too. Today’s sports teams have social responsibilities to the communities which, to more or lesser degrees, support them. Kids idolize ball players, and deserve high standards to look up to. What goes on “in the building” nowadays is very visible to the public. Ball teams, AND the organizations of which they are a part, need to exhibit high degrees of moral and ethical integrity. I'm sad to say what just went on with the Celtics, my team, was very disconcerting. The violation wasn’t the “direct fault” of their ownership, but the environment, with all its rules & regulations, obviously tolerated coach Udoka’s behavior - as well as that of his “freind” in their early stages - for far too long. Till it got out of control. And we’ve seen even more egregious examples across all the sports of poor management oversight of organizations’ ethical and moral standards. An owner has a major responsibility to - not be a woke overseeer - but to lay down and ENFORCE reasonable ethical and moral standards before the s__t hits the fan. To have a culture of it.

-SMART Goals for the Organization — We have all kinds of “analytics” now for teams to evaluate players and to tell coaches how to play the game on the field. Great. But what about the organization’s, including the ownership team? I can’t imagine, as a fan, going decades and decades without a deep playoff run. Is it all about lack of a tv market and big money like they have in NY, Boston, LA and Chicago? What a bummer to now play for the Washington Nationals, huh? Although they did win a WS not that far back. After all these years, it must be very exciting for a team like the Mariners this playoff season. And look at the excitement and hope Steve Balmer has brought to the Clipper fans (yes, along w a barrel of money, too). But my point is: don’t fans deserve performance accountability right up to, and including, the owner? Do owners measure themselves or is it all, as far as they are concerned, just about their throwing money and mugging for the tv cameras? What has the Ray’s ownership been doing to always be a contender in a small tv market? That may be insightful …… Drucker’s “SMART method” was to employ measurable results for the ORGANIZATION to assess it’s performance. SMART = Specific (clear goals), Measurable (specific criteria to be used), Attainable (what’s possible ), Realistic (what’s within reach, and how long), Timely (gotta have dates). A good owner has a measurable five year -or whatever he timeframe - plan of some sort, no? It’s shared with the management team in the building, and not leaked to the hound-like press. It’s a guiding, and revisable, steering mechanism. The GM knows it and so does the coaching staff.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tmdvwneihf3rl0y2', 'title': 'What qualities should a good sports team owner have?', 'score': {'original': 0.99915, 'ai': 0.00085}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I liked to read the “management” theories of guys like Drucker and Fayol, back when I first started out as a manager.

Nitu Singh,1y,Which one is more complicated and easier between dual or team sports? Why?,"I think dual sports are easier sports and team sports are complicated Both dual and team sports are about competing against an opponent with the ultimate goal to win.

So what makes dual sports different from team sports? As you may already know from experience, team sports involve organized groups of players competing against each other. These include sports such as football, soccer, lacrosse, volleyball, basketball, softball and baseball. Dual sports, on the other hand, are played by two people striving against one another. Examples of dual sports include tennis and racquetball.

Some sports can dual and team. For instance, wrestling can be considered both a dual and a team sport, as the wrestler must compete individually on the mat against his or her opponent, but his performance affects the overall team's score.

Dual Sports

It's always fun to cheer on your team or favorite player, but understanding a little bit about the game and scoring can help. Let's take a look at a variety of dual sports.

One major dual sport is tennis, which involves a player using a racket to serve a ball over a low net while the opposing player attempts to return the ball back over the net. In tennis, points are awarded when a serve is failed to be returned. Tennis can be player against player, which is called singles, or it can be two players against two players, which is called doubles.

Another dual sport is racquetball. This game is much like tennis, except there is no net. Instead, the server hits the ball off of the opposing wall and the opponent must try to return the ball, again hitting it back against the wall. In racquetball, points can only be awarded to the server. Much like tennis, racquetball can be played either singles or doubles.

The last dual sport we'll discuss is wrestling, which involved two wresters competing for points. However, wrestling has a complicated scoring system. A fall, or pin, is when a wrestler is able to pin both his or her opponent's shoulders to the mat while exhibiting control. This awards the most points, which is six. An escape from the opponent is worth one point, whereas reversing control is worth two points. A bout is referred to as a major decision when the opponent wins by 8-14 points. If an opponent is winning by 15 points, the match is stopped and the win is considered a technical fall, worth five points. All the points per bout are counted toward the overall team score.

Team Sports

Now let's take a closer look at some different team sports. You may already be familiar with football, an American game in which teams defend their goals and try to score touchdowns on each other to win the most points. In football, a touchdown is when the team moves the ball into the end zone in one of three ways: by completing a pass or running the ball into the end zone; by recovering a fumbled ball in the end zone; or when a kickoff ball remains untouched and is repossessed by the kickoff team in the end zone. Directly after a touchdown is scored, the offensive team has a chance to score either one or two additional points. When the offensive team kicks the ball from the opponent's two-yard line through the goal posts located at the edge of the end zone, they receive one point, known as the extra point; or, if the offensive team decides not to kick the ball, but instead tries to run the ball into the end zone from the 2-yard line, they are awarded two points, called a 2-point conversion.

If the offensive players are unsuccessful at scoring a touchdown, they can try to kick a field goal from any position on the field through the goal posts. If the kicker is successful, his team receives three points. If the defense is able to tackle the offensive player carrying the ball behind his own goal line, he is awarded a safety, which is two points. Football is a full-contact sport where players tackle and block each other; therefore players wear helmets, mouth guards and protective body pads, including plastic padded shoulder pads.

Marc Lawrence,2y,"If agender people have no gender, then what sports team would they be on?","If gender is a purely mental construct, representing one’s mental state, and is completely removed from sex, then it is impossible to be agender, as the person with no mental state is braindead, and will not be doing much of anything.

If gender is related to sex, then it is also imposible to be agender, since one cannot have no sex at all. That’s dictated by one’s DNA. Ergo, one cannot be agender.

The agender position is totally contrary and contradictory to the idea of being transgender, and indeed gender as it’s expressed today is also fatal to it, since if gender exists only in the mind how can one be trans it? It’s like saying you’re transdepressed. Either it’s a tangible thing that is quantifiable, or it’s an abstract thing in the brain. It cannot be both. So one lot of them is lying.

What a mess. It seems like an exercise in sophistry to me; a position that changes depending on the need of the individual and therefore one that is constantly elastic and deliberately undefinable.

Bob Smith,3y,What are some examples of disgraceful though not illegal tactics employed by sports teams in a game?,"Football- Letting the other team score.

Pretend it’s late in the game, and the game is tied. You’re on defense, but your defense stinks; however, you offense is great. Instead of holding the other team back as long as possible and them scoring with 20 seconds left, you’d let them score right away with 1:30 left. This would give your offense a good chance to drive down and win or tie the game.

Steven Haddock,2y,"Has a pro sports team ever lost your allegiance, and why?","Sometimes, your team lets you down one too many times.

Having grown up in Toronto and being awake on Saturday nights, I became a rock solid Leafs fan from an early age. I was even at a game the year they won the Stanley Cup.

I remember in 1968 being heartbroken when this guy was traded.

He went on to win two more Stanley Cups. With the Montreal Canadiens.

I hung on with the team through the 1970s while they struggled and an EXPANSION team won the Stanley Cup.

I watched as the Leafs battled the Flyers year after year in the playoffs, only to lose every time until a babyfaced goaltender showed up and finally got the Leafs into the semi-finals.

But they bowed out to the Canadiens in the semi-finals.

Little did I know that was the last time they would get that far.

In the 1980s it got worse as another expansion team dominated

And then a WHA team!

But in 1993 it looked like the Leafs could do it. They had Dougie and Wendel and Potvin in the net.

And they were back in the semi-finals.

Unfortunately, so was this guy.

And when the guy scored from behind the net “by accident” to knock the Leafs out once again, I couldn’t take it any more.

I haven’t watched hockey regularly now in almost 30 years. Instead, I look forward to Toronto’s other team in blue. Two shades of it actually.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bo8emcxg2j1y3aps', 'title': 'Has a pro sports team ever lost your allegiance, and why?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Sometimes, your team lets you down one too many times.\n\nHaving grown up in Toronto and being awake on Saturday nights, I became a rock solid Leafs fan from an early age.

John Adams,4y,"Factoring every team sports, in terms of leagues, which one do you think is the most physically demanding?","Well as someone who lived in USA for a long time, American Football came to my mind first.

It’s a full contact sport where almost everyone needs to be big/stacked. Some of the hits, especially in the yesteryear eras, are absolutely vicious. And being a RB in NFL is prolly the most physically demanding position in any league sports. But when you look at the sports as a whole. It’s not the most physically demanding. Sorry, but with all the breaks, the offensive, and defense sets, the substitutions, and all that. The sport is deliberately designed to push certain aspect to the extreme in extremely short bursts.

Physically punishing? Very much. Most physically demanding? Not so much.

So, I looked at soccer, & basketball. Then I began to chuckle thinking about all the flopping around in those leagues. And how the refs are intervening even at the slightest hint of contact. No disrespect. I mean those lads are fit. Extremely fit. Most modern day footballers are starting to evolve to become more & more muscular. And most NBA players are starting to look like freak of nature. Seeing someone like Giannis, KD, Lebron move the way they do is just amazing. I love the sports, and they are elite level athletes. But … But.. I have to move on.

So, I thought about Ice Hockey. But then I realised I’ve never even watched a single game to recognise if it’s the most physically demanding or not. Maybe it’s the most physically demanding sports out there. But IDK enough to tell anything about it.

Then I began looking at Aussie Rules Football. As obvious by it’s name. It’s Australian Rule Football. It’s difficult to explain, so I won’t. It’s their own NFL of sorts. And I only began following it after I moved to Australia. Here’s a clip of one of the games from today if you just want to get the general idea of how the sport looks.

It’s a full contact sports where players run like crazy. But then again, this sports is more cardio based, where you needed to be just muscular enough to weather the tackles. And their rotational substitution system allows for players to catch some break while the game is still going. Still it AFL player have to cover most distance when compared with other major sports.

So, I moved on to another sports I became familiar with after I moved to Australia. i.e. Rugby. I think this is the league sport which is the most demanding. I am going to post a clip of a game just for those who might be unfamiliar with it.

Rugby is probably the best sport where they’re trying to get as big as one can get so they can batter each other to bits, while also pushing their aerobics to the max. An average Rugby player covers around 7.2 km/gm in a game that lasts for 80m divided into 2 halves. They don’t have rotational substitution system unlike AFL, or constant breaks like NFL. So, you can’t just focus on muscle, and ignore your cardio. Players are in perpetual collision playing both sides of the game. So you can’t just focus on cardio either.

So I am going to stick with Rugby as the most physically demanding league sports.

Note: Every sports requires its own dedication, discipline, effort, and skill set to succeed. Just because I said I think Ruby to be the most exacting league sports. Doesn’t mean I am saying other sports are easy. Maybe there are some sports league I missed. I would gladly welcome any comments on it.

Michael W.,4y,What popular sport has the highest death count?,"Let’s look at the candidates…

Only one NFL player (Chuck Hughes) died on the field, with only one MLB player dying as a result of play, and only one NHL player (Bill Masterton) who died from an on-ice injury.

There have been numerous hockey players who died as a result of complications of injuries, especially in the early days before helmets where head injuries could occur just from falling to ice level. Howie Morenz famously died of a coronary embolism caused by clots from a broken leg sustained on ice while in the prime of his career.

It’s worth mentioning that many sports which seem safe arent. Even cricket has seen fatalities due to batted balls hitting fielders in the head or neck, in the last few decades.

This does not include children, teens, and college and amateur players who have died as a direct result of injuries sustained during play.

There are other sports with untold numbers of immediate deaths - boxing and horse racing are very old so there’s no way to know how many. Well over 500 boxers have died in sanctioned matches since the 1880s.

Skiing is inherently dangerous as well - hundreds of people die while skiing each year, most of them being recreational skiers and not in competition. Long-distance running (including the marathon), triathlon, and even recreational swimming have had participants die from overexertion or other pre-existing conditions. Running isn’t inherently dangerous like skiing (because you don’t lose control as easily), and neither is basketball or soccer, but even elite-level athletes have had unknown conditions which resulted in death during play.

Newer to this are motorsports - car racing, motorcycle racing, motorboat racing, and even the very dangerous attempts to set speed records - result in numerous fatalities during participation.

But I would bet that the #1 most dangerous “sport” is cycling - these human-powered vehicles can get to very dangerous speeds, and compete with cars and trucks for space. In 2016 alone, in the US, 3500 people were killed or seriously injured in reported road accidents. That’s just one country, and many times more than those who died in sanctioned boxing competitions.

Jason Whyte,4y,Should little league teams and other school sports teams give out participation trophies?,"What you get is what you measure, so if what you want is participation in sport, then it makes sense to incentivise participation with a token.

And incentivising participation is important, not just because it promotes exercise, but also because it's very hard to tell at a young age which kids might excel as they get older. My children had to be cajoled through tag rugby - and participation medals certainly helped - until they found their niche and self-motivation as contact was introduced.

Small children - under 10s, say - really seem to value having something at the end of the day by which to remember it.

However, in my experience they pretty quickly work out that sport is competitive and they start to value the victories more and more. They rumble pretty fast that participation trophies just celebrate turning up, and they lose their value.

That resets a little with each transition point. Kids who are way beyond participation trophies in most circumstances value something that commemorates their first tour, or their first match at a new higher level, or their last match with a particular team.

It's the same motivation that leads really big kids, who ought to know better, to bring back “souvenirs” liberated from the grounds and towns they visit.

Rechavia Berman,4y,"In sports, when a team has a ""home field advantage"", does that actually mean anything?","Depends on the sport and on the team, but less than it used to.

The home field advantage consists of:

Most of the fans will be rooting for you. The building will be mostly quiet when you’re shooting free throws/on offense in football/whatever and be very loud when the other team is. This is more than morale - it’s straight up a tactical advantage. The more knowledgeable and engaged your crowd, the more they will maximize this, and know which opposing player to taunt at which time to throw him off his game, and to chant your player’s team appreciatively after he made a mistake, so he doesn’t spiral in self-blame and lose focus but gets right back in it, etc.
You’re playing at home. That means you haven’t traveled hundreds of miles by bus or thousands of miles by plane to get there. You’re not homesick, you’re not having to put up with hotel bullshit, you got a good night’s sleep. Also, you know every square inch of the field/court better than your opponent. Back in the day, stadiums and field sizes were less uniform and the rules about sizes less strictly enforced. There were A LOT of oddities. Especially in baseball fields which were all sorts of sizes and had all sorts of unique features like Fenway Park’s Green Monster; or very old basketball courts, like the Boston Garden, where the Celtics once won a very important game because Kevin McHale or Larry Bird knew that precisely where they were standing the floor was a little out of whack and caused the ball to bounce in an unexpected way - which you could expect if you’d seen it over and over in practice, not if you played there twice a year tops. Even today, you can use subtle features of your home court or stadium to your advantage. How the wind behaves there, sunlight angles, that place down the sideline that’s a lil bumpy… all sorts.
Again, very sport-dependent and locale-dependent, but some “fans” really are fanatics, and make you wonder if you’re making it out of this place in one piece if they aren’t happy with the game’s result. Not so much in the US, except mayyyyybe some hockey towns, but soccer (futbol) and hoops in Europe? Hell yeah.
It’s expected to be an advantage, so sometimes it acts like a placebo and gives you extra confidence and peace of mind regardless of the objective reality. This of course can be a double-edged sword and instill complacency, or motivate the opponent to achieve an “upset” and shut your nasty-ass fans up.

Tom Clemans,4y,"What are the pros and cons of allowing your teen to be kidnapped for an ""initiation"" night for a sports team?","Our son was at the end of a successful 9th grade football season. The varsity team planned an activity in which the 9th graders ready to move up to the varsity team the next year were to be “kidnapped” from home and taken to the activity.

Two of the varsity team seniors were students in a class I taught off campus. They assured me that the coaching staff would be chaperoning the event, and that all of the planned activities had been approved by the coaching staff. I learned that one or both parents of every 9th grader on the freshman team received a visit from two varsity team members to explain the evening, and to get written permission to “snatch” their son from home on the scheduled evening.

I never learned what all they did, but our son said everyone had an awesome time. More than 20 years later, he is still close friends with several of the varsity team members who ran the event.

Halle Wilson,4y,What team or individual sport have you competed in?,"Well, let me think back… At age 5, I contracted Perthes disease in my right hip. I was on crutches and a brace for 4 years until the age of 9. At the age of 10, I started playing Pop Warner football, at age 12, I began to play Country League Baseball and I continued to play both sports until I graduated High School. I was very good at football, I was all-city second team in 1968, and I won the Golden Helmet Award in 1969, only 4 were given out in our state of Florida.
In Junior High, I took Judo for two years but stopped to concentrate on Football and Baseball.
I went to the Univ of Tampa in Florida on a football scholarship but injured my knee and sat out a year. While I was sitting out I got attracted to Pro Wrestling and began following it as the Univ of Tampa was just a few blocks away from the sportatorium where they taped Florida Championship Wrestling for TV
The Univ of Tampa dropped football in 1974. So I came home to Jacksonville, and I met some Pro Wrestlers in 1981, who recruited me to join their Wrestling School, Frenchy Martin, Louis Tillet, and Johnny Montana. They were taking over Sunbelt Championship Wrestling from Don Curtis and Boris “The Great” Malenko.
From that point on, I was very involved in Pro Wrestling only. In 2004, I officially retired from in-ring competition.

Fred Owens,2y,Do professional sports teams actually play moneyball?,"Original question: Do professional sports teams actually play Moneyball?

As I understand it, Ian Wright only accepts individuals on his ITV gameshow Moneyball
, which means teams couldn’t take part.

It’s times like this I wish Billy Beane’s editors and Hollywood had come up with another title, something like Being Beane - How I Learned to Compete on a Small Budget. A title like that wouldn’t be so misunderstood and create so many misconceptions.

Moneyball isn’t a game; it’s the first word of the title of the book Amazon.com: Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game
 and the title of a movie based on the book.

The book’s premise - misrepresented in a movie full of mistakes - was Beane looking for a way to compete with a budget that didn’t allow the Athletics sign high-dollar free agents. In other words, he wanted to spend the least money possible to add players that helped the team win. To do that, he hired Paul DePodesta in 1999 and, over the course of three years, expanded the Athletics’ use of statistics.

The process didn’t happen overnight, nor was the idea particularly new, and while perhaps underappreciated, the metrics used weren’t new either. The difference was that Beane lacked the payroll power of larger teams, which forced him to push aside all resistance.

If your question is, did teams suddenly realize that players without glossy stats lines but a history of sold performance were valuable, the answer is no. Teams have always looked for undervalued players.

If your question is, did teams see the 2002 Athletics and say, OMG, we have to do that too, the answer is no. Many teams were already expanding their scouting to include the new metrics.

If your question is, are all of today’s teams using advanced metrics to help them make player decisions, the answer is yes.

Any advantage teams like the Athletics had by early use of advanced metrics vanished rapidly as the teams with deep pockets hired the best statisticians and built large statistical analysis divisions.

One wonders what would happen if Hollywood fell in love with Jonah Keri’s “The Extra 2%.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3satcm0q1j6hige4', 'title': 'Do professional sports teams actually play moneyball?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Original question: Do professional sports teams actually play Moneyball?\n\nAs I understand it, Ian Wright only accepts individuals on his ITV gameshow Moneyball\n, which means teams couldn’t take part.\n\nIt’s times like this I wish Billy Beane’s editors and Hollywood had come up with another title, something like Being Beane - How I Learned to Compete on a Small Budget.
