Anonymous,Updated 6y,What is the life of an IT employee after being fired from a company?,"Until February 2017, I was working for a small US based IT company in Mumbai. I’m basically from Hyderabad. My Company had their own Product developed on java. I was a Lead Java developer. I worked with this company for almost 4 years. I was the core person who developed most of that product. Product got released last year and the company had couple of leads and they were in a very good profits.

Suddenly, My Managing director called me into his cabin and started discussing all the things about the company, its profits, investments, e.t.c. and ended up saying that they had some financial problem. He asked me to resign officially and released me from my position in 3 days. They Gave me 45 days paid salary as a compensate.

I still remember that day, i went straight to a near by park sat down for couple of hours, self-evaluated a lot of things, Nothing was going into my mind. I was in so much panic. Not sure how people gonna treat me if they get to know about this.

I went back home and discussed the same with My Wife, had a call with my Mom and Dad who were back home in Hyderabad. They were in shock and my wife started crying. I have a 3 month old baby girl when this thing happened.

For next 2–3 days, i was just at home spent time with my little baby, tried to talk to all my friends over phone call and discuss my situation. Shared resume’s across the network i had . Friends mainly. Naukri, Shine, Timesjobs everywhere i had my resume updated.

Me and My wife decided that we will first relocate to my Native Hyderabad, spending single month in Mumbai with out income is a big expense. We had small savings which will help us survive in hometown with out income for 5–6 months.

In 10 days, i relocated my family completely to Hyderabad. Met few friends, most of them were ready to help me financially, and few of them referred me to their companies for job.

Luckily, One of my friend gave reference for a position in his company in Hyderabad. Got a call from HR and I requested the HR to schedule my interview in 2–3 days, I prepared for interview so much as i had to crack it. never in life i prepared soo much, not even in school and college.

Finally, I went for the interview. It was a complete day process with 3 rounds.

Luck favored me here and I had experience in all the technologies they were working on. Interview went really well. Cleared all of them and Successfully got the JOB Offer.

In just a week time i was offered with a good hike on top of what i was earning in Mumbai. With out no second thought i have accepted it.

I’ve joined the new Company in Hyderabad in April 2017.

Now i’m in my Home Town, With my Family( Joint family), saving all the rents and other expenses i had in Mumbai. Spending almost every week end with my childhood friends.

Now i think, Everything happens for a good reason!

That’s my experience of losing a JOB!

Edit:1 Thanks a lot guys for your support in the comments, I just thought to share my experience and your blessings and comments really touched me. Made my day!

My Wife is currently a home maker taking care of baby. She is also a post graduate, she will start her career soon and My Baby today turned 10 months old.

Prajwal R,Updated 7y,Who has the coolest corporate office building in Bengaluru?,"I must say its The Flipkart Main Office !!

I feel proud to work in here, as you all know Flipkart has many office in Bangalore. But only few people have seen the main office of Flipkart from where Sachin and Binny work and almost 80% of the employees work.

The building is a regal black glass-concrete skyscraper, and has Flipkart’s new logo tastefully positioned at the top.

On prominent display are pictures of legends in several fields of achievement, including Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, John Lennon and Steven Spielberg.

Some hallways are designed like running tracks, and the Olympic logo is thrown in for good measure.

The working areas look roomy and colourful.

There are also lots of breakout zones where employees can gather and ideate.

We even have a cozy little library.

Flipkart hasn’t forgotten its beginnings as an online bookseller, and this piece of artwork seems to be a tribute.

The building is peppered with quirky installations, keeping with Flipkart’s youthful work culture.

And predictably, we are quite high on the geek quotient too.

It just isn’t all fun and games. There are some classy elements as well.

We creatively played with the lighting, which is very unique for an office building.

And finally when it’s time to unwind, the employees can play a game of miniature golf.

It’s always fun and joy while working at Flipkart.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2hwzly48uicftomx', 'title': 'Who has the coolest corporate office building in Bengaluru?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I must say its The Flipkart Main Office !!\n\nI feel proud to work in here, as you all know Flipkart has many office in Bangalore.

T.M. Gautham,Updated 5y,How do companies lose customers?,"Around two years ago I switched to ACT Fibernet from BSNL broadband.

It was a Sunday. I called ACT. They were there in my home within hours. They completed the registration and document verification in minutes and I got the connection.

I got a new connection on the same day I requested them, and it was a Sunday.

Recently, I moved to my new house. So, I called ACT and asked them to transfer the connection to my new house. A guy from call center picked up the call and told me that it would take seven days for transferring and it would also cost ₹600 for transferring the connection.

I didn't know the reason for charging ₹600 for the transfer. They don't incur any expense for the transfer.

I was wondering why they needed seven days for a transfer while they could give me a new connection within hours. Seven days without food is possible. Seven days without internet isn't possible.

I just made another phone call from another mobile number. I asked them I wanted a new connection immediately.

They said that they'd do it immediately and they also mentioned that there was no installation charges.

The next day I got a new connection. I called them and informed to remove the previous connection.

Companies lose their customers because they don't treat their customers the same way before and after getting money from them.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7jpcbx4enf82m06i', 'title': 'How do companies lose customers?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Around two years ago I switched to ACT Fibernet from BSNL broadband.\n\nIt was a Sunday.

David Michael,Updated 5y,What companies have chosen morality over profitability?,"Has a company ever chosen morality over profitability?

SC Johnson made a choice like this, and it’s hurt sales ever since.

Saran Wrap is a product people in the United States know well, and it’s been popular for years… it hit the markets in 1953, and quickly became popular for its utility in storing food. It blocked odors, it microwaved well, and it did a better job of clinging to containers than any other product on the market. (It may have been popular in other countries as well, but I have no frame of reference for that.)

If you’ve used Saran Wrap in the past decade or so, you’ve probably noticed it’s not as effective as it used to be.

Originally created by Dow Chemicals, Saran Wrap came under SC Johnson’s control in 1998. Shortly thereafter, they discovered that one of the chemicals used to manufacture the famous plastic wrap, polyvinylidene chloride, had toxic effects on the environment.

They attempted to find a replacement that would preserve the qualities of Saran Wrap people had come to love, but after a year of effort, SC Johnson made the decision to remove the chemical and release a new formulation. It’s not as effective, but it no longer poisons the environment.

There was no boycott, there was no federal investigation… the company discovered the danger, and then voluntarily gave up its competitive advantage in order to avoid harming the environment.

Govind Raj,Updated 4y,What are some dirty business tactics large companies use to scam people?,"Here is my experience of a Honda two wheeler service centre. I took my 5 years old activa scooter for service. During inspection I mentioned that there is some leak from the scooter which looked like this.

Now he guessed it as oil leak and gave an estimate for ₹ 1000/- as overall charges. Everything was fine until I got a call from them the next day.

Service guy: ""Sir, we need to open up the crank of engine to examine the oil leak. It would cost some 4500₹ for labour and 6000₹ for parts.""

Me: ""no please! let it leak(the leak is just few drops, the scooter is an old one and I’m already considering buying a new one. The way he spoke raised suspicion. So I went to check with my local mechanic)

Do a regular service and hand over the scooter""

Service guy said ok.

Two days went past a with no reply.

Third day he called again and told the scooter won’t start. All their attempts had failed.

I asked them how could a running scooter go dead despite no repairs. Suddenly he let loose a statement that someone claimed that I brought the scooter by walking it. Now I sensed everything. He wanted me to give a go ahead for the crank repair thing. I said I would come in person and I wanted my scooter in the same condition as I left it with an angry tone.

I went to service centre immediately and met the guy. He sensed my angry looks and took me to his senior service person after ten minutes. All of a sudden the senior said that I only needed to replace a spark cable which will cost me ₹244/- and the scooter will be ready.

I confronted them with few questions and finally told them that I brought the scooter riding on it and not by walking in a stern voice; asked them to check CCTV. They got embarrassed while I got my scooter ready within an hour.

After this service, my oil leak has stopped completely without even working in the engine and crank.

The real scam here is service centre guys asking for your permission over phone. This has happened to me earlier for my Maruti 800 where I asked them to deliver the car without service, after which they fixed and returned it.

So I never give permissions over phone anymore. You may be busy in office or work and in a hurry you might give them go ahead. Never do ! I always visit the centre, question them and then decide. That would save you a lot of money.

Hope many would have gained experienced out of this!

You may be busy in office or work and in a hurry you might give them go ahead. Never do ! I always visit the centre, question them and then decide. That would save you a lot of money.\n\nHope many would have gained experienced out of this!\n\n15k upvotes! Thank you all!', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9998
Ryan Gray,Updated 5y,What companies have chosen morality over profitability?,"Volvo

In 1959 a Volvo engineer named Nils Bohlin invented something very important.

The 3-point seat-belt.

Now, back in those days when not very many cars had seatbelts. Even if they did it was simply just a strap across one's lap that often caused more injury than it prevented.

Volvo’s marketing campaign was that they were a safe car brand. Having this could have made the company millions.

But they didn’t patent it.

By doing this they saved millions of lives.

Anybody could use the seatbelt. Soon almost all cars had them.

Even to this day that invention is saving lives.

Thank you Volvo.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7xk6btop32dqmwlj', 'title': 'What companies have chosen morality over profitability?', 'score': {'original': 0.9978, 'ai': 0.0022}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Volvo\n\nIn 1959 a Volvo engineer named Nils Bohlin invented something very important.\n\nThe 3-point seat-belt.\n\nNow, back in those days when not very many cars had seatbelts.

Herbert Delling,4y,Have you ever seen a mass exodus after a respected employee quit or got fired?,"Waitresses have been known to take their customers with them, when fired, or quit.

My mom was a waitress at a short order grill in Little Rock, in the 60's. A very good one, waitress and grill!

I was a child, and the civil rights movement was strong there. Mom had a disagreement with the owner one evening, about her serving a black couple. “There's only one color of cash!” She'd say!

Mom asked me to go with her to work the next morning, so I went, no questions asked. She had about 30 “regulars”, and the place held less than 50.

She put on her apron, and started serving, when the owner came to her and told her she was fired. I didn't hear it, didn't have to! I've seen that look before!

She looked around the cafe, catching the eye of her regulars. “Looks like I won't be serving y'all this morning!” Mama said. “Walgreens will put me on this morning, if y'all would like me to serve you, meet me there!”

That was the first time I heard the phrase “mass exodus”, first time I saw one too! Every single customer there got up and walked out behind us!

My mom's family didn't have much use for her and me. After my dad died, she was a single mom, and a waitress, and I didn't have a dad. But that morning, I learned a very important lesson.

“To be of service is the highest calling!”.- Nick Nolte “Peaceful Warrior”, is a quote I often use now days, to describe the true power of “humble service”!

Even as a lowly “waitress”, a widow, and a single mom, in the 60's, in Little Rock, Arkansas, my mom had more power than anyone I'd ever seen!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/p93weqo2ra6u0hsl', 'title': 'Have you ever seen a mass exodus after a respected employee quit or got fired?', 'score': {'original': 0.996, 'ai': 0.004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Waitresses have been known to take their customers with them, when fired, or quit.\n\nMy mom was a waitress at a short order grill in Little Rock, in the 60's.

Arpit Khunteta,5y,How do companies lose customers?,"ZOOMCAR

Booked a Zoomcar for a roadtrip with friends. Paid full amount in advance. Was excited for the trip, woke up at 5am to collect the car at scheduled time of 6am….now the fun part starts…

I receive the location of car as shown

Time: 6 am - these locations are 9 km far apart - I decide to go to one shown by navigation, near the airport in the screenshot - NO ZOOMCAR to be found there.

Contacted customer care and was asked to go to Durgapura Railway Station

Now time is 6:45 am - Guess what? NO ZOOMCAR to be found there - Customer care repeating the same old tape recording: We will contact you within 15 minutes.

Now time is 8 am - No call received from customer care - We friends try getting info from zoomcar office in jaipur, even they were clueless.

At 9:20 am, someone from Zoomcar finally calls and shares a whatsapp number for pinpointing car location - a totally different location 11kms away from the location initially shown in their application

Anyways, we decide to go there, hail another cab in a series of cab hailing from the morning 6 am and reach the given location

GUESS WHAT? NO ZOOMCAR there….

Now we surprisingly receive another location on whatsapp - a brand new one

Now time was 10:30 am (4hrs 30 minutes from scheduled start of trip) and my patience reserve was running dry.

I called the customer care again (which by the way does not give a damn to what’s the customer’s problem is) and asked them to cancel and refund the booking along with all the cab fares and compensation for mental torture and harassment I faced

And their final say is we cannot refund the cab bills paid by you for finding the zoomcar which we were supposed to pinpoint to you but we failed miserably and cost you so much.

UPDATE:
Someone from Zoomcar finally called and had a discussion. We finally agreed on taking Zoomcar credits worth the cab bills incurred. Let’s just hope that Zoomcar strives to improve their system to prevent any such incidents in future.

I sincerely thank everyone for the help and support rendered to me in this matter :)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wvtzkqni264l13ya', 'title': 'How do companies lose customers?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'ZOOMCAR\n\nBooked a Zoomcar for a roadtrip with friends.

Dave went through hell to try and get United to pay for their sins. After nine months of struggle he agreed to settle for $1200 flight voucher but later was informed by the airline that he wouldn't get it as he missed his 24 hours of reporting window at the time of his initial complaint.

Aled Jenkins,4y,Which business ideas failed because they were ahead of their time?,"How do you fail with the best idea?

Be too early

“Within five years I predict it will be the most popular form of PC sold in America”

The year is 2001, and Microsoft releases a tablet (9 years before the iPad). At the time, Microsoft could not lose. Anything that Microsoft touched turned to gold. So what happened?

Gates was at a press release where he described the tablet.

The tablet was a flawless piece of technology combining the operating power of a computer with the portability of a phone. It seemed to be a gift from the heavens. Pages flowed effortlessly from one to the next.

However…

The press was not convinced saying

Why would anybody want to have such a large portable device? We have a computer at home and a phone for portability. Would people buy this?

Gates’ reply

“within five years I predict it will be the most popular form of PC sold in America.”

And Microsoft pushed hard for this outcome. They advertised the smooth-as-silk design and the unimaginable power for running applications.

And NOBODY BOUGHT.

There were a few purchases but nowhere near enough to make a profit. Why?

Microsoft believed that everybody loved computers. This was true but Microsoft failed to realise that people who used the tablets had different wants to those who used computers. The tablet needed different features to a computer. Also, the tablet was too expensive at over $2,000 because it was so costly to make.

Microsoft did make a mistake and they learned from it. They adapted their product range and created their successful Surface line but…

As Microsoft was struggling; panicking on how to save themselves from this disaster, there was a company watching. They had watched everything. Seen everything. They had become successful to fund their tablet which they believed would be better. Their name was Apple. The Apple iPad came out in 2010 and transformed the industry.

Jennifer Maiko Bradshaw,Updated 6y,What is the most catastrophic mistake made by an intern at a company?,"Not precisely an intern, but I was a flight attendant on her very first flight.

There’s one critical thing flight attendants must do on each flight, and it’s not coffee runs. Flight attendants must arm the plane doors before takeoff and disarm them before opening.

What does arming doors do, you ask?

Arming doors prepares the doors for emergencies. Disarming the doors disables the emergency functions.

I got to see firsthand what happens if you don’t disarm before opening.

We had landed. The pilot had requested the FAs to prepare the plane for disembarking.

I was looking at this:

And for a brief second, my mind went blank. My months of feverish training felt years ago. I looked at the big door handle, and the bright red arrow and OPEN sign.

I reached for the handle…

And stopped, horrified at what I almost did. I quickly switched the lever that disarmed the door, double checked, and turned to my counterpart at the opposite door, to double check that she had done the same.

She was midway through lifting the door handle. I had no time to stop her. The door opened, and with a big BANG!

The inflatable slide-raft burst out, the whole plane rocked a little, and the new FA, one of the many women who had taken training with me, stood there immobile.

The passengers were watching, concerned, so I reassured them, told them not to come near, and gently guided the FA away from the door - we were so high from the ground! - and made her sit. Silent tears rolled down her prettily made-up face.

This slide-raft is not designed with reuse in mind. It can’t just be deflated and rolled back into the plane - it’s meant to be used only in dire circumstances. The plane had to be fitted with a new raft before it could fly again - taking it out of the sky for weeks, causing a big ripple effect.

The crew was stranded in Los Angeles and a new plane had to be brought in from Vancouver. This caused big delays, fines from various airports, overtime for crew, and followup investigation.

I heard various estimates for the cost of the fallout, some up to $10 million.

The FA was let go - ostensibly not because of her mistake, but because afterward, she froze and didn’t help with damage control or ensuring safety.

Edit: Thank-you everyone for reading!
As a funny aside… I had yet another minor crisis in my very first month of FAing. A heavily substance-abused man in one of the carts for unloading bags crashed into another plane I was FAing in. It broke the air seal on the cargo hold door, necessitating repairs. This was again, at LAX, leading me to conclude that the airport was cursed. The man in question threw his badge at his superior and quit rather than undergo a drug test.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ru0ndzotsjc7f8y2', 'title': 'What is the most catastrophic mistake made by an intern at a company?', 'score': {'original': 0.9974, 'ai': 0.0026}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Not precisely an intern, but I was a flight attendant on her very first flight.\n\nThere’s one critical thing flight attendants must do on each flight, and it’s not coffee runs.

Thanks to this guy.

When he took over, Microsoft’s market cap had been going nowhere for a decade.

In the 4 years since Nadella’s taken over, market cap has more than doubled to over US$700bn, only $100bn shy of Alphabet.

Wall Street knows he is making all the right moves.

Microsoft’s focus on cloud is paying off, with Azure leading the way, and Office transitioning well.

In Windows 10, it has also had its first decent Windows release in well over a decade.

Stu,6mo,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","At my former employer we had a saying “Hell hath no fury like a loyal customer scorned”. I now know that I am one of those customers.

I was a customer of ATT Cellular for over 20 years, paying well over $350 a month for 5 lines for my family. That’s $350 after all the “discounts”. The incentive to stay with ATT was mostly inertia and a “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it approach”. In spite of the bluster, they really didn’t give any incentives on new phones other than interest free financing, and I knew I could probably find a better price elsewhere, but…

Then a few months ago my credit card number got stolen (not the card, just the number) and the bank caught it right away and changed the account number. This happened to be the card that ATT used for my auto-bill. I didn’t realize it until they sent me a text saying my monthly payment was one day overdue. So immediately I went online, paid the one-day overdue bill, and changed the credit card number. The bill was over $50 higher due to removal of the e-bill discount and a late payment fee.

The next bill also had a removal of the e-bill discount and the added charge of $7 for late payment. I thought that was unfair, but I let it go.

But a month later the next bill arrived and still had no e-bill discount and added another $7 late fee! I called up to inquire and was told too bad, it takes at least a month and a half to register the new credit card in their system. All I wanted was the recent $7 late fee credited. First I appealed to their sense of fair play, and got nowhere. I then asked politely if I could ask a manager for a waiver.

The manager said no way. I pointed out I was a customer at $350 a month for 20 years, but I would leave over $7. He calmly told me the equivalent of “don’t let the door hit you in the ass” (I’m paraphrasing). No raised voices, just a calm discussion that ended in goodbye.

So I started the research, and found a carrier that uses the same cellular network plus others, and is costing me $210 a month less! $210 a month less for the same exact service!

Alisha Talks,Updated 3y,Which businesses took an unexpected hit because of covid-19?,"My father's business has taken a turn for the worst. Up to 70% of regular customers have vanished in the last week, and our profit has plummeted by a large margin.

I know many takeaways and restaurants are facing the same problem too. Some have already gone bust…

Yesterday evening I patiently waited for orders to come through. On a typical Sunday, we would rake up to 40 orders. This Sunday we barely reached 10.

Watching my dad on the verge of tears and frustration was difficult. It was the first Sunday in years where I simply sat for an hour, praying that the phone would ring or the chimes placed above the door would make a ting noise.

It's understandable — people are afraid of the unknown. We've become cautious and super vigilant about germs and contamination. Customers do not know the health of the person handling the dishes, so cooking at home appears to be a safer option.

Yuvi Singhal,Updated 4y,"Why does everybody become frustrated after working in Infosys, TCS Wipro etc?","The boy who sold his iPhone. From the blog written by a nice HR in TCS (almost all of them are pathetic, however, this one is rare). This is a real story of just one guy. No one knows how many more are there.During my stint as the HR of a large customer account, I got a chance to interact with diverse people. However, none as different as this one. He definitely is an apt choice for a challenging HR case study. I have not used the names of the associates involved or the name of the customer. One Monday morning I get this mail from one of the technical leads in the account.   Dear Yogesh, Please do talk to this associate. He has been unruly, unproductive and has availed unauthorized leave in the past month.  Give him a stern warning. I have asked him to come to your cabin at 2 pm.   These mails are run of the mill ones, usually on young associates who need some HR “tough” talk. Meeting with HR: The guy turned up at 2.30 pm. His black shirt wore a crumpled look and his grey faded trousers were well past its “expiry date”. His face was covered with thick glasses and a flowing beard. He was extremely underweight and felt straitjacketed by his shirt. If there was one word to describe him it would be Unkempt. He seemed to be jittery at the prospect of meeting with a HR.  But I am not a big fan of censuring or reprimanding people, especially young people. It always tends to be counterproductive. So I wanted this to be short.  “Listen Ryan(name changed) I have got whispers from your leadership team that you have not been up to the mark. Pull up your socks and start contributing to the team’s cause. Or we are staring at a disciplinary action.” The guy was unmoved.  “Got it?” I asked, slightly irritated.  “Yes sir” he shuddered.  “Good.” The hidden talent: Just then he received a call. A loud ringtone. He silenced it. It was an apple IPhone. He was fiddling with it for a couple of minutes. The display was unalike I have seen in any of the apple devices.“Hey what version is that?” “11.0. Jailbreak” “What do you mean by Jailbreak” He stammered.  “Go ahead in your local language”.  “I have customized the phone. Something that Apple doesn’t allow. I can control my house devices now through this phone. I have built an app.”  “Really?” He showed me an app, which can control electronic devices like fans, refrigerators at his rented accommodation!” “God. How did you manage it?”  “Python language. A few cheap devices/gateways and a cloud server to connect to.” I browsed through his phone(with his permission) and was shocked. It was cluttered with a lot of custom made apps.  Once we switched to the local language he opened up completely. He was apparently a codevita winner and graduated from a small town college. His dad is a farmer in the hinterland and also lends money to fellow farmers. The latter half of the statement is to suggest that his dad is a rich farmer and has acres of land. The harassment and subsequent frustration: “Just two questions to you. I am running late for a meeting. Which technology are you working currently and what made you take 2 days leave without prior permission?” “Selenium but I merely run already customized scripts. No coding involved. My lead shouted at me in front of everyone. Not for the first time.” (I dint understand the selenium jargons, but what I understood is that it is pretty much manual stuff.) “If this is the reason, then half of TCS would have to go on indefinite leave.” I said sarcastically.  “No he has been picking on me for quite some time now. I am so depressed”, he said with overwhelming emotion and tears in his eyes. I sensed something was wrong with him and opined him to meet the TCS counsellor.   After Ryan’s meeting, the counselor did confirm that he was depressed and he had suicidal tendencies. I was shocked. I spoke to the leadership team and got him transferred to another team which does use python. But he was in trouble once again. I had a few “informers” in the account who updated me that Ryan’s expertise in the technology pricked many senior’s egos.  Eventually a month after switching to the new team, Ryan was in my cabin yet again. This time he was beaming with confidence and happiness. I guessed it right. Some other hawk(a product company – Z**O) had managed to smell his exemplary talent. What Ryan needed was grooming, coaching and patience. In my formative years even I had my own set of personal problems, but my leaders understood and backed me. Ryan unfortunately didn’t have that privilege.

Sean Kernan,4y,What is the most catastrophic mistake by a large pharmaceutical company?,"In the 1980s, Bayer developed a drug that was designed to help patients who suffered from hemophilia.

Hemophilia is a disease that causes spontaneous bleeding. Their product was a blood-clotting agent that could save lives.

The problem?

The first iteration of the drug utilized the plasma of blood donors. Bayer sent a huge, huge shipment into Asia and South America, The problem? They had cut corners during the treatment process—which has to be done exactly—or it puts patients at risk—and in this case—it surely did.

In turn—thousands of patients were accidentally infected with HIV. (Source: Bayer Sold HIV-Risky Meds. CBS)

The story sounds like something out of a dystopian nightmare—but it did indeed happen. Bayer was implicated along with three other companies.

And—15 years and $600 million later—everything was resolved.

It’s surprising that they are even in business still.

Ty Doyle,6mo,"Should a company be held responsible for their product's effect on society? Like if a company that sells guns and the person used the gun to kill people, should the company take part of the responsibility?","No, this is in fact a terrible idea. As fate would have it, I was initially pondering how best to answer your question a few days ago, right before I took a trip to Home Depot. And with your question in mind, Home Depot looked less like a DIY paradise and more like an armory: literally hundreds of products sold there, from good old fashioned lumber to saws and other sharp tools to dozens of highly toxic substances could, in the wrong hands, be used to injure or even kill other people. Were we to hold manufacturers responsible for people using their products for illegal purposes, manufacturers would either go bankrupt and cease making thousands of highly useful products that are dangerous in the wrong hands or such products would cost substantially more than they do today. You think houses are expensive right now? Imagine what they’d cost if lumber manufacturers get hit with 7-figure verdicts every time some moron hits someone else with a 2x4 and you then have to go through mountains of paperwork and deal with licensed resellers just to get a few pieces of wood.

It is the role of lawmakers to decide that certain products are too dangerous to be sold, or can only be sold to certain people. But if a product is legally sold, manufacturers should only be liable for harms caused by the product being used reasonably. To use the example of guns, if there was a gun that tended to fire even when the safety was on or that ejected shells in a manner that tended to injure the person pulling the trigger, those would be reasonable bases for a lawsuit, as that particular gun could not be operated safely by even a reasonable user because of defective design. Similarly, if a product was poorly marketed and failed to warn consumers of risks they would realistically encounter in normal product use - such as drugs with fatal interactions with other drugs - that would also be the basis for litigation.

But at the end of the day, guns are designed to kill other living creatures, and gunmakers should not be punished for selling legal products that are misused. Again, if people conclude that the negative effects of a product, whether guns or lumber, outweigh its benefits, it’s up to lawmakers to regulate the product in question or take it off the market.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xcwkqh2p1tfy4nvr', 'title': ""Should a company be held responsible for their product's effect on society?

Daniel Kaplan,4y,"Should a company be held responsible for their product's effect on society? Like if a company that sells guns and the person used the gun to kill people, should the company take part of the responsibility?","I’m going to admit to something up front. Nope is absolutely right in that guns are designed to kill.

Should people be allowed to sue firearms manufacturers? I do not believe so. As many others have stated, the only reason this is an issue is that suing gun manufacturers for the misuse of their products seems like a great way to end gun ownership. We would never dream of doing anything similar with other goods. As an example, if someone were to grab a dictionary and bludgeon another human to death with it, would we sue the publisher or printer? Of course not.

But this is different, right? The issue arises from the fact that guns are designed for one purpose: to kill. Yes. It’s true. We can pretend there are other purposes. After all, I have several of them, and they’ve never been used to shoot a person. I could pretend that they can only be used in competitions. Some could be used for hunting. Maybe I can claim that I’m just collecting. Still, I have to admit that they are designed to kill. I see no other way around it. Even my little .22 bolt action rifle can kill a person.

The problem? Not all killing is the same. Hunting animals or killing humans during wartime are completely different. Those are both different from murder.

What else is different? Pocatello man who was shot while breaking into neighbors' apartments to threaten them with machete

I would suggest that the consequence of not having a gun in this situation is the deaths of innocent people.

That is not the same as murder. That would be considered “justifiable homicide” except that the aggressor here survived. That, I would argue, is the issue. Guns are designed to kill, but not all killing is wrong.

Thus, guns are made for a purpose that isn’t unlawful. People who misuse them are criminals and should bear all of the responsibility, as should anyone misusing a dictionary, a car, or who purposely crashes an airplane into a building. I don’t think this means that victims should be able to sue Webster, Fiat, or Boeing.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/z98bhqljtk2nuoi6', 'title': ""Should a company be held responsible for their product's effect on society?

Myra Scott,4y,Have you ever seen a mass exodus after a respected employee quit or got fired?,"I have been taking my family’s cars to the same mechanic for 19 years. I am on a first-name basis with the counter staff. Whatever they tell me must be done, I trust them and I have it done.

Forrest Harris,1y,What is the biggest mistake that a big company has made?,"Morphine comes from opium, while heroin comes from morphine. In 1874, British chemists added glacial acetic acid to morphine and synthesized a white crystalline powder, the scientific name of this white crystalline powder was diacetylmorphine. In 1897, a pharmacist named Felix Hoffmann from Bayer in Germany synthesized diacetylmorphine again, and the company was delighted with its superb cough and pain-relieving effects. It was proudly launched by Bayer and was given the superb name ""heroin"", which means ""hero"".

That led me to: he gets $220-440 per hour and I get $10.

It was our last job of the year and I said nothing.

Next year in spring he called me and I upped my price to $20 per hour.

He freaked out, and asked if I was crazy.

I said, “Go and hire anyone you want, you won’t make as much money as you do with me and you won’t spend the last two hours at the bar drinking beer with somebody you like.”

He hired someone else.

Abhijay Kumar,Updated 4y,How do companies lose customers?,"This experience is about Xiaomi - The current number one smartphone brand in India and how their mobile service centers cheat customers.

A lot of people were overwhelmed when Xiaomi launched the POCO F-1 . It seemed to be an incredible phone at a very affordable price.

Image Source: Poco F1 price, specifications, features, comparison

One of my friends bought this phone in September 2018 and was quite happy using it until one day in December, it slipped from his hands and its screen cracked.

Fortunately, he had availed mobile insurance from Airtel Secure[1] and the policy covered screen replacement. My friend, like any other customer, raised a claim with Airtel Secure describing the damage details. He also had to send a photo of the damaged phone along with the IMEI numbers. This is what the phone looked like after falling. Kindly take a note of the IMEI numbers as we will come back to this later.

Source: My friend. Personally identifiable information was blurred by me. The photo was taken before sending the device to the service center.

After doing all the diligence and submitting the Claim, Airtel decided to proceed with the claim. They also offer a pickup and drop service with their policy. Sounds very convenient, isn’t it? So the phone was picked up by Airtel and delivered to the Xiaomi service center as expected.

After 2–3 days, to my friend’s horror, he received a text from Airtel stating that the device was a beyond economic repair(BER) case and since it was insured for a sum of ₹18k, he would be credited with ₹16200 (10% of insured amount being processing fee) and device kept by them to salvage parts. He then asked them to mail the service record of the device just to see the break up of the repair costs.

Now if you look at the service record shared by Xiaomi, it says Device Restart, Auto Restart problem and they have also added a 6GB + 128 GB Motherboard to the bill, meaning that the motherboard was replaced.

First of all, there was no restart problem in the device and the motherboard was working just fine. Okay, let’s go with the story that just like any other service center, Xiaomi too was trying to overcharge their customer by adding something which was unnecessary. Airtel was paying ₹16200 out of the total ₹18000 incurred, but my friend still would have to pay ₹1800 for no reason. Being an engineer and a pro-Android user he was pretty sure that there was nothing wrong with his motherboard. He wanted to take his phone elsewhere to see how the motherboard got damaged. So my friend did not go for the claim and asked Airtel to return his handset without any repair.

After another 2–3 days, he did receive his phone and it didn’t even boot up. He was very disturbed as the phone did boot up earlier and now it was like a dead brick. Since he had denied the repair offered by Airtel, the only option left was to spend 18k out of his own pocket and get the phone fixed all over again. The POCO F1 lied dead almost for 3–4 months until he visited Delhi recently and decided to get it checked at another Xiaomi service center. After getting it repaired from a third party store he was dumbstruck post booting the phone and seeing this...

Imagine turning on your phone and seeing someone else’s photo as wallpaper. At first, he thought that his phone might have got exchanged. But if you look at the cracks in the screen, they match exactly with the one above, also the body hadn’t changed at all.

Source: My friend. This photo was taken after the device was received from Airtel finally repaired at another third party SC. Notice the IMEI numbers have changed.

Ideally, the previous service center should have returned the phone as is without changing anything as the customer denied their service. However, to his surprise, they changed the motherboard as evident in the above photo. The IMEI [2]number is stored in the motherboard and clearly, the first service center had fiddled with his motherboard and replaced it with a faulty motherboard and was offering to repair this faulty board and charge him for it.

Thankfully, the technicians at the new service center were very helpful and hepled him retrieve the service history. After seeing the service record, things started to get clearer as in how the previous service center had cheated him.

This motherboard is his phone was 6GB+64 GB. How crazy is that? They put a faulty 64GB motherboard in a 128GB phone. He was also able to get the name and contact of the person to whom it originally belonged to. Not only that, just imagine him having all the personal data, contacts, Google account, etc. of the person to which the motherboard originally belonged. Looks like Xiaomi’s service center takes data security very lightly and they might fit your motherboard into someone else’s handset not realizing that motherboard also contains your phone’s storage and will eventually put all of your data at risk.

This faulty 64 GB motherboard had come to the same service center, a week prior to my friend’s phone. The Xiaomi guys kept that part with them, stole my friend’s original motherboard and replaced it with the stranger’s faulty motherboard they had received earlier. Evidently, they might have been pissed at him not going for the repair seeing the unnecessary mainboard replacement in the claim.

The above documents, service records, and screenshots are enough to prove that the Xiaomi Service center did a horrible thing and most probably cheated two customers. Post all this drama, when my friend got his phone checked at a non-Xiaomi service center, they started using it as an excuse to dodge the bullet and said they cannot fix his phone since it was opened elsewhere.

Also, their customer service is of no use and they keep replying like a dumb, poorly coded chatbot.

Any sensible person would figure it out in no time, seeing all the proofs but Xiaomi staff is consistently in denial and not willing to accept their mistake. As a result of it, my friend went through so much trouble and disgust and ended up with someone else’s faulty motherboard. He could have easily gone for a screen replacement in ₹4–5k from a third party service center or a service provider like ScreenPro[3].

Xiaomi might be the number one mobile phone brand in India, but the way their customer service and after sales treated my friend and handled his phone, they surely have lost two genuine customers(including me).

Who is to be blamed for all this? Maybe some greedy guys at their service center who don’t give a shit about the brand and are there to make a quick buck.

What did they put at stake? A stranger’s reputation, personal information, photos, chats, everything, and most importantly Xiaomi’s reputation. Imagine the motherboard getting into the hands of a criminal or a wrong person, he could have blackmailed the other guy as he would have access to all of their data.

What is Xiaomi’s fault in this? Not listening to their customers, not tending to their problems and not firing the service center employees who indulge in such thievery. Most importantly, not accepting their mistake and offering to fix it.

What is our lesson from this experience?

Always take a photo of your phone with the IMEI number before submitting it for service.
Do not leave the service center without cross-checking your IMEI number and matching it with the old one.
Also, try to go to the service center in person and do not rely on pick-up/drop. The service center guys are well aware that it's a third-person picking up the device and they are bound to do shady stuff.
Another important thing is, make sure to get your phone wiped even if it is fully damaged before submitting it to any service center. They might not go through the pain of wiping your data, before replacing your motherboard and this could prove to be fatal for you.

This is how Xiaomi lost two of its customers. I was gonna throw away my Mi and about to buy a OnePlus anyway. Learning about this experience only made my will stronger.

Update: There is no resolution even after trying to reach Xiaomi through multiple channels and tagging Manu Jain, they didn't even go through the details already shared with them and are still asking us to contact their support/fill out forms. My friend decided to raise this issue in the Consumer Forum and the case has been registered. Will keep everyone posted with any new developments. Thanks to all for the support.

Final Update: After filling a complain in Consumer Forum, Xiaomi’s state head contacted my friend and enquired about the problem. We directed him to this answer and thankfully, he was able to understand it. Xiaomi had some kind of setup with OneAssist (the company providing mobile Insurance on behalf of Airtel). There was some internal communication between these stakeholders and finally OneAssist decided to repair the phone again. My friend received the repaired phone yesterday and everything looks good now. It has a new motherboard and display. We are really thankful to everyone for sharing and upvoting this answer. Seeing the number of views and upvotes would have certainly alarmed Xiaomi as they wouldn't have wanted to lose so many customers. Until now our complaints were falling on deaf years but this answer changed it all.

Yatin Hiwarkar,Updated 5y,How do companies lose customers?,"XIAOMI India.

This happened couple of days back.

A colleague of mine had a bike accident. His elbow and a leg were peeled badly, actually a shoe had torn apart due to the friction between him and the road. Luckily he didn't have head injuries and is doing fine.

Another thing happened that his phone, an Mi A1, had glass damage. His screen had cracked but the LED display was still safe.

Few days later after joining office, he was asking around us colleagues for a solution to another weird problem.

His phone was stuck only on ‘Android One’ logo screen for hours. He tried restarting the phone several times but to no avail. Hence, he was not able to use his phone at all. He was almost going to buy a Redmi Note 5 pro due to frustration, as he was not able to contact even his family for some days and had to use someone else’s phone every time he wanted to talk to them.

He also asked me the solution. I took the phone in my hands and analyzed the problem and tried troubleshooting it.

A little background here, during my college days, I was fascinated by the website of XDA developers and hence I used to actively root my phone, flash Custom ROMs, kernels and even unlock bootloaders. Once I had bricked(dead state) my old Micromax Canvas HD while flashing another ROM. I spent the entire night to download softwares and OEM ROM, but by morning I had my phone working again! The feeling of seeing your phone work again is priceless!

Now coming back to the present, I didn't wanted to try fancy stuff in other person’s mobile phone. So I just searched on Google “how to enter recovery mode on Mi A1”.

I found that for this model, I could press the Volume up + Power key after the screen just turned on after a restart.

And after a few tries, voila! I was into the recovery mode. But there was another problem like this,

The ‘no command’ error.

Although I could access the menus as you can see, and it was highly likely that the ‘wipe data/factory reset’ option would have done the trick.

But the catch was, the phone would return to out-of-the-box state again. My colleague would have lost all data.

Hence out of courtesy, I informed the risk of the wipe data option, as I was not sure how critical his data was. He got more confused, but I told him to check once with Mi Service Center, if they could salvage his data.

Next day he went to the nearest Mi Service Center.

After enduring a line like the ATM lines after demonetization, he was told to keep his phone with them to check the issue. He was called back after 4 hours.

After 4 hrs, he was told these golden repeated words,

“Sir, it’s a motherboard issue. We will have to change the motherboard. It will cost around Rs.5,000.”

Apart from this screen was promised to be fixed in Rs.1,500.

Luckily, my colleague didn't feel it was a right analysis of the situation, as the screen was in fact turning on. So how could the motherboard still power on the display?

So he took back the phone, and still paid Rs. 200 as ‘handling charges’.

That day in office, he requested me to do whatever I suggested previous day.

I used the ‘wipe data/factory reset’ option.

The phone came to the android set up screen within 5 minutes after wiping data.

My colleague shrieked with joy!

His phone was working normally. He said he couldn't thank me enough.

I did some research on this issue and found this thread on Mi forum.

MI A1 STUCK IN ANDROID ONE LOGO [HELP] - Mi A1 - Xiaomi MIUI Official Forum

Some screenshots are as follows:

And the most common solution was,

Go to the service center - where they will say the only one nonsense thing called motherboard issue, and will loot you as you are not aware of such technical stuff.

So basically they will exploit their helpless customers!

Hence, I request you to please try some Googling before you handover your hard earned money, just like that.

Jackie Hart,2y,Should parents of young children be given priority when it comes to a company allocating Christmas leave?,"I work at a casino. I don’t have children. I remember sitting in the office doing some paperwork while 2 other managers were sitting there talking about the upcoming holidays and how hard it was working the holidays with young kids at home. I didn’t say anything or interject myself into the conversation in any way because I already know the perception. Nonetheless one of them took it upon themselves to tell me how much easier it was for me to work the holidays since I didn’t have kids and I couldn’t possibly understand how hard it was for them.

I walked out before I lost my temper because there were a few things they didn’t know. First of all that I was raised as a Jehovahs Witness and didn’t celebrate Christmas as a child so it meant a *lot* to me as an adult. It was about my escape from a cult, about my freedom, and about celebrating family I wasn’t allowed to know well when I was in the religion. The holidays are precious to me. The second thing they didn’t know is that my grandparents were not doing well. It was likely going to be the last Christmas I had with them.

Here’s the thing, you don’t know anyone else’s circumstances. And my employer does not get to decide that my coworker’s family is more important than my family no matter how I define my family.

Hector Quintanilla,4y,What is the reality of startup life?,"“Who wants to go to Disney World?” I asked my kids.

Immediately they reacted shouting, “Me! Me! Me!”

I turned to my wife and whispered in her ear, “Project sold. We have our ‘startup team’ onboard!”

“Okay, okay! Calm down, kids. Don’t get too excited yet,” I said in a loud voice, “This will be a long trip. Florida is very far away. It will take two days to get there.”

“Only two days? Ohh, come on, dad, that’s nothing! We can take it.”

“Kids, I’m telling you this won't be easy. I can assure you this will challenge every one of us,” I said.

“No worries, Dad. We can take it. We’re ready!” my girl said confidently.

So we started planning our trip.

We did some research, paperwork, and finally packed our luggage to make this ‘project’ a reality. The motivation and excitement were enough to lift every one of us into taking care of all the details.

The day finally came. No more planning. It was time to take action! “Hop into the car,” I said, “And don’t forget your luggage!”

That day we woke up at 5:00 AM. Everyone energetically jumped out of their beds. The goal was clear: Get to Disney World! Our plan was to drive to New Orleans, sleep there and continue to Orlando the following day.

Easy, right? That’s what we thought …

As soon as we took action, reality kicked in.

“Dad, I need a restroom!”

We stopped.

Then we hit the U.S. border with two long hours of car line.

We stopped.

“Mom, I’m hungry!”

We stopped.

“Dad, are we there yet?”

“No, we still have several hours ahead of us,” I answered patiently.

Then, internal problems began to emerge, “Keep your hands to yourself!” one said.

“I didn't do anything!” the other said.

“Yes, you did!”

We stopped for a break before the conflict escalated.

Then, our resources started to become scarce. We needed gasoline but found no gas stations nearby. Patience. Uncertainty. More patience. Nerves. Uncertainty.

It took time, but we finally found one.

We stopped.

Then we bumped into an accident in the middle of the highway blocking the road. We had to use a different road to avoid all the traffic.

It took us much, much longer than expected to get to our first destination, but, finally, hotel and dinner for everyone!

Tough day, full of unexpected issues, but we successfully solved one at a time. Day one … OVER.

Early the next day, I woke up to motivate the team. “Who wants to go to Disney World?”

“Me! Me! Me!” They shouted jumping out of their beds.

“Quickly,” I said. “We have another long day ahead of us,” I told my ‘partners.’

Everyone was excited. Off we went …

A couple of hours later, problems started to happen again, “Mom?”

“Yes?” my wife asked.

“I’m dizzy!” one of our children said, followed by a long pause.

“Mom? I want to …” my kid said with his eyes popping out while holding his mouth tightly.

“HECTOR,” my wife shouted, “PUT DOWN THE WINDOW AND STOP THE CAR!”

We stopped.

Then a restroom.

We stopped.

Then gasoline.

We stopped.

A few hours later, “Dad, I’m hungry!”

We stopped.

“Mom, are we there yet?”

“Not yet, we still have a few hours ahead of us,” my wife patiently said.

Then a yellow warning light appeared on my dashboard. “CHECK ENGINE.”

I found the nearest Honda dealer. We deviated from our route, again. A few hours later, success. Issue solved. We continued.

Then emotions started to overtake us.

“Dad, I want to get out. I don’t feel like going to Orlando anymore,” my girl said impatiently.

“We’re almost there,” I said.

Emotions turned into desperation …

“DAD, ARE WE THERE YET? WILL WE EVER GET THERE?”

“Yes, we’re just a few minutes away.”

Minutes felt like hours, until FINALLY … we got there.

This is an exemplification of “the startup life.”

Expect a journey full of emotions. You will experience good days and bad days. You will work hard with little-to-no progress and multiple unexpected roadblocks along the way.

That’s okay. That’s the road everyone goes through on their way to “Disney World.”

We all start with a dream. We plan. That’s easy!

The real adventure starts the moment we get moving, and like on any road trip, your PATIENCE will be tested.

But, hey! Cheer up! Remember that “Disney World” awaits you at your destination!

My advice: Control your attitude!

Remember that the “adventure” that leads to your destination is also part of your overall “Disney Trip” experience!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9etmx0s5ny8zc163', 'title': 'What is the reality of startup life?', 'score': {'original': 0.9336, 'ai': 0.0664}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""“Who wants to go to Disney World?” I asked my kids.\n\nImmediately they reacted shouting, “Me!

Vijayaraghavan Karunakaran,Updated 5y,How do companies lose customers?,"Keep a watch on this name.

KOTAK Bank

The latest scam by these kind of banks is what I am gonna share.

It all started with this ad which I encountered online. Can you see up there their first feature?

Upto 6% interest per annum on their Kotak 811 account.

That's basically a lie. You can only get 6% interest if you have a balance of INR 100001 or more. And guess what? Maximum limit of Kotak 811 is INR 100000 only.

I came to know about this after opening an account with Kotak 811. Then I decided to go ahead and become a Savings Account holder. A guy from Chennai Velachery Kotak branch approached me to explain about different options they have. Let's call him Employee1. I was convinced with the features available for Pro Savings Account and applied for it.

The above pamphlet was shared to me by Employee 1. He also called me back after a couple of days to give me another so called irresistible offer.

The offer was that, I don't need to maintain an AMB(Average Monthly Balance) of 20K if I have a demat account from Kotak. And INR 750 is all I have to pay once in a life time to have a demat account. At first, I would be debited an amount of INR 20750 and INR 20K would be returned back to me soon after completion of demat account opening. No other annual or monthly maintenance charges at all. I had doubts on these charges and asked him again a couple of times. He had promised me about the charges and told that these are final. I agreed upon it and told him to proceed further.

Another person from Kotak came for demat account processing and let's call him Employee2. He came to me, got me signed in an application form and left. It took him more than 3 weeks to create a demat account where as my friend at the same time opened an ICICI direct demat account in 3 straight days sitting right next to me at my office. I still thought that it was worth the wait since I was going to get a better offer in terms of brokerages and other charges.

This is the screenshot of my account transactions. This is where, it all started. I was debited INR 20,750 and credited INR 18,919.76. I immediately got a call from Employee2 and was told that an amount of INR 65 willl be debited from my account every month for AMC(Account Maintenance Charges). I was taken aback because this was never shared to me earlier. And I was also not explained about why I did not get my assured INR 20K back. I called Employee1 and asked him about what was happening. He again promised me that there are no charges for my account and told me that he would talk to Employee2.

The next day, I was again called by Emoloyee2 to know if I am going to use my demat account. I asked him first for my update. He told me that Employee1 has clearly told me about all the charges that are going to be debited already and gave the mobile to Employee1. He told that he had clearly told all the charges from day 1. I asked him about the last conversation we had and he still lied that he told about the charges in that call too. Employee1 also told me that these AMC charges were implemented during the 3 week demat processing period that I was waiting for.

I was pissed at all these conversations and got their manager number and called him to explain all that I have faced till then. I was assured that it would be taken care and I would be contacted in a day. Nobody as such called me for a week and I called the manager again for the update. His answer was not satisfying and he was supporting his employees.

I immediately sent an email to Kotak escalations about the incident and I am yet to receive any money from the bank. While suffering through all these drama, there was another shocker on the way. I was debited another INR 885.00 for Debit card Annual Fee after 3 months of use. I then went online to check their charges and also contacted their customer care.

What I have is a platinum debit card and it has no annual fee for the first year and there onwards, it's only INR 250 per annum. But I'm debited INR 885.

If I had even kept my money in any other account I would have at least saved an amount of 1830.24 (demat charges) + 885 (Debit Card Annual Fee) = INR 2715.24.

It's not just about this money that we lose. It's more about how the banks that try to showcase some Fancy Ads like 6% interest on the savings account and at the other side loot our money without our knowledge and also their useless agents who just to get more customers can lie whatever that come to their mouth.

I have decided to close all my accounts from Kotak. I will tell about this Kotak scam to all my friends and people known to me and make sure that they are all aware of it. Kotak lost a new customer even before he started banking.

Update 1: I had made a long argument with the Kotak bank staff and higher officials and closed the Demat account associated with my Savings Account and was able to retrieve only an amount of INR 919.76 which lied inside the account with the name of brokerage charge balance. This has currently reduced my loss to INR 1795.48.

Update 2: I have also raised a request to get back the wrongly debited Debit card annual fee of INR 885 for which, I was told on 5th March that, I can only be given INR 750 because, the remaining 135 was given to the government in the name of GST it seems. I argued again telling that I am not responsible for that tax part because, it was not paid with my consent and asked for a complete reversal of INR 885 for which, they seem to have created another request which may take another 5 to 7 working days. I will write back when I get another update.

Update 3: I had to talk to 3 different online customer care representatives from Kotak customer care to get the same repetitive answer that, the deduction was not legitimate and that I would get the amount reversed to my account. But, they were not sure when. During my call with the third representative, I wanted an official mail from her to progress through the raised ticket. Through that mail, I also found a way and connected to her manager and explained him all the proceeds I had till then. With a way too long struggle, I finally received the complete cash reversal of INR 885 on March 14. Now, my total loss is INR 910.48.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6xa9u5dmifqreosk', 'title': 'How do companies lose customers?', 'score': {'original': 0.44026666666667, 'ai': 0.55973333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Keep a watch on this name.\n\nKOTAK Bank\n\nThe latest scam by these kind of banks is what I am gonna share.\n\nIt all started with this ad which I encountered online.

Anonymous,6y,What is the life of an IT employee after being fired from a company?,"I guess i am eligible to write the answer because i got fired from a Top Product based company.

I was with company for 2 years with total of 4 years experience and within that span of time i was around 1 years and 6 months in the project and got really good ratings and then things got worse , no work, after that i started working on some POC kind of things in different technology and was not so happy to work on those.

Day came and they told me to resign from the company on immediate effect. As a part of formality they told me i will continue in the payroll for 2 months but can’t come to office within that time and also i can leave the company anytime before that. Except that i will get 2 months salary as a part of removal from the company . So i accepted and I resigned from my side and they took my laptop and ID card. Left for the day to my home. Informed my Brother-in-law , Sister, Mother and they told me not to worry about future. (My father is still unaware of the incident)

The same day i had a good dinner in a good restaurant and at night 12o’clk i activated my Naukri profile and slept.
Next day was a Friday and i started reading and revising the works. I started getting mails and calls for interview on Friday itself. So scheduled a interview with a well known service based company because interview will be easy. So Saturday came and i reached the company, there were more than 100 people for the opening . 1st round was coding round and i was thinking that i will not be able to do as i can see 100 people standing there. Believe me after rejecting 45 candidates in the written HR was so happy to inform me that i am the first person to qualify the written test. Really i felt happy and after that 2 rounds of Technical and got selected with a pretty good hike with them as i was from a product company. Informed that to my Mom . Now she was relaxed and congratulated me for the Job and told me to come to home town for some days. But i told i will come after some days.

Next day was Sunday . I enjoyed that day full with my friends without informing them regarding the incident. Then came Monday again i got calls and started giving interviewa . Got a call from another product based MNC and gone for the interview and was really confident that i can get that. Of course i got that with better package . Again i was looking for more and gave interviews and got selected in 5 companies and rejected by 2 and i rejected 1 as they offered me less salary.

So finally by Friday i was with 5 offers in my hand . That’s just 6 working days after i got fired and i have 5 offers in my hand with lot better package than what the old company was paying me . Decided to join the product company which i gave on Monday .

Now i decided to travel to my hometown for 1 month and after coming back i will join. Then days passed and after more than one month i joined the company and happily with them with better work and better salary. Also i got a good remuneration from the old company .Thankful they fired me!!

So what i learned is self esteem and motivation . Don’t loose hope and keep learning . The company fired me because they have no work for me not that i was bad. After leaving that company the industry is so large that there are many who are eagerly waiting to take you in there company.

Love your work!!! Not your company!!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6pot3ruqf5zavlc2', 'title': 'What is the life of an IT employee after being fired from a company?', 'score': {'original': 0.9276, 'ai': 0.0724}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I guess i am eligible to write the answer because i got fired from a Top Product based company.\n\nI was with company for 2 years with total of 4 years experience and within that span of time i was around 1 years and 6 months in the project and got really good ratings and then things got worse , no work, after that i started working on some POC kind of things in different technology and was not so happy to work on those.\n\nDay came and they told me to resign from the company on immediate effect.

Aled Jenkins,Updated 4y,What companies have gotten destroyed by their business competition?,"How do you win a war?

Just ask Netflix

Reed Hastings (founder of Netflix) had a big fight ahead of him. He had just finished watching the movie he rented called “Apollo 13” and he returned it to Blockbuster six weeks late. They charged him for returning the movie late.

Hastings launched a new company called Netflix in complete anger. He did not believe people should have to pay for returning a movie late!!!

Hastings had a plan.

Netflix realised that people wanted as many movies as they could get delivered to them. Therefore, Netflix started as a DVD rentals-by-mail service. Netflix was smart and they made a huge discovery.

Perhaps DVDs don’t have to be delivered physically.

Netflix came up with a genius idea that would change the way they did business. They would start a streaming subscription service where someone could watch movies on their computer or another streaming device.

Netflix started to win the market. Hastings believed that he could make money from selling Netflix. Hastings took Netflix and made a pitch to Blockbuster.

Netflix has seen tremendous growth in previous months and we will offer you Netflix for $50 million.

Blockbuster laughed.

Nobody wants to go to Netflix! People like to physically go to a shop and pick out the DVD they want to buy.

Hastings walked away with nothing. Once again, he was angry. He started marketing Netflix and grossly undercutting Blockbuster on price.

Little by little, Netflix grew its customer base and started to outcompete Blockbuster. Blockbuster tried everything to stop Netflix. Hastings famously said that Blockbuster was throwing “everything but the kitchen sink” at Netflix.

A few days later, Blockbuster physically delivered a kitchen sink to Hastings’ house. The Blockbuster era was over.

In the summer of 2010, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy and Netflix became one of the most recognised brands globally with an annual gross profit of $5.8 billion in 2018 (59.21% increase from 2017 according to macrotrends)

If you are interested, I will leave a few Netflix tips in the comments.

Hastings famously said that Blockbuster was throwing “everything but the kitchen sink” at Netflix.\n\nA few days later, Blockbuster physically delivered a kitchen sink to Hastings’ house. The Blockbuster era was over.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy and Netflix became one of the most recognised brands globally with an annual gross profit of $5.8 billion in 2018 (59.21% increase from 2017 according to macrotrends)\n\nIf you are interested, I will leave a few Netflix tips in the comments.

Kumar Abhinav,Updated 3y,What discourages global companies from manufacturing in India?,"KIA motors had set up a manufacturing plant in Andhra Pradesh in 2017.

( Source: Google Images )

The plant which is spread over 23 million square foot area has the annual capacity of 3,00,000 units. The plant has also created 12000 jobs in total.

Everything was going right in the plant but in July 2019 there was a policy change by the new Jaganmohan Reddy government. The changed law made it mandatory for the companies to hire 75% local workers. The onus of training the workers was also placed on the companies.

Now this new law has started troubling many companies including KIA motors. It's being very difficult for them to find skilled workers. Because of this new troublesome law KIA motors is now planning to shift the plant to Tamil Nadu.

Just think how much problems they will have to face in shifting the plant from Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu. Furthermore, the cost of shifting the plant will be too high. Because of these problems, from next time they’ll think twice before investing in India.

This is just one example of how companies face problems in India because of frequent changes in laws and policies. And these problems are what discourage them from manufacturing in India.

Unless the India government changes its attitude and makes the country business-friendly, it'll be very difficult for India to become a manufacturing hub.

Edit : I had written this answer several months ago. At that time there were reports that KIA was planning to shift to other states. However, they haven't shifted so far and it doesn't even seem that they’ll shift (at least in the near future).

I had used those reports related to KIA just as an example to highlight the issues firms face in our country. Whether KIA actually shifts or not was never my concern.

KIA might not have shifted in this particular case but it doesn't change the fact that foreign companies do face several problems in our country because of stupid government policies.

By the way, that 75% reservation in private sector by AP government has been challenged in the high court and currently the case is pending.

Preyash Shah,7y,What is the biggest mistake that a big company has made?,"The marketing strategy of Tata Nano

About Tata Nano

The Tata Nano is a city car manufactured by Tata Motors
. Made and sold in India, the Nano was initially launched with a price of ₹100,000 or USD 1,500. It is the cheapest car in the world.

Even though it is an engineering feat to package the entire car within that price range, it sales largely failed, primarily due to its marketing campaign.

The Marketing Strategy

Owning a car in India is a big thing. It is more of a social status symbol!

A middle class family in India more often than not travel like this:

And in order to capture this market segment Ratan Tata announced the concept of Tata Nano in 2006.

The concept of introducing a cheapest car for every middle class family in India. Everyone (including me!) got fascinated by the idea. But unfortunately the fascination did not transpire into sales!

What went wrong?

The idea of promoting Nano as the ‘cheapest’ car!

Considering the society we live in today, one would not want to own the ‘cheapest’ car in the world.

“Dude he owns a car, and that too the cheapest one! Lol!”

To be read as:

Gaadi kharidne ki aukat nahi hai, isiliye Nano kharida!

(Can’t afford to buy a car, hence bought Nano!)

And that mentality is what made people to rethink before booking a Nano.

Once on a stage, when a student asked Ratan Tata regarding the failure of Tata Nano, he acknowledged that the mistake was branding the model as the cheapest car instead of affordable car; people did not want to be associated with a cheap car.

However, I personally believe that may not have worked well, because people always knew that Nano is the cheapest car!

In my opinion, one of the possible campaign they could have run to market Nano was to promote it as ‘Your first car!’, with the target audience being the youth and working professionals!

Anyway, the Tatas are still trying hard to push Nano on the roads, it will be tough!

Certainly a big mistake committed by Tata Motors!

I would love to have your thoughts on this mistake! Cheers!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/savogbknhjpqm3li', 'title': 'What is the biggest mistake that a big company has made?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The marketing strategy of Tata Nano\n\nAbout Tata Nano\n\nThe Tata Nano is a city car manufactured by Tata Motors\n.

Mike S.,4y,Why is the USPS the only company you see using those tiny USPS trucks? Why don’t they just use something like Ford Transits?,"I believe we are talking about this:

This is a Grumman LLV. This vehicle was built for USPS, according to their very specific requirements. Canada Post also ordered some. They were never sold like normal cars and trucks. It was more like a fighter plane - a government agency contracting with a builder who won a bid. It’s no accident it was built by Grumman rather than a real car company.

As to why they didn’t just go with a Ford Transit…

LLV entered service in 1987. The newest one of them was built in 1994. This means the design was done a couple of years prior, around 1985, or earlier. In 1985, Ford Transit looked like this:

Not quite the Transit you are thinking of, I bet. It was also a Europe-only vehicle, not legal in US due to different crash standards.

More importantly, though, it didn’t meet the USPS requirements without a lot of modification.

The LLV had to have a specific floor height to match other postal equipment. Roll-up door and sliding side door were required. Most importantly, though, LLV stands for Long Life Vehicle. They were required to last at least 24 years in service, and use easily available parts. In 1985, Ford could not make a guarantee like that with the Transit.

This requirement is why they have straight-panel aluminum bodies. It’s also why they use the incredibly gutless “Iron Duke” engine. Low power contributes to longevity.

The most technically difficult requirement most likely was the specified turning radius. LLV is supposed to be able to get in and out of a dead-end street without backing up. To this end, you might notice that the front wheels are closer together than the back ones. Interestingly enough, they found that this isn’t a great solution in parts of the country where it snows. The LLV becomes rather “interesting” in snow and ice, and the specs for the replacement explicitly state it should have axles the same width.

Ford would have had to rebuild the 80’s Transit almost completely to be able to match all that. I’m not sure if they were in the running for the LLV bid back in the 80’s. They are, however, in the running for the current bid on the contract to replace the LLV, and their entry is, indeed, based on the Transit.

The way they coordinate on private chatrooms to strategize and take down content is disgusting.

One of their employees tweeted about suffering from depression and this is how they reacted.

They collaborated to take down Anirudh Malpani’s LinkedIn account.

Sriram Sridhar,Updated 5y,How do companies lose customers?,"Zomato Gold:

In my experience running a business that strives to be customer focussed, I have often found that the way a business handles a mistake determines whether a customer stay or leave.

Let me try explaining this better with a recent example.

I had been a pretty consistent user of Zomato and was a strong supporter of Zomato gold for the sheer impact it was having on the restaurant industry and the way it was reshaping the pattern of how people picked restaurants.

I subscribed to the program the day it was launched in Chennai and went on to try it the same week. The restaurant I picked was The Flying Elephant in Park Hyatt, Chennai. Since the program had just launched, I called Zomato on my way there and checked if the restaurant was indeed equipped to handle the program and they confirmed that it was. The restaurant was listed as a food partner and Zomato confirmed the same on the call.

But when I reached the restaurant, I was in for a surprise. Nobody was really aware of the program on the restaurant floor. They eventually found a manager who was aware of Zomato Gold but he was positive that they had only signed on as a drink partner. He was surprised to see his restaurant unlocked on my mobile as a food partner.

I was with my family and we had two Zomato gold subscriptions between us. All of us were hungry at that point and proceeded to order food assuming that the issue would hopefully be sorted out between the restaurant and Zomato, by the time we finished eating and not particularly concerned even if it wasn’t.

Just as the food was delivered, the restaurant manager returned and mentioned that he had communicated with Zomato and that it was a listing error on Zomato’s side. He further added that since it was Zomato’s mistake, the restaurant will not be able to help. I said it was fine, but smiled and added that, while he can indeed relinquish his responsibility over the issue, but when I was in the restaurant I was their customer and the experience I have there will reflect more on them than Zomato. He agreed with that statement and promised to check what he could do.

In the meantime, I was annoyed by Zomato, especially since I had made the effort to call and check earlier about the restaurant. However, not wanting to disrupt my meal with a call, I shot them a quick chat message from my app telling them I was in a Zomato Gold restaurant, which was not accepting the subscription. I asked them to look this up on their end and hopefully take care of it by the time I was finished eating. A few minutes later, a support executive responded to the message saying this was a problem he could immediately fix and wanted to call me for just a couple of minutes, which I grudgingly permitted him to.

On the call, I took a minute to explain what I had heard from the manager about his conversation with Zomato. The support executive immediately said the Zomato listing was right and the manager was wrong. He insisted on talking to the manager and I passed on the phone to a waiter who would be able to find the floor manager.

A good 15 minutes later, the waiter handed the phone back to me with the support representative still on the line. This is the point where things really started going downhill. (Note: At this point, simply a polite and sincere apology and a promise to ensure that it won't happen again would have got me back to my meal slightly annoyed but not terribly unhappy).

Back on the call, the support representative now adopted a more aggressive voice than earlier. He said that he had checked with the restaurant and they weren't at fault and Zomato wasn’t either. He continued on saying that the mistake was on my end, I had not read properly and that the restaurant was indeed listed as a drink partner on the app. I was really irritated on hearing that and told him that certainly wasn’t the case and that I had even called Zomato on my way to the restaurant. He would have none of that and continued accusing me of not reading properly. I took the other phone with Zomato gold and checked. To my surprise, sometime in the last few minutes, the restaurant had been moved from the food to the drink category. In addition to this the gold unlock had disappeared from the account. He/ Zomato’s team had somehow managed to move the listing in the past few minutes, now I understood why he had changed his tone. I tried explaining to him that the change had happened in the past few minutes but with no luck. In fact, his tone suggested that he knew exactly what had happened in the background.

The meal had ceased to matter at this point and I was furious about being accused. Incidentally right at this moment, I realised that I had not navigated away from the Zomato gold unlock screen from my phone. I went back to the app and found that the confirmation screen was still visible. I demanded an email address that I can forward this to, while he remained on the phone. After much reluctance, he gave me one. I sent him a few screenshots of the confirmation screen clearly showing the restaurant to be a food partner.

After receiving the email, he realised that he could no longer accuse me of not reading properly. He put me on hold, saying he wasn’t sure what happened and with a promise of sorting it out. He came back and asked to speak to the manager again (Note: He had still not apologised or assumed responsibility for the mistake). The restaurant manager I guess gave him an earful this time and put the fault entirely and rightly on Zomato’s shoulder.

The phone was back to me soon and he was still on. At this point, for the first time ever and faced with almost no other option, he finally acknowledged that the issue was a ‘RARE’ fault on Zomato’s side. This was almost 30 minutes into the call. I had lost it now and told him that considering it finally dawned on him that it was indeed Zomato’s fault, I needed to be compensated for ruining my dinner by being rude, unhelpful and accusatory (Note: I would have settled for just an apology more than 20 min back, if only he had been a little polite and forthcoming in admitting their fault)

Even at this point, despite being furious, the demand for compensation was more for driving home the point of how terrible the experience had been with them overall and not with an expectation of actually being fairly compensated (A meal that cost thousands, more than 30 minutes of my time when having dinner and a ruined dinner experience). However, rather than simply apologising or promising to escalate the issue, he mentioned that he would be glad to compensate me and what he could do was add one week to my Zomato Gold subscription. I laughed out loud despite my seething anger and pointed out how ludicrous his offer was, despite this, he still tried selling me on it to close the issue.

Finally, I demanded the call to be escalated and his response to that was that it was past 9:00 PM, his manager was at home and would not like to be disturbed. I even received an email the next day, with the same 1 week extension offer, despite having said how insulting that was.

My request over email to be escalated to the right person managing the program was refused.

At the end of my meal, the floor manager returned with the F and B manager of the hotel, sincerely apologised for the problem despite the issue being on Zomato’s side and proceeded to comp most of my meal there.

After this incident, I have returned twice to the same restaurant. However, I have completely stopped using Zomato and haven’t spent even a single rupee on the app after that night, despite spending thousands on dining since.

In fact, We use this single incident now as a negative example in our support team’s training process to demonstrate a plethora of obvious things that shouldn’t be done. such as,

Being rude to customers
Not treating them with respect
Arguing with customers
Accusing customers of things like being unable to read
Not showing Empathy
Not accepting fault where appropriate
Making false promises
Not escalating when appropriate
Giving bad or incorrect information

It is also used to demonstrate how out of two merchants involved in the issue, the way they treated the customer after the issue unfurled in one losing the customer for good, with the other managing to retain him despite not being at the top of their game.

Most customers sympathise with the fact that mistakes can indeed occasionally happen and do not always leave because of one.

Aled Jenkins,4y,What small change for a company resulted in the most money saved?,"McDonalds

This one change saved the McDonalds’ Chicken McNugget

In the early 1980s, McDonalds came up with a new and exciting idea called the Chicken McNugget. There was just one problem…

The cost of chicken was highly volatile at the time and that would make pricing the McNugget very difficult. On this note McDonalds sought advice from a famous stock and commodity trader named Ray Dalio.

Ray Dalio’s (founder of Bridgewater Associates which is the biggest hedge fund in the world managing $160 billion worth in assets) two biggest clients at that time were McDonalds and a chicken producer.

If Dalio could make the chicken price stable McDonalds could launch the McNugget, however if he couldn’t they would throw the idea away.

Of course, Dalio pulled it off. Instead of thinking about buying chicken, Dalio thought of buying a chick and its food (corn and soymeal). The price of a chicken was fairly constant but its food was variable. But…

There is a futures market for corn and soymeal.

A future market allows the buying and selling of futures. A future is a legal agreement to buy or sell something at a guaranteed price at a specified time in the future.

Dalio showed the chicken producer how to buy and sell futures on corn and soymeal to guarantee the cost of the food for the chickens. This made the cost of chicken stable.

It is unclear how much money this saved McDonalds, however, the Chicken McNugget would never have existed if it wasn’t for Ray Dalio. This saved the Chicken McNugget.

Bob Areddy,4y,Does it bother you that some small companies bring their pet to work? Do you think this is appropriate?,"My office has a “dogs allowed” policy (it’s an IT shop), but we don’t just let them run around the office, we have rules which we all follow.

The dog must be on a leash, in your office, or in a “designated” area. My office is in one of those designated areas, which is just a hallway off the main hallway. All 5 of us who are in this hallway are “dog people”, although another guy and myself are the ones who are “regulars” when it comes to bringing our pets in.
Clean up after your dog. Yes, it doesn’t seem like this should be said, but it is. I have a big roll of poop bags at my desk if anybody needs them.
The dog is not allowed in the break room. That’s where people eat. I don’t even let my own dog in our kitchen when we are preparing food.

There are a couple of managers that people can go to if they have an issue with any of the pets (in case they don’t want to go directly to us). If someone had an issue, I’d be cool with it and it would be handled professionally. Nobody has ever complained.

Here are some office photos:

Onyx on the left, Jordan (my dog) on the right. Jordan isn’t so sure of this giant dog!

Kya on the left, Jordan on the right, in my office.

Lexie on the left (my other black lab) and Jordan on the right.

Luna on the left, Jordan on the right. Luna is an albino, and is deaf. She and Jordan are best buds!

Athena lives to play ball!

Anshul,5y,How do companies lose customers?,"Let’s take the example of Bansal Classes

In case you don’t know them, they were a very famous coaching class for IIT-JEE students in Kota, I haven’t kept a track of them ever since I left. But the way it operated, I’d like to see it as a company trying to make business from education.

Bansal Classes was at its prime around 2000–2010 when they produced toppers after toppers, at times even successive AIRs came from Bansal. Their results affected everyone so much that Kota became the IIT-JEE coaching hub. But the winning run could’ve only lasted so long with the kind of culture they had.

Below are my personal experiences which I believe led to their downfall:

1. It’s all about Money

With time, the only thing Bansal Classes cared about was money. Out of the top 40 batches they had around my time, they gave major importance to only the top 10 batches, as they believed that’s where they’d get their top rankers from.

Students like me who couldn’t do well in the first test and remained in a lower batch got the worst teachers they had. At times, they tested out some new teachers for experimentation purpose as soon as they got the first couple of instalments from students.

2. Teaching Quality

As you go lower and lower down the batches, you would actually witness the teaching quality. There were times, when I attended the class with only 10 students in a batch of 100+. Even when I complained to the authorities regarding bad teaching, they wouldn’t listen because I was among the bottom 30% at that time.

3. The Attitude

There was a time when one of our Organic chemistry teacher had left the classes and no one turned up for a week. It was around that time I volunteered to represent my Batch and went to Sonal Rajora, their Head faculty only to be humiliated for not being patient. We were already running behind and it wasn’t until another week, that someone came up and just rushed through topics.

4. Better Competition

It was around 2010 when Bansal split and Vibrant was formed. Top batches had the option to directly join them while the others had to give a test. All the cream faculty was shifted and students feared that Bansal wouldn’t sustain without those top teachers.

In fact, Allen, which was only a medical coaching institute till then, started coaching the JEE students and as of now, is much better than Bansal Classes.

5. Money Making techniques

To increase revenue, they even opened an alternate batch for 11th and called them Acme, which started 2 months later than Bull’s Eye. I didn’t realise how costly those two months were when I opted to join Acme even though I had a chance to join Bull’s eye. Little did I know I would be just playing catch-up having to cover all those topics in lesser time.

But for Bansal, it wasn’t just an option given to students to join their classes, but to make some extra bucks. Not saying, nobody from Acme made it, but those who were there, knows how tough it was.

6. (De)Motivation

At times, there was no indirect way in which we were told by the faculty themselves that why are we even studying and wasting our parent’s money. We should instead leave and do something else with our lives. This particular statement has stayed with me ever since and always acted as a motivation.

You may call it a way they wanted to motivate us, but I am not going to buy that knowing how exactly they said it.

Bansal promised so much and delivered for a long time too. Alas, it was the intent that went wrong. I was so afraid to go to Kota after my 2 years of experience that I chose a small coaching in Mumbai over Kota and fortunately, I made it through.

Safe to say, it isn't always the fancy teachers that a student needs, sometimes, individual attention makes all the difference.

Bansal obviously couldn’t do that by having 100+ students in every batch and hence, lost a majority of their customers (read students).","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/26xdywp8arm5j47l', 'title': 'How do companies lose customers?', 'score': {'original': 0.8545, 'ai': 0.1455}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Let’s take the example of Bansal Classes\n\nIn case you don’t know them, they were a very famous coaching class for IIT-JEE students in Kota, I haven’t kept a track of them ever since I left.

Cathy Buchanan,2y,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","In 2004, I bought cell phones for my husband and myself for Christmas. We had a three-year “family plan” contract with the service provider.

Husband passed away seven months later. I called the service provider, explained the situation and asked if I could switch to a one-person contract. (Naive of me, I know, but I was new to the world of cellphone contracts.)

They turned me down cold, and were actually quite rude about it. The agent I spoke to just said “That’s not our problem…you signed up, you pay. No exceptions.” So I was stuck with a phone I didn’t need and wouldn’t be using, and stuck paying for service for two phones for the rest of the term of the contract.

Near the end of the contract, I got a call from a very nice lady on behalf of the provider, inviting me to renew my contract with them. I told her I would swallow ground glass before I ever dealt with her company again. She was shocked, and of course she asked me why.

I told her what had happened when I tried to change my contract. She was even more shocked…she apologized, and said “That’s not our policy…I don’t know who you dealt with before, but they were wrong!”

At that point I thanked her for her kindness, but I pointed out that it obviously only came into play when her company wanted something from me. When I needed something from them, I was treated very rudely and dismissively.

I told her the wrong answer was bad enough, coming from someone who should have known the right answer…that was his job, after all. But if the company’s “customer service” agents felt free to treat people like that, they had much bigger problems than an employee who didn’t know what their “deceased customer” policy was.

I told her it wasn’t so much the contract issue that had upset me, although I did resent having to pay for service for a dead man for nearly two and a half years. It was that “Not our problem” that had really pissed me off. And I remembered it every time I used my phone.

She tried to talk me around, but I didn’t change my mind. It was eight years before I bought another cell phone, and I made sure I chose a different service provider.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hwy4otbr7fea6plu', 'title': 'What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In 2004, I bought cell phones for my husband and myself for Christmas.

Colin Riegels,Mon,Why do legal companies put hot girls in their ads? Do they really think I'm going to make use your firm just because of that?,"It probably has some kind of effect. Many years ago I was at a trade show in Moscow, and one of the firms involved in organising it basically offered us three options for local staff to help man our stall. We could either have (i) helpers who spoke English, (ii) helpers who were hot women but spoke no English, or (iii) helpers who were hot women and who also spoke English. The prices escalated accordingly. They may not have used the exact term “hot women” but the meaning was pretty clear.

After briefly wrestling with my conscience, I decided there was no way I was ever going to submit a budget for approval which included “hot Russian women” as a line item, so we went with the cheapest option. Our helpers were both male in the end.

But at the actual trade show itself, you could clearly see why the pricing operated the way it did. The company displays which had very attractive women in slinky dresses handing out brochures and guiding prospective clients back to people to talk about the product were heavily attended. Those of us stuck with the much less photogenic Boris and Yuri (no offence, guys) got significantly less attention.

Maybe other cities are a bit more enlightened than Muscovites.

Herbert Shimmelfinney,11mo,What was a Christmas bonus you got from your company that made you speechless?,"I was downsized from a company I had been with for a pretty long time. Every year I would work really hard to make my goals so my bonus would be maxed. The cap was $1000. The CEO of the company had 4 houses, several race horses, and 3 private jets. The company made a ton of money. I moved on to another, much smaller company about the middle of September the same year. Needless to say, my bonus that I had been working for most of the year evaporated. I didn't give it much thought beyond just being grateful I found another job that paid me equally. Christmas came around and I didn't think much about it because nobody had ever mentioned anything about bonuses and I had only been there about 4 months.

I told her that I didn't get one and that was to be expected since I had just been there a short time.

Asim Qureshi,6y,What is the biggest mistake that a big company has made?,"In 1999, Excite was no.2 in search after Yahoo, and Google had just got going.

Larry Page offered to sell Google to them for, now wait for it, US$750k and 1% of Excite. Page insisted that Google would have to be the search engine running Excite, and that was where the deal broke down.

Excite walked away.

Today Google is worth around US$650bn.

It could be argued to be the biggest mistake in history. But, you know what, if Excite had bought Google, I doubt Excite would have ever capitalised the way Google had, and they would have been worth a smidgen of that US$650bn today.

Shit happens.

But, to me, the lesson of this story stems from the fact that Page wanted to sell Google for US$750k. I mean he didn’t have a clue about Google’s potential.

Page is worth US$44bn today. Had he gone ahead with the deal, I doubt he’d be worth more than US$50m, and you wouldn’t have heard of Page, Brin, or Google.

And to me, that highlights the huge element of luck in entrepreneurship. It applies to every successful entrepreneur. It definitely applies to me.

You need these lucky breakthroughs. There is a massive element of luck, yet at the same time, you can influence the number of opportunities you get by taking action, by doing things, by creating opportunities.

The difference between great entrepreneurs and the ordinary ones is how well they capitalise on those opportunities.

M S K Akash,Updated 6y,Why are so many companies changing their logos to flat designs?,"Flat design is a concept and style that renders everything in a two-dimensional way, making it flat. This lack of “realism” is called flat design. No embellishments, such as shadows, bevels, reflections, glows, gradients or textures, are added in the design process. Flat design is based in minimalism and simplicity. They are flexible and can be re-sized which makes the logo adaptable to all type of screens.

Since Apple
, following Microsoft changed its user interface from realistic looking icons to flat designs free from superfluous elements after it launched iOS 7 in 2013, more companies have adopted the flat layout design style and the reason for this change isn’t just to stay trendy.

Flat logos may seem simpler and less elegant but they could potentially save a company millions of dollars in printing and representation expenses. A flatter logo is much, much cheaper to reproduce as it consumes less printing material and takes less time to print.

Nowadays more wireless data is transferred between mobile devices. So the necessity of saving bandwidth has led designers to strip graphics, icons and UI from unnecessary embellishments. This simple change leads to pages that load faster because they consume less disk space.

For example Google inc. changed its logo to a simpler font which consists of basic geometric shapes and removed the shadows and bevels present in the old logo, this simple change led to a google homepage that loads faster than the old one, because the new logo consumed only 300 bytes of data while the old logo consumed 7300 bytes!

Microsoft first introduced their authentically digital interface with the launch of Windows 8 and their Modern UI.

The traditional red, green, blue, and yellow wavy flag logo was replaced with a flattened, angled looking logo, more like a real window.

Brands like Netflix, Hershey, Foursquare, Paypal, AirBnb etc went flat back in 2014.

Thank you.

Aravind Sudarshan,4y,How do companies lose customers?,"OYO Rooms.

They are absolutely irresponsible and insensitive to their customers.

This incident happened recently in May of this year. I had to go to Delhi for a one day event for which I booked OYO rooms. In order to have a good stay, I picked one of the costliest hotels shown on their app, Hotel Connaught Mews. They seemed very friendly and prompt before the stay by sending all the confirmation emails and messages.

Upon arrival at Delhi, I proceeded to the Hotel. It was situated at Connaught Place(CP), supposedly one of the busiest places in Delhi. Despite using navigation it was pretty hard to locate the hotel. It was situated in a stinky alley behind the Embassy of Spain(First Red flag). The Hotel looked very shady and creepy and had no OYO Boards hanging (which they are supposed to have for identification).

This was how the entrance looked. No prominent board to indicate even the name of the hotel. I had to go and confirm the name of the hotel before sending my cab off.

Upon reaching the reception, there was nobody to attend for a span of full 10 minutes(Second Red Flag). After 10 minutes, a guy arrived and verified the booking and took the payment. OYO rooms have a bunch of useless people stationed at hotels covered by them for “Customer service”. Those guys are brutes and have no idea what that means. I had to rush for a meeting in about 30 mins. So i requested him for a simple lunch to be given quickly. I went to my allotted room. The corridors leading to the room were stinking again as they were stacked up with stained beddings to be put for laundry. Despite waiting for 20 mins , no food arrived. I couldn’t even call anyone from my room. The phone had no number list attached. Just a plain phone. How dumb!

I had to walk down and enquire about the lunch for which the staff replied arrogantly saying it would take another 20 - 30 mins. I was irritated by then. I requested a simple lunch and specifically insisted the guy to give it to me quickly. I shouted at the guy sitting there. He DID NOT give a damn! When i said i shall complain to OYO, his body language kind of meant,”Go ahead”. (Now i know why he meant it). I was getting late and left without eating any thing.

I finished my meeting and and returned that night back to the hotel. I got to see their washrooms only then. The mirrors were rusted. The shower tap just came off when i tried to use it. PATHETIC!

The night seemed very disturbed and creepy. People were constantly howling and running around in the corridors. The next day morning, I just had enough of this place and decided to leave it ASAP. I thought i could get it sorted with OYO.

I then immediately took to their app and gave my feedback stating all the issues and claiming that i wanted a refund. I wouldn’t have cared much had it been a cheaper hotel. I specifically picked a costly hotel to make my stay experience superior. Despite waiting for 2 days i received no response except the system generated ones. I then tried to call their “Customer Care” number regarding the issue and refund. They just play nice music and the call ends. Not once . Not twice. I tried seven times. The eighth time a person picked to whom i explained the whole thing and even indicated my reviews. The guy said his team would look into it and so on. Again after the call, no response for 2 days. It was disgusting. Finally, after wading through their amazing “Customer Care” system, a so called senior guy spoke to me. I had to explain the whole thing again. He then started arguing that no refund is possible as you have completed your stay and any issues faced must have been reported during the stay.

When i choose a hotel or any amenity of higher cost, It is beyond just the stay. It is for the Experience. Also I do not book a hotel in a different city for time pass. I have an agenda to complete in the place which is why i leave the hassle of booking and other formalities to a third party(like OYO).

The guy on phone argued for 15 mins that he cant go beyond his policy and that i should have reported the issue during the stay. Really??. I come to a place for one day and instead of minding my work i sit and keep reporting my problems and keep jumping hotels. I suggest they change their policy to reporting issues even before the stay. Absolutely absurd. Finally after his argument he said he could give me 500 units of OYO cash to my OYO Wallet(Money in the OYO Wallet isn’t even money. Just units that will get cut in the next booking). I insisted on transferring the call to someone higher which he refused to. I declined the 500.

People are not beggars to use the app that they refund peanuts.

I suggest they change their “Customer Care” unit to “Customer Dont-Care”. They have no sense of logic nor patience to listen to the customer. All they are trained is to repeat the same set of statements again and again.

OYO has turned out to be an absolute piece of crap in the realm of current day startups. If they do not revamp their structure and attitude (and of course policies), they are bound to collapse in the near future.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hxsw4m1djl8nzau5', 'title': 'How do companies lose customers?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'OYO Rooms.\n\nThey are absolutely irresponsible and insensitive to their customers.\n\nThis incident happened recently in May of this year.

Errol,Updated 4y,What was the cruelest thing a company has ever done to you as an employee?,"A research company I worked for in 1999 did the dirtiest, lousiest thing any company ever did to me. They were so heinous, Karma wound up paying them back for it.

I was a mountain biker back in the late 90’s and spent most weekends biking the north Georgia mountains with friends.

A group of about ten of us went to a place called Bull Mountain, a demanding but beautiful ride about an hour and half north of Atlanta.

We’d had a great ride, had crested the top of the mountain and were on our way down heading to our cars when we hit a long fire road on a steep decline and decided to take it to get us back home more quickly.

From this point on, I don’t remember anything but was told this was what happened.

I was going about 35+ mph downhill on the gravel road when the headset of my bike (the handle bar control) apparently broke. I lost control of the bike, hit a log at high speed, and flew over my handlebars face first into a tree.

Some of my friends thought I had died on impact, I hit the tree that hard.

I wound up being picked up by a group of hikers and put into a truck where I passed out from head injuries. My short-term memory was gone and I didn’t know where I was or what was happening. I understand that my face was so badly bruised, cut, and swollen that the rescuers had a hard time looking at me. Part of my lip was hanging off my face.

I wound up spending five days in Critical Care at a regional hospital and was told by the neurologist that he’d buried people in better shape than me.

I needed a week after the hospital to recover and experienced intense pain and road rash during recovery, but the first thing I did when I was well enough was call my office and tell them I was going to find a way to come back to work.

And when I did… they laid me off.

I was told I “wasn’t cutting it,” even though 78% of all new business that year was mine. I was also told by the owners that per the terms in my contract, I was no longer owed any commission because I was no longer employed by the company (despite the reason) so I was also out approximately $20K that I had been counting on.

They had apparently laid me off to avoid having to pay me my commissions.

I was given two weeks of severance pay and asked to leave. As I walked out the door I could see that they had gone back to doing business as usual. They didn’t feel the slightest bit bad about sending me out in my condition without a way to earn a living.

I took several weeks off so that my face looked decent enough to go on a job interview. I wound up going through a good bit of my savings and experiencing a short-term financial hardship as a result.

Eventually I did get another job, but it took me years to restore my savings to what they had been before this happened.

The karma from this?

The married couple that owned the research company who fired me wound up getting a divorce. The husband wound up being practically shunned from the Atlanta business community. He went from living an upscale life in a mansion to living in a hovel with no furniture in the panhandle area of Florida. The wife wound up living an isolated, lonely life in a mansion by herself.

I see her occasionally at the grocery store where I live. I refuse to acknowledge her existance.

Rana Ashish,5y,How do companies lose customers?,"Let me explain it with a simple incident,

It was 10:20 pm, when I reached home. Then I came to know that our cook (who daily prepares dinner for us) had ditched. I decided to order food online.

Exactly at 10:32 pm, I placed my order via “FoodPanda”. It was showing that the order will be delivered in 25 minutes.

I was too hungry because as usual I skipped my lunch that day, and patiently started waiting for the food to get delivered.

After 1 hour at 11:35 pm, I received a call.

He: Hello, Are you Ashish?

Me: Yes, It’s me.

He: Sir we cannot deliver your food. We don’t deliver food after 11 pm.

Me: What? But I placed order at 10:30 pm.

He: Sir, I already logged off and if you want your food then you will have to come till half the distance.

Me: I was like, What the fuck? You are taking delivery fees and still you want me to travel half the distance.

He: Sorry Sir, do one thing. Cancel your order and you will get complete refund.

(And this is where I started losing my mind).

Me: I am waiting for 1 hour and now you are asking me to cancel that order. Where will I get food at this wee hour?

And without replying he disconnected my call. I was hungry, and angry as well. When I logged in to the Foodpanda App, I saw that the food is already delivered. Now I couldn’t cancel it.

I was agitated, hungry, angry, frustrated and stressed. I contacted their customer care, where their responses were slower than the IRCTC website. They made sure that I will get refund, but I told them that I don’t want refund, I want food.

For which obviously they refused and told me that the money will be refunded in next 3 working days.

I immediately uninstalled “FoodPanda” app. And this is how they lost one regular customer. I logged in to Swiggy, my food got delivered at 1:30 am.

And this is how Swiggy earned one more customer.

Now let’s summarize, how do companies lose customer:

Don’t meet Deadline

This is an important factor for any company to deliver quality within promised deadline. FoodPanda failed to deliver food in 25 minutes. If you can’t meet the deadline, then don’t promise customer about the deadline.

If you create an expectation, then you must fulfill it.

Commitment towards customer

If that delivery guy wanted to deliver, he could have delivered it. His lack of commitment towards his work resulted in loss of one regular customer.

Like Big Billion day launched by Flipkart, most of the times it is a flop show. You have committed something to your customer, then you should deliver what you have promised.

Customer Care

Of course, none of the products you launch is bug free. And customer needs resolution for it.

If your customer care service is slower than expected, it creates frustration among customers.

Creating Good Relation with Customer

You will not get goody goody type customers every time. You are here to make money, and I will only give money if you establish good relation with me.

The way he disconnected that call was rude and unprofessional.

Competitors

You will always get competitors in the market. Foodpanda refused to deliver food after 11 pm, but Swiggy cashed on this opportunity and delivered it.

If you are unable to compete with your competitors, then you can’t sustain in the market.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wergc5l6ph8i7ynj', 'title': 'How do companies lose customers?', 'score': {'original': 0.45445, 'ai': 0.54555}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Let me explain it with a simple incident,\n\nIt was 10:20 pm, when I reached home.

Brian Stevens,Updated 1y,"What is the sleaziest, dirtiest trick an auto insurance company tried to pull on you? Did they succeed?","Years ago in 1997, I was at home recovering from a car accident that I had been involved in. Anyway, my wife needed to go to the store to pick up a few things. She took our four year old son with her. About 45 minutes after they had left, the phone rang, I answered it, and it was my wife. She and our son had finished shopping and were walking out to her car. It was a 1995 Nissan 300ZX. There was a fire truck right next to her car , There was a lot of black, acrid smoke coming out from the front end of the car. As she got to the car, they asked her if it was her car, of course she said yes, and asked for her key so they could open the hood. They got the hood open and put the fire out. The electrical harness had caught fire and was burnt to a crisp as well as some of the other parts under the hood. One of my neighbors went to the store and picked up my wife, our son, and the groceries.

I spoke with the insurance company which at the time was Nationwide. I explained what had happened, and that we had full coverage on her car. They told us to get it to the Nissan dealership for an estimate. They wanted the name of the dealership, and said they would handle the situation. About three days later the dealership called and explained what needed to be done including what needed to be replaced. But they said Nationwide was not going to pay the $7000 to repair her car.

I called Nationwide, I had talk to one person, no luck. I talked to a second person, no luck. I talked to a third person, no luck but I told him that I wanted to speak with a supervisor. They put a supervisor on the telephone. He said that the car was not covered. I asked why, and told him that we had full coverage on the vehicle. He said even though our policy said fire damage was covered, what it meant was if the car was at home and got struck by lightning, or if it was in the garage and the house burnt down , that Nationwide would pay for it. I had the policy right in front of me and it said nothing about those situation. It just said, fire damage. I told the gentleman that I was home all day, every day and had no problem whatsoever being on the telephone with them all day, every day. I told the gentleman that my brother wanted to talk to them and see if he could help. The guy said yes. About an hour later, the gentleman called me and said there had been a misunderstanding on the insurance company side, and they were going to cover the cost of the repairs as well as a rental vehicle. He also said that he was going to personally handle the case and get the car back to us as quickly as possible. It did take about two weeks to get the car back as the electrical harness and some of the other parts had to come from Japan. What had changed their mind was my fault. When I had talked to the supervisor and let him know that my brother would like to call , somehow it slipped my mind and I forgot to tell him that my brother worked for the state insurance commission. Oops.

UPDATE: I am completely stunned and humbled beyond belief at the response that this post has received. I knew that it was a cute little story that I had told friends over the years. So, I thought that it might get a few smiles. For all of the thousands of people who managed to get through my run on sentences, thank you for having the patience to make it to the end. For all of the folks that gave the story an up vote, thank you. For all of the people that left a message, thank you. All of you just reinforce what I have always believed and continue to believe.

Vic Lugo,5y,What kind of company could rival Amazon? How would they do it?,"They can’t.

Jeff Bezos plays the long game. Amazon will operate on a loss in order to gain market share. Let me repeat that, Amazon will operate at a “loss” in order to “gain” market share.

Have you ever heard of the story of diapers.com?

What a great website, oh wait, it just redirects to Amazon.

The owners of diapers.com
 and other high value URLs like soap.com
 were making a go at it. Selling baby products, they sourced good products, started building infrastructure like warehousing for their inventory, even had a major shipment deal with the brown trucks. Then one day Amazon came knocking and asked to buy the domain. The answer was no.

What did Amazon do? Drove up the AdWords PPC on KWs and sold diapers at a ridiculous price losing margin and cash on traffic.

But do you know what else happened? Amazon dominated diapers online. Diapers.com
 could not outspend Amazon or sell at a lower price. Within 6 months, Amazon owned Quidsi, the Corp that owned Diapers, and Soap, and YOYO dotcoms.

In the end, Amazon’s long game of operating at a loss, had gained them huge market share in diapers.

They’re still doing it to this day. If you run an e-commerce store, you will have every invitation and incentive to also list your products on Amazon. Why not? That brand recognition is powerful isn’t it? It sure is.

But while you’re counting your dollars rolling in. Amazon is counting the data. If your products are winning, Amazon will simply sell the same exact thing, especially if you source it from overseas. All Amazon has to do is make their “Amazon’s Choice” banner on it and show it at the top of the page, it’s their website right? They can do whatever they want.

And you’re left there thinking….

Jay Bazzinotti,Updated 1y,Has a company ever fired all employees at once?,"I live near Walpole, MA.

In Walpole was the Bird and Son company. Bird got his start as the stationery maker for George Washington. Making stationery was a big deal in those days when paper was made from rags and the final version of any document was called “the Enduring Hand”. Bird made out, built a great reputation and also a huge paper company. He had mills everywhere. He passed the mills on to his son and his son’s sons. The Bird and Son company invented tar paper; they invented asphalt shingles for roofing; they invented vinyl siding. The sky was the limit. During the 1930s, the Bird and Son company was known as the company of last resort: when you lost your job, Bird would hire you. He hired everyone who needed work, but the work was hard and dangerous and included working with poison chemicals.

By the war, the Bird and Son plant expanded over three separate towns. The headquarters near Walpole had its own rail spur with Bird and Son diesel-electric engines, the pride of the company. Trucks came day and night to move bulk paper around the nation. They even controlled a large portion of the shoe box market. They sponsored the high school football team; the paid for the big Christmas tree on the Common; they caused all the complaints about “traffic” downtown by busy shoppers going from store to store. You never know how some things are a blessing in disguise.

Life was rosy for the Bird and Son company right up until 1980. The company was named as one of the last 10 of the original companies surviving from Revolutionary times, up there with Houghton-Mifflin and Casswell-Massey Soap and Ames Plow (which still exists). It was a proud name and the Bird Mill ran day and night, 500 people per shift with women in blue lab coats and hair nets stacking cardboard box blanks as they came, damp and steaming, off the cutting machines and hard, tough men moving heavy paper with forklifts and cranes. The stink of paper pulp filled the air and smoke bellowed from the highest smokestack in the entire region. Fishermen fished daily from the giant lakes formed by the Bird and Son dams that blocked many local rivers. They even had their own hydro plant.

And then the idiots managing the company started making mistakes, mis-spending, investing poorly. In 1981 they lost so much money. And there was cheap paperboard coming up from Mexico now, from new plants with new machines and no environmental restrictions. The next year they recovered slightly. And then the EPA came in. You can’t dump your dyes, bleaches and pulp waste into the rivers anymore. The dead fish and dead deer are lining the banks as far as the eye can see. Yes, we know you control the dams and all the good work you do. Yes, we know you’re the biggest employer in the region. But no, the rivers cannot run yellow anymore.

They tried.

They really tried.

They built giant concrete settling tanks (that are still there) to take out the dyes; they built all kinds of mitigation projects to clean out the waste. They cut expenses to the bone and the plant suffered. The first thing to go were the beautifully painted locomotives. When they needed to move product by rail, they hired them from Boston and Maine Railroad. But it didn’t matter. Making paper is a dirty, dirty business.

One day after the work whistle blew at 7AM - and I heard that whistle as a child every single day from my bedroom - while everyone was doing their jobs and the massive lights in the ceiling blazed and the crane operators were lifting heavy rolls of paper and the immigrant women were stacking cardboard onto pallets and scientists were developing new uses for paper, the word went around for everyone to drop what they were doing and report to the cafeteria. Down, down, down, six flights of stairs, the men having a smoke outside the doors before filing over to the cafeteria building, the women going for a wash in the sub-basement where their lockers were located, next to the giant, circular cement sinks and showers. Into the cafeteria they filed, the smell of oatmeal still in the air, the steam still coming from the kitchen where lunch was being prepped. Everyone lined up to get a cup of coffee in a green Bird and Son ceramic cup and saucer, made tough to withstand years of use.

And when they were all seated, the President stood up in front of them and told them the plant was closing, that this was their last day, that they would be handed their last checks and a brochure from the Unemployment Office on their way out. Five hundred blank faces looked at him without comprehension. A few minutes ago they were maybe thinking about getting a mortgage or buying a new car or taking a trip with the family. Not anymore. The President continued. No, they could not go back to their stations. No, they could not go back to their lockers. They would be told when they could go pick up their coats and personal items, when Brinks guards could watch them because suddenly they were untrustworthy. For now, just leave. Just leave.

Meanwhile, the salvers were walking through the factory with the foremen, with their clipboards, pointing at machines that could be sold and machines that could be written off. And as they moved through the buildings, the work lights blazing overhead, the motors still spinning, the cardboard still moving down the assembly lines, the rollers still squeezing water from pulp as paper was spun onto massive rolls, they pulled those giant Frankenstein switches and the machines, one by one, powered down until all that was left was the sound of dripping water and pulp and the sobbing of the plant managers who had made this job their life.

Bird and Son was sold to Certainteed, and Certainteed was only interested in the asphalt shingle plant in my town, Norwood. It still operates today, stinking up the entire town. The rest of the operation was left to decay. They walked away from the paper and cardboard and the shoe boxes and the tools and equipment. They just walked away. No one wanted worn out paper making machines from the 1940s. No one wanted the cranes that had been installed in 1912 and still had that date emblazoned on the overhead rails. No one wanted most of what was left behind and there it sat, rusting, getting old, falling apart until the vandals broke in with their blowtorches and ripped open the giant motors and cut out the copper armatures and pulled out the copper piping and wiring wherever they could. Eventually the town pulled up all the steel rails and dismantled all the bridges that still bore the fading words “Bird and Son” on the sides. You can still walk the abandoned embankments, now overgrown with trees.

“Bird and Son” it read on the top of the building, engraved in the cement to last, followed by the numbers “1912”. Proud, it was, and sad was the community as the jobs went away and as all the industries that supported Bird and Son failed. The hardware stores, the lumber mill, the machine shops, the car dealer, the diner - even the florist next door. There were no workmen to buy flowers for their wives on the way home from the factory anymore. There were no longer traffic jams downtown to complain about. Most of the stores were boarded up now. The entire town fell into depression, all through the 1980s and 1990s. The population fell as homes were foreclosed and abandoned, sometimes entire neighborhoods. The Bird scions, without progeny, died of old age and heartbreak and their mansion overlooking the abandoned factory was torn down. Eventually, tract houses would be built on the once-groomed landscape. One day a Japanese company came in and bought the giant smokestack. They wanted the millions of clay-made brick. They dynamited the stack and it went down fast in a cloud of smoke and those Japanese men stood around the rubble smiling as bulldozers dumped their antique clay brick onto dump trucks to be taken… to Japan? Who knows?

The abandoned Bird and Son before the fire.

And then one Fourth of July in 2001 the plant caught on fire. Destructive kids were blamed, but everyone knew who it really was - the developers or maybe even the town. They needed that monstrosity gone. The plant covered 12 acres and nearly 15 different buildings, all abandoned. I once went right through the front door and the time cards were still crumbling in the racks next to the time clock, the men’s names printed in blue ink. That got me in the feels that day. The Bird and Son cups and saucers and plates were still there in the cafeteria when I broke in in 1994. Somewhere along the line I used a wrench to take a massive pressure gauge from a pipe. It was very “artsy” to me. It registered 30 pounds and I assumed it was broken. But when I untwisted the gauge, there was a hiss of air and the gauge went to zero. Fifteen years, winter and summer, and that pipe was still holding pressure. I still have it, that gauge, screwed to the wall in my cellar. In the crew area, the rusting lockers all hung open, some covered with “Led Zeppelin” bumper stickers or Union logos. Their work clothes and leather gloves were still hung inside or strewn on the floor. There was a dead dog in the corner, somehow lost in the maze and unable to find his way out. The test tubes and experiments and photo lab looked brand new. There were still balances and shelves of chemicals of all types. The carpeted computer room was strewn with miles and miles of brown computer tape all over the floor along with manuals for DEC computers, long gone. The file cabinets and oak desks and swivel chairs of the executive offices were still there, the names of the leaders still stenciled on the smoked glass doors. All gone, gone in a day. The fire was visible for miles. Over the next weeks the bulldozers came in and leveled what was left.

It was impossible to extinguish, and dangerous. They let it burn itself out over days.

It’s 2022 now. In the ensuing years the Army Corps of Engineers has been through many times. Bird and Son used to control the flood plain. They paid for all the dams and all the maintenance and they had engineers on site to open and close the dams during heavy rains. But you can’t just leave a dam for 30 years with no maintenance and no engineering and think nothing is going to happen. The hydro plant is still there, burned down by kids smoking dope in it in the 1990s, little dope leaves painted over the crumbling brick, the turbines still visible under the water. The Army wants to take the dams away before they fail and flood the countryside, including my neighborhood. But no one wants to pay and no one knows what the ecological damage upstream will be when the lakes and marshes are gone because the dams are gone.

For awhile into the early 2000s I would occasionally see an old man walking downtown wearing a tattered blue work coat, the words “Bird and Son” emblazoned on the right breast. “Did you work there?” I would ask, stopping them on the sidewalk. They would nod, those old men. “I was there,” they’d sometimes say. “I was there at the end.”

Do they fire people all at once? Yes. Yes, they do. And they leave misery in their wake.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/czj2b3onxdls96ik', 'title': 'Has a company ever fired all employees at once?', 'score': {'original': 0.292525, 'ai': 0.707475}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I live near Walpole, MA.\n\nIn Walpole was the Bird and Son company.

They would nod, those old men. “I was there,” they’d sometimes say. “I was there at the end.”\n\nDo they fire people all at once? Yes. Yes, they do. And they leave misery in their wake.', 'result': {'fake': 0.1043, 'real': 0.8957}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 20, 'credits': 1997849, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'I live near Walpole, MA.\n\nIn Walpole was the Bird and Son company. Bird got his start as the stationery maker for George Washington. Making stationery was a big deal in those days when paper was made from rags and the final version of any document was called “the Enduring Hand”. Bird made out, built a great reputation and also a huge paper company. He had mills everywhere. He passed the mills on to his son and his son’s sons. The Bird and Son company invented tar paper; they invented asphalt shingles for roofing; they invented vinyl siding. The sky was the limit. During the 1930s, the Bird and Son company was known as the company of last resort: when you lost your job, Bird would hire you. He hired everyone who needed work, but the work was hard and dangerous and included working with poison chemicals.\n\nBy the war, the Bird and Son plant expanded over three separate towns. The headquarters near Walpole had its own rail spur with Bird and Son diesel-electric engines, the pride of the company. Trucks came day and night to move bulk paper around the nation. They even controlled a large portion of the shoe box market. They sponsored the high school football team; the paid for the big Christmas tree on the Common; they caused all the complaints about “traffic” downtown by busy shoppers going from store to store. You never know how some things are a blessing in disguise.\n\nLife was rosy for the Bird and Son company right up until 1980. The company was named as one of the last 10 of the original companies surviving from Revolutionary times, up there with Houghton-Mifflin and Casswell-Massey Soap and Ames Plow (which still exists). It was a proud name and the Bird Mill ran day and night, 500 people per shift with women in blue lab coats and hair nets stacking cardboard box blanks as they came, damp and steaming, off the cutting machines and hard, tough men moving heavy paper with forklifts and cranes. The stink of paper pulp filled the air and smoke bellowed from the highest smokestack in the entire region. Fishermen fished daily from the giant lakes formed by the Bird and Son dams that blocked many local rivers. They even had their own hydro plant.\n\nAnd then the idiots managing the company started making mistakes, mis-spending, investing poorly. In 1981 they lost so much money. And there was cheap paperboard coming up from Mexico now, from new plants with new machines and no environmental restrictions. The next year they recovered slightly. And then the EPA came in. You can’t dump your dyes, bleaches and pulp waste into the rivers anymore. The dead fish and dead deer are lining the banks as far as the eye can see. Yes, we know you control the dams and all the good work you do. Yes, we know you’re the biggest employer in the region. But no, the rivers cannot run yellow anymore.\n\nThey tried.\n\nThey really tried.\n\nThey built giant concrete settling tanks (that are still there) to take out the dyes; they built all kinds of mitigation projects to clean out the waste. They cut expenses to the bone and the plant suffered. The first thing to go were the beautifully painted locomotives. When they needed to move product by rail, they hired them from Boston and Maine Railroad. But it didn’t matter. Making paper is a dirty, dirty business.\n\nOne day after the work whistle blew at 7AM - and I heard that whistle as a child every single day from my bedroom - while everyone was doing their jobs and the massive lights in the ceiling blazed and the crane operators were lifting heavy rolls of paper and the immigrant women were stacking cardboard onto pallets and scientists were developing new uses for paper, the word went around for everyone to drop what they were doing and report to the cafeteria. Down, down, down, six flights of stairs, the men having a smoke outside the doors before filing over to the cafeteria building, the women going for a wash in the sub-basement where their lockers were located, next to the giant, circular cement sinks and showers. Into the cafeteria they filed, the smell of oatmeal still in the air, the steam still coming from the kitchen where lunch was being prepped. Everyone lined up to get a cup of coffee in a green Bird and Son ceramic cup and saucer, made tough to withstand years of use.\n\nAnd when they were all seated, the President stood up in front of them and told them the plant was closing, that this was their last day, that they would be handed their last checks and a brochure from the Unemployment Office on their way out. Five hundred blank faces looked at him without comprehension. A few minutes ago they were maybe thinking about getting a mortgage or buying a new car or taking a trip with the family. Not anymore. The President continued. No, they could not go back to their stations. No, they could not go back to their lockers. They would be told when they could go pick up their coats and personal items, when Brinks guards could watch them because suddenly they were untrustworthy. For now, just leave. Just leave.\n\nMeanwhile, the salvers were walking through the factory with the foremen, with their clipboards, pointing at machines that could be sold and machines that could be written off. And as they moved through the buildings, the work lights blazing overhead, the motors still spinning, the cardboard still moving down the assembly lines, the rollers still squeezing water from pulp as paper was spun onto massive rolls, they pulled those giant Frankenstein switches and the machines, one by one, powered down until all that was left was the sound of dripping water and pulp and the sobbing of the plant managers who had made this job their life.\n\nBird and Son was sold to Certainteed, and Certainteed was only interested in the asphalt shingle plant in my town, Norwood. It still operates today, stinking up the entire town. The rest of the operation was left to decay. They walked away from the paper and cardboard and the shoe boxes and the tools and equipment. They just walked away. No one wanted worn out paper making machines from the 1940s. No one wanted the cranes that had been installed in 1912 and still had that date emblazoned on the overhead rails. No one wanted most of what was left behind and there it sat, rusting, getting old, falling apart until the vandals broke in with their blowtorches and ripped open the giant motors and cut out the copper armatures and pulled out the copper piping and wiring wherever they could. Eventually the town pulled up all the steel rails and dismantled all the bridges that still bore the fading words “Bird and Son” on the sides. You can still walk the abandoned embankments, now overgrown with trees.\n\n“Bird and Son” it read on the top of the building, engraved in the cement to last, followed by the numbers “1912”. Proud, it was, and sad was the community as the jobs went away and as all the industries that supported Bird and Son failed. The hardware stores, the lumber mill, the machine shops, the car dealer, the diner - even the florist next door. There were no workmen to buy flowers for their wives on the way home from the factory anymore. There were no longer traffic jams downtown to complain about. Most of the stores were boarded up now. The entire town fell into depression, all through the 1980s and 1990s. The population fell as homes were foreclosed and abandoned, sometimes entire neighborhoods. The Bird scions, without progeny, died of old age and heartbreak and their mansion overlooking the abandoned factory was torn down. Eventually, tract houses would be built on the once-groomed landscape. One day a Japanese company came in and bought the giant smokestack. They wanted the millions of clay-made brick. They dynamited the stack and it went down fast in a cloud of smoke and those Japanese men stood around the rubble smiling as bulldozers dumped their antique clay brick onto dump trucks to be taken… to Japan? Who knows?\n\nThe abandoned Bird and Son before the fire.\n\nAnd then one Fourth of July in 2001 the plant caught on fire. Destructive kids were blamed, but everyone knew who it really was - the developers or maybe even the town. They needed that monstrosity gone. The plant covered 12 acres and nearly 15 different buildings, all abandoned. I once went right through the front door and the time cards were still crumbling in the racks next to the time clock, the men’s names printed in blue ink. That got me in the feels that day. The Bird and Son cups and saucers and plates were still there in the cafeteria when I broke in in 1994. Somewhere along the line I used a wrench to take a massive pressure gauge from a pipe. It was very “artsy” to me. It registered 30 pounds and I assumed it was broken. But when I untwisted the gauge, there was a hiss of air and the gauge went to zero. Fifteen years, winter and summer, and that pipe was still holding pressure. I still have it, that gauge, screwed to the wall in my cellar. In the crew area, the rusting lockers all hung open, some covered with “Led Zeppelin” bumper stickers or Union logos. Their work clothes and leather gloves were still hung inside or strewn on the floor. There was a dead dog in the corner, somehow lost in the maze and unable to find his way out. The test tubes and experiments and photo lab looked brand new. There were still balances and shelves of chemicals of all types. The carpeted computer room was strewn with miles and miles of brown computer tape all over the floor along with manuals for DEC computers, long gone. The file cabinets and oak desks and swivel chairs of the executive offices were still there, the names of the leaders still stenciled on the smoked glass doors. All gone, gone in a day. The fire was visible for miles. Over the next weeks the bulldozers came in and leveled what was left.\n\nIt was impossible to extinguish, and dangerous. They let it burn itself out over days.\n\nIt’s 2022 now. In the ensuing years the Army Corps of Engineers has been through many times. Bird and Son used to control the flood plain. They paid for all the dams and all the maintenance and they had engineers on site to open and close the dams during heavy rains. But you can’t just leave a dam for 30 years with no maintenance and no engineering and think nothing is going to happen. The hydro plant is still there, burned down by kids smoking dope in it in the 1990s, little dope leaves painted over the crumbling brick, the turbines still visible under the water. The Army wants to take the dams away before they fail and flood the countryside, including my neighborhood. But no one wants to pay and no one knows what the ecological damage upstream will be when the lakes and marshes are gone because the dams are gone.\n\nFor awhile into the early 2000s I would occasionally see an old man walking downtown wearing a tattered blue work coat, the words “Bird and Son” emblazoned on the right breast. “Did you work there?” I would ask, stopping them on the sidewalk.

Keira,Updated 3y,What was the most embarrassed you’ve been after having had unexpected company?,"I had just had my daughter. I could barely walk due to stitches and was just in so much pain, she was born with severe acid reflux among a few other smaller things and it caused her a lot of pain and very little sleep and it was hard for her to eat.

So she threw up a lot and a lot of um other stuff from the other end. And I was doing it on my own.

So the doctor told me to put her on formula after a lot of issues with breast milk and it was causing tummy problems. I had just fed her and normally I wouldn’t change her diaper right after a feeding but she had pottied so I went to change her and right when I lifted her legs to wipe her she exploded down there and sprayed everything with runny poo. Getting it everywhere (including me and herself).

So she’s screaming because she’s dirty and her tummy hurts and I’m sobbing because I had only 3 hours of sleep and was just splattered with poo and then the someone knocks on the door. Which makes me cry even harder.

I wrapped her bottom half in a clean blanket and answered…it was 2 friggin police officers. Which just makes me cry even harder thinking I’m in trouble for something.

I lived in a one bedroom apartment and my neighbor called a noise complaint because of my daughters crying. The female officer instantly asked me if I was being hurt, kindly ignored the poo while the male officer just stood dumbstruck lol.

I let them in and explained the situation, still covered in poo mind you, while cleaning up my daughter who is still crying.

Once I was done the female officer came over to me and told me they would stay and let me shower and get cleaned up (which of course made me cry more lol).

So both officers sat there trying to occupy my newborn and get her calmed down while I took a very fast shower and dressed.

When I came out the male officer had my daughter asleep on his shoulder and walking around the tiny living room. He explained his son was similar and told me things that helped and such, then proceeded to give me his wife’s number so I could talk to her when I needed help.

So this was my most embarrassing moment with unexpected company, but also the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9j02um3n7egslt5a', 'title': 'What was the most embarrassed you’ve been after having had unexpected company?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I had just had my daughter.

Mats Andersson,4y,"Why do so many companies that ask for British people to specify their address details forget to provide ""London"" or ""Greater London"" as an option?","Similar things happen in all countries. And it’s actually part of my job as a translator to try and persuade the companies to ditch this.

What happens is that they are using US-developed software. And there’s a mandatory field for “State”, since they often have cities of the same name in several different states.

And when the software goes abroad, they just squeeze in whatever they feel is the closest equivalent, since they are convinced that everything works just like in the US everywhere on the planet. So, in the UK, it’s counties.

The UK doesn’t have a county called “Greater London”.

Simple as that. When faced with reality, the software’s brain explodes.

It’s even sillier in Sweden. We also often have to specify “county” in our address. But lots of people don’t even know in which county they live, since it is completely irrelevant to us in everyday situations, unless we work in healthcare. And the modern counties, “län”, are different from the traditional counties, “landskap”. In a similar manner to the UK, we have a modern county called “Stockholms län”, but there is no such traditional county; I live in the modern “län” of Stockholm and the traditional “landskap” of Uppland.

Ty Doyle,3y,"Why did a multi-billion dollar company, Disney, sue a school for showing a movie?","I assume your question is about the California elementary school that was fined $250 by Disney’s licensing wing after its PTA screened The Lion King as part of a fundraiser that brought in less than $1,000? First of all, this wasn’t a lawsuit, but a fine levied by the holder of the copyright (Disney) for the unlicensed use, which the school apparently paid. And yes, the optics of all of this are terrible; Disney has a well-earned reputation for being litigious, so it was always going to be the Scar, rather than Mufasa, in this story.

But that being said, there’s a major issue in copyright (which would apply to a film) and trademark law that if you don’t vigorously protect those rights, you may lose the ability to enforce them later. The law doesn’t have a “for the kids” or “little guy” exception; if you’re regularly turning a blind eye to schools showing your films without a license, then a movie theater, restaurant, city, etc. could argue that it’s entitled to do the same thing. This kind of stuff has come up countless times—The Simpsons and Star Wars are major sources of unlicensed goods, for example—and the argument is always “I’m just a fan,” “it’s for a good cause,” or “X Company is ginormous, what does it care about little old me making a few bucks?” but again, if you let people steal a little bit, you may have a problem enforcing your rights when someone steals a lot. So while Disney’s licensor is guilty of being overly vigilant, this isn’t a case of the company being “evil” or “greedy,” but rather, a company that makes money primarily off of its intellectual property ensuring that it retains those rights.

Samantha Josh,9mo,What are the benefits for companies developing voice and text based chatbots?,"The development of voice and text based chatbots has immense potential for companies to increase customer satisfaction and efficiency.

By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, these AI-powered chatbots can accurately interpret and respond to voice and text input.

For instance, if a customer has a question about a product or service, the chatbot could quickly provide an accurate response and direct the customer to the appropriate resource.

Additionally, voice and text based chatbots can help companies increase their customer service speed and accuracy by routing customers to the right department, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

When it comes to the singularity, AI technology will play a definitive role in the ways we live, work, and interact with one another.

Voice and text based chatbots are just one example of how AI's capability for advanced information processing and analysis can revolutionize customer service.

With the emergence of AI, voice and text based chatbot technology will no doubt continue to progress, creating even more efficient customer service processes that streamline customer experience.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3gfa48btoepchxws', 'title': 'What are the benefits for companies developing voice and text based chatbots?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The development of voice and text based chatbots has immense potential for companies to increase customer satisfaction and efficiency.\n\nBy utilizing natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, these AI-powered chatbots can accurately interpret and respond to voice and text input.\n\nFor instance, if a customer has a question about a product or service, the chatbot could quickly provide an accurate response and direct the customer to the appropriate resource.\n\nAdditionally, voice and text based chatbots can help companies increase their customer service speed and accuracy by routing customers to the right department, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.\n\nWhen it comes to the singularity, AI technology will play a definitive role in the ways we live, work, and interact with one another.\n\nVoice and text based chatbots are just one example of how AI's capability for advanced information processing and analysis can revolutionize customer service.\n\nWith the emergence of AI, voice and text based chatbot technology will no doubt continue to progress, creating even more efficient customer service processes that streamline customer experience."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1997823, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""The development of voice and text based chatbots has immense potential for companies to increase customer satisfaction and efficiency.\n\nBy utilizing natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, these AI-powered chatbots can accurately interpret and respond to voice and text input.\n\nFor instance, if a customer has a question about a product or service, the chatbot could quickly provide an accurate response and direct the customer to the appropriate resource.\n\nAdditionally, voice and text based chatbots can help companies increase their customer service speed and accuracy by routing customers to the right department, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.\n\nWhen it comes to the singularity, AI technology will play a definitive role in the ways we live, work, and interact with one another.\n\nVoice and text based chatbots are just one example of how AI's capability for advanced information processing and analysis can revolutionize customer service.\n\nWith the emergence of AI, voice and text based chatbot technology will no doubt continue to progress, creating even more efficient customer service processes that streamline customer experience."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0
Sean Kernan,1y,What is the biggest mistake that a big company has made?,"Imagine working in the hot streets of Manila in the early 1990s. You are a butcher, slaving away in a loud, humid market for long hours. You only make several dollars a day to support a large family.

One evening, you are holding a Pepsi bottle cap in your hand. On it is a number. You bought several of these sodas in hopes of winning a big $40,000 giveaway at the end of the promotion. This money could change your family’s life. It is a mountain of earnings in a world of limited opportunities. You watch as Pepsi begins reading off the winners on TV.

Suddenly, you realize you’ve won. Incredulous, you quadruple-check your numbers. The number is accurate. Your heart begins racing as you rush to call your wife and kids. However, you, and many winners like you, will never see that money. But at least you won’t lose your life, like some.

It started a year prior.

Pepsi was trying to break into the Philippine market where Coca-Cola was already dominant. This was the 12th largest soft drink market, with a rapidly growing population of 62 million people.

The economy was weak. Lots of people struggling to make ends meet. Tens of millions worked in rice fields and other physically demanding, low-paying jobs.

Pepsi executives decided to do a promotional campaign that promised to have lots of payouts. Each Pepsi bottle cap would have a number that correlated to a prize that would be announced. There were be lots of small winners and then two huge winners of $40,000 each.

One Massive, Massive Problem

Pepsi hoped the allure of prize money would convert many of the low-income Coke drinkers. They strategically planned to give out a total of $2M in prizes.

However, a computer glitch with one of Pepsi’s vendors caused them to manufacture 800,000 bottles with the number “349” on the bottle cap.

The number “349” was the $40,000 winning number.

Pepsi had explicitly told its vendor factories not to print this number at all. The two bottles with that number would be specially manufactured and sent to the Philippines by Pepsi themselves.

So here is Pepsi, churning along each month, not knowing they accidentally sent $32 billion worth of winning caps to the Philippines. Meanwhile, everyone in the Philippines is going bananas for this promotion, buying up all the soda bottles. This disruptive campaign increased Pepsi’s market share from 4% to 24.9% in just two months.

Fast Forward. The big day arrives. All the Filipinos have their TVs on. Pepsi goes on to announce the winning bottlecap number, 349, and across the Philippines, crowds of people are cheering. They’ve won enough money to buy a large house.

Pepsi then realizes they’ve made a terrible mistake. They do their whole, “Whoa whoa whoa, hold up.”

The optics of the situation aren’t pretty. You have this first-world multibillion-dollar business that has made this huge monetary promise to these poor people, only to backpedal and blame it on a system error. One could see how it wouldn’t sit well with a rice farmer.

Pepsi realizes they can’t just walk away without paying anything. They make an offer of $18 to each patron. It came out to $8.7M in total payouts, versus their original budget of $2M. The people don’t fin...

Either they decided that they actually did need someone in that position.

Nate Carmody,23-Aug,"What bad experience had you saying ""I will never buy from that company or use their service ever again""?","U-Haul

(What I believe should happen to the company)

My wife was moving from Virginia to Ohio, had a U-Haul reservation, and showed up on Saturday morning to pick up her truck. There was no truck, they had rented it out to somebody else, who showed up earlier that Saturday without a reservation. When asked about why they had done that, they blamed us for not being there earlier, on an 8–12 pick up window, when we showed up at 9:00.

Within an hour, we had a Ryder truck. However, later that afternoon, when we were nearly done packing up her stuff, U-Haul called to say they had her truck ready. We said “no” in very definitive terms. Sure enough, two weeks later, when my wife got her credit card statement, U-Haul had charged her for the rental in spite of not having the truck. The customer service representative at U-Haul was inflexible on the charge, stating that they had a truck for her, and it was her fault that she didn’t pick it up.

Ron Rule,5y,What is one reason Quora could fail as a company?,"The content matching algorithm.

I get what they’re trying to do here, but the side effect is that it creates content silos. Not all users understand this, and are getting the impression that the “majority of content on Quora” is specific to a handful of topics.

For example, right now my feed is dominated by (usually ridiculous) gun questions. Why? Because I answered a couple, and so did some of the people I follow.

If I didn’t understand the technology behind why this happened, my impression would be that Quora is a site where 90% of the people argue about gun control and the other 10% talk about other stuff.

The rest of you are probably having a similar experience with different topics.

I’m just speculating here, but this - whatever the topic happens to be that you get siloed into - is probably a turn-off for a lot of users.

The user-level confusion is evidenced by the fact that there are many questions like “Why is Quora so liberal” and “Why is Quora so conservative” or “Why is Quora full of eCommerce platform spam” - well, the answer is because your actions told Quora that’s the kind of crap you are going to engage with. And Quora took that ball, ran with it, and hasn’t stopped running. The problem is that once this happens, you see so much of that content, it becomes a flood where it feels like that’s all there is.

How this affects Quora as a company is with user retention. User acquisition isn’t a problem with Quora due to the variety of topics.

Santosh Tandale,Updated 5y,What companies have chosen morality over profitability?,"Let’s see some Indian stories.

1) Amul India:
When amul was Launching India's first milkshakes, they had found out that the most popular flavors were strawberry and chocolate. When Dr. Vergis Kurien was told about this, his instant reaction was “I have access to your chocolate throughout the year, but don't have access to real strawberries. and I will not launch an artificial strawberry flavor, no matter how successful it will become"". So they launched chocolate and ilaichi flavors. Morality winning over the profit.

2) TATA TEA:
When Mr R. K. Krishnakumar, Managing Director of TATA TEA , in a presentation of a media plan for a new campaign of TATA TEA, he was told that although getting spots on mahabharat serial( which at that time was the most popular, must–watch program on Indian television) was extremely difficult, we will manage with our contacts in doordarshan . His immediate reaction was, if there is any underhand dealing or bribery involved in getting those spots, then he is not interested. Not only that but if he ever found out that anyone had resorted to some such dealings, he will sack the agency regardless of how much he liked the their work.
Morality winning over profit.

3) TATA SALT:
When the company was launching India's first iodized salt, TATA SALT, Mr. Darbari Seth, the Chairman of TATA chemicals said , ""While we're doing this campaign to sell packaged salt, we have to release a campaign to educate the people that the usage of salt should be minimized in their cooking, because too much salt is bad for the health. As a responsible corporate citizen, we owe it to the people.” Imagine India's biggest salt company telling people to eat less salt .
Morality winning over profit.

4) Vicco Vajradanti:
When few prestigious customers of Vicco Vajradanti pointed out to Mr. Gajanan Pendharkar , the chairman of VICCO, that sometimes the paste is too watery and can something be done about it? His instant response was the consistency of the paste depends on the water content in the bark of one of the ingredients, and it will always differ from batch to batch. And he will not add anything artificial to get uniform consistency. In fact he went ahead to advise the advertising company that in every advertising created for this company, strict attention should be given to being honest and not claim anything that the product does not have or deliver. When the price of sandalwood oil became so high that the entire pricing of vicco turmeric and sandalwood cream would go haywire unless he switched to using artificial sandalwood essence, he chose to launch a cream without Sandalwood oil and proudly called it so.

from Amazon and it arrived in a box like this:

So I posted pics online and said “hey, what gives?”

A guy who says he works in an Amazon warehouse (I don’t know if that’s true or not) claimed they have extremely high numbers of packages they’re supposed to prep and ship per hour and said he’d frequently get yelled at by his manager if he left his station to get more boxes, so sometimes if he ran out of small boxes or shipping envelopes he’d just toss small orders into whatever box he had.

Adam Buckland,Updated 4y,Can you describe a time that your company only discovered that you were irreplaceable after they fired you? How did you feel? What did they do?,"My position was made “redundant” (UK term for we don’t need your role any more) a decision I took with good grace because I had just been offered a position to set up my own software and hardware division and also they had to pay me my notice period (3 months) and a compensation for my loss of job.

I moved on and found out a few weeks later that my junior had been fired for walking in to the office in trainers (He ran to work each day and showered and changed whilst there) and so breached the office attire rules.

I gave him a suitable reference to get a new job and thought nothing of it until the end of the following tax year when the company we had worked for needed to produce annual financial statements for over 1,300,000 individuals including some very , very high worth people.

So the old company contact me and ask me to do a days work at my old rate to help them out.

I declined and said that I needed to run it myself as a contractor as my role had been deemed surplus to requirements.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 4y,What are some businesses that it's hard to believe have gone bankrupt?,"My favorite childhood store went bankrupt last year. It took me several months to digest the news.

Victoria Kidd-Cromis,Updated 3y,Have you ever seen a mass exodus after a respected employee quit or got fired?,"My father was a banker for most of my life. He worked in the trust department assisting people with estates, wills, and trust funds, inheritances, etc. My mother used to tease him that he had a “harem” of older ladies who thought he was wonderful because he had handled things when their husbands died.

In the early 90s the local bank was bought by a much larger bank from another state. Things changed and not for the better. My father was told that he should use money from one account to bolster another account and replace the money later. My father refused. While it might not have been illegal at the time he felt that it was highly unethical and he wouldn’t do it.

He resigned.
