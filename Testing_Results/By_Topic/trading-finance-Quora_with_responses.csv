Palkesh Asawa,7y,What are some of the mind blowing facts about stock markets?,"An interesting case of how superstitions work in real life!

In the Bombay Stock Exchange, there is a statue of a bull in front of the second gate of the building. People in the market have this superstition that whenever that gate is opened, the markets crash.

This is the famous stock market bull statue -

The door was first opened in 1992, and the infamous Harshad Mehta scam happened soon after it.
In 2001, the door was opened again during US President Clinton’s visit, and there was a major crash in the stock exchange.
Again, in 2008 when the gate was opened to install a new statue, the markets crashed suddenly.

What is going on here?

Are we meant to believe that the bull statue really caused a crash in the stock exchange? I mean, do superstitions work in real life?

In order to understand this better, let me tell you a story…

Akbar and Birbal decided to conduct a social experiment. They announced that every person in the kingdom should donate one glass of milk to the royal treasury during the night time.

But in the morning, they saw that the tank was actually full of water, not milk! Nobody gave a drop of milk. What was happening?

To find out, they decided to disguise themselves and ask around.

One person said, “Oh, everyone else was going to put milk. Who will find out if I added one glass of water? I saved money!”

It was a genius idea, but alas, everybody thought the same. Everyone thought that everyone else is going to put milk, and hence it would benefit them if they put water instead. In thinking so, everyone eventually ends up putting water.

This is interesting, right? It happens in the stock markets too.

Imagine that you hold some shares in the stock market and you get to know that gate number 2 of the Bombay Stock Exchange has recently been opened. What are you thinking right now?

“Holy shit! Whenever they open that bloody gate, the market crashes. Man! I have a lot of money invested in the market. I better sell my shares before the market falls”

That’s a fantastic idea, except that everybody is thinking the same thing.

Everyone is afraid that the markets may fall. As a result of this, everyone wants to sell their shares and leave, before the price falls. What happens then? This is basic economics. When the supply rises, prices fall.

Imagine! Markets crash because people believe that they are going to crash.

Such is the power of a superstition!

Yves Pircher,5y,Why hasn't a mathematical model to beat the stock market been found?,"Because the market is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system.

Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it (e.g. weather): It doesn’t care what the weatherman says; if it rains, it rains. Though it is influenced by a myriad of factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts.
Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it and therefore can never be predicted accurately (e.g. markets): They care a lot about predictions and rumours . What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise.

So many forces are at work and their interactions are so complex that extremely small variations in the strength of the forces and the way they interact produce huge differences in outcomes.

Arjan Atkinson,Updated 1y,Can you lose money with crypto trading bots?,"Most inexperienced traders who want to make money on cryptocurrencies prefer to use bots in their trading. Their main goal is to automate the trading process, as they help to earn only on a fully automated system.

What is a trading bot? To answer this question, consider a simplified mechanism for how it works:

rules are created;
a strategy is developed;
writing code.

Then the software remains connected to the trading account in order to trade 
and start earning money. But the income is directly proportional to the quality of the bot.

Most programs use fairly simple, formulaic strategies that are far from always effective. Therefore, if the program promises to make 300% or even 1000%, you should not take this information literally and consider the possible profit.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qxvy5c0atjno1lbs', 'title': 'Can you lose money with crypto trading bots?', 'score': {'original': 0.8753, 'ai': 0.1247}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Most inexperienced traders who want to make money on cryptocurrencies prefer to use bots in their trading.

Ross.Lederhman,3y,Has procrastination turned out to be beneficial for you in the stock market?,"Yes.

Many folks, who are proclaimed professional daytraders, feel they have to trade every day. Every fucking day. With their massive setups like this;

And shoutout to the world, how tough it is, how much hours it takes every day, so much stress, yada yada. The above is nonsense. You don't require all this rubbish. You don't need fixed daily goals, it makes, mathematically, no sense. One should trade when an opportunity arises, not the other way around. I am a “lazy” trader. I don't trade frequently, and when I do, I don't require 50 screens, ha.

I was busy working on an old algorithm of mine when someone of Quora name dropped me random firms (Jake). Chegg and Six Flags were one of em'. I put Chegg in my algorithm and was purely checking how it was working out.

Due to its results, I wanted to know more. Doing some reading about it made me realize, before earnings, I should put in a short, textbook example of a fat bastard of a company, earnings are likely going to be disappointing, the rest is probably going to indicate massive growth (book company, we are in the middle of the pandemic). It was the perfect moment for folks to exit some of their positions. And on that I anticipated. They published earnings after closing, made an absolute killer.

And why? Purely because someone fetched me the name of a firm I never investigated, they had earnings coming up, I did my research and felt a position should be taken.

And all on 1 small laptop, while I did my positions through the phone. Manually.

Being “lazy” is another word for waiting for what seems the right moment. You don’t need to trade. Heck, I never have to trade again, but I can, and it gives me time and clarity to research what I think is worth investing in.

I felt absolute no pressure, and I am convinced that helps me in my trading activities. I never understood the “need” to trade or “boasting” about how frequently one traded.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/p4q2odxg8ezjct5w', 'title': 'Has procrastination turned out to be beneficial for you in the stock market?', 'score': {'original': 0.9458, 'ai': 0.0542}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Yes.\n\nMany folks, who are proclaimed professional daytraders, feel they have to trade every day.

Bryant Judith,7mo,Can you lose money with crypto trading bots?,"Absolutely, you can lose money with crypto trading bots. While it is true that using trading bots can be a potentially lucrative way to make money in the cryptocurrency market, it is not without its risks. However, it is essential to stress that using crypto trading bots is legal and not inherently fraudulent or illegal as some may suggest.

Firstly, it's important to understand that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable. Prices can fluctuate rapidly within a short period, making it challenging for even the most sophisticated trading bots to accurately predict market movements. As a result, there is always a risk of losing money while using trading bots, just as there is with any form of trading or investment.

Secondly, the performance of a crypto trading bot greatly depends on its setup and configuration. If not properly configured or if using unreliable software, a trading bot can make incorrect decisions or execute trades at unfavorable prices, resulting in financial losses. It is crucial to thoroughly research and choose a reputable and well-tested trading bot with a proven track record of success.

Additionally, human error can also play a significant role in potential losses. Even with the assistance of a trading bot, it is essential to have a sound understanding of the market and be able to interpret data and trends accurately. Incorrect analysis or misjudgment can lead to poor trading decisions, ultimately resulting in financial losses.

Furthermore, external factors beyond the control of trading bots can also impact their performance and lead to losses. These factors include regulatory changes, security breaches, market manipulation, and unforeseen events that can cause significant price fluctuations. It is crucial to stay informed about market news and be prepared to adjust trading strategies accordingly.

To minimize the risk of losing money with crypto trading bots, it is advisable to start with small investments and gradually increase exposure as you gain experience and confidence in your chosen bot and trading strategy. Additionally, regularly monitoring and adjusting the bot's settings based on market conditions can help optimize performance and reduce potential losses.

In conclusion, while using crypto trading bots can be a legal and potentially profitable way to participate in the cryptocurrency market, it is important to acknowledge the associated risks. Losing money is a possibility, but by conducting thorough research, selecting a reliable trading bot, staying informed about market conditions, and continuously monitoring and adjusting your strategy, you can mitigate these risks and increase your chances of success.

Doug Armey,4y,"When a stock market crashes and everyone is desperately selling, who is actually willing to buy?","I am. And thrilled to.

Of course, I’ve been accused of being a little off kilter, too.

2009, in the Great Recession, investors fled the stock market like rats off a burning boat.

They couldn’t sell fast enough.

Pundits cried, “It’s the end of the financial world. Get out while you can. Buy gold.”

I fielded phone calls morning to night from scared clients. I did my best to convince them not to bail.

Most followed my advice. A couple of them jumped overboard right at the height of the hurricane.

If you didn’t live through it as an investor you just can’t comprehend how frightening it was. And the level of panic that engulfed the markets.

In the midst of the carnage I analyzed underlying values. Stock prices had been decimated. But earnings of most large companies were fine. Their prices had plummeted and their values skyrocketed.

The stock market was like Macy’s having the “White Sale of the Century.”

Warren Buffett announced he was buying stocks.

He was asked, “Aren’t you worried they could go down more?

He replied, “Sure, prices might go down more. But they’re cheap now. Eventually they’ll go up.”

And every month I maxed out my 401k and bought stocks, also.

Me and Uncle Warren together. Of course, he has no idea that I’m his self adopted nephew.

Kind of like buying patio furniture on sale during a winter blizzard. I know spring is coming and it’s cheap now.

I look back at those investments and they’re some of the best I’ve ever made. They’ve increased exponentially.

And I’m giddy every time Macy’s has another “White Sale”. I load up on bargains again.

Of course, I’ve been accused of being a little off kilter.

You build wealth when the stock market is crashing as you understand the difference between price and value.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ta62iuwrygfo7jp5', 'title': 'When a stock market crashes and everyone is desperately selling, who is actually willing to buy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am.

Stock Price,Updated 4y,Why hasn't a mathematical model to beat the stock market been found?,"Investors aren't rational, information isn't always widely available or understood, and markets aren't 100% efficient. And the farther we go back in time, the more inefficient they were. This, combined with hard work to find the inefficiencies is why Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch, and many others were able to do so well. There have been models and algorithms over the years that have done better than average. As word got out about them, more and more people started using them, and their effect faded away.

Classical finance theory is based on the concept of the efficient market. 100% rational investors who know everything there is to know about the market as soon as the information becomes available. Of course that's a myth. There are still inefficiencies today, and people are still finding them, but my belief is they're getting harder to find all the time.

Pramod Kumar,Updated 6y,What are few tips for trading in Indian stock market? What are the trading secrets?,"What Are The Trading Secrets ? :

The question is in two parts. The first one seeks tips for trading in Indian Stock Markets. The second part seeks to know the secrets of trading.

Once you know the answers to these two questions, profits will start rolling in and you are on your way to the world of stock market riches.

I have been trading for some 25 years now. In this period I have seen many traders go broke, never return to trading again. I have seen people make some money, lose more than that, take a break, return and meet the same fate and repeat the cycle many times.

And I have seen very few, who have made money from trading but they generally do not talk much about it.

If there was a secret formula or the holy grail of trading, then about 90% of the traders would not be in the losing category.

PART I : TIPS FOR TRADING:

Based on my experience of trading and observations of the characteristics of the traders, I would like to list the tips of trading.

(A) Trader Should Remain A Trader, Not Become An Investor:

This is the first tip for a trader.

A trader buys a stock at Rs. 100 in the hope of selling at 102–103 on the same day. Such trades are done on margin. Instead of going up, the stock falls to Rs. 97.

What do you do?

Take delivery of the stock. Now the money is blocked. You hope that the price will move up next day and you will exit at a profit. It goes down further to Rs. 92. You are now stuck with it.

After a month it is back to Rs. 100. You exit at break even. Lost the brokerage amount.

Few days later, the stock is at Rs. 120 and you are regretting the missed opportunity.

Does this look familiar?

A trader is in the trade for the day or few days. It does not serve the purpose if the trading capital gets blocked.

And the cardinal mistake here was waiting while in loss, but not waiting when the trend became positive.

Some traders have all the patience in the world when a trade goes wrong, but exit from a likely winning trade after only break even or with a small profit.

This can be summed up as the second important tip:

(B) Exit The Losing Trades Quickly, Wait In The Winning Trades.

At the risk of repeating myself ( I have said it many times in my other answers ), the following example will illustrate this point:

BHEL Futures Day Trades in July 2014 :

There were 6 trades in all, only one of them profitable. The loss in five loss making trades were— 0.00, 1.10, 1.65. 4.40 and 1.90 units respectively.

The profit in single winning trade was 22.10 units.

Exit from the losing trades quickly and waiting in a single profitable trade resulted in good profit for the month.

(C) Never Trade Without A Stop Loss:

All the above trades were with stop loss at pre determined levels . Once the trade became profitable, the trailing stop loss was used. In the absence of a stop loss, there is too much thinking before action which makes the trade go wrong.

Successful traders always use stop loss. Losing ones have not even heard about it.

(D ) Wait In Profits, Maximize The Gain From A Good Trade:

In the same screen shot, the trade which gave maximum profit is not about my skill about picking the right trade.

I had shorted BHEL earlier in the day and a stop loss was hit very soon. I had entered another short trade few minutes later and this time the trend changed. I could have been wrong again and taken a loss.

But when right sit tight theory was used and this single trade gave a profit of Rs. 44000.

(E) Trend Is Friend:

Trade with the trend. There are people who make very good counter trend calls. But that needs too much study of market and price movements.

Study is something which traders want to avoid even at the risk of loss.

Then at least take the easy option of staying with the trend.

And if the trend reverses, stay protected with appropriate stop loss.

(F) Trade Only In High Volume Stocks:

Traders look for small profits. So trades have to be done in stocks where prices are fair. That is possible in most of the large cap stocks.

Stick to those stocks or Indices like NIFTY or BANK NIFTY.

PART II:

SECRET OF TRADING:

There is none.

There is only one way of making money.

Buy Low Sell High.

Do it whichever way you want.

Buy first sell later. Do short selling and buy later. Buy and sell Options. Trade futures.

But the selling price is to be higher than buying price for making profits.

How simple?

But how difficult to achieve?

The secret to trading is— KNOW YOURSELF.

Know your strength and weakness.

Know your patience limit in loss and in profit.

Know to control your fear and greed.

Know that profit is the result of a good trade and not a lottery.

Know that losses are part of trading and are meant as lessons to be learnt.

Know and believe that trading can be profitable.

Do not go outside to search for secrets.

The secret to good trading lies within you.

Happy trading.

The first one seeks tips for trading in Indian Stock Markets. The second part seeks to know the secrets of trading.\n\nOnce you know the answers to these two questions, profits will start rolling in and you are on your way to the world of stock market riches.\n\nI have been trading for some 25 years now. In this period I have seen many traders go broke, never return to trading again. I have seen people make some money, lose more than that, take a break, return and meet the same fate and repeat the cycle many times.\n\nAnd I have seen very few, who have made money from trading but they generally do not talk much about it.\n\nIf there was a secret formula or the holy grail of trading, then about 90% of the traders would not be in the losing category.\n\nPART I : TIPS FOR TRADING:\n\nBased on my experience of trading and observations of the characteristics of the traders, I would like to list the tips of trading.\n\n(A) Trader Should Remain A Trader, Not Become An Investor:\n\nThis is the first tip for a trader.\n\nA trader buys a stock at Rs. 100 in the hope of selling at 102–103 on the same day. Such trades are done on margin. Instead of going up, the stock falls to Rs. 97.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nTake delivery of the stock. Now the money is blocked. You hope that the price will move up next day and you will exit at a profit. It goes down further to Rs. 92. You are now stuck with it.\n\nAfter a month it is back to Rs. 100. You exit at break even. Lost the brokerage amount.\n\nFew days later, the stock is at Rs. 120 and you are regretting the missed opportunity.\n\nDoes this look familiar?\n\nA trader is in the trade for the day or few days. It does not serve the purpose if the trading capital gets blocked.\n\nAnd the cardinal mistake here was waiting while in loss, but not waiting when the trend became positive.\n\nSome traders have all the patience in the world when a trade goes wrong, but exit from a likely winning trade after only break even or with a small profit.\n\nThis can be summed up as the second important tip:\n\n(B) Exit The Losing Trades Quickly, Wait In The Winning Trades.\n\nAt the risk of repeating myself ( I have said it many times in my other answers ), the following example will illustrate this point:\n\nBHEL Futures Day Trades in July 2014 :\n\nThere were 6 trades in all, only one of them profitable. The loss in five loss making trades were— 0.00, 1.10, 1.65. 4.40 and 1.90 units respectively.\n\nThe profit in single winning trade was 22.10 units.\n\nExit from the losing trades quickly and waiting in a single profitable trade resulted in good profit for the month.\n\n(C) Never Trade Without A Stop Loss:\n\nAll the above trades were with stop loss at pre determined levels . Once the trade became profitable, the trailing stop loss was used. In the absence of a stop loss, there is too much thinking before action which makes the trade go wrong.\n\nSuccessful traders always use stop loss. Losing ones have not even heard about it.\n\n(D ) Wait In Profits, Maximize The Gain From A Good Trade:\n\nIn the same screen shot, the trade which gave maximum profit is not about my skill about picking the right trade.\n\nI had shorted BHEL earlier in the day and a stop loss was hit very soon. I had entered another short trade few minutes later and this time the trend changed. I could have been wrong again and taken a loss.\n\nBut when right sit tight theory was used and this single trade gave a profit of Rs. 44000.\n\n(E) Trend Is Friend:\n\nTrade with the trend. There are people who make very good counter trend calls. But that needs too much study of market and price movements.\n\nStudy is something which traders want to avoid even at the risk of loss.\n\nThen at least take the easy option of staying with the trend.\n\nAnd if the trend reverses, stay protected with appropriate stop loss.\n\n(F) Trade Only In High Volume Stocks:\n\nTraders look for small profits. So trades have to be done in stocks where prices are fair. That is possible in most of the large cap stocks.\n\nStick to those stocks or Indices like NIFTY or BANK NIFTY.\n\nPART II:\n\nSECRET OF TRADING:\n\nThere is none.\n\nThere is only one way of making money.\n\nBuy Low Sell High.\n\nDo it whichever way you want.\n\nBuy first sell later. Do short selling and buy later. Buy and sell Options. Trade futures.\n\nBut the selling price is to be higher than buying price for making profits.\n\nHow simple?\n\nBut how difficult to achieve?\n\nThe secret to trading is— KNOW YOURSELF.\n\nKnow your strength and weakness.\n\nKnow your patience limit in loss and in profit.\n\nKnow to control your fear and greed.\n\nKnow that profit is the result of a good trade and not a lottery.\n\nKnow that losses are part of trading and are meant as lessons to be learnt.\n\nKnow and believe that trading can be profitable.\n\nDo not go outside to search for secrets.\n\nThe secret to good trading lies within you.\n\nHappy trading.\n\nThanks for reading.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.39635
Christopher Stones,5y,What techniques do you use to get into the right mindset before trading?,"Flexibility -Hold no attachment to trades-Endeavour to have no emotional attachment to an idea. When a trade is wrong he will just cut it, move on and do something else.

Change opinions on a dime-When people ask me for my opinion about the markets I always tell them, “what I think the market should do today may not be the same view I hold tomorrow.” As traders, it’s not our job to be right; it’s our job to make money.

Focus on the here and now-Quick decisive decision making is crucial. We base our decisions on the information in front of us at the time of the trade.

You have to stop trying to will things to happen in order to prove that you’re right. Listen only to what the market is telling you NOW. Forget what you thought it was telling you five minutes ago. Remember the objective is not to prove you’re right, but to hear the cash register ring.

Intuition is gained from experience-Whether you consider yourself a discretionary trader or mechanical trader there’s a level of intuition and feel that develops from observations and experience.

In addition to live trading and reviewing charts, the quickest way I’ve found for developing a sound trading intuition is to keep a log of market behavior.

Write down what is happening in the market. Then write down what you think will or should happen as a result. Once the outcome is revealed, compare your initial hypothesis. This is a great way to build a solid macro understanding and strong intuition.

The Importance of Implementation -Right strategy for the idea-With so many markets and instruments out there to trade there are many ways to express your ideas. It begins with an observation or hypothesis. Sometimes buying the underlying is the best trade. Other times, a derivative or currency makes for a better play.

When looking to express an idea in the markets, seek out the trade with the least risk, greatest reward potential.

Draw a line in the sand-Know where you are to be proven wrong before even entering a trade. Start by deciding where the market would have to go, that is at what level your idea would be invalidated. This is where you place your stop. Colm O’Shea stressed this idea in his trading.

Execute consistently-Even though I place my trades manually, I try to be as mechanical as possible. This means, if I see a setup that meets my criteria, I take it. The mechanics of trading should not be left up to the judgment of the trader. To be a winner you have to be able to toe the line and pull the trigger.

Embrace uncertainty and risk-I accept that a trade will be a loser even before I enter the position. That is, I’m accepting the worse possible scenario and I’m okay with it. This keeps me focused and objective during the entire trading process.

Belief is in the Numbers -Think like a “Turtle”-The turtle trader experiment resulted from a dispute between commodity speculator(this I was told by a long time friend over the idea of whether great traders were born or made). Some believe that they could teach people to become great traders and some think that genetics and aptitude were the determining factors.

I suggest you recruit and train yourself to be a better trader, giving yourself actual account to trade and see if you can be correct.

You can be the one to make the most profit ever made by a trader..The rules instructed are easy to follow because sometimes they are not only very precise, but provided answers for each of the decisions they were to make while trading. This can also make it easier to trade consistently because there was a set of rules which defined exactly what should be done.

Ignore individual trade outcomes-The best way to gauge our trading performance is not to look at the result from our last 1 or 2 trades; it’s to look collectively at a group of say our last 20 trades. In this way, the outcome of each individual trade is masked. This also helps dilute any “recency bias” that we may encounter and prevents past trades from influencing future decisions.

Calculate your expectancy-Expectancy is simply you projected return over a longer period of time. Expressed (Avg $ W x Win %) – (Avg $ L x Loss %) – commission per trade.(Parker Joas taught me well on this and I think this is key to the whole process)

HE says, “If you know that your system makes money over the long run, it is easier to take the signals and trade according to the system during periods of losses. If you are relying on your own judgment during trading, you may find that you are fearful just when you should be bold and courageous just when you should be cautious.” you can add him on Skype with the name

4. Accept Mistakes -Mistakes lead to improvement-Check your ego at the door and accept that you will be wrong. Mistakes provide the path to improvement and ultimate success. Each mistake offers an opportunity to learn from the error and to modify one’s approach based on this new information.

Whenever you make a significant mistake in trading, write it down, both to reinforce the lesson and to serve as a future reminder. Then change your trading process based on this new experience. In this way, mistakes can become the essential ingredient for continual improvement as a trader (or any endeavor for that matter).

Be bold, embrace disagreement-Parker joas employs a culture encouraging independent thinking and innovation. he believes there must be thoughtful disagreement and non-ego impaired exploration of mistakes and weaknesses to achieve goals.

Imagine how much better decision making would be if people who disagree were more open to trying to get at the truth through thoughtful discourse. It is a process that produces discovery.

Collaborate on ideas-Something you may not know about me is that I studied architectural design in college. One of the things I loved about design studio was the ability for collaboration. When an idea first pops into your head it seems fantastic, but as you begin to discuss your idea with others, questions arise that you may not have thought about at first. Thinking through all these facets leads to the development of a structurally sound idea.

Seek out opposing views-The better we understand the opposition, the better we can understand who is on the other side of our trades and how they might react.

The great thing about being a trader is that you can always do a much better job, no matter how successful you are. Most people are busy trying to cover up their mistakes. As a trader, you are forced to confront your mistakes because the numbers don’t lie.

Find what works for YOU-Do as others do NOT-In order to achieve greatness we must get uncomfortable. As a trader, you can’t be afraid of going against the grain.

If you do the same as others do, you can expect to be average. Going against the grain is tough. There can be a lot of social pressures and questioning from family and friends. In order to live your life the way YOU want, you need to put yourself in opportunistic situations. Surround yourself with the people you want to be like who share your same moral beliefs.

Think about the opposite-Look at things from all angles and think about the opposite action. When a lawyer prepares a case they will often prepare the opposing arguments first. In this way they know what to expect and have all their bases covered. In trading, think about who is on the other side of your trades and if you were that person, how you would react.

Just because everyone is buying gold, doesn’t mean you should too. The media and the talking heads are often on the wrong side of the trade.

Learn by doing-There’s no substitute for experience. Go out and try something. If it doesn’t work for you, learn from it and move on.

Isolate yourself from negativity-Surround yourself with people who have a positive impact on your life. Learn from those who’ve come before you, taking bits and pieces, making them your own.

Get uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to be different!

Over Prepare-Follow your passion-Winners don’t just work harder than everybody else. At some point they fall in love with their craft to the point where they want to do little else, it becomes their life.

Luck favors the prepared mind-No one is perfect, especially in trading, but preparation pays. It’s essential to know more than the other players in the game. You’ve heard the saying the rich get richer, well the lucky also get luckier. To increase your luck, you must adequately prepare for the day ahead. The trader who shows up better prepared will be the one with the greatest chance of coming out ahead.

Think like a chess player-Always be thinking 2 steps ahead. Don’t think about what the market’s going to do; you have absolutely no control over that. Think about what you’re going to do if it gets there. In particular, you should spend no time at all thinking about those rosy scenarios in which the market goes your way, since in those situations, there’s nothing more for you to do. Focus instead on those things you want least to happen and on what your response will be.

Never stop learning-The worst thing we can do is to stop learning. We get settled with our lives and become complacent, stuck in our comfort zone. In order to evolve as a consistently profitable trader you must constantly be on the lookout for opportunities. I find myself always thinking about the markets and new ways to implement my ideas. Life is an iterative learning process.

Visualize-Believe in yourself-Greatness starts from within. You must believe in yourself and your ability to become successful.

Attitude influences behavior-Jesse Livermore made and lost his fortune a number of times over. Donald Trump is another example. These individuals share the same mindset; they believe that they can build back up from scratch. Their mental attitude and belief in themselves gave them the confidence to achieve greatness.

Mental practice-One reason Tiger Woods was such a great golfer is not necessarily the hours spent at the range, but time spent off the course using a combination of visualization techniques and internal biofeedback.

Envision your ideal self-Before you fall asleep each night, take moment to envision your ideal self. Close your eyes for a moment…

What does your ideal self look like?
What are you wearing?
How do you carry yourself down the street?
Approach others?
Make decisions?
What things surround you?
What people surround you?

When repeated and practiced with deep though these visualization exercises go a long way towards turning ourselves into the person and trader we want to be.

Evaluate Yourself Based on Your Goals -Don’t compare yourself to others-This principle goes far beyond trading. There is absolutely no reason to compare your situation to that of others.

What is your unfair advantage?-Everyone has something that is unique to them and no one else.a trader quoted saying if a betting game among a certain number of participants is played long enough, eventually one player will have all the money. If there is any skill involved, it will accelerate the process.

Something like this happens in the market. There is a persistent tendency for equity to flow from the many to the few. In the long run, the majority loses. To win you have to act like the MINORITY. If you bring normal human habits and tendencies to trading, you’ll gravitate toward the majority and inevitably lose.

Draw your own conclusions-“The average man doesn’t wish to be told that it is a bull or a bear market. What he desires is to be told specifically which particular stock to buy or sell. He wants to get something for nothing. He does not wish to work. He doesn’t even wish to have to think.”

Set personalized metrics-We each live in our own reality with our own beliefs. Winners compare themselves to their own goals, not to the achievements of others.

Establish a Routine -Create a solid foundation-Dedication and discipline are the foundation of success, hands down. A consistent routine develops habits that transform into subconscious behaviors.For a period of time I used to run a split sleep schedule, sleeping for a few hours waking up to trade the Euro open and then returning to bed before the NYSE open. Over time it took its toll on the body, especially with racing mountain bikes. What it did teach me however, is the importance of adhering to a routine, day in and day out.

Focus on what you CAN control-You have more power over your trade outcomes than you might think. While no one can control the market itself, you can control your actions and reactions. You can control how well you prepare and plan for the given trading day, and most importantly you can control your risk exposure associated with a position.

Schedule meditation, walks, and exercise-I’m a big believer in having balance in life. Think time is incredibly powerful. When you’re in a rhythm you feel great. Taking walks, listening to podcasts, getting outside, exercising, playing sports, sitting quietly, meditating, these are all things that help bring a healthy balance to a person’s life and have a great impact on a person’s long-term success.

Be Humble -Always question yourself-“don’t be a hero. Don’t have an ego. Always questions yourself and your ability. Don’t ever feel that you are very good. The second you do, you are dead.”

Feeling invincible is a death trap-If you’re not careful the market will take from you in an instant that which you worked longest and hardest to obtain. When you’re experiencing a string of winners and feel like you are untouchable that’s precisely when you should be the most cautious.

Use positive self talk-Studies show positive self talk has a strong impact on your actions so it’s important to talk to yourself in a positive way. Responding positively to situations helps keep a clear head and reinforces a good attitude. As I said before it is our attitudes that influence our behavior.

Give back-I’m not alone when I say that it is better to give than to receive. I’ve had the privilege to learn from some exceptionally great traders who were doing their part to give back what they had learned. I’m a strong believer in giving back anyway I can.

Action Plan for you to consider:

Commit (commit to doing what you love)
Be flexible (do not become attached to your trades)
Focus on execution (trade the right strategy for the idea)
Calculate your expectancy (the #s need to make sense)
Hold yourself accountable for your mistakes (this is the path to improvement)
Do what works for YOU (don’t be concerned with what others are doing, go against the grain)
Establish a routine (it’s always best to over prepare)
Determine your unfair advantage (we all have one, what’s yours?)
Remain humble
Visualize what you want, then make it happen!

Put some thought into these principles and incorporate them into as many aspects of your life as you can. Trading is a fantastic teacher of life’s greatest lessons. Allow the trading journey to shape you into the person you want to become.

A consistent routine develops habits that transform into subconscious behaviors.For a period of time I used to run a split sleep schedule, sleeping for a few hours waking up to trade the Euro open', 'result': {'fake': 0.0856, 'real': 0.9144}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'and then returning to bed before the NYSE open. Over time it took its toll on the body, especially with racing mountain bikes. What it did teach me however, is the importance of adhering to a routine, day in and day out.\n\nFocus on what you CAN control-You have more power over your trade outcomes than you might think. While no one can control the market itself, you can control your actions and reactions. You can control how well you prepare and plan for the given trading day, and most importantly you can control your risk exposure associated with a position.\n\nSchedule meditation, walks, and exercise-I’m a big believer in having balance in life. Think time is incredibly powerful. When you’re in a rhythm you feel great. Taking walks, listening to podcasts, getting outside, exercising, playing sports, sitting quietly, meditating, these are all things that help bring a healthy balance to a person’s life and have a great impact on a person’s long-term success.\n\nBe Humble -Always question yourself-“don’t be a hero. Don’t have an ego. Always questions yourself and your ability. Don’t ever feel that you are very good. The second you do, you are dead.”\n\nFeeling invincible is a death trap-If you’re not careful the market will take from you in an instant that which you worked longest and hardest to obtain. When you’re experiencing a string of winners and feel like you are untouchable that’s precisely when you should be the most cautious.\n\nUse positive self talk-Studies show positive self talk has a strong impact on your actions so it’s important to talk to yourself in a positive way. Responding positively to situations helps keep a clear head and reinforces a good attitude. As I said before it is our attitudes that influence our behavior.\n\nGive back-I’m not alone when I say that it is better to give than to receive. I’ve had the privilege to learn from some exceptionally great traders who were doing their part to give back what they had learned. I’m a strong believer in giving back anyway I can.\n\nAction Plan for you to consider:\n\nCommit (commit to doing what you love)\nBe flexible (do not become attached to your trades)\nFocus on execution (trade the right strategy for the idea)\nCalculate your expectancy (the #s need to make sense)\nHold yourself accountable for your mistakes (this is the path to improvement)\nDo what works for YOU (don’t be concerned with what others are doing, go against the grain)\nEstablish a routine (it’s always best to over prepare)\nDetermine your unfair advantage (we all have one, what’s yours?)\nRemain humble\nVisualize what you want, then make it happen!\n\nPut some thought into these principles and incorporate them into as many aspects of your life as you can. Trading is a fantastic teacher of life’s greatest lessons. Allow the trading journey to shape you into the person you want to become.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in your trading!', 'result': {'fake': 0.605, 'real': 0.395}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 27, 'credits': 1978635, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Flexibility -Hold no attachment to trades-Endeavour to have no emotional attachment to an idea. When a trade is wrong he will just cut it, move on and do something else.\n\nChange opinions on a dime-When people ask me for my opinion about the markets I always tell them, “what I think the market should do today may not be the same view I hold tomorrow.” As traders, it’s not our job to be right; it’s our job to make money.\n\nFocus on the here and now-Quick decisive decision making is crucial. We base our decisions on the information in front of us at the time of the trade.\n\nYou have to stop trying to will things to happen in order to prove that you’re right. Listen only to what the market is telling you NOW. Forget what you thought it was telling you five minutes ago. Remember the objective is not to prove you’re right, but to hear the cash register ring.\n\nIntuition is gained from experience-Whether you consider yourself a discretionary trader or mechanical trader there’s a level of intuition and feel that develops from observations and experience.\n\nIn addition to live trading and reviewing charts, the quickest way I’ve found for developing a sound trading intuition is to keep a log of market behavior.\n\nWrite down what is happening in the market. Then write down what you think will or should happen as a result. Once the outcome is revealed, compare your initial hypothesis. This is a great way to build a solid macro understanding and strong intuition.\n\nThe Importance of Implementation -Right strategy for the idea-With so many markets and instruments out there to trade there are many ways to express your ideas. It begins with an observation or hypothesis. Sometimes buying the underlying is the best trade. Other times, a derivative or currency makes for a better play.\n\nWhen looking to express an idea in the markets, seek out the trade with the least risk, greatest reward potential.\n\nDraw a line in the sand-Know where you are to be proven wrong before even entering a trade. Start by deciding where the market would have to go, that is at what level your idea would be invalidated. This is where you place your stop. Colm O’Shea stressed this idea in his trading.\n\nExecute consistently-Even though I place my trades manually, I try to be as mechanical as possible. This means, if I see a setup that meets my criteria, I take it. The mechanics of trading should not be left up to the judgment of the trader. To be a winner you have to be able to toe the line and pull the trigger.\n\nEmbrace uncertainty and risk-I accept that a trade will be a loser even before I enter the position. That is, I’m accepting the worse possible scenario and I’m okay with it. This keeps me focused and objective during the entire trading process.\n\nBelief is in the Numbers -Think like a “Turtle”-The turtle trader experiment resulted from a dispute between commodity speculator(this I was told by a long time friend over the idea of whether great traders were born or made). Some believe that they could teach people to become great traders and some think that genetics and aptitude were the determining factors.\n\nI suggest you recruit and train yourself to be a better trader, giving yourself actual account to trade and see if you can be correct.\n\nYou can be the one to make the most profit ever made by a trader..The rules instructed are easy to follow because sometimes they are not only very precise, but provided answers for each of the decisions they were to make while trading. This can also make it easier to trade consistently because there was a set of rules which defined exactly what should be done.\n\nIgnore individual trade outcomes-The best way to gauge our trading performance is not to look at the result from our last 1 or 2 trades; it’s to look collectively at a group of say our last 20 trades. In this way, the outcome of each individual trade is masked. This also helps dilute any “recency bias” that we may encounter and prevents past trades from influencing future decisions.\n\nCalculate your expectancy-Expectancy is simply you projected return over a longer period of time. Expressed (Avg $ W x Win %) – (Avg $ L x Loss %) – commission per trade.(Parker Joas taught me well on this and I think this is key to the whole process)\n\nHE says, “If you know that your system makes money over the long run, it is easier to take the signals and trade according to the system during periods of losses. If you are relying on your own judgment during trading, you may find that you are fearful just when you should be bold and courageous just when you should be cautious.” you can add him on Skype with the name\n\n4. Accept Mistakes -Mistakes lead to improvement-Check your ego at the door and accept that you will be wrong. Mistakes provide the path to improvement and ultimate success. Each mistake offers an opportunity to learn from the error and to modify one’s approach based on this new information.\n\nWhenever you make a significant mistake in trading, write it down, both to reinforce the lesson and to serve as a future reminder. Then change your trading process based on this new experience. In this way, mistakes can become the essential ingredient for continual improvement as a trader (or any endeavor for that matter).\n\nBe bold, embrace disagreement-Parker joas employs a culture encouraging independent thinking and innovation. he believes there must be thoughtful disagreement and non-ego impaired exploration of mistakes and weaknesses to achieve goals.\n\nImagine how much better decision making would be if people who disagree were more open to trying to get at the truth through thoughtful discourse. It is a process that produces discovery.\n\nCollaborate on ideas-Something you may not know about me is that I studied architectural design in college. One of the things I loved about design studio was the ability for collaboration. When an idea first pops into your head it seems fantastic, but as you begin to discuss your idea with others, questions arise that you may not have thought about at first. Thinking through all these facets leads to the development of a structurally sound idea.\n\nSeek out opposing views-The better we understand the opposition, the better we can understand who is on the other side of our trades and how they might react.\n\nThe great thing about being a trader is that you can always do a much better job, no matter how successful you are. Most people are busy trying to cover up their mistakes. As a trader, you are forced to confront your mistakes because the numbers don’t lie.\n\nFind what works for YOU-Do as others do NOT-In order to achieve greatness we must get uncomfortable. As a trader, you can’t be afraid of going against the grain.\n\nIf you do the same as others do, you can expect to be average. Going against the grain is tough. There can be a lot of social pressures and questioning from family and friends. In order to live your life the way YOU want, you need to put yourself in opportunistic situations. Surround yourself with the people you want to be like who share your same moral beliefs.\n\nThink about the opposite-Look at things from all angles and think about the opposite action. When a lawyer prepares a case they will often prepare the opposing arguments first. In this way they know what to expect and have all their bases covered. In trading, think about who is on the other side of your trades and if you were that person, how you would react.\n\nJust because everyone is buying gold, doesn’t mean you should too. The media and the talking heads are often on the wrong side of the trade.\n\nLearn by doing-There’s no substitute for experience. Go out and try something. If it doesn’t work for you, learn from it and move on.\n\nIsolate yourself from negativity-Surround yourself with people who have a positive impact on your life. Learn from those who’ve come before you, taking bits and pieces, making them your own.\n\nGet uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to be different!\n\nOver Prepare-Follow your passion-Winners don’t just work harder than everybody else. At some point they fall in love with their craft to the point where they want to do little else, it becomes their life.\n\nLuck favors the prepared mind-No one is perfect, especially in trading, but preparation pays. It’s essential to know more than the other players in the game. You’ve heard the saying the rich get richer, well the lucky also get luckier. To increase your luck, you must adequately prepare for the day ahead. The trader who shows up better prepared will be the one with the greatest chance of coming out ahead.\n\nThink like a chess player-Always be thinking 2 steps ahead. Don’t think about what the market’s going to do; you have absolutely no control over that. Think about what you’re going to do if it gets there. In particular, you should spend no time at all thinking about those rosy scenarios in which the market goes your way, since in those situations, there’s nothing more for you to do. Focus instead on those things you want least to happen and on what your response will be.\n\nNever stop learning-The worst thing we can do is to stop learning. We get settled with our lives and become complacent, stuck in our comfort zone. In order to evolve as a consistently profitable trader you must constantly be on the lookout for opportunities. I find myself always thinking about the markets and new ways to implement my ideas. Life is an iterative learning process.\n\nVisualize-Believe in yourself-Greatness starts from within. You must believe in yourself and your ability to become successful.\n\nAttitude influences behavior-Jesse Livermore made and lost his fortune a number of times over. Donald Trump is another example. These individuals share the same mindset; they believe that they can build back up from scratch. Their mental attitude and belief in themselves gave them the confidence to achieve greatness.\n\nMental practice-One reason Tiger Woods was such a great golfer is not necessarily the hours spent at the range, but time spent off the course using a combination of visualization techniques and internal biofeedback.\n\nEnvision your ideal self-Before you fall asleep each night, take moment to envision your ideal self. Close your eyes for a moment…\n\nWhat does your ideal self look like?\nWhat are you wearing?\nHow do you carry yourself down the street?\nApproach others?\nMake decisions?\nWhat things surround you?\nWhat people surround you?\n\nWhen repeated and practiced with deep though these visualization exercises go a long way towards turning ourselves into the person and trader we want to be.\n\nEvaluate Yourself Based on Your Goals -Don’t compare yourself to others-This principle goes far beyond trading. There is absolutely no reason to compare your situation to that of others.\n\nWhat is your unfair advantage?-Everyone has something that is unique to them and no one else.a trader quoted saying if a betting game among a certain number of participants is played long enough, eventually one player will have all the money. If there is any skill involved, it will accelerate the process.\n\nSomething like this happens in the market. There is a persistent tendency for equity to flow from the many to the few. In the long run, the majority loses. To win you have to act like the MINORITY. If you bring normal human habits and tendencies to trading, you’ll gravitate toward the majority and inevitably lose.\n\nDraw your own conclusions-“The average man doesn’t wish to be told that it is a bull or a bear market. What he desires is to be told specifically which particular stock to buy or sell. He wants to get something for nothing. He does not wish to work. He doesn’t even wish to have to think.”\n\nSet personalized metrics-We each live in our own reality with our own beliefs. Winners compare themselves to their own goals, not to the achievements of others.\n\nEstablish a Routine -Create a solid foundation-Dedication and discipline are the foundation of success, hands down. A consistent routine develops habits that transform into subconscious behaviors.For a period of time I used to run a split sleep schedule, sleeping for a few hours waking up to trade the Euro open and then returning to bed before the NYSE open.

Indrazith Shantharaj,1y,What is the hard part about being a full-time day trader?,"I quit my well-paid IT job in 2016 to pursue full-time trading.

When I was working in IT, I had a cab mate who was also a senior manager.

We constantly debated full-time trading vs. part-time trading.

He always thought that quitting an excellent job for trading was not necessary. But I always debated that full-time trading is required to make good progress in trading (please note that algo trading was not there during those years, and even semi-algo platforms like Sensibul were not popular).

If he were not there around me, I would have quit my job immediately to take up full-time trading. But to respect his suggestion, I took two breaks from my work and realized many vital lessons in the break.

I have faced many challenging situations in the last 6 years of my full-time trading career, and below are some of the difficult situations:

Difficult to face market ups and downs

The hard part about being a full-time day trader is the psychological challenge of dealing with market ups and downs.

It's tough to remain calm and objective when you're watching your portfolio go up or down, especially when it seems like there's no rhyme or reason to the movement. It can be tempting to try to outsmart the market or make rash decisions in an attempt to recover your losses, but this is usually a recipe for disaster.

The best traders can stay disciplined and stick to their trading plan even when things aren't going their way. They understand that there will be good days and bad days and that the key is to have a solid strategy in place so they can make money in the long run.

Discipline required to trade every day

For many people, the hard part about being a full-time day trader is having the discipline to wake up every day and work. Trading is not a job where you can just show up when you feel like it and expect to do well.

In order to be successful as a day trader, you need to be laser-focused and disciplined. That means setting aside time each morning to analyze the markets and make trades only when you have a clear idea.

Many full-time traders feel lazy, and they just do time pass and don't set serious goals. So internal motivation should be required to succeed as a full-time trader.

Family & friends think that you are always free

The hard part about being a full-time day trader is that your family and friends often think you're always available and free. The fact is, most successful day traders have a strict routine and stick to it religiously. This includes trading for a specific number of hours each day and then taking the rest of the day off to spend with their loved ones.

If you want to be successful as a day trader, it's crucial to maintain a healthy work/life balance. You need to set some clear boundaries and stick to them, even when your family and friends don't fully understand what you're doing. Remember, they're not the ones who have to live with the consequences if you don't make money trading.

Adoptability is required in different market conditions

The hard part about being a full-time day trader is that you need to be able to adapt to the market conditions quickly. For example, suppose the market is moving slowly. In that case, you'll need to find ways to be more efficient with your time, and if the market is moving quickly, then you'll need to find ways to trade more conservatively.

In addition, it's crucial to stay disciplined and not overtrade. Overtrading can lead to losses, so it's essential to have a solid trading plan in place and stick to it. Finally, it's also important to understand the markets and keep up with current news and events that could impact trading decisions.

People assume you print money everyday and hence they ask loan shamelessely

The hard part about being a full-time day trader is that people always assume you make a lot of money and hence ask for a hand loan. Most people don't realize how much work and dedication it takes to succeed as a full-time day trader. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme by any means.

There are many ups and downs, and it's not easy to make consistent profits in this business. The key is to have a solid trading plan, stay disciplined, and cut losses quickly when things go wrong.

Unexpected Issues

If you're a full-time trader, your livelihood depends on your ability to make timely and accurate trades. So any issue with your broker or trading software can be disastrous.

For example, suppose your broker goes down for an extended period of time. In that case, you could miss out on essential opportunities and lose money. Or, if your trading software has a glitch that causes you to make bad trades, you could lose a lot of money in a very short period of time.

These are just some examples of the types of things that can go wrong when you're a full-time day trader.

In that case, you'll need to find ways to be more efficient with your time, and if the market is moving quickly, then you'll need to find ways to trade more conservatively.\n\nIn addition, it's crucial to stay disciplined and not overtrade. Overtrading can lead to losses, so it's essential to have a solid trading plan in place and stick to it. Finally, it's also important to understand the markets and keep up with current news and events that could impact trading decisions.\n\nPeople assume you print money everyday and hence they ask loan shamelessely\n\nThe hard part about being a full-time day trader is that people always assume you make a lot of money and hence ask for a hand loan. Most people don't realize how much work and dedication it takes to succeed as a full-time day trader. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme by any means.\n\nThere are many ups and downs, and it's not easy to make consistent profits in this business. The key is to have a solid trading plan, stay disciplined, and cut losses quickly when things go wrong.\n\nUnexpected Issues\n\nIf you're a full-time trader, your livelihood depends on your ability to make timely and accurate trades. So any issue with your broker or trading software can be disastrous.\n\nFor example, suppose your broker goes down for an extended period of time. In that case, you could miss out on essential opportunities and lose money. Or, if your trading software has a glitch that causes you to make bad trades, you could lose a lot of money in a very short period of time.\n\nThese are just some examples of the types of things that can go wrong when you're a full-time day trader.\n\nI hope this information helps!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0008
Tom Groves,8y,What is a Wall Street interview like?,"When I started my internship at Lehman Brothers in the summer of 2004 I was warned that in addition to any formal interviews I had while I was there I should treat every interaction with anyone who worked for the firm as an interview.

I was also told ""don't do anything that draws a lot of attention to yourself. Every year there's a guy who gets involved in some kind of eating contest, ends up throwing up on the trading floor and doesn't get hired. Don't be that guy. Don't be the guy everyone is talking about"".

Unfortunately, I had a line on my resume that tended to draw a lot of attention on a trading floor. And when you're interning at a Wall St firm your resume is everywhere. That line was ""Former world record holder for memorizing a shuffled deck of playing cards"".

Each intern was allocated to a particular trading desk for the summer but to gain more exposure to other areas of the firm, and so other employees could meet and interview them, each Wednesday the interns were sent off to different groups where they would be grilled by three (or more) of the traders & salespeople there. Over the course of the summer, this adds up to a lot of interviews, and as it turns out a lot of opportunities to draw attention to yourself.

So the first Wednesday I went off as scheduled to meet the people on the Convertibles trading desk. I found the person I was supposed to meet and sat down. He looked at me, pulled a pack of cards from his desk and said

""I understand you think you can memorize these?""
""That's right""
""Well we thought you could start by showing us""

I'm aware at this point that maybe half a dozen people are starring at me.

""Well sure, I'd be happy to. Maybe at the end of the day after we've...""
""Dude, I'm not speaking another word to you until you've memorized the cards""

So my first ""interview"" involved memorizing a pack of cards. In front of about 30 people on the trading floor, in the middle of the trading day. As a way to not attract attention to yourself, this is about the worst thing you can possibly do (with the exception, perhaps, of the intern who got involved in a chicken wing eating contest and ended up throwing up on the trading floor. He, briefly, was more famous than me that summer).

The following week I went along to the credit trading desk hoping to have a slightly lower profile. No chance. They had about 60 people waiting around for me to demonstrate the ""card trick"" they'd heard so much about. I'm pretty sure there was a decent amount of money wagered on whether or not I could do it.

And so it went on. Every week my ""interviews"" would consist of me stopping all work on the floor for a few minutes to be a performing monkey. Those were some nerve-wracking minutes. Memorizing a deck of cards isn't terribly difficult (when you know how), but doing so in those circumstances, knowing that making a mistake might cost you a job offer puts a lot of pressure on. But I got through it.

And in fact I was the lucky one. I was being asked to do something I knew I could do, I knew the person asking me couldn't do, and I knew that most people watching (the trading floor has a lot of similar personalities) would be impressed by. Other interns that summer would get to their interviews to be faced with questions like ""can you prove the Black-Scholes formula for me?"" (These were not quant people, so the answer was no). Or even worse...

""We just had a guy here who could memorize a pack of cards. Can you do that?""
""No""
""Jeez, that's not very impressive is it? Ok then, how about you make up for it by proving Black-Scholes for me...""
""Ermm....""

I had the easiest interview process of anyone, and all because of that line on my resume. So here's my advice. If you possibly can, think of some skill that might impress the type of person who works on Wall St, put it on your resume, and be REALLY prepared to demonstrate that skill when asked.

Greg Thompson,Updated 1y,Which online broker should I use in Germany?,"Investors most commonly buy and trade stock through brokers.

Pramod Kumar,6y,What was your first stock market mistake?,"A trader makes mistakes everyday.

Not waiting in profit, waiting too long in profit, waiting endlessly in a losing trade and hoping that somehow the trade will work out are some of the mistakes we all make.

We learn from these mistakes and refine our trading methods.

But humans are fallible. We make mistakes again.

Markets punish us for these mistakes, we take it on the chin and move on.

Chastised and somewhat wiser, we again enter the market with new trades and new hopes and life goes on.

Profitably for some, loss making for the majority.

I might have made thousands of mistakes in my years of trading. It is not possible to recall what was the first mistake.

Probably getting into the markets was the first mistake. If you do not agree, confirm it from the spouses of most traders.

Jokes apart, the trading mistake which makes one learn some important lesson is the one which is remembered forever.

My such mistake was:

Two Cups of Tea for Rs. 30000:

The apparently refreshing cups of tea cost me Rs. 30000 and taught me a valuable lesson.

The day was June 09, 2000.

Weekly settlement on BSE used to be on Fridays and this day was a Friday.

A day earlier I had bought 500 shares of WIPRO for 2380 and it had closed at 2442. I expected to make a good profit on Friday and planned to collect the cheque for profit from the broker at the close of market.

It opened at 2498. Touched 2500 and stayed thereabouts. I was happy calculating notional profit of Rs. 60000 or so.

A friend came to visit. We went out for a cup of tea. It must have taken some 15–20 minutes. The friend bid good bye and went on his way.

I came back to broker’s terminal.

The profit had also bid good bye and gone away.

The price was around 2480 when we thought of taking tea. Now it was 2370 and falling. There was nothing much to do. I closed out at 2360. Sold another 500 shares at 2360 . It started recovering and I bought back at 2400.

Forget about the notional profits, I had messed up and had an actual loss of Rs. 30000.

The closing bell rang and brought an end to the agony and ecstasy of the day.

I later reflected on what had happened and learnt two important lessons:

(a) Treat your trading as a serious business activity. There is a time for markets and there is a time for socializing. Never mix them up.

A stop loss would have protected the profit, but I was blissfully ignorant about it.

(b) Never Trade Without A Stop Loss.

A look at the price movement of WIPRO on that fateful day, June 09, 2000:

What Else This Mistake Taught:

There is a reason other than the unfortunate cup of tea for remembering this trade. I had planned to buy a gift from the profits of this trade for my wife whose birthday is June 10. The fall in price hurt that plan too.

Markets are volatile. Plan your trade accordingly.

Do not plan to spend the profit before you actually earn it.

As Aesop’s fables tell us:

That was my first big mistake. I have made many more since then.

Every mistake hurts. The hurt makes you learn.

Life is a learning process.

Keep learning. Keep improving.

Thanks for reading.

Raghav,Updated 7y,What are some of the mind blowing facts about stock markets?,"Domino’s Pizza saw their stock increase by 233% within a year after changing their pizza recipe.
In 1997, Michael Dells was asked at a technology conference what advice he would give Steve Jobs who was just about to return to Apple. He replied, “What would I do? Shut the company down and give the money back to shareholders.” Jobs responded by saying, “F**k Michael Dell.”
The next trillion dollar company may happen in the next few years. The top contenders are Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google.
Roland Wayne co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. His stake – which he sold in 1976 for $800 – would be worth $35 billion today.
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in India has the highest number of listed companies in the world with an estimated 5,689 companies. National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India has around 1,750 companies.
The oldest stock exchange in the world is Amsterdam Stock Exchange, which was established in 1602 by Dutch East India Company dealing with the printed stocks and bonds
The terms “Bear” and “Bull” are thought to be originated from the way of attacking by each animal, with the bull thrusting its horn up in the air, while a bear swiping downwards.

Bikrant Sarmah,3y,What are the dark secrets of stock markets that are unknown to ordinary traders?,"A telecom company which used to trade at 3 digits, used to be part of NIFTY 50 is now trading a single digit and now on the verge on bankruptcy. Company also filled the biggest loss in Indian corporate history.

But an ace investor believes company can turn around from here. It can’t go worse than this. Buys huge quantity at Rs 3.XX. Stock moves up from these levels. Few months later a speculative news pops up that an international well reputed firm is planning to buy a stake in that company. Suddenly stock moves up to 7.8 many retailers jumps to buy the stock. The ace investor generated almost 100% returns in a matter of few months at a time when markets are trading at three year lows and many investors lost huge portion of their wealth. And yes, company later clarified that it’s just a speculative news.

Whether such news are intentionally popped up for big players to take entry/exit I leave it upto you to decide.

Another NBFC which is as of now bankrupt, but earlier was a favorite stock among investors. One day stock almost fell 50% from its peak.

Pramod Kumar,Updated 6y,What are the biggest mistakes a trader should avoid in stock trading?,"Biggest Mistakes? :

Well, mistakes are made.

It should have been singular. Mistake.

You can not be making many mistakes and all of them biggest.

Biggest Mistake:

A trader makes mistakes almost in every trade. How do we say that one particular mistake is the biggest ?

It is indeed difficult to identify a single one.

I would settle for 3 mistakes and express my views for whatever they are worth.

I have made these mistakes at some point of time and suffered for it. Other traders too may be doing the same knowingly or unknowingly.

Mistake 1:

Real Example:

Reliance Infra was trading at around Rs. 453–454 on December 23, 2015.

My brother in law decided to buy 500 shares. I had recently resigned from a job with this company was not in favor of buying decision. For me everything about the company sucked. As if my leaving will cause the stock price to crash.

But he was very firm in his decision and placed a LIMIT order for buying at Rs. 452.

The price kept moving for a very long time between 455–453 range and I advised him to buy at MARKET price, not the LIMIT.

He did not change the order.

The stock was not bought.

It closed at 461 on that day, went up to 491 next day and on December 31, 2015 closed at 543.95.

An opportunity missed because of being adamant about limit order.

Every trader does it.

Why is this a mistake? :

Just consider this.

You are buying because you expect the price to go up.

Then why you are placing the order below the current price.

Are you not being too greedy?

You want the price to go up. But before that you want it to come down to meet your requirement . It should move up only after you have bought at a lower price.

Why should market oblige you twice?

It is difficult to get one move in your favour, you are asking for two.

This is what generally happens with such orders:

The order will not be completed like in this case and you miss out on a good trade.

You will get the stock at 452 and it will continue to go down further. Yes, the market obliged you once and did not reverse the direction after that.

Avoid this mistake.

Once you are committed to a trade, go ahead with a MARKET order.

Mistake 2:

Most traders have no idea about a STOP LOSS.

They have heard of it but do not know what to do about it.

Sure, we are here to make profits. Why we should be talking of booking losses?

See these Trapeze Artists:

Can they succeed without the safety net?

Trading is like a trapeze act. Stop Loss is the safety net.

In case of a fall, it will protect you from fatality and broken bones.

Meaning a total capital wipe out or a huge loss.

With manageable losses one can get into next trade with a positive feeling.

Never ever trade without a stop loss.

One of my experiences of trading without stop loss is narrated here:

Pramod Kumar's answer to What was your first stock market mistake?

Mistake 3:

I know I am courting controversy here but I am having a very firm view on this issue.

The advice given to traders by almost everyone is:

Trade with the money you can afford to lose.

I beg to differ.

Rather, I strongly disagree.

If you even have a slightest thought that you can afford to lose some money, believe me, you will certainly lose it.

Do not make the mistake of considering some loss as affordable.

Money is precious.

Money is important.

We work hard for it.

Why should I be even thinking of losing it and considering the loss affordable?

Every loss is bad.

It should give me pain.

I should work and refine my trades to eradicate this pain of losing money.

I trade with the money I can not afford to lose.

But all the money is not put in one trade. I plan to have winning trades but plan to manage the losing ones also.

Loss in one trade or a month does not rattle me. There are more trades to make and eventually right trades will bring in the profit.

Every loss should be taken as a lesson to improve my trading and money management and not shrugged off as something I could afford.

Summary:

Do not expect the markets to oblige you more than once. Place MARKET orders.

Do not trade without a STOP LOSS. It is dangerous.

Do not treat losses as AFFORDABLE. Learn a lesson from every loss. Learn to respect the MONEY.

These were my views on the biggest mistake a trader should avoid in trading.

Mark Daviis,Updated 2y,If you were to invest your money in the stock market would you advise long-term or short-term holdings?,"When it comes to investing, it is important to find the right balance for you and your individual situation. Before you start investing, whether it be short or long-term investing, you should have clear goals in mind.

Investing isn't typically a get rich quick tactic that you can do for a short period of time and expect to make a significant amount of money. It's often a long-term process that requires patience, commitment, and keeping calm when the market fluctuates, as it inevitably will.

You may have heard of long-term investments and short-term investments, but are unsure of what they mean, what the difference is, or what investment strategy is best for you. A long-term investment usually offers a higher probability of maximizing your return over a 10-year period, rather than bringing you a high return in just a few years. Examples of long-term investment vehicles include stocks and index funds.

A short-term investment is an investment you expect to hold for 3 years or less, then sell and/or convert to cash. Examples of short-term investments include money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-term bonds. While many people like to play the market or speculate with day trading, it's a risky business and you should educate yourself and do plenty of research before you try short-term investing. For most people, it is easier and safer to plan on long-term investments.

Long-term investments are investment that you can expect to pay off after holding them for a period of several years. When investing long-term, you can be more aggressive because you have a longer time horizon, so you could opt to invest in an aggressive mutual fund to get the highest rate of return.

You can approach long-term investing by determining the rate of return you want, then looking for a mutual fund that averages that rate of return over a five to 10-year period. When you invest for the long-term you must not panic when a stock's value drops and avoid selling just because the market looks bad.

The market is cyclical and always recovers from drops, although it may take time to do so. However, if you pull out when prices are low, you may lose a portion of the money you initially invested. It helps if you avoid watching your portfolio often, and if there's a dip in the market, sit tight and don't pull out your money. Let the stock prices recover over time.

When you decide how much risk you can bear, keep in mind that the longer you have to invest your money the bigger the risks you can take. If you need the money in the next few years, take a more financially conservative approach to your investments and opt to invest in a more secure type of investment. Another factor in choosing the type of investment may be what you are planning on using the money for. This may determine how much risk you feel comfortable with while investing.

Anurag R Nair,7y,How do I understand BSE and start trading?,"GO THROUGH PART 1 OF STOCKS DECODED FOR REFERENCE LINK: Anurag R Nair's answer to What are basic world and historic facts every person should know?

STOCKS DECODED PART 2-

What is Stock Exchange(SE)?

Stock Exchange is an exchange where traders can buy and/or sell stocks(aka shares),bonds and other securities.

Bombay Stock Exchange(BSE)- is an Indian SE located at Mumbai . Established in 1875, the BSE is Asia’s first stock exchange and it’s the world's 11th largest stock exchange with an overall market capitalization of $1.7 trillion as of January 23, 2015. More than 5500 companies are publicly listed on the BSE.

How are these 5500+ companies divided?

Companies are divided into various indices (Sensex being one of the indexes as mentioned in part 1 of my answer)

Various indices are calculated based on

1)Market capitalization which includes

BSE Sensex Index,BSE Mid-Cap Index,BSE Small-Cap Index,BSE-200 Index,Dollex-30 and many more.

The stocks in BSE Sensex approximately account for one-fifth of the capitalization of the exchange.

2)Type of industries which includes-

BSE Auto Index,BSE BANKEX,BSE Healthcare Index,BSE IT Index,BSE Oil and Gas Index,BSE IT Index,BSE Metal Index,BSE Power Index,BSE Healthcare Index,BSE FMCG Index,BSE Consumer Durables Index.

If a company like MARUTI is there in BSE Sensex Index then it can’t be there in BSE Auto Index.

So Conclusion—

BSE and Sensex are different, one is the stock exchange and another one is the Index which comes under BSE which includes various other indices.

Now coming to how Sensex is computed-

Sensex includes top 30 companies as per the market capitalization which is listed on BSE.

Calculation part for Sensex Index is explained in STOCKS DECODED PART 1 ,but these list of 30 companies gets revised in every quarter, i.e 3 months.

Suppose Co 1 to Co 30 are there in the decreasing order of Total free floating capitalization(TFFC). Now suppose cumulative Total free floating capitalization of these 30 Companies =Rs 1,00,00,000(1 crore) at the end of first quarter of 2016 and Sensex Index=25000 at the same time.

And suppose TFFC of Co 30=Rs 1,00,000(1 lakh) at the end of 1st quarter .

Now Co 31 did well in the 1st quarter with a Total free floating capitalization=Rs 2,00,000 which is greater than the TFFC of company 30 but less than that of Co 29 .

So now Co 31 enters into the top 30 companies of BSE(which we call new Top 30) and Co 30 goes out.

But now the cumulative TFFC of the new Top 30 = (Rs 1,00,00,000-Rs 1,00,000+Rs 2,00,000)= Rs 1,01,00,000(1 crore 1 lakh).

Now on the first day of 2nd quarter 0f, 2016 Sensex will indicate some different value.

What will be the new value?

For a TFFC of Rs 1,00,00,000 Sensex Index= 25000

So for a TFFC of Rs1,01,00,000 Sensex Index=25250 (Ratio Proportion)

Conclusion- Top 30 companies are not fixed and similar calculation is done after every quarterly report when there is a chance for”n” number of companies to get into top 30 list

Ross.Lederhman,3y,How do I deal with a bad trading week?,"I generally never experienced a really bad trading day or week in over 20 years.

A day or a week mean nothing in terms of investment horizon.

I always make sure that I don't go in naked unless I empirically know that the odds for an off day are so low, they are worth taking.

I have moments where a single trade can hit a loss of a quarter of a million, but that is an unrealized loss on 1 trade. Most likely I will have this trade hedged.

For example, when Corona happened, my generic stocks dropped (as they did with everyone else). So my year to date return dropped. Why did I not sell?

Because timing is a bitch. The statistical odds of you timing anything correct are very small. I had no idea how long this corona session would take, but I did know panic would increase, and I also knew others would sell.

Panic, emotions, pandemic, economy in tatters. That is awesome. That provides opportunity.

I instinctively realized that with China blocking air travel, Europe was going to be next. And at that point, it was waiting for the US to do the same. This would allow for shorting airlines.

But not just airlines, no, the entire production chain of airlines.

So I shorted Boeing, Lufthansa, and Spirit Aerosystems (and a few more). The entire flow from producer for a airplane manufacturer, to airplane manufacturer and airline itself.

When the US had not yet announced that they would ban UK from traveling, I dosed up my leverage.

Donald Trump kept the UK out of that due to some BS sense of comradery. And, et voila, the waiting was over, the US also added the UK to this ban list for flying…

US Travel Ban Extends to UK, Ireland

and my shorts were literally taking off…

On top of that, due to increase in volatility, I went long a market maker, flowtraders. Flowtraders only makes money when idiots are fucking around on the stock market (so no positional drive).

Having been able to short airlines, long marketmakers easily made up for lack of portfolio gains during corona times. The profit was that excessive I exited when Corona slowed down over the summer (before the second wave came).

This wasn't a difficult strategy.

I didn't need to do a lot of maths, or tricky option models.

The gain out of all this, allowed for purchasing some of my stocks at a lower level. And the rest just allowed for increase of reserves.

There is always an opportunity.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7lg8wrfxazijsv5o', 'title': 'How do I deal with a bad trading week?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I generally never experienced a really bad trading day or week in over 20 years.\n\nA day or a week mean nothing in terms of investment horizon.\n\nI always make sure that I don't go in naked unless I empirically know that the odds for an off day are so low, they are worth taking.\n\nI have moments where a single trade can hit a loss of a quarter of a million, but that is an unrealized loss on 1 trade.

Don Stuart,Updated 1y,What made people suddenly decide to sell their stocks on the same morning in late October 1929?,"It wasn’t sudden.

The Dow peaked Sept. 3, 1929, a month after the Reserve Bank of New York announced it was jacking interest rates from 5% to 6%.

We take credit for granted now, but in the Roaring ‘20s credit to consumers was a brand new thing. Guess what? People took to it like Peruvian Flake.

A figurative representation.

General Motors was built upon GMAC, the new credit arm facilitated by J.P. Morgan Jr. in 1919 that allowed buyers to “finance” a new car with a payment plan — for the first time. People soon after could borrow similarly to buy all sorts of durable goods. Eventually even stock in the makers and sellers of those goods.

So they did. The Dow rose 400% from 1921 to 1929, fueled by credit-driven consumer spending, increased manufacturing to meet demand, and speculative “investing” by people following the “smart money.”

Here’s a glimpse of the landscape courtesy of the FDIC (which didn’t exist then):

The Roaring '20s

Exposed to mass marketing and “easy payment plans,” people buy in record numbers everything from houses to cars to appliances and furniture.
Assembly lines increase production.
Department stores give credit cards to their wealthier customers. Metal charge-plates are introduced. Oil companies offer courtesy cards for charging gas.
Banks offer installment loans, mortgages, and loans to stock market speculators on 90 percent margins.
There are no insider-trading laws.
The dramatic expansion in the financial sector introduces new corporate securities issues, especially in common and preferred stock. The stock market undergoes an extraordinary, unprecedented expansion and is caught in a speculative euphoria between 1925 and 1929.
Banks unveil new securities affiliates with names almost identical to their own to wipe away the distinction between saving and speculating.
First National City Bank (Citibank) and its stock subsidiary, the National City Company, have 2,000 brokers selling stocks.
National City Company repackages bad Latin American loans from its affiliated bank and sells them to unknowing investors as new securities. This is one of the deals that initiate the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
Banks speculate on land development.
The financial environment creates new products like the unit trust (known today as the mutual fund) and compound-interest savings accounts.

Especially popular was borrowing to buy stocks on margin. Except few folk expected to face a “margin call.” That comes into play if your margin value falls too low, like um, if your stock prices go down. You gotta put up more collateral out-of-pocket, or else the broker sells off your stock regardless of market price.

Anyway, the Dow had already sunk 21% from its September peak by Black Thursday, which was initially just a nasty margin-reckoning session. Morgan and other big bankers bought stocks and propped prices back up, Friday was okay but after considering the Sunday papers the bears came running Monday morning. The bankers mostly surrendered and the market tanked by 13%. On Black Tuesday the panic was full blown — down another 12% in a day.

There had been political commentary about the market’s “speculative orgy” in September and October. The London Exchange had foundered amid scandal in late September, driving overseas investors and lenders to pull out of the US. And the “smart money” began shorting stocks — that’s leveraged betting that a stock price will fall.

Erosion of confidence was gaining momentum for six weeks ahead of the Crash, and began months earlier as new President Hoover urged the Fed and the press to throttle speculation, a massive tariff bill was working through Congress and consumer demand was lagging manufacturer oversupply.

Meanwhile a long recession in rural America was turning toxic. In four years 5,000 banks had folded as farmers couldn’t meet their loans and small-town folk defaulted on those “easy payment plans.”

Risk of panic was exacerbated by a long history of bank runs and failures in the US. Banks, you see, were also speculating with depositors’ money. And lending to help people play the market, driving up the value of the bankers’ own plays. By 1929, two out of every five dollars a bank loaned were used to purchase stocks.

While just 10% of Americans owned shares of stock at peak irrational exuberance, over 60% of families struggled below the poverty line. Then came the Great Depression as the economy and banking system gradually collapsed.

That’s become the conventional story. If you want to drill into what was probably the market’s tipping point, it was this:

The meltdown of highly leveraged, overvalued utilities stocks in mid-October due to looming investigation of rate-scalping. Electrification in the 1920’s was like the Internet of the 1990’s, only with wider economic implications and larger infrastructure costs.

Yup. A tech bubble.

There’s a deeper academic analysis below, from which I’ll share this tidbit:

Stocks lost nearly $16 billion in the month of October . . . Twenty-nine public utilities (tabulated by the New York Times) lost $5.1 billion in the month, by far the largest loss of any of the industries listed by the Times.

The 1929 Stock Market Crash
Harold Bierman, Jr., Cornell University Overview The 1929 stock market crash is conventionally said to have occurred on Thursday the 24 th and Tuesday the 29 th of October. These two dates have been dubbed “Black Thursday” and “Black Tuesday,” respectively. On September 3, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record high of 381.2. At the end of the market day on Thursday, October 24, the market was at 299.5 — a 21 percent decline from the high. On this day the market fell 33 points — a drop of 9 percent — on trading that was approximately three times the normal daily volume for the first nine months of the year. By all accounts, there was a selling panic. By November 13, 1929, the market had fallen to 199. By the time the crash was completed in 1932, following an unprecedentedly large economic depression, stocks had lost nearly 90 percent of their value. The events of Black Thursday are normally defined to be the start of the stock market crash of 1929-1932, but the series of events leading to the crash started before that date. This article examines the causes of the 1929 stock market crash. While no consensus exists about its precise causes, the article will critique some arguments and support a preferred set of conclusions. It argues that one of the primary causes was the attempt by important people and the media to stop market speculators. A second probable cause was the great expansion of investment trusts, public utility holding companies, and the amount of margin buying, all of which fueled the purchase of public utility stocks, and drove up their prices. Public utilities, utility holding companies, and investment trusts were all highly levered using large amounts of debt and preferred stock. These factors seem to have set the stage for the triggering event. This sector was vulnerable to the arrival of bad news regarding utility regulation. In October 1929, the bad news arrived and utility stocks fell dramatically. After the utilities decreased in price, margin buyers had to sell and there was then panic selling of all stocks. The Conventional View The crash helped bring on the depression of the thirties and the depression helped to extend the period of low stock prices, thus “proving” to many that the prices had been too high. Laying the blame for the “boom” on speculators was common in 1929. Thus, immediately upon learning of the crash of October 24 John Maynard Keynes (Moggridge, 1981, p. 2 of Vol. XX) wrote in the New York Evening Post (25 October 1929) that “The extraordinary speculation on Wall Street in past months has driven up the rate of interest to an unprecedented level.” And the Economist when stock prices reached their low for the year repeated the theme that the U.S. stock market had been too high (November 2, 1929, p. 806): “there is warrant for hoping that the deflation of the exaggerated balloon of American stock values will be for the good of the world.” The key phrases in these quotations are “exaggerated ba

Penny Stocks,4y,How do normal day traders manage to profit 200-300% annually and hedge funds are able to return only 20-40%?,"Some hedge funds have been able to make substantial gains while keeping their risk in check. Most of them fall into the category of quantitative hedge funds, which use complicated mathematical algorithms and high-speed computers to execute trades.

Renaissance Capital, one of the most popular quant funds, manages an employee-only strategy called the Medallion Fund. This fund has returned 40% per year since 1998 with a Sharpe Ratio of 2. Those are extremely high returns for the risk taken. $10,000 invested at inception would now be worth more than $8M.

Hedge funds manage much larger sums of money than your average day trader. It’s more difficult for the hedge fund to put the money to work. Your average day trader can move in/out of the market with very little consequence, however when a hedge fund is moving millions of dollars in/out it takes longer and has adverse effects (slippage etc.). It’s much easier to make a large return on a small sum of money. Getting this money in and out of the market the same way a day trader would is impossible.

Risk - Hedge funds have outside investors who they are answerable to. This means that the risk assumed to make these returns is lower than the risk assumed by day traders. Investors hate volatility, steady returns is the name of the game. This leads to higher investment and therefore higher fees. Leverage. Brokers offer day traders huge leverage. This is often many times the leverage offered by the exchanges and because day traders (mostly) don’t hold positions over night, they are considered less risky. If couples slightly with the first point, it’s easier to make a large return on a small sum. If someone else is leveraging your money, then returns are easier to achieve. This is obviously a double edges sword, as losses are also magnified. The question isn’t day traders versus hedge funds, its type of strategy. You can find strategies with Sharpe ratios from 0.5 to 1 that have huge capacity, consistent parameters and inexpensive infrastructure. You can find strategies with Sharpe ratios above 3 with limited and inconsistent capacity, unpredictable parameters and expensive infrastructure.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wc9g1qrhnuxp8ds3', 'title': 'How do normal day traders manage to profit 200-300% annually and hedge funds are able to return only 20-40%?', 'score': {'original': 0.9815, 'ai': 0.0185}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Some hedge funds have been able to make substantial gains while keeping their risk in check.

Indrazith Shantharaj,2y,How can I learn technical analysis specially for intraday trading?,"I have studied high school (8th to 10th std) in a small remote village called Malladihalli.

It was a tiny village in one of the most backward districts in Karnataka. But it had many educational institutes, and it helped a lot of families get a good education at a very low price.

One person started all these things. His name is Malladihalli Raghavendra Swamiji, who taught yoga to Sadghuru.

One of my classmates/hostel mate/roommate from high school was troubling me to teach intraday trading to him.

He used to call me 1-2 times a month and pleaded with me to teach intraday trading.

But the problem is his personality and mindset are not suited for intraday trading.

He gets excited soon, he will lose his temper quickly and doesn't have analytical skills.

But he is a good person by heart and also works as a school teacher. So, I didn't want him to lose money by jumping into intraday trading.

But he is not in a mood or situation to listen to my advice. I had to do something. Otherwise, our friendship was at stake.

So I made a plan.

I asked him to come to Bangalore for 2-3 days (he stays in a small village near western ghats) and observe my intraday trading activities. If he still prefers to learn intraday trading after 2-3 days of observation, I am happy to teach him.

He came to my house on a Sunday. I took him to pyramid valley (a beautiful place for meditation in the outskirts of Bangalore), and we had some fun.

The next day, we were ready before the market opened. I told him that I would take each trade in front of him. I will mention the initial risk amount and explain all my actions in the live market.

On that day, Banknifty opened with a small gap near the previous day's high. It was a pure initiative buying setup (a market profile concept). So, I took a long trade with Banknifty futures (medium quantity).

After 10-15 minutes, Banknifty shot up by 200 points. I have a separate screen for charts, and the banknifty chart was displayed there. On my laptop screen, I opened my MTM screen and asked my friend.

Me: 'These numbers displayed in green is the profit. What should I do now?'

Friend: 'Sell immediately! you have already made so much of profit in 15 minutes'

Me: 'ok, but note down the profits now. I am not closing this, and I will hold the trade.'

My friend got confused, and he strangely looked at me.

After some time, the price corrected 60-80 points.

Friend: 'see, I had told you to close the trade. Now you are profits reduced by 40-50%'.

Me: 'That's fine. What would have done if you were in my position?'

Friend: 'I would have closed the trade now and pocked at least the remaining 50% profits'.

Me: 'That's wonderful, but I will do the opposite.'

After saying this, I added some more quantities to my long trade.

It was still 11.30-12. My friend has already started feeling restlessness. But I had clearly instructed my friend to sit in front of the computer until the market closes for the day.

It was a clear uptrend on that day, and Banknifty was going up.

My friend was going mad after seeing the profit numbers. He was scolding himself for suggesting closing the trade while he congratulated me for not following his advice.

Banknifty started giving a pullback at 2 PM. I asked him what to do now.

Friend: ' You made good money already. It looks like it will fall now. Please close the trade at least now. I am 100% sure I will be right this time!"".

Me: 'I do the exact opposite thing now. I will add some more positions'.

After saying this, I have bought some more quantity in banknifty.

My friend had gone mad and started walking in the room at a brisk pace. Every tick of fall raised his blood pressure, and he was having a tough time dealing with it.

To cut short the story, Banknifty closed at day's high, and I made good profits on that day.

My friend was exhausted by that time. I asked him to take a cold shower. After the shower, I took him to a good restaurant and started eating lunch.

I had told him that this is the lifestyle of an intraday trader and asked him whether he is still interested to learn intraday trading.

He did 'namaste using both hands and said he would focus on his job. He admitted that he would not be able to handle the emotions in the live market and apologized to me for troubling me to teach intraday trading to him.

Many newcomers will have the same story when they start intraday trading.

Most people face tough times to ride their profits and to avoid revenge trading in intraday trading.

But these two are the essential qualities required to make money in intraday trading.

Unfortunately, many people only highlight 'Technical Analysis' in intraday trading.

Without a doubt, technical analysis is important. But trading psychology and risk management play a crucial role than technical analysis in intraday trading.

Please note opportunity exists in all the time frames. But whenever we get into a lower timeframe, we get more opportunities. Still, we also get more noise, and there is a high possibility of facing successive failed trades (hence money management is essential).

So, all the general technical analysis concepts hold good in intraday trading as well.

Let us look at some of the valuable technical analysis concepts.

#1 ABCD Pattern

It is one of the oldest and simplest intraday trading strategies. New traders and even intermediate-level traders can quickly deploy this strategy.

Typically ABCD patterns start with a strong upside move.

When the market opened, Reliance stock rallied upside as buyers bought aggressively from point A and made new highs of the day (point B).

One should not take trade here as it has already rallied on the upside and wait for some correction due to profit booking.

After B, traders started booking profits, and also some sellers entered the market.

At point C, the price has found some support. Hence, a trader can plan a long trade above the green candle's high, keeping a stop-loss below the green candle's low.

The stock price surged from 2000 (C) to 2025 (D) around 11.20 AM, and you can also see a good volume spike at the same time.

It indicates a strong buyers' presence, and hence we can expect a strong close on the upside. Hence, it is better to trail our SL below every swing low.

The chart reveals that the trail SL has been hit at 2028 in the last hour of the trading session.

#2 Open Range Intraday Breakout Trading System (ORB Strategy)

ORB Strategy is developed by TOBY CRABLE, and it is one of the most famous trading strategies among intraday traders.

It is based on the concept “Amateurs open the market and professionals close the market.”

The first hour after the market opens is crucial and sets the base for any further activities for the rest of the day.

Usually, traders wait for 1-hour range completion.

If the price breaks on the upside, they opt for a long trade above the high of the 1-hour opening range, keeping a stop-loss a little below the breakout candle (or below the high of the 1-hour opening range).

The same logic for a short trade if the price breaks the low 1-hour range.

We can use MA, or ATR to trail the stop-loss.

The above image shows an example of an opening range breakout (ORB) trade in Bank nifty.

First, the price consolidated within a 1-hour range for some time. In the last few sessions, the price broke above the high of the 1-hour range and displayed a good move on the upside.

This strategy has offered a 50% accuracy and a risk-reward of 1:1.8 for Bank nifty in the last 10 years. Hence, this is a pretty good system to deploy in intraday trading.

Useful Rules in Intraday Trading

Below are some of the rules which are helpful in intraday trading:

Don't lose more than 10% of your capital on any trading day.
Don't risk more than 3-5% of your capital in one trade.
It's better to take a break from intraday trading if you are not feeling good (emotionally).
Always remember trading is just a probability game and not a prediction game.
It's impossible to catch all the excellent trade opportunities every day/time.
If you see the MTM profit screenshots of other traders, it will trouble your emotional balance. So follow your trade plan.
It's better to stick one trading system across different market conditions. Your learning curve will not improve if you keep on jumping from one strategy to another.
Avoid trading when you see a significant drawdown or when you get a few successive failed trades.
When you think you know everything in the market, the next day you lose big money.
If you lose money on any trade, then you have made a mistake. There is a lesson to learn (no matter what).
Your aim should be to make money in the market every day, not on other tasks like getting appreciation from others, getting more followers, etc.
There is no need to argue with anyone for any reason. You are right if you are making money in the market.
Profit in trading is inversely proportional to your ego.
Learn how to ride your profits. It is the most challenging task in trading.

Hence, this is a pretty good system to deploy in intraday trading.\n\nUseful Rules in Intraday Trading\n\nBelow are some of the rules which are helpful in intraday trading:\n\nDon\'t lose more than 10% of your capital on any trading day.\nDon\'t risk more than 3-5% of your capital in one trade.\nIt\'s better to take a break from intraday trading if you are not feeling good (emotionally).\nAlways remember trading is just a probability game and not a prediction game.\nIt\'s impossible to catch all the excellent trade opportunities every day/time.\nIf you see the MTM profit screenshots of other traders, it will trouble your emotional balance. So follow your trade plan.\nIt\'s better to stick one trading system across different market conditions. Your learning curve will not improve if you keep on jumping from one strategy to another.\nAvoid trading when you see a significant drawdown or when you get a few successive failed trades.\nWhen you think you know everything in the market, the next day you lose big money.\nIf you lose money on any trade, then you have made a mistake. There is a lesson to learn (no matter what).\nYour aim should be to make money in the market every day, not on other tasks like getting appreciation from others, getting more followers, etc.\nThere is no need to argue with anyone for any reason. You are right if you are making money in the market.\nProfit in trading is inversely proportional to your ego.\nLearn how to ride your profits. It is the most challenging task in trading.\n\nTo know more technical analysis concepts such as patterns, indicators, support & resistance, and candlestick pattern, please read the below article.\n\nTechnical Analysis of Stocks for Beginners in Indian Financial Markets 2024\nTechnical Analysis is the study of historical price movements to identify known repetitive patterns and determine future price movements\' probabilities through the use of technical concepts, technical indicators, and other analysis tools.

Linh Nguyen,Updated 1y,What is the best brokerage for beginners?,"There are those that invest in order to generate money, while others invest in order to build or protect their financial security. Prioritize your financial needs and make sure the brokerage you choose can meet those demands.

You should pay careful attention to the commissions and costs associated with the markets that are most relevant to you. Think about whether or not the brokerage's available technology suits your investing preferences, whether you're a long-term investor or frequent trader.

For investors, a brokerage is much more than just a place to make deals. Find a broker like 𝖵𝗂𝖼𝗍𝗈𝗋𝗂𝖺 𝖦𝗋𝖺𝖼𝖾 𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖽𝗌𝖺𝗒 who will help you become a better investor by providing you with high-quality research and educational resources.

Finally, don't forget how critical it is that you have access to real-time customer service. Some brokerages place a premium on this feature, offering round-the-clock access to human agents by phone and online chat.

While China has been working towards becoming the leader of world trade for the past 50 years, and has attained the leadership position only over the last decade.

Mark Daviis,Updated 2y,What are different investment strategies?,"An investment strategy is a defined approach to investing that shapes the choices an investor makes for his or her portfolio. Different investment strategies assume specific tactics based on fundamental beliefs. For instance, value investing seeks stocks that are undervalued and are selling for less than their true worth, whereas growth investing aims to find investment opportunities in companies that have high potential for growth. Those are just a few of the many investment strategies out there to choose from. This guide will break down the major investment strategies and help you decide which of them is likely to be a good choice for you.

How to Choose an Investment Strategy

There are a number of factors that go into choosing the investment strategy that will work best for you. One thing is to think about whether you want to choose an active or passive investing strategy. Active investing involves the frequent buying and selling of stocks. It requires hands-on management, often by a portfolio manager who can delve into various factors to forecast the market.

Passive strategies, on the other hand, are focused on buying and holding investments for the long haul. Proponents of passive strategies argue this cuts down on trading costs and increases tax efficiency. It also tends to be less risky than market-timing strategies, which can reap big rewards by trying to beat the market but also suffer big losses. Oftentimes, portfolios will blend active and passive investing.

Other factors you need to consider are your time horizon, such as how close you are to major life events like buying a house, having children or retiring. If you need income soon, you may not want to select long-term investments, for instance. Your risk tolerance is another consideration. Generally, you can tolerate more risk early in your career, and desire less risky, more stable investments as you move towards retirement. A strategy like income investing, which is based on generating a steady income, might be less risky than more subjective strategy like value investing.

Growth Investing

Growth investing is an investment strategy that focuses on building capital through buying equities that have the potential to increase in value. This is most commonly found in stocks where investors believe the value of the company, and thus the value of the shares they’ve purchased, is likely to go up.

Growth investing contains several sub-strategies. Two of the most common are short-term investments and long-term investments. Short-term generally means buying stocks and holding them for less than a year. Investors use short-term growth investments when they think a company’s value is likely to shoot up quickly. Long-term investments, on the other hand, are held for more than a year. Investors use these when they believe the company’s value will grow slowly and steadily over the years.

Growth investing can touch on numerous sectors, such as:

Emerging markets

Tech

Energy

Aerospace

Value Investing

Value investing, an investment strategy championed by Warren Buffett, focuses on seeking out stocks that you believe are intrinsically undervalued. By finding companies the market does not properly value, investors have the potential to post big gains when the market eventually corrects and the company becomes valued properly. This is a very subjective type of investing.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4bo3fjp82yi70naz', 'title': 'What are different investment strategies?', 'score': {'original': 0.6113, 'ai': 0.3887}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'An investment strategy is a defined approach to investing that shapes the choices an investor makes for his or her portfolio.

Two of the most common are short-term investments and long-term investments. Short-term generally means buying stocks and holding them for less than a year. Investors use short-term growth investments when they think a company’s value is likely to shoot up quickly. Long-term investments, on the other hand, are held for more than a year. Investors use these when they believe the company’s value will grow slowly and steadily over the years.\n\nGrowth investing can touch on numerous sectors, such as:\n\nEmerging markets\n\nTech\n\nEnergy\n\nAerospace\n\nValue Investing\n\nValue investing, an investment strategy championed by Warren Buffett, focuses on seeking out stocks that you believe are intrinsically undervalued. By finding companies the market does not properly value, investors have the potential to post big gains when the market eventually corrects and the company becomes valued properly. This is a very subjective type of investing.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.6113

Glen Boston,Updated 2y,Is it too late to get into cryptocurrency trading? Has the bubble burst?,"Is it too late to buy bitcoin, or is it just a bubble? I usually get this question quite a bit from close friends, family members and even random people that I meet daily. If you are a crypto expert, you’ll probably be asked the same question before Halloween. In fact, a simple Google search for “Is it too late to buy Bitcoin?” reveals more than 18,000,000 results.

Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies might be heading to, DON’T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don’t be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency.

Note: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.

So, is it too late to buy Bitcoin or is it just a bubble? Well, the truth is that it is never too late to invest in 
Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for that matter. It doesn’t matter when you buy your Bitcoin because the crypto market is among the most dynamic and rapidly growing financial markets in the world.

Although Bitcoin prices tend to fluctuate a lot, it is quite unfair to refer to these fluctuations as a bubble that is ready to burst. The truth is that Bitcoin opens up a world of great technology and endless opportunities for people. Bitcoin is built on blockchain technology that is gaining rapid acceptance all over the world.

Therefore, we cannot say that it is about to die. The biggest problem with some people who make losses is that they invest money into Bitcoin because other people have done so. They don’t take time to understand the whole idea and know how to go about it.

Before you start investing in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, you need to take your time and conduct thorough research. Know the current market trends and catch up with all the latest news. That way, you will make informed decisions that won’t hurt you in the future.

The Major Bitcoin Bubbles We’ve Experienced So Far

The truth is that Bitcoin has experienced its own fair share of good and bad days, but it has managed to stand the test of time. Whenever its price rises sharply, you’ll hear a lot of people say that the Bitcoin Bull Run is on and whenever the market takes a sudden dip, the same people will come forward and call it a bear market.

For investors, it is always a good move to go slow on buying Bitcoin when the price gets too high, especially during the bull runs when it is really high. Be sure to wait for some big dips before you start investing your money. That way, you can be sure of high profits when things get better.

Ever since its inception over a decade ago, Bitcoin has had several bull runs and also survived the scariest moments of the market as well. Here are some of the major Bitcoin bubbles since 2011.

The 2011 Bitcoin bubble: Slightly over one year since Bitcoin trading started, this cryptocurrency recorded a massive increase in the number of people investing in it. The result was a sharp rise in its market prices. The price of one bitcoin shot from $0.30 as of January 2011 to $30 as of June 2011. At that time, the number of people using Bitcoin was low, and as the demand increased, people started selling their coins. This led to a whirlwind of selling Bitcoins, and the price took a major hit and went as low as $2 within five months. Later on, the price rose by more than 10,000%. This led to a whirlwind of selling Bitcoins, and the price took a major hit and went as low as $2 within five months. Later on, the price rose by more than 10,000%.
The 2013 bitcoin bubble: Bitcoin started the year at around $15 and hit $50 by March. By April, one Bitcoin was worth around $100 and in less than two weeks, its price doubled to hit $230. However, a few days later, the price dropped to $160 then rose to $170 a few weeks later before dropping to $100. It stabilized at $100 for a few months before rising to $250 in November, and within one month, one Bitcoin was worth $1,100. This was significant growth in less than a month. Again, the “bubble” burst and the price dropped to $700.
The 2015 bubble: After experiencing multi-year instability, the price of Bitcoin started to stabilize in 2015. Suddenly, it became the new thing in town, and its worth went from $177 in January 2015 to $465 by December of the same year. By the end of 2015, bitcoin had recorded a 160% increase in its price, and many people believed that things were going well for the digital currency.
The 2016 Bitcoin bubble: 2015 was a good year for Bitcoin and the good times were carried over to 2016. The price of one Bitcoin rose from $378 in January 2016 to about $1140 in December of the same year. This significant rise in price attracted many investors which resulted in the market taking a hit a few days later.
The 2018 bubble: This is probably the bubble that everyone remembers. Bitcoin started 2017 at around $900 and ended the same year at $20,000. This represented a 2,395% increase in the price of Bitcoin, and it was the largest since 2011. However, things took a wrong turn in 2018 and saw Bitcoin prices drop to $15,000 and then $8,000 before the end of 2018. This was a time when many people sold their bitcoins out of fear of losing money.

Are We in the Middle of a Bubble?

After listing some of the major Bitcoin bubbles that we have been through so far, you may be asking yourself whether we are in the middle of a bubble or if it is just too late to invest in Bitcoin. In this section, I want us to break down things step-by-step before we draw a conclusion.

The truth is that the media is being crazy about the so-called “Bitcoin bubble” because of Bitcoin’s high price tag. In fact, no media house cared about this cryptocurrency in 2011 when its price was relatively low.

Journalists and other self-proclaimed crypto experts only started casting their spotlight on Bitcoin in 2017 when the price shot from $2000 to $4000 in a few months. However, nobody cared in 2011 when the price of one Bitcoin tripled in less than seven days because its worth was still low.

What I’m trying to say is that if Bitcoin was a bubble as many people want us to believe, then it had been popped numerous times before it became popular. I’m convinced that many people are just confusing the media hype combined with the relatively high prices for a bubble.

Other cryptocurrencies have grown 100× in less than a year, but nobody talks about them because they still cost less. Once they hit the higher price tags, then you can be sure that the bubble talk will start for those cryptocurrencies as well.

The bottom line is that people are focusing too much on the wrong numbers instead of paying attention to Bitcoin’s rate of growth.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kdlbuvigatp4fncz', 'title': 'Is it too late to get into cryptocurrency trading?

The price of one Bitcoin rose from $378 in January 2016 to about $1140 in December of the same year. This significant rise in price attracted many investors which resulted in the market taking a hit a few days later.\nThe 2018 bubble: This is probably the bubble that everyone remembers. Bitcoin started 2017 at around $900 and ended the same year at $20,000. This represented a 2,395% increase in the price of Bitcoin, and it was the largest since 2011. However, things took a wrong turn in 2018 and saw Bitcoin prices drop to $15,000 and then $8,000 before the end of 2018. This was a time when many people sold their bitcoins out of fear of losing money.\n\nAre We in the Middle of a Bubble?\n\nAfter listing some of the major Bitcoin bubbles that we have been through so far, you may be asking yourself whether we are in the middle of a bubble or if it is just too late to invest in Bitcoin. In this section, I want us to break down things step-by-step before we draw a conclusion.\n\nThe truth is that the media is being crazy about the so-called “Bitcoin bubble” because of Bitcoin’s high price tag. In fact, no media house cared about this cryptocurrency in 2011 when its price was relatively low.\n\nJournalists and other self-proclaimed crypto experts only started casting their spotlight on Bitcoin in 2017 when the price shot from $2000 to $4000 in a few months. However, nobody cared in 2011 when the price of one Bitcoin tripled in less than seven days because its worth was still low.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that if Bitcoin was a bubble as many people want us to believe, then it had been popped numerous times before it became popular. I’m convinced that many people are just confusing the media hype combined with the relatively high prices for a bubble.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have grown 100× in less than a year, but nobody talks about them because they still cost less. Once they hit the higher price tags, then you can be sure that the bubble talk will start for those cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nThe bottom line is that people are focusing too much on the wrong numbers instead of paying attention to Bitcoin’s rate of growth.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.11683333333333

The only things I could think of that would be rarer and more exotic are Kyber Crystals and Coaxium, which as we know for the former there are only two known locations for the stuff (besides the hearts of stars), and the empire shattered the moon of one and turned the other into a super weapon. As for the latter, well, a few crates of the stuff costs as much as a star destroyer (which is the equivalent of and entire world's annual economic output) and can power entire fleets (or can jump-start a certain YT-1300 freighter into hyperspace).

So what makes Bacta so valuable? Well, because there's only one world that can makes the real deal, and they keep it a trade secret.

Barun Mohanty,3y,Why is the market not crashing when the Nifty PE is crossed 30? Is this a myth?,"You own a samosa center at your university. Your samosas are very tasty and the demand is too high. Your samosa business is growing bigger day by day.

Your samosa center is listed in the stock market. People are very optimistic about your samosa business. So, your share is trading at 100 rupees. But your earnings per share is 10 rupees.

So, the PE is 100/10 =10

Now, a pandemic happened.

People started thinking you would go out of the business as you can’t sustain it as you have operating costs to pay.

Now, your share price fell down. Your samosa company is trading at 5 rupees now.

Why? Because some people like teachers, admin staffs hold your shares and optimistic about your business as they have come to university regularly.

But your earnings per share become 1 as there are no students to consume your samosa. Now, samosa is consumed by the teachers and staff only.

Now, your PE is = 5/1 = 5

Now, the pandemic is almost over.

The university is going to reopen. Students feel optimistic about your company and started buying shares.

Now, your share is trading at 150 rupees. Why? Some people think students have not eaten your tasty samosas for a long time. So, when they come, they will consume 1.5 times more. Let’s say the student who was eating 2 samosas, will eat 3 samosas as he is craving for it for a long time.

But wait!

University is going to reopen. But it has not reopened yet. So, your earnings per share are still 1 rupee.

But your share price is 150 rupees.

So, the PE is = 150/1 = 150 (Highest PE ever recorded)

As you are going to do business as before, your earnings will go higher than 1 rupee and your PE (Share price/ Earning per share) will come down. Nobody knows what will happen to the price. It might get correct a bit but there is less chance it will fall down causing a market crash.

Following are some secrets that can be profitable for an investor:

i. The quality of the company is vital to determining the future stock growth in the market.

Penny Stocks,4y,What are the common mistakes made by a first time investor in stock markets?,"Nobody really wishes to fritter away their hard-earned money, am I right?

If you aim on stepping into the stock market, however want to overcome common slip-ups, I suggest you read some points for you to avoid if you want to successfully execute your stock market strategy.

Not Having a Trading Strategy

Stock traders in the beginning of their careers may not develop a strategy prior to their trading. Even if they make, they perhaps are more likely to slip away from the outlined practices than would seasoned individuals. Novice stock traders might overturn the path on the whole. For instance, having less money after primarily purchasing securities due to their declining share prices, just to finish up being whipsawed,

Disregarding Risk Assessment

Never stop paying regard to your risk bearing, or your tolerance to persist on risk. Some individuals may not bear instability and the rises and falls affiliated with stock trading or more tentative trades. Other individuals may have to protect, daily interest incomes. Such investors with low-risk acceptance may be more affluent trading in the blue-chip traders of settled firms and must keep afar from more unpredictable increase/decrease or new companies trades.

Overlooking Your Time Sphere

If you are new in stock trading, you must avoid investing without setting up time duration. Find out how long the time duration, you have to stock up for a down payment on property, education or retirement.

Not Determining Stop Losses

Even though stock traders have to show tolerance and patience, they must not bear failure without action. Outline a price threshold, when in case the price exceeds/devlines you are not comfortable holding a trade.

Purchasing Stocks on Credit

Purchasing stocks on credit is a tactic maintained by experts in the share trading. They take money to purchase stock from a financial institution or stock agent. After the price of a share rise, they sell it and look after their cash and liabilities difference and gains. However if the price of a share does not increase and diminished instead, the financial institution or agent suppose them to give in additional amounts.

Pramod Kumar,6y,"Is trading in a share market a good earning method? When we make someone lose, is it right?","The push cart vendor in the image above is selling Vegetables.

He trades in vegetables.

Buys them in whole sale market and sells in retail going door to door. He has developed expertise in sourcing his purchase, pricing his stock and also has regular customers. Based on these skills , he trades profitably everyday.

So does this guy:

This also is a trade.

Here the cost price is very low, effort is high and he is actually selling HAPPINESS for the child whose parents buy the balloon. Price of the end product relates to the value provided.

If one can make such trades profitably, then why not in Trading in Stock Markets.

Yes, it is a good earning method.

But you need to develop the skills required.

( a ) Like the vegetable seller buys at a right price and sells at another right price, you have to develop the skill to find the right entry and exit points for your trade. This is known in stock markets as — Technical Analysis.

(b) The vegetable seller selects good quality vegetables. He is also not carrying only one variety but some selected ones. You have to learn the skills of selecting the right stocks —- Fundamental Analysis. More number of vegetables / stocks is called Diversified Portfolio.

(c) If you happen to go to a market place of vegetable sellers, you are likely to notice one point— The selections are mostly same. Yes, few sellers stock some exotic and out of season vegetables, which are high priced, but generally it is same stock with everyone. This is known as following the trend.

(d) The exotic vegetables do sell at a high price but it is difficult to sell them. But if there is a sudden demand due to some wedding function/ other occasion. great profits are made. Such trades are known as Contrarian Trades.

(e) All other things being similar ( not same), the share market trader has the advantage of not having to go door to door. Stock exchange/ Broker do that for you.One can trade sitting at home. What else you can ask for ?

(f) If the sales of vegetables are slow on one day and some loss occurs, the vegetable seller does not give up. He is again there in the morning buying his stock. For him it is a business. A stock market trader also needs to have the same approach. It is a business.

I hope I have been able to answer your question.

Done rightly, trading in stock market can be a good method for earning money.

Thanks for reading.

Denise Bellerose,Updated Oct 11,Should I put my $7000 savings into the stock market?,"Saving any amount of money isn’t easy and $7,000 is no small feat. Unless you got it through less-than-legitimate means and are currently on the lam, give yourself a huge pat on the back. Now it's time to figure out what to do with it.

First two nosy questions. Are your credit cards all paid off? Do you have three to six months of living expenses set aside in case you're not able to work for a while? If the answer to either of these questions is no, i highly recommend putting some or even your entire $7,000 towards accomplishing these two goals before investing, because both scenarios involve real and potential credit card debt, and credit card interest rates will almost certainly outpace any gains you might see from investing. If you have those things taken care of, then you can get busy and start investing.

There’s certainly nothing wrong with nurturing dreams of an early retirement filled with financial security and exotic holidays. But, hey, be careful of allowing your emotions to sway you. You might be just be lured into investing through fraudulent platforms in which case you lose all your money before going into the market where you will lose even more money through their guidance. If You're a Victim of Scam you can undo the financial damage that's already been done to you by narrating your ordeal through the scamreveal/net community where complaints are directed to the relevant authorities in an attempt to assist victims reclaim lost finances as well as to create awareness that stop scam schemes.

If history is anything to go by, one of the quickest potential ways to have made your $7,000 to grow would have been by investing in the stock market. But what stocks should you have bought? Chances are you’ve heard stories about some dude who invested a thousand bucks in Amazon in 1997 who now lives in a castle. What you don’t hear about as much, however, are the stories about some other guy who went all in on Snapchat and now lives in his mom's basement. Stock picking is extraordinarily hard. Famously rich stock picker Warren Buffett has spent the last decades discouraging pretty much everyone not named Warren Buffet from trying to make money picking individual stocks and in fact, has encouraged his heirs to invest the lion’s share of their inheritance in low-fee, highly diversified stock funds.

How to invest $7,000 safely

If safety is what you're looking for then you will need to look for low-risk investments, though you should know that there are no guarantees in investing. Stocks, being naturally risky, will fluctuate in value. In exchange for taking on this risk, investors will generally be rewarded with the possibility of higher returns than they'd get from less risky investments. If you absolutely can’t risk any fluctuation, you’ll be better served with a savings account or a savings product, that typically carry virtually little to no risk. That said, you can't expect the kind of returns you might get from investing in ETFs made up of stocks, bonds, and real estate. In fact, interest rates have lately been so low that inflation is likely to outpace the interest rate, and in the long run, you’ll essentially be losing money by keeping your money stuck in one.

Government bonds typically come with less risk, but also provide comparatively low returns. Stocks behave a little like a penny tossed in the air; the more times you do it, the more likely it is you'll get to a one-to-one heads-to-tails ratio, and the longer you hold a stock, the more predictable the results will be. The range of outcomes tend to narrow over time, so in the past, those who held onto a variety of stock investments for more than a decade were most likely rewarded with returns that offset any short-term risk.

The conventional wisdom is the longer your investment horizon, the higher the ratio of stocks to bonds your portfolio can contain. If you don’t need to withdraw money in the short term, you can afford to ride the wave of the stock market.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dp15cgtej4n08qmu', 'title': 'Should I put my $7000 savings into the stock market?', 'score': {'original': 0.6402, 'ai': 0.3598}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Saving any amount of money isn’t easy and $7,000 is no small feat.

Famously rich stock picker Warren Buffett has spent the last decades discouraging pretty much everyone not named Warren Buffet from trying to make money picking individual stocks and in fact, has encouraged his heirs to invest the lion’s share of their inheritance in low-fee, highly diversified stock funds.\n\nHow to invest $7,000 safely\n\nIf safety is what you're looking for then you will need to look for low-risk investments, though you should know that there are no guarantees in investing. Stocks, being naturally risky, will fluctuate in value. In exchange for taking on this risk, investors will generally be rewarded with the possibility of higher returns than they'd get from less risky investments. If you absolutely can’t risk any fluctuation, you’ll be better served with a savings account or a savings product, that typically carry virtually little to no risk. That said, you can't expect the kind of returns you might get from investing in ETFs made up of stocks, bonds, and real estate. In fact, interest rates have lately been so low that inflation is likely to outpace the interest rate, and in the long run, you’ll essentially be losing money by keeping your money stuck in one.\n\nGovernment bonds typically come with less risk, but also provide comparatively low returns. Stocks behave a little like a penny tossed in the air; the more times you do it, the more likely it is you'll get to a one-to-one heads-to-tails ratio, and the longer you hold a stock, the more predictable the results will be. The range of outcomes tend to narrow over time, so in the past, those who held onto a variety of stock investments for more than a decade were most likely rewarded with returns that offset any short-term risk.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is the longer your investment horizon, the higher the ratio of stocks to bonds your portfolio can contain. If you don’t need to withdraw money in the short term, you can afford to ride the wave of the stock market."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.6402
Tom Costello,Updated 5y,"What should I do next? I invented a trading system which generates a profit of 50% on average. I developed it and tested it for 3 years. I can fund only $10,000 so it will end up very slow to quit my job. What are your suggestions?","I worked in quant finance for 25 years, the last portion of it as Head of Equity Trading at a 1B quant fund where a substantial portion of my time was spent interviewing and hiring Portfolio Managers. So if one of the things you’re thinking of doing is going to work as a PM at an established fund in order to increase your capital, let me tell you how the story you’re currently telling will be seen.

You aren’t really making 50%. (by that I mean 50% annually, which is the typical metric by which strategy returns are described.) Your ‘testing’ is back testing not paper trading, so it isn’t really ‘proven’. I assume this because the major listed markets are far too efficient for anyone to make 50% annually in a reliable and reproducible way. When you try to actually trade this strategy or to properly ‘test’ it with appropriate assumptions for execution costs, (or at the very least, to trade it in any volume) you’ll find that slippage eats most if not all of your profits.
If I’m wrong about that and you really have paper traded it with a reasonable estimate for costs and slippage, the strategy won’t scale large enough to make it worth it for a fund to participate in. Trading in size means worrying about issues that most people don’t understand. (How do you think all those execution traders have earned their money of the last 2 decades?) There are some strategies which will deliver a relatively high return at a VERY small size, but those don’t make sense for a large fund because of other fixed management costs. As a rule, they won’t make sense for you to do on your own either.
If by some miracle I’m wrong about ALL of that, then your risk is too high and I’ll see that from a quick glance at your cumulative return chart. Making 50% is easy if you are sometimes down 150%. But to properly scale a strategy you’ll need to show a cumulative return history that never exceeds a 20% drawdown. That 20% is as close as the hedge fund world gets to a universal rule. The other close to universal rule is that you’ll need a sharpe ratio above 1. Of the hundreds of guys I’ve interviewed for PM jobs, all of whom had several years of professional experience working in research, I saw only 4 strategies that met both those requirements. One of them lost its entire P&L to slippage, and one other wouldn’t scale enough when we tried to run it.

I’m not trying to discourage you, but these questions are very common on Quora and they all ignore the facts of the financial markets. They’re all version of “I’ve discovered the magic formula trading program that will make me a billionaire if I can just raise the money. What do I do?” But they’re all wrong. I tend to generously think that they’re just kids trying to understand the processes in the industry and not trolls or people looking to ‘game’ it. But whether their motives for the questions are innocence and ignorance, or malice, I and the entire professional end of the industry already know that the magic formula they’re looking for (or pretending they’ve found) doesn’t actually exist.

The truth is that in large hedge funds, decision making is very strictly constrained by risk limitations. You can’t just do ‘whatever you want’. In fact, the rules for hedge funds are actually defined by the typical investors in hedge funds, and their rules are determined by the cost of capital, and the best risk management thinking available.

Within those constraints, there is NO magic bullet. There is no secret formula that will give you a 50% return because there isn’t a enough ‘information content’ in the combination of price, volume, volatility and the statistics of derived markets that hasn’t already been studied to death by tens of thousands of the sharpest minds on the planet. If it were really there, someone (probably several people) would have found it, and they’d be doing right now - and in the process eliminating the profit opportunity for everyone else.

From the outside it looks like easy money. Analyze stock prices, make a prediction, and poof… you’re driving a lambo. It doesn’t really work like that.

In reality you’re considering getting into the single most intellectually competitive field on the planet. A field where people have been systematically doing for decades what you’re hoping to do by luck. Yes you may be the smartest person you know. But so is EVERYONE else in quant finance. And they’ve been at it for a good long while.

They’ve looked at high frequency, low frequency and everything in between. They’ve done market neutral, long only, short only, long Vol, short Vol, periodic regime change, and all the possible variants you could ever imagine while looking at price, market spreads, market splits, market gaps, volume and derived price and volume. They’ve done mean reversion, mean divergence, and mean stability on every one of those combinations. They’ve tested equity to futures. Futures to options. Equity to options, options to futures and all of the above against all the ETF’s and indexes. They’ve compared all of those to every conceivable predictable variant of yield curve trajectory across every major currency and bond market.

They've compared one market to the next in every conceivable possible way. And in the process they’ve teased out every fraction of penny of predictable inefficiency in every major market in the entire world. The odds that you have actually done better than all of them on one of your very first tries, is infinitesimally small.

Collectively, professional quant traders can be thought of as a single huge machine that tests every new rational potential theory of market relationships in a lightning fast way, looking in every conceivable corner for enough predictive certainty to turn a profit, for as long as they can. (They test all the irrational ones too… but those never leave the drawing board.) Those that win today can play again tomorrow and those that don’t have to go find something else to do. To call them highly motivated is a vast understatement.

With all that discouragement stated, let me give you the flip side.

There are other ways to approach this that still work, and can still make you a living. Try looking at “Alternative Data” or getting into a less efficient market like crypto. Take a look at trading illiquid assets because the accounting rules are more generous than daily ‘mark to market’. That’s what the leaders in the space are all doing now.

If you’re looking in the right place, it might be possible to come up with a model that will give a big return by ‘luck’. It might not work for very long, but maybe by then you’ll learn enough about the market to come up with something else. But if you think you’re going to write the magic formula in the major equity, bond, currency, future, option markets, that delivers a huge return with limited risk, think again. I don’t mean to be too harsh about it but you’re wasting your time.

I’d like to add one thing to this answer that has occurred to me since. One of the biggest challenges in designing a real ‘quant’ strategy is a low correlation. Your returns need to be uncorrelated (below .5) or ideally anti-correlated (below 0) to the market you’re trading, and the overall return of the fund you’re talking to. If your correlation to the S&P is 0.9, then I don’t need to pay you to obtain that risk, I just buy the S&P. I can pay someone 50K a year to do that, and to manage P&L and settlement at the same time. I can have a tech guy do it in between writing code.

This may not sound like much, but you’d be shocked at how difficult it is. It basically means that you have to have a truly unique idea. A new approach to understanding the relationships between markets and price behavior. And when all the competition is taken from the top few percentage points of the top schools on the planet, run through the best industry training programs in the world, and set loose in direct competition with each other for the better part of 2 decades where only the very best are allowed to continue in that role, it’s no easy trick.

It can be done. It’s done by a tiny number of people every year. But the odds that you are that person are very small. The odds that you are not only that person, but that you’ve found 50% annual return in the process by using data you downloaded from google finance, are non-zero.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rxd421uctn9zji0b', 'title': 'What should I do next?

Indrazith Shantharaj,Updated 3y,Why do people trade in Options when they are risky and there are other options to make money from share market with lesser risk?,"Wonderful question!

We have below 3 trading instruments in the stock market:

Equity
Futures
Options

So, a trader should know how these trading instruments work.

Now assume a new trader has Rs. 2,00,000 in his trading account and he wants to make a trade with APOLLO HOSPITALS today (as on 20/06/2020 CMP 1370).

.

The current Market Price of APOLLO HOSPITALS is 1370.

So, the total shares he can buy is 146 (approx) with a capital of Rs. 2,00,000.

Now we will try to understand both the ‘Risk’ and ‘Reward’ from this trade.

Reward - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the upside. In this case, he will make a profit of Rs. 20,000 and his current portfolio value is Rs. 2,20,000.

Risk - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the downside. In this case, he will make a loss of Rs. 20,000 and his current portfolio value is Rs. 1,80,000.

.

The current Market Price of APOLLO HOSPITALS is 1370.

Image - Margin requirements information (as on 20/06/2020)

So, with a capital of Rs. 2,00,000, he can buy 1 lot (500 quantity).

(This info can be found in F&O Margin calculator from most of the broker sites)

Now we will try to understand both the ‘Risk’ and ‘Reward’ from this trade.

Reward - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the upside.

10% of 1370 (CMP) is 137.

Total Profit = 1 lot (500 quantity) X 137 = Rs. 68,500

In this case, his current portfolio value is Rs. 2,68,500.

Risk - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the downside.

10% of 1370 (CMP) is 137.

Total Loss = 1 lot (500 quantity) X 137 = Rs. 68,500

In this case, his current portfolio value is Rs. 1,31,500.

.

The current Market Price of APOLLO HOSPITALS is 1370.

One should look at the option chain for the nearest strike price on the NSE India website or with your broker terminal to get the LTP.

Image - APOLLO HOSPITALS Option chain CE/PE info at 1380 strike price (as on 20/06/2020)

So, with a capital of Rs. 2,00,000, he can buy 4166 (LTP of both CE and PE is 48) quantity (ignoring Lot size at the moment)

Now we will try to understand both the ‘Risk’ and ‘Reward’ from this trade.

Reward - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the upside.

Option LTP approximately increase by 75% of the change in the underlying price (Implied Volatility is also around 70–75% for this script).

10% of 1370 (CMP) is 137 (change in the underlying instrument) and 75% of 137 is 102.75.

So, Total Profit = 4166 quantity X 102.75 = Rs. 4,28,056

In this case, his current portfolio value is Rs. 6,28,056

Risk - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the downside.

In this case, LTP of 1380 CE will become zero.

Hence, this trader will lose his entire capital.

PS: I have considered only “Options Buying” as most the retail traders only do options buying and the above question is also relevant to option buying.

.

Summary:

Image - Capital size after the execution in Equity, Futures, and Options.

The above image is self-explanatory.

Most retail traders try their luck in options to make quick money.

(Apart from retail traders, institutions and some big traders also do options trading to hedge their portfolio. I am not mentioning them here as the intention of the question is different)

With other trading instruments (Equity and Futures), the risk is less, but the reward is also less!

Image - Thumb rule of risk-reward in 3 trading instruments

However, my sincere caution to all the retail traders is to master their trading skills before trying anything in options. The above explanation is only a theoretical assumption and in the live market options LTP may change due to other factors (like time for expiry, volatility, etc).

I hope this detailed explanation helps :)

.

Edit-1 (on 05/07/2020)

Thanks for 10K+ views.

I have received a few queries about Implied Volatility. Hence, I thought to clarify the same.

Implied Volatility (IV) is one of the most critical metrics to understand when trading options.

In simple terms, IV is determined by the current price of options contracts on a particular stock or future. It also represents the expected volatility of a stock over the life of the option.

Options that show high levels of IV will result in high-priced option premiums.

Each strike price of options will also respond differently to implied volatility changes. Usually, near-the-money strike price contracts are more sensitive to change in IV. Whereas, out-of-the-money strike price contracts are less sensitive to changes in IV.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ri5lvx2juogfphed', 'title': 'Why do people trade in Options when they are risky and there are other options to make money from share market with lesser risk?', 'score': {'original': 0.42855, 'ai': 0.57145}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Wonderful question!\n\nWe have below 3 trading instruments in the stock market:\n\nEquity\nFutures\nOptions\n\nSo, a trader should know how these trading instruments work.\n\nNow assume a new trader has Rs. 2,00,000 in his trading account and he wants to make a trade with APOLLO HOSPITALS today (as on 20/06/2020 CMP 1370).\n\n.\n\nThe current Market Price of APOLLO HOSPITALS is 1370.\n\nSo, the total shares he can buy is 146 (approx) with a capital of Rs. 2,00,000.\n\nNow we will try to understand both the ‘Risk’ and ‘Reward’ from this trade.\n\nReward - Assume, on the next trading day this script moved 10% on the upside.

Stock Price,4y,"What types of stocks do you avoid investing in, and why?","Following are the four mainstream types of stocks that one should avoid investing for the sake of safeguarding the returns. These stocks are easily available into the market, one should be involved in swot to decide whether a particular investment will be profitable or not.

1. Low liquid Companies

There are some investments or stocks whose prices continuously decrease. Unfortunately, the investors cannot sell those investments as there are no buyers available. One should avoid investing in securities with less liquidity because exiting from a low liquid organization can create stressful conditions.

Generally, stockholders must stay away from companies that have average trade volume of less than ten lac. It is obvious that the higher the volume is, the better the situation of the company will be. In addition, alternative way to check liquidity of a company is to focus on the difference between bids and ask price. The higher the liquidity, the smaller is the difference.

2. High debt companies

Debts in the organizations are same as big holes in a spaceship. Unless and until, these holes are not filled then the ship is unable to move. One must avoid investing in companies that have a lot of liability found. Following the thumb rule, one must stay away from organizations with an equity/debt ratio that is greater than 1.

3. Falling knife category companies

Investment in organizations whose share price falling significantly and continuously (for example PND, PC Jewellers, Suzlon energy and Geetanjali etc) is not a good idea. There is always a reason why the stock prices are decreasing and the market punishes that company. Furthermore, there are a lot of listed companies in New York Stock exchange which could be explored.

4. Low visibility companies

There are a few companies in the New York Stock Exchange whose information is not so easily available on the financial websites or the Internet. This is mostly in the case of micro-cap or small companies. Looking into such companies with lower visibility could be a boring job for stockholders. In addition, there are various chances for data manipulation. So, if you are unable to cross check the information or when the reference sources does not seem reliable then one should avoid to invest in those companies.

Christian Herzig,Updated 3y,Can a company’s stock get sold out?,"Yes it's possible. In 2008 Porsche was secretly building up a stake in Volkswagen in order to prepare a hostile take over.

Monish Ronald,3y,What's the biggest mistake that stock market investors make?,"Taking a research report seriously is one of the biggest mistakes I did. Let me show you how. I was planning to do BTST on NTPC, so I got 2 shares at 100/each and the very next day, it touched a high of 108.

So, that’s where the problem began. I guess it’s natural human tendency, I thought,” Wow, already I’m running a Rs.16 profit, what if I HOLD ?”.

I usually don’t take tips from any company, but this time for some bizarre reason I wanted to try it out. So I saw the research reports for NTPC given by companies.

I thought, all big institutions are saying it will go higher than this, so why miss the ride to the top ? I thought I will exit at Rs. 140, which falls in their prediction range.

But the very next day, the share price started falling. I thought it was a retracement and it will recover. But it didn’t. The share fell even further, and my net loss was more than 10%, I was still holding on to it, and I finally exit at Rs. 85, have a look at the chart. The share fell even further after I sold.

So the lessons I learnt are,

Stick to your plan. If you want to BTST, do that. If you want to do intraday, do that. Don’t change plans in between.
Never lose more than 10% of your capital. Here I lost 15%
Good thing I did not average for every drop. So wait till it bottoms out.
Always good to keep a GTT on short term trades. It is difficult to watch the market during work hours.

Indira Securities,2y,How can I find the trends of the stock market in an easy way?,"5 easy ways to analyze trend in stock market.

1 Three data points required -A pattern is considered true only when we have three or more points of contact.

2 Direction- Patterns can travel up, down, and sideways in three directions. You'll be able to see all three kinds of trends on the same map if you research prices over a long period of time.

3 Monitor the slope- A trend's slope shows how far per day the price of a share can move. Steep lines indicate a certain pattern, going upward or downward. If the line is too flat, however, both the validity of the trend and its predictive powers are called into question.

4 Timing the trend- The period of time decides a trend's validity. Monthly time series are usually of greater significance than weekly prices, which substitute daily prices.

5 Long lasting- The longer a trend stays in place the greater the weight it bears.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/c69gfd7l25uj4isk', 'title': 'How can I find the trends of the stock market in an easy way?', 'score': {'original': 0.5172, 'ai': 0.4828}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""5 easy ways to analyze trend in stock market.\n\n1 Three data points required -A pattern is considered true only when we have three or more points of contact.\n\n2 Direction- Patterns can travel up, down, and sideways in three directions.

TS,Updated 4y,How did Theodore Weld Smith learn quantitative finance?,"Let’s start with a short story on how I learned about what quant finance is and what quants do. (Also let me make it clear that I have not in any way whatsoever mastered quant finance at all—have not gotten near that, so “How did Theodore Weld Smith learn quant finance” is a bit difficult to address as it isn’t a done-deal at all, rather a continuous process, but I’ll describe here how I’ve accomplished this task thus far).

I was sitting in a frozen yogurt shop on Euclid talking with my dad about the professions people with math or physics degrees pursue outside of academia, and he mentioned that you could become a quant at a hedge fund—and he spoke of the famous quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies and how their employee base consists of Princeton physics PhDs. This happened approximately three years ago.

After hearing of this I looked into Renaissance Technologies and learned as much about them as I could on the internet, much of it here on Quora from people such as Vladimir Novakovski. Then I opened up a brokerage account and started doing some trading on my own, and was pretty successful.

I continued to fully immerse myself in the subject, as I do with anything that I become interested in. My original interest was in algorithmic trading, which quantitative finance and the jobs of quants plays into. Quantitative finance is really just applied math—but it implies the programming implementation as well in 2019 (most quants know how to code too—and not just R or Excel).

I started with looking through the internet for general information on the topic, here are the mediums that came up frequently:
Quora
r/algotrading
 (I’d recommend some caution on this subreddit now as its quality has declined severely, it used to be good but unfortunately now is filled with questions about how to use cryptocurrency APIs).
Quantitative Finance Stack Exchange
Nuclear Phynance
Quantopian
 I used extensively before I decided to invest in creating my own environment for developing and testing trading algorithms. I’d recommend it for any beginner looking to get into the field.
QuantConnect
 I also used a bit for the same reasons.
various news articles on algorithmic trading and HFT from places such as Forbes
 or Bloomberg
.
Then, I did something that is the largest distinction by far with any other of the subjects I have had intense interests in (physics and aerospace engineering as examples): I talked to people! I initiated conversations with tons of people on the internet. When you’re a fourteen year old asking questions about the significance of the efficient market hypothesis and how log normal returns are represented by geometric Brownian motion and how that plays into pricing derivatives… you tend to get people’s attention. Sometimes in a negative way, but overwhelmingly it has been positive. My success rate was (and still is) astoundingly high! Here were some of the places where I found most of these people:
Quora
Facebook (often it was friends of someone who was a quant that I had already been interacting with; a lot of my relationships with people in the finance field can be traced back to 4 or so people).
Reddit
LinkedIn (mostly Citadel, Jump Trading, and Jane Street people, I sent many of them connection requests and started talking with them).
Quantitative Finance StackExchange
I then explored the topics that exist inside of quantitative finance, i.e., the subjects that apply to quant finance. Here are some of those topics and the sub-topics within them.
Probability Theory
Stochastic Processes
Stochastic calculus (lots of Ito’s Lemma[1])
Markov Chains (yes, a kind of stochastic process)
Brownian motion (same case as iii)
Expectation value & confidence intervals
Linear Algebra
Hessian Matrix
Hamiltonian Matrices (good stuff on this in the MCMC book).
Stochastic Matrices (covered well in chapter six of the second book mentioned below).
C++
Concurrency & parallelism
Memory Management
Template meta-programming
dealing with large matrices and linear algebra computations
dealing with trading APIs (most prominently Interactive Brokers)
The QuantLib C++ library for derivatives pricing.
Python
implementing the various aforementioned math concepts programmatically
various libraries within scipy and numpy, e.g., numpy.fft[2] , scipy.signal[3], etc.
machine learning libraries in Python (mostly sklearn[4]), I plan on trying to learn how to use Tensorflow, though.
Machine learning (covered a bit in the Python section, but here’s more)
Recurrent neural networks
LSTM models, (a sect of i)
Sequence to sequence (commonly reffered to as Seq2Seq) learning with neural networks

There are probably more things that I’ll edit and include later, this is currently all in my mind.

Here are some of the books I used along this process, starting with probability theory and statistics. I must thank my dad yet again for this as approximately 86% of the books mentioned (in all sections—not just probability) are his, many of which I “temporarily borrowed”. Also don’t think that just by virtue of these texts being mentioned that I understand everything from them, as this is not necessarily the case. I am merely putting them here as I have / am consulting them for my learning process of the quant field.

I think the main reason I have been successful with this has actually nothing to do with programming or math skills at the moment: it’s about taking social risks. Creating these various internet accounts, interacting with adults, venturing into professional adult-dominated spaces, etc. you really stand out as someone my age and it’s a good thing. “and don't be afraid of taking social risks - they dont matter in the long run” to quote Alex K. Chen. It is one of the keys to success.

After I did all this exploration (which I continue everyday), I started writing about it here on Quora and various other mediums (mostly the Quantitative Finance StackExchange
 and the r/highfreqtrading
 subreddit I made and moderate).

Hopefully this is interesting / useful for some.

ALSO: If anyone has any recommendation for further reading in the math (specifically stochastic processes section), I’d appreciate some books. Preferably unrelated to finance, actually.

Indrazith Shantharaj,2y,What is the best way for trading in share market?,"A few years back, I was struggling to make money in trading, and I used to say it to myself -

""If I consistently do what I'm intended to do for a long enough time, I'm bound to achieve great success in trading/life.""

But then, many times, I missed doing what I was supposed to do, and hence, I didn't see good results.

1 - Pick the Trading Type

There are many varieties of trading - day trading, swing trading, or investment.

Opportunity exists in all the timeframe, and hence you need to pick the proper trading method that compliments your personality and work schedule.

Suppose, if your day job demands more attention and time during the market hours, it will be foolish to pick day trading. It will help if you try swing trading or investment.

Similarly, if you are young and get a lot of free time during market hours, then you can explore intraday trading.

2 - Finalize a Trading System

Let's say you picked intraday trading.

There are many methods to manage your intraday trades—for example, price action trading, indicator-based trading, options selling, options buying, etc.

Every concept comes with its own style, risk, and reward. I will take an example to explain this.

I have designed an intraday system using RSI, and below are the backtested results (against 10 years of Banknifty):

Accuracy - 40%

Profit Factor - 1.2

Starting Capital - Rs.350,000

Ending Capital - Rs.1,790,000

Maximum Drawdown - 14%

Consecutive losing trades - 12

Number of trades - 22 trades per month

Image - Equity Curve of the RSI Day Trading System

So, if I decide to use this system, I shouldn't expect an accuracy of 80% or 90%.

Similarly, it generates 22 trades approx every month. Hence, I should keep a check on my expectation about the total number of trades each month. For example, expecting 50 trades each month from this system is foolishness.

3 - Define the Rules

Trading in the stock market is not rocket science. But most people lose money in trading because they randomly make decisions.

Hence, success in trading is all about your discipline action rather than about getting your calls right.

Having well-defined rules helps to sustain this business. Some of the examples are below:

What is the entry criteria
Where should be the initial stop-loss
What is the position size for each trade
How and when to trail stop-loss
How to increase the position size

4 - Money Management Rules

""Even a poor trading system could make money with good money management"" – Jack D. Schwager.

The key to success in trading starts with good money management. Having clarity on how much money you are willing to lose on every trade is crucial for successful trading.

Money Management is nothing but a set of rules to allocate the required position size to reduce the risk while aiming for good returns in trading.

5 - Trading Psychology

Psychology means the mental factors or emotions governing a situation or activity. So, when we say trading psychology, it implies cognitive factors related to trading.

4 primary emotions revolving around trading are greed, fear, regret, and hope. Please note, all these factors emerge because of a lack of knowledge.

Greed

Most people come to the stock market intending to make money. Well, this is not wrong. But most traders set high expectations from the market and that too in quick time.

Fear

Most of the fears in mind are created from our past bad experiences in trading.

The only way to eliminate fears in trading is by increasing your conviction in trading. You can do this by backtesting your system with more data, reading specific niche books on trading, or taking a particular Trading course.

Regret

In trading, our regrets are never-ending. If you exit a trade and the price keeps moving in a favorable direction, you regret your exit decision.

If you don't take profits from one trade and then the trade takes a turn into the negative zone, you will regret your decision for not exiting.

So, plan your trade and trade your plan. Please note, it is not possible to catch all the good moves in the market. Focus on learning and improving day by day, trade by trade.

Hope

A trader starts hoping for some miracle to happen as soon as he deviates from his trading plan.

For example, a trader plans to buy a stock at 200 with 198 as Stop loss level and book profit at 204 level.

The price moved to 200, and he is in the trade.

After some time, the price moves to 204, but he didn't book profit as he starts hoping that short covering will come into the market anytime and it will take his position to massive profit.

Now the market takes a U-turn. Our stock price moves back to 199, and now he starts to hope for a rebound.

The price falls below 198, but he doesn't book the loss as he thinks a rebound is just around the corner. Price is now 196, and he is still living in the hope of a rebound.

What has happened in the above example is that he has lost control of his trading plan.

Pre-decided stop loss and target are the two points where we need to act.

Once we do not reach those points, the situation is not in our control, and the decision we take after that is based on hope, which is a sign of weakness.

6 - Execution is the Key

Execution is the real Holy Grail in Trading.

Do you know why Usain Bolt runs only in 100M and 200M sprints?

Being the fastest athlete globally, why will he not choose to run in other categories such as 400M, 800M, 1500M, 5K, 10K, and other marathon events?

It is because he wants to achieve more in sprints than to become a jack of all the running types.

Suppose you have an excellent positive expectancy system and clear money management rules. In that case, you can make money in Trading in the long run if you execute the plan in all market conditions.

Harshajyoti Das,Updated 6y,What are some of the mind blowing facts about stock markets?,"The Indian Index (BSE) has given a 17.5% return if you take the last 30 years.

So, what’s so great about 17.5% ?

Your money doubles every 4 years.

Year 1 - 10 lakhs

Year 4 - 20 lakhs

Year 8 - 40 lakhs

Year 12 - 80 Lakhs

Year 16 - 1.6 Crores

Year 20 - 3.2 Crores

Year 24 - 6.4 Crores

Year 30 - 13 Crores (approx)

Compare that to real estate, we have hardly seen 12% appreciation on average if you consider the last 30 years.

——————————————

Ref for calculation: 1 Crore = 100 Lakh = ~155k USD

10 Lakh = $15,524 USD

13 Crore = $2,018,162 USD

Bitcoin popped up 20% today and it's just getting started. I said it before that Bitcoin is not going to stop popping up any moment from now, and it's the best Cryptocurrency to invest right now.. Better investment than Banking investment, because Banks would never double your investment, but would rather rip you off your profits like they've been doing. And that's why Banking industry doesn't want to accept Crypto and doesn't like Crypto industry, because they see it as threats that is going to take over from them.

On Tuesday morning, bitcoin price suddenly jumped by 16% in an hour (05:29 UTC), reaching USD 4,882 per coin, or the level last seen in November 2018, before trimming its gains to USD 4,755 (15:27 UTC.) (Updated on 15:51 UTC: updates throughout the entire text. A new section ""Volatility and long-term investing"" has been added, while the ""Looking for catalysts"" section has been updated with its new first paragraph.)

Other top coins also registered strong hourly gains of 3.2% - 11.45% and have retracted later.

Moreover, bitcoin surpassed its 200 daily moving average, which is considered to be a very important metric in technical analysis.

At the time of writing (15:27 UTC), bitcoin is up by almost 15% in the past 24 hours, increasing its weekly gains to more than 20%.

Moreover, bitcoin just posted two-consecutive months of gains, having increased by more than 10% in the first quarter of this year.

Also, as reported, the bitcoin bottom has already occurred, as there aren’t additional sellers coming, according to New York-based research and consulting boutique specializing in the digital asset market Delphi Digital.

Meanwhile, more signs have recently emerged showing that the altcoin season is also here.

Volatility and long-term investing

Jehan Chu, managing partner at blockchain investment and advisory firm Kenetic Capital, told Bloomberg that the crypto market is still very much subject to waves of enthusiasm.

""I don’t think today is anything special other than a temporary enthusiasm,” he added.

However, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, a digital asset management firm, stressed that ""short-term volatility doesn’t matter to the long-term investor.""

""As I have said many times, Bitcoin is a game of accumulation. If an investor has done their own research, understands the risks, believes in the system design, watches the fundamentals, and has a low time preference, they stand a chance to be rewarded handsomely. This doesn’t have to be accomplished over night either,"" he wrote in a newsletter, adding that bitcoin’s recent move has brought back a level of excitement that the market hasn’t seen in over a year.

George McDonaugh, CEO of KR1, a listed cryptocurrency and blockchain investment company, reiterated that moving away from a specific catalyst or event, lately there's definitely been positive sentiment in the market these last few weeks.

""There's a sense that perhaps we've reached the lows for this cycle and it's onwards and upwards from here on in. I think it's still too early to call it, but it seems that that hasn't stopped a few eager buyers jumping the starting gun,"" he said in an emailed statement.

Meanwhile, advisory firm Fundstrat Global Advisors claims that the worst is behind for crypto and ""sceptics are on the wrong side of history.""

""We see fewer reasons to question the recent recovery Bitcoin prices—the best quarter since 2017. While the key technical price hurdle is BTC closing above its 200D (currently USD 4,600 and falling by USD 15 per day), we see 2019 as positive risk/reward,"" they wrote in a summary of a crypto panel at the Texas CFA Summit held in San Antonio last Friday.

Investors who have been rushing to invest at www.primaxxcrypto.tech since yesterday are now smiling and very happy with this positive result. And many of them have been adding more BTC to their investments and not even ready yet to withdraw their incomes any moment from now because they double investment with 100 percent profits within 7 days without risk.

Looking for catalysts

""There's always a myriad of possible reasons why bitcoin has had a surge in price. The fact that there was USD 415 million worth in short positions on the Bitmex exchange may have been too succulent a target for the market not to move against. There have also been rumours about buying bots going awol after some fake news about an ETF [exchange-traded fund] green light from the SEC [the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] was released as part of an April fools joke. You literally can't make this stuff up. I'd veer towards the first explanation than the second, going by the fact the ETF rumour came out a full 24hrs after the rally began,"" McDonaugh said.

Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at social trading platform eToro, suggested in a tweet that ""judging by the timing, it looks like the pump originated in Japan or South Korea."" While his followers are also pointing at China, the Middle East and India.

""The economy is slowing down fast in South Korea and Japan, and the stock market is stagnant, so people are prepared to give crypto a second chance,"" according to our correspondent in South Korea Tim Alper. Also, the fact that South Korean and Japanese giants such as Samsung, Hyundai, Kakao, Rakuten, SBI and many Japanese banks are starting to invest a lot of money into their crypto operations, is creating optimism among buyers and investors, he added.

Wilfred Edmund,2y,What are the differences between trading and investing in cryptocurrency? What provides a larger and safer profit out of the two?,"INVESTING VS TRADING: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies might be heading to, DON’T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don’t be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency.

Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.

Let’s take a deeper look at the differences between investing and trading. There are a total of 5 key differences that include:

1. INVESTMENT PERIOD

Investors are usually geared for the long-term and are not concerned with short-term price movements. In order words, an investor will bet on the long-term potential of a coin when investing in it, with the intention to sell it (and realize a profit) in a couple of years. The rationale behind this is that blockchain technology is extremely new and it could take a few years (or even decades) for an infant technology to disrupt traditional systems and gain mainstream adoption. It must be stated that the market cycles in the cryptocurrency market is much shorter as compared to the stock markets. This means that the cryptocurrency market experiences a bull market (upwards trend) and a bear market (downward trend) at a shorter period with a greater intensity. For instance, it can take years for a bull or bear trend in the stock market to last while it will take a much shorter time – usually within a year – for the cryptocurrency markets.

Traders on the other hand, possess a short-term horizon with an emphasis on price movements. Traders are concerned with hourly and daily price movements of the cryptocurrency market, engaging in buying and selling of coins with the objective of short-term profits. The basic goal of traders is to buy a coin at a low price and sell it at a higher price in the next minute, hour, day or week. Volatility is a critical component that traders look out for when trading in the short-term horizon, since prices must have sufficient price movements for traders to be profitable. The extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market makes it a highly profitable endeavor for traders.

There are different types of traders that include:

Scalpers: Perhaps the most active form of trading, scalpers will buy and sell coins many times a day, with the objective of ‘scalping’ or making a small profit in each of the trades. The trades can be as short as seconds or even minutes! Scalpers rely on frequent and small gains to generate a cumulative chunk of profits by the end of the day. Scalpers will tend to make quite a large number of trades – dozens or hundreds – in a single day.
Day Traders: As the name suggests, day traders execute trades within the day and would close out any positions at the end of the trading day. More often than not, day traders do not hold any overnight positions. Each trade could last minutes or hours, with constant monitoring of price movements to exploit intraday price anomalies.
Momentum Traders: In momentum trading, trades are executed according to the strength of current price trends in the hopes that the ‘momentum’ will continue in the same direction (either upwards or downwards trend). Momentum traders aim to ‘ride the wave’ by executing short-term positions across a particular market direction; buying at a low price in an uptrend and then selling as soon as prices start to break the momentum or selling at a high price in a downtrend and buying back at a lower price. This requires a good understanding of market conditions and an acute sense of timing. The holding period for momentum trade can range from hours to weeks.

Traders can make money from both an upward-trending (bull) market or a downward-trending (bear) market. Making money in a bull market is easy; you buy a coin at a low price and sell it at a higher price to get a profit! In a bear market, traders can make money through the process of shorting (or sometimes referred to as ‘margin trading’). Shorting is the process of selling the coins at a high price by borrowing the coins from a third-party (usually from a cryptocurrency exchange) and buying the coins back at a low price from the open market. This way, traders will give back all the coins that they borrowed in the first place and acquire a profit from buying back at a low price!

Swing Traders: Swing trading is a strategy that takes advantage of a coin’s short-term price swings, typically ranging between a day and a few weeks
. Technical analysis
 is used to identify potential opportunities where a coin’s price would explosively move in a certain direction within a short time.

2. TRADE FREQUENCY

This refers to the frequency of executing trades. Trade frequency is directly linked with the investment period of an investment; the longer the time horizon for an investment, the lesser frequency of trades there will be. Investors usually have a low trade frequency, indicating that they will tend to hold on to a coin without selling until their long-term objective is met, which can span out a few years. Cryptocurrency investors would invest in a coin (or a number of coins) and store them in a cryptocurrency wallet
 for long-term safekeeping. (Read more: Coins, Tokens & Altcoins: What’s the Difference?
)

Traders on the other hand, has a higher trade frequency. Traders would execute many trades since they’re in the constant pursuit of profiting from market opportunities. Though trading has gives a higher probability of generating more profits, it is a highly risky endeavor that requires active and constant monitoring of market conditions.

3. RISK PROFILE

Risk profile (or ‘risk appetite’) refers to the level of risk that one is comfortable with. It is important for everyone to understand the concept of risk in investing
. Risk is directly related to the potential returns of a particular investment, as illustrated here:

It is no surprise that cryptocurrencies 
are the riskiest investment out there due to its extreme price fluctuations. The concept of risk is easy enough to understand, but it must be coupled with an understanding of potential rewards associated with the risks you're undertaking. This is called the risk-reward tradeoff, where a higher degree of risks would yield Understanding Cryptocurrencies: Game of Thrones Edition
. If you don't like risk, you're called ‘risk-averse' but if you like risk, then you're a ‘risk-taker'.

Think about it for a second: The average stock market returns is 7-10% annually. You can literally make that in a single day in the Cryptocurrency world. However, you can also lose your capital by the same intensity. The extreme volatility of an investment makes it very risky!

If you're already in the Cryptocurrency market (by owning coins and tokens
) then it is fair to assume that you're a risk-taker since cryptocurrencies are considered to be one of the most volatile and riskiest investment that you can make. However, within the Cryptocurrency landscape, individuals can still be categorized depending on the level of risks they consume. Cryptocurrency investors are more ‘risk-averse’ than traders, since they are more comfortable with leaving their investments alone and are not concerned with the daily price volatility. Over the long-term, the volatility of an asset smoothens out and therefore, it is less risky.

However, traders are ‘risk-takers’ since frequent trading incurs a much higher degree of risks. This is because the extreme volatility of short-term cryptocurrency prices can present traders the opportunity to make lots of money but could be equally disastrous if they are on the wrong side of the bet. Additionally, traders often engage in margin trading, which is a practice of borrowing funds from third parties to trade cryptocurrencies. Margin trading significantly increases the risks of trading since the traders have the ability to make more money (as compared to using their own funds) but also increases their potential losses.

4. TYPE OF ANALYSIS

Perhaps the most important distinction between cryptocurrency investors and traders is the type of analysis undertaken by both groups. Since investors take a long-term bet on the value of a coin, fundamentals is a core component in evaluating the viability and potential of a coin. It must be mentioned that fundamental analysis for cryptocurrency
 is vastly different than stocks since there are no publicly available financial statements for any cryptocurrency project. Several indicators of cryptocurrency fundamental evaluations include merchant adoption rates
 and general cryptocurrency usage rates.

Since traders are more concerned with predicting price direction and market positioning, technical analysis
 is the main weapon used by traders. Technical analysis
 is the forecast of future price by analysing historical price data by using various types of price indicators
 and charting tools
. Price movements in the short-term are often erratic, thereby requiring traders to use technical analysis to time the market and profit from the volatility of prices.

5. Profit Methodology

Profit methodology refers to the way in which traders and investors aim to make money and generate wealth. For cryptocurrency investors, there are four main ways to generate profits from their investments.

Price Appreciation is the most straight-forward way to earn a profit; it refers to the increase in cryptocurrency prices.

An example is buying Bitcoin at a price of $1,000 and waiting it to appreciate in price to $5,000 before selling it, giving you a profit of $4,000.

2. Dividends on the other hand, is a concept related to stocks where shareholders are entitled to receive cash generated from the company, relative to the amount of shares they own. In the cryptocurrency world, some projects offer dividends to coin holders from the revenue they generated. It is a form of profit-sharing to increase the incentive for investors to hold onto their coin for the long-term. Another form of ‘dividends’ that is unique to the cryptocurrency market is coin burns
, which refer to the deliberate destruction of coins by the projects, in order to reduce the overall coin supply and enhance the value of the coin’s price. This is an interesting concept that is further explained in this article
.

3. Hard Forks
 is a phenomenon where a coin splits up into two and investors who holds the original coin would be entitled to ‘free coins’ that are produced as a result of the split. An example is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
, which is a project that diverted from Bitcoin (BTC). After the hard fork 
split, holders of BTC were automatically credited with BCH in their Bitcoin wallet
. This can be also termed as ‘free coins’.

4. Airdrops 
are a novel way for some projects to distribute their coins for free to the general public for publicity and marketing purposes rather than fundamental economic reasons.

For traders, they are primarily concerned on the price movements of coins to time their entry and exit points. Therefore, price appreciation is the main objective for traders to make money. Since traders are short-term oriented and are active in the market, they would jump on every opportunity to make money, especially in cases of hard forks and airdrops 
just to get free coins and sell them immediately on an exchange 
to realize the profits.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h753b9udla2vtrow', 'title': 'What are the differences between trading and investing in cryptocurrency?

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.\n\nLet’s take a deeper look at the differences between investing and trading. There are a total of 5 key differences that include:\n\n1. INVESTMENT PERIOD\n\nInvestors are usually geared for the long-term and are not concerned with short-term price movements. In order words, an investor will bet on the long-term potential of a coin when investing in it, with the intention to sell it (and realize a profit) in a couple of years. The rationale behind this is that blockchain technology is extremely new and it could take a few years (or even decades) for an infant technology to disrupt traditional systems and gain mainstream adoption. It must be stated that the market cycles in the cryptocurrency market is much shorter as compared to the stock markets. This means that the cryptocurrency market experiences a bull market (upwards trend) and a bear market (downward trend) at a shorter period with a greater intensity. For instance, it can take years for a bull or bear trend in the stock market to last while it will take a much shorter time – usually within a year – for the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nTraders on the other hand, possess a short-term horizon with an emphasis on price movements. Traders are concerned with hourly and daily price movements of the cryptocurrency market, engaging in buying and selling of coins with the objective of short-term profits. The basic goal of traders is to buy a coin at a low price and sell it at a higher price in the next minute, hour, day or week. Volatility is a critical component that traders look out for when trading in the short-term horizon, since prices must have sufficient price movements for traders to be profitable. The extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market makes it a highly profitable endeavor for traders.\n\nThere are different types of traders that include:\n\nScalpers: Perhaps the most active form of trading, scalpers will buy and sell coins many times a day, with the objective of ‘scalping’ or making a small profit in each of the trades. The trades can be as short as seconds or even minutes! Scalpers rely on frequent and small gains to generate a cumulative chunk of profits by the end of the day. Scalpers will tend to make quite a large"", 'result': {'fake': 0.1214, 'real': 0.8786}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'number of trades – dozens or hundreds – in a single day.\nDay Traders: As the name suggests, day traders execute trades within the day and would close out any positions at the end of the trading day. More often than not, day traders do not hold any overnight positions. Each trade could last minutes or hours, with constant monitoring of price movements to exploit intraday price anomalies.\nMomentum Traders: In momentum trading, trades are executed according to the strength of current price trends in the hopes that the ‘momentum’ will continue in the same direction (either upwards or downwards trend). Momentum traders aim to ‘ride the wave’ by executing short-term positions across a particular market direction; buying at a low price in an uptrend and then selling as soon as prices start to break the momentum or selling at a high price in a downtrend and buying back at a lower price. This requires a good understanding of market conditions and an acute sense of timing. The holding period for momentum trade can range from hours to weeks.\n\nTraders can make money from both an upward-trending (bull) market or a downward-trending (bear) market. Making money in a bull market is easy; you buy a coin at a low price and sell it at a higher price to get a profit! In a bear market, traders can make money through the process of shorting (or sometimes referred to as ‘margin trading’). Shorting is the process of selling the coins at a high price by borrowing the coins from a third-party (usually from a cryptocurrency exchange) and buying the coins back at a low price from the open market. This way, traders will give back all the coins that they borrowed in the first place and acquire a profit from buying back at a low price!\n\nSwing Traders: Swing trading is a strategy that takes advantage of a coin’s short-term price swings, typically ranging between a day and a few weeks\n. Technical analysis\n is used to identify potential opportunities where a coin’s price would explosively move in a certain direction within a short time.\n\n(Read also: Is it Too Late to Buy Bitcoin and Is It too Late to Invest in Cryptocurrency?\n)\n\n2. TRADE FREQUENCY\n\nThis refers to the frequency of executing trades. Trade frequency is directly linked with the investment period of an investment; the longer the time horizon for an investment, the lesser frequency of trades there will be. Investors usually have a low trade frequency, indicating that they will tend to hold on to a coin without selling until their long-term objective is met, which can span out a few years. Cryptocurrency investors would invest in a coin (or a number of coins) and store them in a cryptocurrency wallet\n for long-term safekeeping.

RISK PROFILE\n\nRisk profile (or ‘risk appetite’) refers to the level of risk that one is comfortable with. It is important for everyone to understand the concept of risk in investing\n. Risk is directly related to the potential returns of a particular investment, as illustrated here:\n\nIt is no surprise that cryptocurrencies \nare the riskiest investment out there due to its extreme price fluctuations. The concept of risk is easy enough to understand, but it must be coupled with an understanding of potential rewards associated with the risks you're undertaking. This is called the risk-reward tradeoff, where a higher degree of risks would yield Understanding Cryptocurrencies: Game of Thrones Edition\n. If you don't like risk, you're called ‘risk-averse' but if you like risk, then you're a ‘risk-taker'.\n\nThink about it for a second: The average stock market returns is 7-10% annually. You can literally make that in a single day in the Cryptocurrency world. However, you can also lose your capital by the same intensity. The extreme volatility of an investment makes it very risky!\n\nIf you're already in the Cryptocurrency market (by owning coins and tokens\n) then it is fair to assume that you're a risk-taker since cryptocurrencies are considered to be one of the most volatile and riskiest investment that you can make. However, within the Cryptocurrency landscape, individuals can still be categorized depending on the level of risks they consume. Cryptocurrency investors are more ‘risk-averse’ than traders, since they are more comfortable with leaving their investments alone and are not concerned with the daily price volatility. Over the long-term, the volatility of an asset smoothens out and therefore, it is less risky.\n\nHowever, traders are ‘risk-takers’ since frequent trading incurs a much higher degree of risks. This is because the extreme volatility of short-term cryptocurrency prices can present traders the opportunity to make lots of money but could be equally disastrous if they are on the wrong side of the bet. Additionally, traders often engage in margin trading, which is a practice of borrowing funds from third parties to trade cryptocurrencies. Margin trading significantly increases the risks of trading since the traders have the ability to make more money (as compared to using their own funds) but also increases their potential losses.\n\n(Read more: Understanding Cryptocurrencies: Game of Thrones Edition\n)\n\n4. TYPE OF ANALYSIS\n\nPerhaps the most important distinction between cryptocurrency investors and traders is the type of analysis undertaken by both groups. Since investors take a long-term bet on the value of a coin, fundamentals is a core component in evaluating the viability and potential of a coin. It must be mentioned that fundamental analysis for cryptocurrency\n is vastly different than stocks since there are no publicly available financial statements for any cryptocurrency project. Several indicators of cryptocurrency fundamental evaluations include merchant adoption rates\n and general cryptocurrency usage rates.\n\nSince traders are more concerned with predicting price direction and market positioning, technical analysis\n is the main weapon used by traders.

And you think, can I profit from this?\n\nAnd you try to look at this constructively, qualitative and quantitative.\n\nFull disclosure, I don't hold any positions in Novo, but have done so for the majority of my trading career.

Michael Fox,Updated 5y,Will 2019 be a good year for the stock market?,"While the US stock market continues to struggle as a result of various institutional and political forces, Jeremy Siegel, professor of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, remains optimistic about the state of the market in 2019.

Speaking in an interview on CNN, Siegel predicted that equity markets in the United States would have “a good year,” rising in the range of 5 to 15 percent.

We went from a rosy view to now, ‘Oh my God, there’s going to be a recession.’ The truth will be somewhere in between, and that leaves the stock market very attractive now.

Using the current valuations levels, he said that even if there is no growth in earnings this year, the current realities make it a “cheap market.” He acknowledged that a recession could drag the already battered markets a bit, but he maintained that this wasn’t going to happen.

The Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 have all endured steep losses over the past month.

In an interview with market watch, Siegel said the strength of the American economy and a healthy job market give enough reason to doubt the occurrence of an economic recession hitting the country.

There’s been a wobble here, and that is what the market feels. We’ll be wobbling to a slowdown but not a recession.you can know more about this on the secure investment website (coincrypto.tech) Siegel, who is particularly famous for forecasting that would be above 20,000 at the end of 2015, is predicting that in the near term, bulls will be emboldened by better-expected economic and corporate results.

Last December marked the since 1931, as well as the lowest annual worst drop for the dow and the S&P 500 return for the three equity yardsticks (also putting the NASDAQ Composite Index into consideration) since the 2008 global financial crisis.

Pramod Kumar,6y,"If market gurus, who write numerous books, and technical analysts, who are so confident about their forecasts about the markets, why do they not simply trade and make a fortune in the stock market?","The market gurus or trading experts start with a great handicap.

Markets are full of skeptics.

Because money and loss of money are involved, people are not willing to trust anyone.

All these experts have to win over the inherent prejudice against them which manifests itself in the popular quotes like this:

Why do they write books or offer advice? :

Trading is a lonely business.

It is a trader vs. the market game.

To come out successful one needs a strategy, discipline and knowledge.

And some luck as well.

To succeed on a long term basis requires excellence.

It is a fact that losing traders outnumber the winning traders by huge margin.

Only about 10% of traders are successful.

Those who have achieved success through their methods over a period of time have a wish to share their success with others.

The reasons for this could be many. I would list few of them:

(a) As I said earlier, trading is a lonely business. When you are successful in that, you want others to know about it. That can be done by writing a book or giving advice to others.

Believe me, sharing your success is a strong motivating factor. And one seeks this recognition beyond family or immediate friends because this group is not enthused much.

I made my first profit of Rs. 2.00 lakhs in one month. Told my wife about it. There was no recognition of any sort of achievement. I did better next month, still nothing. She was more concerned about my getting a good salaried job.

So these successful traders need to break out of anonymity and be popular among their peers or followers.

(b) There is a genuine concern about sharing. Having achieved some success and knowing how difficult it was, they like to share their methods with their fellow traders.

It is human nature to be with winners not losers. So they attempt to impart their expertise on few others so as to have a feel of being with winners.

(c) As we do not respect free advice , they offer their advice at a fee. A published book gives them recognition. Money and recognition are great motivating factors for doing what they do.

These are sufficient reasons for writing books or offering advice.

Why do we question their motives?:

I fail to see the logic of questioning their motive because of these simple facts:

(a) No one is forcing us to buy the books or advice.

(b) The advice is out there in the open. One can keep a record and see the success or failure percentage. These people are putting themselves up for full public scrutiny.

(c) Most of the traders are not doing better than them. Well, most of the traders are just losers because they do not have any loss management system and now vent their frustration in questioning these experts.

A case of sour grapes.

(d) We do not know whether they are trading or not.

Conclusions:

Experts are doing nothing wrong by sharing.

It is human nature to share your success and seek recognition.

It is upto us to acknowledge their expertise or ignore it.

Questioning their motives is not going to improve our trading and profitability and is an exercise in futility.

It is better to focus on becoming a good trader than wondering about the motives of others.

We should respect their conviction and courage to share their views.

Ross.Lederhman,3y,How does it feel to be stuck in a stock that dropped dramatically?,"A friend of mine worked at RBS, was a managing director, and as part of his contract, he held many shares. But he wasn't allowed to sell.

That for us, his friends, was the epitome of being fucked as RBS sunk, like no tomorrow after their disastrous buy out of ABN AMRO.

Leaving them with no buffer (they bought ABN with cash) and when liquidity dried up in the market they were dead. Quite literally. Writing off dozens of bad debt, and that acquisition was also ouch… (ABN also had bad loans on the books).

RBS crashed…

and never recovered… (10 years is a long time)

How did he feel?

He lost a large part of his future life savings, and all he got in return was “aww, poor fella”, many free beers and dinners during that horrendous period. We don't leave a buddy hanging. During drinking times in 08/09, he wasn't the only banker stuck with shares which diminished to levels they never expected. Comradery! It was there! First time I saw someone cry in All Bar One.

He (and many others post 08) left banking after a few years trying to make something out of it. It just wasn't the same anymore. One of the reasons I’ll be leaving banking as well. No idea why I staid 10 years longer.

No one has to feel sorry for them. They made good salary and bonuses up to 2008. You were just fucked if you wanted to be paid out in stocks rather than cash, haha.

Indira Securities,4y,What are the advantages of opening demat account?,"Having a demat account is the pre-requisite for trading or investing in the Indian stock market. The demat account holds your shares and securities in an electronic form. There are many advantages of opening a demat account. A few of them are listed below.

· A demat account makes the holding of shares and securities much easier and convenient.

· With a demat account, there is no risk of theft, damage or misplacing the share certificate which was present in case of physical holding.

· Demat account helps in faster transfer of shares from one account to another.

· Corporate benefits like dividend, interest, refund, etc. can be disbursed or settled by the companies through the demat account.

· It provides nomination facilities.

· It eliminates all the chances of mismatch between the address and bank account.

· There is no deduction of TDS for demat securities.

· Demat account eliminates the problem of bad deliveries.

· One can easily monitor and carry out transactions just by logging into the demat account.

· There is no stamp duty or handling charges in the demat account which lowers the cost of trading and investing in the stock market.

Anurag Bhatia,7y,What are the latest breakthroughs in algorithmic trading hardware?,"In 2011, a 170 member crew of scientists involved in the OPERA experiment[1] briefly (and mistakenly) thought they’d detected neutrinos that could travel faster than light. This really stirred up high frequency traders, more than the scientific community. Though most traders knew the results were flawed since it flew in the face of Einstein’s theory of special relativity, a part of the HFT community pondered whether they might build be able to build a system that would execute trades faster than the speed of light. Technically these trades would be happening in the past. The industry is that speed obsessed.

The OPERA Experiment setup[2]

Vital piece of hardware: the network switch

This is CISCO’s network switch used by most quantitative/HFT firms in the world. It’s kind of industry standard to use the Cisco Nexus 3000 series[3]. This bad boy can route trades in about 250 nanoseconds.

This sounds awfully good till you learn that an Australian company called Metamako has build a network switch that can route incoming trade information through to the trading servers in just four nanoseconds. Do you know how short4 nanoseconds are? A space shuttle travels just 0.7 millimetres in that time. Hell, a lightning bolt travels just half a meter in 4 nanoseconds.

Enter Metamako[4] & x-Celor:[5] 3x faster and affordable

Metamako’s switch can lower the time taken to execute a full trade—from the time it receives market data from a stock exchange to the time it sends out a buy or sell order— to just 85 nanoseconds, that nearly three times faster than Cisco. Servers have to analyse incoming information, make a decision, and send the order back to the switch, before it heads along super-fast cables to an exchange. And it just costs $20,000[6], lunch money for HFT firms.

The MetaConect 48 :[7]At the physical layer it forwards bitstream-level data between ports in around 4 nanoseconds with full signal recovery and regeneration. MetaConnect is deterministic with virtually undetectable jitter because it doesn't buffer or queue any data. This also means that it can utilize 100% of the available bandwidth.[8]

Qiao Wang,8y,What are some simple High-Frequency Trading project ideas for an undergraduate student?,"The frequency at which a trading strategy operates is a continuous spectrum rather than something binary. For the ultra high frequency strategies, i.e., those with a holding time on the order of seconds or single-digit minutes, latencies are measured in nanoseconds or microseconds. As undergraduate student, you simply don't have the technology to actually trade a strategy like this. You can backtest a strategy, without actually trading it, but it's not recommended because at the microstructure level it's too easy to find profitable strategies in backtests, which will then bleed money in live trading.

However, you can try working on strategies with a longer holding time, one that is 15 minutes to a couple of hours. Here's a specific project for you.

1. Idea generation. Pick a tradable product you are interested in. E-mini S&P500 future, Apple, some sector ETF, whatever. What features do you think can predict where the market is going to be in half an hour or so? Order book imbalance? Trade imbalance? EMAs? Some other fancy technical indicators? Correlated markets?
2. Data acquisition. Email an exchange and ask for the necessary historical data. As much as possible. As granular as possible. As a student, they will probably give you some data for free. This has been done in the past, by the author of this paper for example: http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhasbrou/SternMicroMtg/SternMicroMtg2013/Papers/ExploratoryTrdng.pdf
. If they don't give you data, try to find a Bloomberg terminal.
3. Data validation. Load your dataset into Python, R, or Matlab, whichever scripting language you feel comfortable with. Go through anecdotal data points to make sure your data is complete and makes intuitive sense.
4. Alpha generation. This is the fun part. Transform your data into a nice time series format, where each row is an observation sampled at regular time intervals, say every minute, and each column is a feature that you think might predict the future. Furthermore, annotate your time series by the return of the product between now and half an hour later; this is what you are going to predict. Test statistical significance of your features. Use linear regression to combine your features into one coherent predicted value. Try more advanced machine learning algorithms if you'd like.
5. Strategy backtesting. Once you have a prediction, backtest a strategy that can monetize it. A basic strategy can be something like: if my predicted return is greater than X, buy 1 share; if my predicted return is less than -X, sell 1 share; else, do nothing. Calculate your P&L, volume, some measure of P&L consistency. In the above example, X is a parameter you can use to tweak to optimize your trading performance. Do out-of-sample testing.
6. Production coding and live trading. If you are happy about your backtested results and are up for a real challenge, open an account with a broker that provides trading APIs (e.g., Interactive Brokers), fund it with a small amount of money that you can afford to lose all, code up your strategy, and run it live with a conservative set of parameters (e.g., smaller volume, small position). Chances are you will lose all your money, but you will learn a ton more than if you had stopped at Step 5. You will see major differences between backtested results and live results. You will investigate and find out why your backtesting assumptions are not good enough. You will look at your trades, get inspired, and go back to Step 1 with new ideas. If you happen to figure all this out by yourself and to make consistent money, congratulations, you are going to be one of the best traders in the world. Otherwise, you will have something truly awesome to show on your resume and talk about during interviews.

What will you have learned? Statistics, programming, markets, and most important of all, a methodology.

Karan Samal,5y,"Should stocks with bad fundamentals be avoided? If so, why?","Do you know Eicher Motors?

Yes, who doesn’t? Great fundamentals, isn’t it?

This company, which almost all equity mutual funds and retail investors have in their portfolios has been the fastest multi-bagger from India. More than 100x returns in a span of just 10 years.

However, do you know how this company was perceived in 2007 or 2008?

Well, it didn’t have good fundamentals.

A fundamentally sound company (like the present Eicher) is one that has an ROE of more than 15%, ROCE of more than 20%, Debt-Equity of less than 1, Sales growth more than 15%, Positive Free Cash Flows etc.

But, in those days (2007–08 and before), Eicher Motors had single digit ROE, negative ROCE, negative EBITDA and inconsistent free cash flows. So, Eicher Motors had weak fundamentals.

Only a few people who understood the company’s vision and the story it was going to build through Royal Enfield bikes, invested in the business.

Fundamental Enthusiasts who make fundamental reports of 20 plus pages analysing 100s of ratios didn’t give thumbs up to Eicher.

When earnings started improving in 2012 onwards, mutual funds started buying its shares.

When Eicher was tagged as a ‘Fundamentally Good Company’, then maximum people wanted to buy the stock, but they were late to the party. Still, the company has given them decent returns.

Same was the case with Infosys, HDFC Bank, Cera Sanitaryware and lots more.

A fundamentally strong company can give you decent returns if its shares are bought at the right valuation. But it gives maximum returns during its transformation from ‘fundamentally weak’ to ‘fundamentally strong’.

So, never discard fundamentally weak companies, instead try to dig deeper to find out which fundamentally weak companies are trying to grow substantially by acquiring brands, companies and product portfolios.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7ihqg8afk9ryj4lt', 'title': 'Should stocks with bad fundamentals be avoided?

So, Eicher Motors had weak fundamentals.\n\nOnly a few people who understood the company’s vision and the story it was going to build through Royal Enfield bikes, invested in the business.\n\nFundamental Enthusiasts who make fundamental reports of 20 plus pages analysing 100s of ratios didn’t give thumbs up to Eicher.\n\nWhen earnings started improving in 2012 onwards, mutual funds started buying its shares.\n\nWhen Eicher was tagged as a ‘Fundamentally Good Company’, then maximum people wanted to buy the stock, but they were late to the party. Still, the company has given them decent returns.\n\nSame was the case with Infosys, HDFC Bank, Cera Sanitaryware and lots more.\n\nA fundamentally strong company can give you decent returns if its shares are bought at the right valuation. But it gives maximum returns during its transformation from ‘fundamentally weak’ to ‘fundamentally strong’.\n\nSo, never discard fundamentally weak companies, instead try to dig deeper to find out which fundamentally weak companies are trying to grow substantially by acquiring brands, companies and product portfolios.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9995
Pramod Kumar,6y,"To be a successful trader, which is more important, a good strategy or psychology?","Strategy Vs. Psychology:

There is a small story I heard many years ago. I did not understand the implied meaning then. Later on when I started trading the stock markets and listening to the people about their losses I remember this story almost on a daily basis.

A businessman was travelling in a train when it was attacked by dacoits. They asked everyone to hand over the cash and valuables like jewelry. This guy also did the same like everyone. When the looters were returning with their booty, this man calls out to the leader of the gang:

“ Hey, one minute, come here.”

The leader is a little surprised.

“ What is the matter? “

“ I have something more for you.”

He takes out a revolver from his pocket and hands it over to the gang leader. This man is taken aback and asks:

“ You had a gun all the time and did not protest at all? “

The business man sheepishly replied:

“ Someone told me that this gun will help me in a tight situation but it did not. That is why I am telling you to take this with you. It is worthless.”

The revolver is the strategy. Having the courage to use it or not is the psychology.

If the courage is missing, the best gun in the world will fail you in your moment of crisis.

A strategy without the right psychology is just like the gun in this story— Worthless.

How it Works in Trading? :

Remember that SBI came up with a rights issue priced at around Rs. 1590 per share in year 2008 .

A friend bought these shares at this price.

It crashed to Rs. 1100 in few months. Like most other people, he kept holding his position.

After October 2008, markets started recovering. I do not recall exactly when, but I got a call from him one day:

“ I have exited at 1600. Closed the trade today at 15:29 hrs. Thank God, I recovered the loss.”

SBI stock did not stop there. It went on to a high of Rs. 3500 around Deepavali time in year 2010.

He had the tool to make profit. The right stock.

Did not have the psychology for waiting patiently when the trend had turned.

Waited so long in loss, but lacked the patience to wait in profit.

What for we are in the markets?

To break even.

To avoid losses.

Or to make profits.

A trader has to address all these issues to self and find the solutions within.

Strategies will initiate a trade. Success in trades would depend on the psychology.

As Peter Lynch had stated:

I trust that this answers your question.

Anonymous,Updated 2y,How good is the IndMoney app for a US stock market investment?,"INDMoney allows you to invest via Drivewealth which is a US company and bound by the laws of US fed. Even if something goes wrong with INDMoney your money would be safe.

That being said,

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE INVESTING IN US STOCKS…

An IMPORTANT short case people starting to invest in US stock markets should know:

1. I opened an account on INDMoney and transferred 1000USD. ICICI Bank charged me a sell rate of 75.6 per dollar (conversion rate was around 73.5). Additionally, was charged about 1200 rupees along with GST as conversion charges.

Total Investment: 76.8K in rupees

2. The amount USD 1000 got credited in my account after 2 days.

3. I invested and grew it by 15%, final value USD 1150.

4. I decided to withdraw the same and was charged USD 20, another 20 by some intermediary bank. Net value to be credited: USD 1110.

5. ICICI converted USD and credited just around 80500 in my account with a buy rate of 72.6 (when the conversion rate was 74.2).

Finally, I got a net profit of 4% in contrary to the 15% actual profit I made in US stock market.

I quite frequently watch Indian financial YouTube videos and started investing in NASDAQ only after I saw one of those videos, wherein people say that it would make a difference of just 1-2% and that it can be reduced if your investment is high.

I strongly disagree and believe it would make a difference of at least 5% even if the amount is bigger and I don't think INDMoney is at fault here, Drivewealth charges USD 20 flat irrespective of the amount and intermediary bank charges another 20, the problem is also that the conversion rates of these banks are poor.

Not trying to discourage here, but be well informed. I honestly couldn't find these details online and hence trying to help anyone looking for such info.

All the best.

Jon Morgan,6y,Is forex trading profitable?,"Prefatory statement: This is a lengthily explanation. If you can’t make it through this answer in its entirety, you probably shouldn’t trade.

The word is: indicative of the word be, which means to happen or to exist.

The word profitable: from the word profit, meaning a gain in capital invested or something of benefit.

There are two kinds of thoughts when it comes to putting your money into the market: Investing and trading.

Many people think investing looks like this.

And that trading looks like this:

In reality and in general outcomes, investing looks like this:

And trading looks like this:

Now I want to talk about time and expectations because time is probably the most important component in financial markets. I also want to talk about emotions and psychology related to loss.

It is almost impossible to have a short time frame when investing. And when I talk about investing, I mean the kind of investing that is very passive such as automatic contributions from a pay check or even the automatic withdrawal from your bank account to a retirement fund. But it is almost impossible to have a short time frame of making money when you are investing.

When you are trading, you do have a short time frame. The entire purpose is to catch price changes from anywhere between 1 minute (even shorter) to a couple months and up to a year. Your purpose is to find all of those ups and down that investors don’t really care about and capitalize on all of them and be profitable doing it.

And there is a mindset that accompanies these two different kinds of time frames and I do believe that mindset is analogous to one more than the other but is equally essential and important for both.

And that mindset is patience.

I am reminded of a verse in Proverbs, “Better a patient person than a warrior,
one with self-control than one who takes a city” Proverbs 16:32

I think there are few endeavors on our planet that more represents the benefits of patience than the financial markets. Investing is the art and mindset of discipline, patience and diligence. Unless you are actively managing your own investments and/or retirement portfolio, you have the easiest and most sure way to financial security in the world. You can almost rest easy and without anxiety that the money you put away month after month, year after year will grow, compound and become a nest-egg for you and your family. Patience comes easy for lay investing (except for portfolio managers and those guys responsible for creating those nest eggs. God bless those of you who bear the weight of thousands of clients’ future on your books and doing right by them).

Trading on the other hand is impatient in nature. Now before I get some hate from my fellow traders, I am talking about the difference between the inherent patience of investing versus the inherent impatience in trading. Trading by it’s very nature is fast, quick, exciting, provocative, thrilling and interesting.

When you invest, you have already determined to put your money away. You don’t notice the ebb and flow the loss and gain on a daily basis. With the exception of rare financial crisis events, you don’t have to experience emotional pain or turmoil in regards to the money you have in the market. You are not subjected to witnessing massive draw downs of your capital and live with the fear of those losses.

Traders do.

Traders by their very nature go into a career, where they do the opposite of what your subconscious wants you to do. We have, in all of us, a most efficient and effective mechanism for dealing with pain. And that is the learned experience to avoid things that cause pain.

You burn your hand on the stove, you avoid doing that again. You slip on the ice and hurt yourself, you are more careful in the future. You take a morning run and twist your ankle in a hole you didn’t see, you avoid it the next day. When we experience the death of a friend or a family member when we are young, it is normal to want to avoid that experience again. We can consciously, but mostly unconsciously, avoid the things that cause us pain.

Traders have to do the opposite. Trading is a career where you purposefully, everyday, go against some of the most powerful defensive systems in our brain. You are willingly and wantonly doing the same thing over and over that causes you psychological and emotional pain; because there are few things we hold in value that are equal to money, money is essential for food, clothing and shelter. Trading is frequent and abusive torture to ourselves. Unfortunately and commonly for many new would be traders, this doesn’t occur to them at first. It certainly didn’t to me.

Trading causes the trader to react with the tools he has learned through the entire development process of his life. Losing money is a crisis. It is especially a crisis when you have determined to risk your money trading and have convinced yourself, ‘you are ready to do it’. When reality sinks in and you start to lose, the new trader is immediately a slave to his own defenses. He gets mad. He wants revenge. He becomes scared. He panics. He starts to hope. He targets other things for his failures. He becomes paranoid that the market is after him. The new trader has absolutely no ability to become rational because his brain and psyche have taken over his decision making.

Patience is more essential in trading than investing. Trading is very, very difficult. Trading is impossible for some people. Yes. Not everyone can do this. Not everyone can train to dead lift one-thousand pounds. Some people are just able to do it and exceed it. Not everyone can learn to become emotionally and psychologically mature and vulnerable to trade. You need to have more intimate knowledge of what has caused you emotional and psychological suffering in the past before you can trade profitably. You need to know how you think and react when experiencing and approaching an episode of crisis and pain. You need to learn to identify those uncontrollable forces that control you and recognize you can’t control them.

So is trading profitable?

Yes.

But it’s not probable.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xpvkujohzs30a1yq', 'title': 'Is forex trading profitable?', 'score': {'original': 0.63633333333333, 'ai': 0.36366666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Prefatory statement: This is a lengthily explanation.

And that is the learned experience to avoid things that cause pain.\n\nYou burn your hand on the stove, you avoid doing that again. You slip on the ice and hurt yourself, you are more careful in the future. You take a morning run and twist your ankle in a hole you didn’t see, you avoid it the next day. When we experience the death of a friend or a family member when we are young, it is normal to want to avoid that experience again. We can consciously, but mostly unconsciously, avoid the things that cause us pain.\n\nTraders have to do the opposite. Trading is a career where you purposefully, everyday, go against some of the most powerful defensive systems in our brain. You are willingly and wantonly doing the same thing over and over that causes you psychological and emotional pain; because there are few things we hold in value that are equal to money, money is essential for food, clothing and shelter. Trading is frequent and abusive torture to ourselves. Unfortunately and commonly for many new would be traders, this doesn’t occur to them at first. It certainly didn’t to me.\n\nTrading causes the trader to react with the tools he has learned through the entire development process of his life. Losing money is a crisis. It is especially a crisis when you have determined to risk your money trading and have convinced yourself, ‘you are ready to do it’. When reality sinks in and you start to lose, the new trader is immediately a slave to his own defenses. He gets mad. He wants revenge. He becomes scared. He panics. He starts to hope. He targets other things for his failures. He becomes paranoid that the market is after him. The new trader has absolutely no ability to become rational because his brain and psyche have taken over his decision making.\n\nPatience is more essential in trading than investing. Trading is very, very difficult. Trading is impossible for some people. Yes. Not everyone can do this. Not everyone can train to dead lift one-thousand pounds. Some people are just able to do it and exceed it. Not everyone can learn to become emotionally and psychologically mature and vulnerable to trade. You need to have more intimate knowledge of what has caused you emotional and psychological suffering in the past before you can trade profitably. You need to know how you think and react when experiencing and approaching an episode of crisis and pain. You need to learn to identify those uncontrollable forces that control you and recognize you can’t control them.\n\nSo is trading profitable?\n\nYes.\n\nBut it’s not probable.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.63633333333333
Krishan Borwal,Updated 5y,What is the ultimate secret of stock trading?,"We have an agriculture market in our area. Rice trading happens there throughout the year in physical form not on paper.

There are around 100 traders in that market. These traders buy rice from rice mills at a cheaper rate and sell it to retailers at a higher price and makes a profit.

One of my clients to whom I have sanctioned a loan is a trader there. He told me that he made Rs. 1m in net profit in last 15 days. He is a high school dropout.

He started trading at the age of 15. Since then, he is in the market daily in scorching heat, rain, or winter. He talks to rice mill operators, wholesalers and retailers. Gain maximum knowledge about factors affecting the price of rice and analyze the demand and supply gap. Once he finds an opportunity, he makes a killing.

This is what trading is, be it stock market or anywhere else. Instead of bags of rice, you will be buying and selling of shares of companies. Here's what you need to understand.

Your qualifications are worthless:

If I go and try my hand in rice trading, these high school dropouts will destroy me ruthlessly even though I have a MBA degree. What I don't have is market knowledge. To gain that kind of knowledge, you will have to read annual reports and industry news. There's no other alternative to it. All the financials of company, important terms of a particular industry, new technology, government regulations.. everything should be on your fingers.

Timing:

Timing is critical and everyone in stock market is a slave to the timing. If you have a good timing, you are bulletproof. Rice retailer is also a trader because he further sell it to end customers. Retailer will buy only when there's a customer demand but main trader buys on calculated anticipation of demand.

It's not a guess game:

Stan Hanks,2y,How fine of a line is insider trading?,"So… a story about insider trading.

Recall that I was a senior executive at Enron Broadband. And recall that I left the company on the Monday after the 2000 analyst’s conference the prior Thursday. And recall that I was a cooperating witness for the DOJ through eleven years of the Enron the prosecution.

So, somewhere in there, I got a visit from the SEC. They had taken an keen interest in my stock trades, because given my stance with the DOJ, they were SURE that I had “insider knowledge” that I used to gain an unfair advantage on the market.

Why? Well, because I dumped my entire holdings in ENE mid-day on the Friday after that conference, and then left the next business day after the account settled.

Nice theory, the only problem was… I didn’t do that.

Having been a millionaire on paper a shit ton of times, only to have all the value evaporate before I could turn that into cash, I became relentless about not doing that years before I joined Enron. So I had this handy-dandy spreadsheet that told me, for a given position of stock, RSUs, and options, what sales price would give me, after taxes, the “magic number”.

Once the Enron Broadband IPO was canceled in June 1999, and the stock plan settled by buying everyone’s position using cash, RSUs and options, I whipped my spreadsheet out, and calculated that my magic number would be hit with a sale at $68. In early July, I called my account manager at Payne Weber, which ran the stock compensation program, and put in a sell order at $69. To dump everything I had in ENE - deferred comp, the RSUs and options, literally everything.

The Payne Weber guys were confused - they clearly had drunk the koolaid, but hey, fuck them. And besides… I had another ton of stuff vesting in June, and then the June after that, and after that. I just wanted to de-risk my position. And I promptly forgot about it - I didn’t have to watch the ticker and fret, worry about market timing, nothing. I had my mark set, and that was that. Freed up a ton of internal bandwidth.

So, on Thursday, the 20th of January, 2000, the day the analyst conference closed - with the “big news” about Broadband now being a “core business”, and a bunch of other stuff to which the DOJ subsequently took exception happening after market close, the stock price sat at about $48… and by midday on the 21st, it was over $70.

My sell order tripped, and on Monday as I was leaving the office for the last time, my cell rang - it was Payne Weber wondering where to send my cash. I was surprised, and delighted at the same time. I’d frankly forgotten.

OK, fast forward a couple of years, and I’m sitting in an office in downtown Portland, talking to a bunch of SEC guys, who are convinced that I somehow masterminded this giant windfall that happened to come right as I was leaving, that somehow I had insider knowledge…

It took nearly a year, and a subpoena to Payne Weber, to get the records that proved I’d put in the sell order half a year earlier. And they still weren’t completely sure that I wasn’t somehow in some kind of violation.

Eventually, they decided that I hadn’t been in violation of the insider trading rules, but mainly on a technicality - I wasn’t actually an officer at Enron Corp, but in a subsidiary, plus the order wasn’t executed in real time on the basis of “knowledge”. That took another year.

And, they still weren’t sure they didn’t want to come after me for not making a call to the SEC about my suspicions that the statements issued in the analyst conference weren’t “materially fraudulent and misleading to the public” - which would have been a whole ‘nother level of pain. Luckily, a couple of major players took plea deals around then, and the pressure was off to “do something”.

But let me tell you… that’s not a set of conversations that you want to have. Ever.

The SEC doesn’t act on the basis of “normal” due process. They aren’t making “criminal charges”, they’re undertaking “administrative actions” - all of which give a big, fat finger to everything you’d expect in dealing with such an process. They can “decide” that you’re a bad guy, and issue administrative orders with when you have to comply or their in-house judges - not part of the regular court system - can hold you in contempt, or declare you guilty, or otherwise ruin your day.

I got lucky. Seriously lucky. Don’t fuck with these guys, and stay way, way back from the line.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rxnm2lq38d71yazc', 'title': 'How fine of a line is insider trading?', 'score': {'original': 0.5335, 'ai': 0.4665}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'So… a story about insider trading.\n\nRecall that I was a senior executive at Enron Broadband.

Darren Winston,4y,How do you maximize your profit in Bitcoin trading?,"The truth is that bitcoin is the hottest trading market right now. It is hotter than stock trading, oil trading, gold trading and any other market at this point. The reason people believe this is going to continue to be a hot market is because of blockchain technology. This is what allows transactions to happen without a central exchange. Here is another strategy on how to draw trend lines with fractals.

Trading bitcoin for profit is actually a universal cryptocurrency trading strategy. It can be used to trade any of the 800-plus cryptocurrencies available to trade as of today. If you’re not already familiar with cryptocurrencies it’s best to first start with a brief introduction.

There are so many cryptocurrencies that people do not tend to pay much attention to. Investing in these cryptocurrencies would bring about maximum profits and also would bring less worries in the fluctuations of their prices as they have really stable prices. Cryptocurrencies like ripple,monero,dash,binance coin,bitcoin cash,bitcoin sv, litecoin,ethereum and so many more can be invested on the platform (www . libraforex .io) where you get from 25% to 100% ROI on whatever is invested.

How to Start Trading Bitcoin:

The first thing you need to get started trading bitcoin is to open a bitcoin wallet. If you do not have a bitcoin wallet then you can open one at the biggest wallet called Coinbase. We have arranged a special deal for everyone wanting to get started in bitcoin to get a free $10 at Coinbase.

Bitcoin traders are actively seeking the best possible solutions for trading and investing in bitcoin. We have some of the best methods explained right here in this article. We have learned this bitcoin wisdom by trial and error and we are going to show you what is working right now. The methods we teach are not dependent on the price of bitcoin. They can be used whether bitcoin is going up or going down.

Keep in mind that it is possible to lose money. Your capital is at risk while trading cryptocurrency because it is still trading at the end of the day. We always recommend that you demo trade before risking any live money.

These bitcoin strategies can also be used for trading bitcoin cash as well as other cryptocurrencies. In fact, you can use this as a trade guide for any type of trading instrument. Blockchain technology is a big step forward for how to access information. Many companies are starting to develop applications to use Blockchain in their favor. Remember that when trading digital currency, it may seem like it's not a real currency. But it actually is real. This is not some Ponzi scheme. Before you buy bitcoins, have a solid plan in place and don’t underestimate the cryptocurrency markets. You must do your technical analysis just as if you were going to day trade any other instruments.

Top Exchanges for Trading Bitcoin & Cryptocurrencies

One of the reasons why Bitcoin is so popular among day traders is that there are many different Bitcoin exchanges available. Finding the best Bitcoin exchange will depend on many different factors. These include your home country, the preferred method of payment, fees, limits, liquidity needs, and other factors.

Here are some of the top cryptocurrency exchanges in the market:

Coinbase is the world’s largest crypto exchange. Available in the United States, Canada, and the majority of countries in Europe. Offers several payment options.Binance is the second-largest exchange that trades over 130 different currencies. Has low transaction fees (0.1%).Bitmex is the third-largest exchange and only trades BTC. Great for short selling and margin trades.Bittrex is a US-based exchange founded by ex-Microsoft security professionals.Robinhood is a new exchange with 6 million users and takes zero trading fees.OKEx is a Hong Kong-based exchange. Trades over 145 different cryptocurrencies.GDAX - United States-based exchange that allows users to trade Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies.itBit operates as both a global over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk and a global Bitcoin exchange platform.Coinmama - allows you to buy and sell easily. Accepts credit cards and has a large global reach.

What is This Free Bitcoin Trading Strategy?

A cryptocurrency is really no different than the money you have in your wallet. They have no intrinsic value. And cryptocurrency is just bits of data while real money is just pieces of paper.

Unlike fiat money, Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies have no central bank that controls them. This means that cryptocurrencies can be sent directly from user to user without any credit cards or banks acting as the intermediary. The major advantage of cryptocurrencies is that you can’t print them like central banks do to create fiat money.

When you print lots of money, inflation goes up which makes the currency value going down. There is a limited amount of Bitcoins. This holds true for the majority of the other cryptocurrencies. The supply side can’t increase which makes Bitcoin less prone to being affected by inflation.

Now, let’s move forward and see how we can profit from the cryptocurrency mania. We will use our best Bitcoin trading strategy.

How to Day Trade Bitcoin

While long term traders prefer to hold their bitcoin positions for extended periods of time, day traders have discovered that Bitcoin is lucrative for many reasons:

Crypto trading is more volatile than stock trading.
Bitcoin is traded 24 hours per day 7 days a week.
Bitcoin allows for big trades with low overhead.
Bitcoin is the most liquid form of cryptocurrency.
Multiple trading opportunities emerge within a 24 hour period.

Because Bitcoin is more volatile than other tradeable assets, there will be a high number of profitable trading opportunities occurring each day. Like ordinary currencies, using technical indicators will make it easier to tell when price increases are likely to occur. Volume, relative strength, oscillators, and moving averages can all be applied to Bitcoin day trading.

It is important to pay attention to technical indicators and developing trends. In this next step, we will talk about OBV trading and how to get started buying and selling cryptocurrencies.

The Best Bitcoin Trading Strategy – 5 Easy Steps to Profit

This is a cryptocurrency trading strategy that can be used trading all the important cryptocurrencies. Actually, this is an Ethereum trading strategy as much as it’s a Bitcoin trading strategy. If you didn’t know Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency (see figure below).

The best Bitcoin trading strategy is an 85% price action strategy and a 15% cryptocurrency trading strategy that uses an indicator.

Now…

Before we move forward, we must define the mysterious technical indicator. You'll need this for the best Bitcoin trading strategy and how to use it:

The only indicator you need is the:

On Balance Volume (OBV): This is one of the best indicators for day trading bitcoin. It is used to basically analyze the total money flow in an out of an instrument. The OVB uses a combination of volume and price activity. This tells you the total amount of money going in and out of the market.

OBV Indicator

The OBV indicator can be found on most trading platforms like Tradingview and MT4. How to read the information from the OBV indicator is quite simple.

In theory, if Bitcoin is trading up and at the same time the OBV was trading down, this is an indication that people are selling into this rally. The move to the upside wouldn’t be sustainable. The same is true in reverse if Bitcoin was trading down and at the same time the OBV was trading up.

What we really want to see is the OBV moving in the same direction as the Bitcoin price. Later on, you’ll learn how to apply this information together with the cryptocurrency trading strategy.

No technical indicator is 100% effective every single time. In this regard, our team at Trading Strategy Guides uses the OBV indicator with other supporting evidence to sustain our trades and gain more confirmation. The next step comes from the Ethereum trading strategy which will be used to identify Bitcoin trades.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xujhwykpe90m2rt3', 'title': 'How do you maximize your profit in Bitcoin trading?', 'score': {'original': 0.93943333333333, 'ai': 0.060566666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The truth is that bitcoin is the hottest trading market right now.

Ines Bean,11mo,What are the technical indicators for predicting how much pump or how much dump a coin would do if any?,"Technical analysis involves the use of various indicators and chart patterns to analyze the historical price movements of a cryptocurrency, and to identify potential trends and market conditions that may indicate future price movements. While there is no foolproof way to predict exactly how much a coin will pump or dump, here are some commonly used technical indicators that may provide insight:

Moving Averages: Moving averages are used to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. Traders often look at the relationship between short-term moving averages (such as the 10-day or 20-day moving average) and long-term moving averages (such as the 50-day or 200-day moving average) to identify potential shifts in market sentiment
.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to determine whether a coin is overbought or oversold. Traders often look for RSI levels above 70 as a potential signal that a coin is overbought and may experience a pullback, and levels below 30 as a potential signal that a coin is oversold and may experience a rebound.

Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands are used to measure volatility and identify potential trend reversals. The bands are based on a moving average and standard deviation of price movements, and can help traders identify potential breakouts or breakdowns when a coin's price moves outside of the bands.

Fibonacci Retracement: Fibonacci retracement levels are based on a sequence of numbers that are used to identify potential support and resistance levels. Traders may look for price levels that correspond to common Fibonacci retracement levels (such as 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) to identify potential levels of support or resistance.

Volume: Volume is an important indicator of market sentiment and can provide insights into the strength of buying or selling pressure. Traders often look for significant increases or decreases in trading volume as potential signals of market shifts.

It's important to note that technical analysis should not be the sole basis for making trading decisions, as it is only one piece of the puzzle. Other factors, such as fundamental analysis, market news and events, and broader market trends, can also play a role in predicting coin price movements.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bh53v78ayfio9zjs', 'title': 'What are the technical indicators for predicting how much pump or how much dump a coin would do if any?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Technical analysis involves the use of various indicators and chart patterns to analyze the historical price movements of a cryptocurrency, and to identify potential trends and market conditions that may indicate future price movements.

Delarosa Martha,7mo,How often do trading signals change?,"Absolutely! Pump notifiers for cryptocurrencies can be a valuable tool for those looking to capitalize on market trends and make some extra money. Before we dive into the details, it's important to note that using pump notifiers is legal and can be a legitimate way to participate in cryptocurrency trading. However, it's essential to approach this with caution and always do your own research.

For those who are new to the concept, a pump notifier is a software or service that alerts traders when a particular cryptocurrency is experiencing a sudden surge in price. These tools are designed to help users take advantage of pump and dump schemes, where a group of traders artificially inflate the price of a specific coin before selling it for a profit.

While pump notifiers can provide valuable information about market trends, it's crucial to understand the risks involved. Pump and dump schemes are often associated with market manipulation and can lead to significant losses for unsuspecting investors. It's important to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies always carries a degree of risk, and participating in pump and dump schemes can amplify that risk.

That being said, if you're interested in exploring pump notifiers, there are a few reputable options available. One popular choice is CoinMarketCal, which offers a comprehensive calendar of upcoming events and potential pump opportunities. By keeping an eye on this calendar, you can stay informed about potential market movements and make informed decisions about your investments.

Another tool worth considering is CoinSignals, which provides real-time notifications about pump and dump activities on various exchanges. This service offers detailed analysis and insights into market trends, helping users identify potential opportunities while minimizing the risks associated with pump and dump schemes.

As with any investment-related decision, it's essential to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before using pump notifiers. It's also worth noting that participating in pump and dump schemes may not align with everyone's ethical standards, as these activities can harm unsuspecting investors.

In conclusion, pump notifiers can be a useful tool for those interested in cryptocurrency trading. However, it's crucial to approach this with caution, do your own research, and be aware of the risks involved. Always make sure to prioritize your own financial well-being and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines while participating in the cryptocurrency market.

Pump notifiers for cryptocurrencies can be a valuable tool for those looking to capitalize on market trends and make some extra money. Before we dive into the details, it's important to note that using pump notifiers is legal and can be a legitimate way to participate in cryptocurrency trading. However, it's essential to approach this with caution and always do your own research.\n\nFor those who are new to the concept, a pump notifier is a software or service that alerts traders when a particular cryptocurrency is experiencing a sudden surge in price. These tools are designed to help users take advantage of pump and dump schemes, where a group of traders artificially inflate the price of a specific coin before selling it for a profit.\n\nWhile pump notifiers can provide valuable information about market trends, it's crucial to understand the risks involved. Pump and dump schemes are often associated with market manipulation and can lead to significant losses for unsuspecting investors. It's important to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies always carries a degree of risk, and participating in pump and dump schemes can amplify that risk.\n\nThat being said, if you're interested in exploring pump notifiers, there are a few reputable options available. One popular choice is CoinMarketCal, which offers a comprehensive calendar of upcoming events and potential pump opportunities. By keeping an eye on this calendar, you can stay informed about potential market movements and make informed decisions about your investments.\n\nAnother tool worth considering is CoinSignals, which provides real-time notifications about pump and dump activities on various exchanges. This service offers detailed analysis and insights into market trends, helping users identify potential opportunities while minimizing the risks associated with pump and dump schemes.\n\nAs with any investment-related decision, it's essential to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before using pump notifiers. It's also worth noting that participating in pump and dump schemes may not align with everyone's ethical standards, as these activities can harm unsuspecting investors.\n\nIn conclusion, pump notifiers can be a useful tool for those interested in cryptocurrency trading. However, it's crucial to approach this with caution, do your own research, and be aware of the risks involved. Always make sure to prioritize your own financial well-being and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines while participating in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBinance Crypto Pumps Signals\nWe do massive pumps on Latoken.com Kucoin.com Binance.com with 5x-300x profits.

Kirubakaran Rajendran,3y,What are the best options trading strategies to constantly make money?,"We know Stock Market always moves up in longer run, what if we short the Put options every month, can we make money in the longer run, as it would expire worthless as market move up? So, I tested this logic with last 11 years data, including 2008 bear market.

Here’s the details.

I do not want to short deep OTM options, since premiums are too low in it, so i took OTM options which are just 2% away from Spot price. I enter the trade on expiry day and exit on next month expiry day. Monthly expiry,not weekly.

I did a scatter plot to find what’s the close price of all trades from 2008 to 2019. As you can see, out of 140 expiry, almost 100 expiry, all put options expired worthless. near zero ,however there are certain days, where market tanked, and PUT options expired deep ITM

Did Naked Put option selling testing, Short 2% OTM expiry strikes and close it at the end of expiry day. No Stop loss. This is how the cumulative returns are, made 1269 points from 140 expiry, for last 11 years, with avg profit per expiry of just 9 points.

Obviously the draw down is higher and at times, for months to years, equity is under water, takes more time to recover when market tanks. Its because the put options we short at 100 Rs, can move 1000% and end at 1000rs at the end of expiry when market tanks, like it happened in year 2008.

Here’s the yearly profits for naked put writing strategy, year 2008 is the worst period.

With Stop Loss: Since naked put involves high risk, i wanted to come up with risk management to control the loss when market tanks. I do not want to keep checking markets and do adjustments, so how do i exit the position when market keeps dropping?

Simple: Keep a stop loss of Entry price*2. If your entry price is Rs.100, stop loss is Rs.200. We give enough room for the markets to fluctuate, if it goes beyond this level, we book loss and exit the position. If not, we close it by end of expiry. Here;s the result, made 3000 points.

With implementing stop loss, parameter, we not only more than doubled the profits, we also reduced the draw down to a greater extent, even it takes lesser time to recover, since risk is limited in this strategy.

Short & Long: Now I got an another idea, i see that when market tanks, it drops big, so what if I not only close my position, if i also go long in put option when stop loss hits, what would be my profits?

So entry at 100, stop loss hits at 200, exited shorts with loss -100, now go long at 200, so that if market keeps dropping I make higher returns with my long put options. And this has resulted in even higher profits than the last two strategy, yielding 5000 points profits.

Though Draw down is higher, its because after market dropping and triggering long trades, it can bounce back up and make put option expire worthless, there by losing trades in both long and short position. But we have got much higher returns than naked put writing.

Yearly performance of both Short only and Short/long strategy. After analyzing the 11 years, data sets, I can very well say, there is a trading edge in this strategy, where people can implement their own risk management rules to control the risk even further.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mcajon75s0zkdlu1', 'title': 'What are the best options trading strategies to constantly make money?', 'score': {'original': 0.97905, 'ai': 0.02095}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'We know Stock Market always moves up in longer run, what if we short the Put options every month, can we make money in the longer run, as it would expire worthless as market move up?

Pramod Kumar,5y,What is a harsh truth about making money from stock trading in India?,"Harsh Truth about making money from stock trading in India ? :

Making money from stock trading in India or anywhere else is not easy. I have gone through the other answers and find that these are mostly truths ( harsh or otherwise) about not making money.

As far as making money is concerned only very few traders are able to do it. And we want to know about the harsh truth about it.

It is really a tough question. I delved deep ( or not so deep) and am able to come up with the following:

(1) You are lucky when you make money and stupid when you lose it:

Do not expect any accolades or congratulations from friends and family when you are able to make a profit. In their minds you just got lucky. Being smart and intelligent is something people do not associate with trading.

If you were lucky while making profits, you should be just unlucky when in loss. Do not expect the world to be so kind to you. Now you will be termed as stupid.

No appreciation for success and full criticism for failure is a traders lot and one has to learn to live with it.

(2) It is a lonely life:

Try talking about your trading with parents, spouse, children, friends and all you get is a cold shoulder.

Not a shoulder you can cry on in your time of despair but a shoulder which suggests to take your burden elsewhere.

You can not share your success or failures. Either you get indifference or criticism. Do not expect appreciation even at the best of times.

Learn to cope with the lonely trading life.

(3) All the conventional market wisdom, charts and strategies do not work all the time:

We get nuggets of wisdom like:

95% of traders lose money.

It is a zero sum game.

Option Buyers never make money.

80% of options expire worthless.

Then there are charts, bands, theories and strategies which are back tested for some time and promise great rewards if followed diligently.

First about the wisdom part. Even if these sayings are true to some extent so what? Why we can not be among the 5% who make money?

Similar is the talk about 80% options expiring worthless. All these talks are designed to make you a sure loser. Let your mind not be conditioned accordingly. Think on your own. Think like winners.

As for the technicals like charts, bands and strategies , all of them fail and fail spectacularly. If that were not the case, big traders will never lose money. And believe me they lose by the truck loads when the markets go against them.

You have to live by your own methods and by control on the emotions of fear and greed.

(4) Sell at a higher price than the buy price:

And to conclude the topic the biggest and simplest truth of them all.

Profit = Sell Price - Cost Price

This is taught at elementary school level. And we forget this fact and go for complicated and convoluted methods to get to this point.

No other formula for making profit has yet been invented and is not likely to be invented.

Keep life simple.

As we can not control the selling price ( it depends on the prevalent market condition) , let us focus on managing our losses. Once we learn how to manage the losses, profits will start coming in.

To Summarize :

Trading does not have social acceptance in India. Even if you run a big trading firm or are a broker, there are people looking for your failures. Do not expect respect even if you are the biggest and successful trader. Remember, you just got lucky.

As for being lonely as a trader there are few remedies. Write a journal of your trades. Write a blog like I do. share your experiences here on Quora. Other traders can benefit from your insights. Here you will not get the cold shoulder but some appreciation and thanks from those who value your experiences.

Do not give much thought to losers. Always plan for success and gratefully accept whatever the markets give you.

Penny Stocks,4y,How should one prepare for next financial crisis in stock markets?,"With the previous times as your guide, there are some crucial points that you must know when a financial crisis arises in stocks. You know that this occurs, on an average approximately once in ten years. However it is not possible to forecast with any levels of exactness when the next financial crisis takes place. However, just because the crises are volatile doesn’t mean you can’t take preventive measures to be ready for them. I have some points for you to avoid whilst preparing for a financial crisis:

· Don’t attempt to forecast the condition

Markets always recovers after breakages, however some revival and restoration takes more time as compared to others. Nonetheless, attempting to forecast market is persistently a failing intention. You may foresee it right once as your luck works. However, predicting it correct twice is what declares your victory.

· Hold a protective spot

If you have endeavored tough to reach up to a certain point of wealth, it is essential you secure your money. As I believe, many investors who are Type A ‘invest to win’. However, at the point you accomplish a particular spot in life, it nearly sounds good ‘not to lose’. Thus, when trading, ask yourself if the prize is meaningful to the confront danger.

· Make your portfolio parallel to your aims

I personally suggest some points that all traders must closely consider whilst investing, these are their tolerance for risk, time duration and liquidity requirements. A portfolio must be planned well with overall financial strategizing, total cash requirements and liquidity planning instead of attempting to foresee the market.

· Keep some cash secured
