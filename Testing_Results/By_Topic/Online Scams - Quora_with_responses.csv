Subham Mahapatra,Updated 3y,What are common scams in India?,"Last month I was travelling from Bangalore to Bhubaneswar. As it’s around 30 hrs journey, l couldn't take all the food for the whole journey.

Somehow I managed lunch and dinner on day 1, because I had taken food from home. The next morning, I managed my breakfast with bread and jam and ordered lunch from the pantry.

I ordered one veg meal from pantry. The pantry boy noted my seat number as I ordered my meal. After some time I got a meal that looked like this.

But water packet was not available with my meal. I didn't even ask.

After 1 hour the pantry boy came to collect the money.

Me: Bhaiya kitna hua??

(how much brother??)

Pantry boy: Sir, apka 120 hua?

(sir, your bill is 120 rupees.)

Me : Mene to veg meal order kiya tha, bhaiya

(I have ordered just veg meal, brother)

Pantry boy : Han sir. Ye veg meal ka price.

(yes sir. This is the price of veg meal)

I was shocked!!!! How can a veg meal cost this much? Then I said get me the bill then I'll pay you.

Then that guy got me a raw bill, nothing is written on that only train number and amount, even catering name was not mentioned. Unfortunately I have lost the bill. Otherwise I would have posted here.

Then I paid the money. Without saying anything.

After that I thought to check on IRCTC site about the actual cost of the meal.

Then I got this

Let me zoom it.

This is the veg meal cost . These are the items you are supposed to get in a veg meal.

Let's have a look at the price.

That’s 50 rupees. I'm not even considering food quality, quantity, and the food they had given.

How can they take more than double price of each meal?

Just suppose in one coach 60 passengers ordered a meal. They are earning

70(the extra cost) * 60=4200 rupees

4200 rupees they are earning illegally from each coach .

Then I told to that pantry boy “you shouldn't charge more than double cost”. Immediately that pantry boy started arguing with me that sir please have a look at our food quality.

I just asked one question, “Are you right at your position?”

Pantry boy had no answer.I asked him to get out.

Then I thought to complain in the railways about the exorbitant price in this pantry.

You might not have observed there is a toll free number for complaining about pantry service.

This is the number : 1800-111–321

I just called on this number and put a complaint about this.

I would never have thought that they would take some action because this is India. When they took action about it.I realized India is changing.

After putting a complaint, within 2 minutes that pantry boy came with a sad face and said, “Sir, have you complained?” in a low voice.

I said, “Yes I have complained. So what?”

His face became red with fear. Then he started convincing me to take back that complaint.

Pantry boy : Sir, even if you are not taking back the complaint, nothing will happen. Our owner has contacts up to the ministry level, but I’ll definitely loose my job if you are not taking back the complaint. Then after seeing tears in his eyes I took back the complaint.

Pantry boy : Thank you Sir. I'll return your extra money.

Me : Can you return everyone's extra money which you have taken?

Pantry boy : No sir it’s not possible. I can return the money of the passengers who are sitting near you.

Then he returned 350 rupees of 5 passengers extra money who were sitting arround me.

This is India’s biggest day light scam.

I appreciated that government is changing but corruption can't leave India’s hand.

Whenever you are facing this type of problem while travelling please put a complaint on that.

NOTE: This answer I had written on 2018. the above information was valid till that time, now the price of IRCTC has changed. The standard veg meal price has change to Rs.80 by IRCTC. please do consider while ordering and putting complaint.

I know with one complaint our nation is not going to change.

But every single drop of water helps to make a ocean.

Vivek Aundhakar,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"“Loot under the name of GST”

I recently visited Vishal Mart in Guwahati. It is quite big shop with huge crowd on weekends.

I bought ‘Britannia-Bourbon’ biscuits. I was expecting some discount offer but there wasn't any. I just bought it to MRP Rs. 27/-

After payment, I checked the bill casually and I found this-

I went back to the counter and asked the guy, why they charged me Rs. 30 when MRP is clearly written Rs. 27?

He said that, it is the GST applied over the MRP. I told him that MRP includes all taxes and no one can charge above that price, still he kept repeating same thing. Then I went to the manager and told her about the issue, then she started apologizing me and told that counter guy to return Rs. 3

Then I said to her, it is not about just my 3 rupees but it’s about the all customers they are fooling under the name of GST and charging extra. Imagine how many packets they must be selling everyday. That would surely make a huge amount earned and it’s clearly a scam.

Before leaving the store I asked her to make the change in their system so that no other customers get fooled. Other customers present there also started asking her to do it immediately.

It is my request to all that we must always check the bill details in shops, hotels and everywhere. I am sure there are many such examples of looting under the name of GST. Beware!

Edit 1-

Many people suggested in the comments that I must complain about it to the govt. So I have registered a complaint at online portal of consumer court. Let's see what action they take!

Rahul Giri,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"The most common scam is done by the popcorn sellers. The popcorn which is of value ₹20 are sold at ₹200- ₹1000 in Movie Theatres.

In INOX FARIDABAD, NCR, I went to watch NEWTON where the show ticket was of ₹120. During interval, I went to buy some snacks and popcorn the cost of popcorn was starting from 260 (medium sized) and the small one was not available.

After this I have decided that I will never be a part of this scam. And I will never buy these from Theatres.

Why this is a scam?

My Father is a farmer and we produce Maize or corn (मक्का) and sell it @ ₹5–10 per kg and in market, it is easily available under ₹30 per kg.

If we add the making charges, packing and labour charges it will cost ₹50 per kg and people from PVR and other Theatres are selling at ₹3000 per kg.

So a net scam of ₹2950 per kg is being done by them.

So “JAAGO GRAHAK JAAGO”!!

Anuj Narang,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Every Zomato (product) Scam has 3 parts. The first one is called - “The Pledge”, where Zomato shows you something ordinary. Like these Cheesy Chicken Meatballs costing 100 bucks and additional taxes n charges of 30 bucks.

Kathiravan RS,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"There are already lots of scams by major fast-food chains, this one is by Domino’s Pizza.

Image source: www.asklaila.com

Last week I went to a Domino’s restaurant with my friends in Chennai. Usually, when we go there, we order Pizza Mania since it is the cheapest. This time we decided to buy around 20 pizzas and when proceeded to give the order at the counter.

Now, at the counter, the guy told me that they don’t have the normal crust and asked to order for Fresh pan pizzas. Now the additional cost is ₹25 per pizza and the total cost will be ₹500 extra for 20 pizzas. We had no choice rather than to buy those.

After 20 - 25 minutes we received the pizzas, the pizzas tasted just like the regular ones and I don’t know how these are different. I was regretting that I have wasted ₹500.

Now comes the actual scam part. I had a suspicion because they never told me that regular pizzas are not there. To check, I opened their Android app and ordered few pizza mania with REGULAR base as takeaway and the order was confirmed.

BOOM!!

I got the pizzas which they told it was out of stock in ten mins. The guy handed the pizzas to me with a shocked face. He said that he didn’t check the stocks properly.

Then I had to eat the pizza with regret of wasting ₹500.

So, whenever they tell you that normal base is not available, just order online with their app and save money instead of spending on other bases.

I don’t know whether this has been already posted by others, Sorry if it is repeated.

Don’t tell that they reserve stocks for online orders separately, how can they give preference to another customer somewhere over a customer who is right at their shop.

Update: After seeing this answer, a representative from Domino's called me and apologized over the incident, assured me to give coupons as a refund for the extra money spent and assured it won't happen again.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/60kd2g1vf4nqc9mb', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""There are already lots of scams by major fast-food chains, this one is by Domino’s Pizza.\n\nImage source: www.asklaila.com\n\nLast week I went to a Domino’s restaurant with my friends in Chennai.

Shreyansh Chandak,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Cafe Coffee Day.

I went to a CCD a couple of days back and ordered a gourmet hot chocolate. Price on the menu - Rs 120.

I place the order and it is being billed. When I ask for the final amount I am being told Rs 200.

I take out my wallet and search for 2 Rs 100 notes to pay.

Wait. And then it struck me.

Rs 200 for a 120 drink? No. That’s not right. There seemed to be something wrong. Maybe, I heard it wrong?

I ask him again for the bill amount. Yes, it is Rs 200. I ask for the break up, he fumbles a bit and I ask him in a more stern manner.

And that’s when I get to know, he wants to add cream to my drink worth Rs 50 odd without asking me whether I want it or not. Apparently, he assumed that I needed it.

I point it out to him. He doesn’t seem to have an answer. I ask for his manager’s number and get his manager on the call. I am looking to explain the entire situation to him. But, as soon as I tell him that the manager that I was overcharged, he apologised and said that he understood that the representative must have added add ons without asking.

Again, wait. He sort of knew that this is what exactly happened before I even explained it to him? I would say that was because it has happened before and it happens on a regular basis.

Imagine, this happening to even 10 customers per outlet everyday for an average of Rs 30 to Rs 40. Or say even a small percentage of the many thousands of people that come to CCD to chill, relax, work over coffee. It turns out to be a huge sum across the approximate 2000 outlets that CCD has in India.

I would say CCD is a pretty big scam.

Adam Singh,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Delhi Police, Not only scam, Delhi Police runs an extortion racket.

Till 4th June, I would have argued, there are few bad guys in Delhi Police, but majority are good guys.

But, as of 5th June, I argue, there are few good guys in Delhi Police, but majority are bad guys.

Let me share my experience.

My wife arrived from OS trip, and I drove to Delhi on 4th June 2019, to pick her up. After receiving her from IGI (approx 1am 5th June), we went straight to hotel.
On 5th June, approx 9am, we left hotel within 30 seconds, we were pulled aside by Delhi Police officers, with masks and hand-held equipment.
I was asked to produce License, RC, Insurance, which I provided.
Police Officer then extended his hand into the cabin, and pressed horn, his immediate reaction was ""Pressure Horn, come out"".
For next 15 minutes, I tried explaining, that it is a DISC HORN with measured 90db rating. Including showing manufacturer’s website, and SC judgements.
After multiple threats ranging from impounding RC to impounding my car, 2 police officers asked me to come aside, which I refused. This is common tactic by Police Officers to ask bribes.
Eventually, I was told, Delhi Police won't be unjust, and will cooperate with me.
Delhi Police, showing pity on me, and in spirit of cooperation, gave me, on the spot fine, Rs.100 for pressure horn and Rs.1000 for dangerous driving.
Delhi Police had latest technology available, to issue, on the spot fines, but did not even have an app (on their phones), to check approximate loudness of horns.
When I asked, why was I fined for dangerous driving? a pile of abuses were hurled towards me and my wife (who never left the car and never said a single word to anyone). Here is list of on the spot fines, Delhi Police is suppose to issue. DEPARTMENT OF POLICE, Delhi, India
When I asked, what kind of dangerous driving, I was doing, on an empty road, with a 1600 kg car with 70bhp, with 4 suitcases (approx 110kg) in boot, I was informed, ""Pressure horn tau dangerous driving hi hai"".
I shook my head, said thank you, and walked towards my car. On reaching front of my car, I stopped to take pictures of supposed pressure horn, and a dam of abuses burst at me and at my wife.
One police officer went ahead and opened door to the car and started threatening my wife, while second Police officer opened drivers door and started honking the horn, while third police officer started filming the supposed pressure horn firing video.
I made worst mistake of my life and asked “what did I do wrong?”,
Multiple options was offered as replies to my and wife.
""Bhenchod, tujse co-operate kiya, tujhe aur teri randi ko impound karte hain""
""Haramjade ko arrest karo""
“Harami ko court bhejo”
I jumped into my car, and drove off.
Since, I reside approx 400 kms from Delhi, and my car’s number plate displayed that. Police Officers knew, arguing Rs.1100 in court, would cost me, well over Rs.5000 and 2 days at bare minimum.
So Delhi Police pushes for ""side pe aa"" tactics, to take bribes and those who refuse, get Rs.1100 fine and abuses.

At this point, you must be wondering, why didn’t I made a complaint to PCA?

Sorry, PCA (Police Complaints Authority) does not consider this extortion (or serious abuse of authority) and as such, will not accept complaints on this matter.

It might sound like a one-off, but every taxi driver, I spoke to, confirms, this is a daily occurance in Delhi, anyone with outside Delhi number plates face this cooperation by Delhi Police.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/z2o985a1hpl4ifsk', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.84475, 'ai': 0.15525}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Delhi Police, Not only scam, Delhi Police runs an extortion racket.\n\nTill 4th June, I would have argued, there are few bad guys in Delhi Police, but majority are good guys.\n\nBut, as of 5th June, I argue, there are few good guys in Delhi Police, but majority are bad guys.\n\nLet me share my experience.\n\nMy wife arrived from OS trip, and I drove to Delhi on 4th June 2019, to pick her up.

Sumit De,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Titan

I bought a Titan edge in Jan 2015 worth RS 16,000/-. It had a warranty for 2 years. In September 2017 the watch stopped. I thought may be the battery has drained out.

Went to Titan world, Park Street, Kolkata. They took it, they said they will check but since it's beyond warranty so I have to pay. I was ok with it.

After a week received a SMS saying please collect your watch at your convenience. I went again . To my surprise, I was told that the watch is irreparable. I was shocked. Just within two years without any physical damage how can a award winning technology of edge just become irreparable?

The service centre informed that company can take the watch back since it is just out of warranty but would provide me a Titan coupon of 50% of the buy value.

I insisted I want to repair. Now the service centre told me if I don't take the offer now they won't even provide me any coupon in future. So it's now or never.

I asked them to write in the bill that the watch is not repairable. But they denied to do so. I asked them to show me the company policy of 50 % , that also they couldn't provide.

I requested to talk to the manager. After listening to the situation he took back the watch and asked the service person to check once again and didn't hand it back to me, nor he gave to me anything in writing.

The scam here is the service centre will take back the watch and provide a 50% coupon with which you have to buy another titan watch within 3 months.

Your watch may have only got a battery to replace, so that will be replaced and put up for a sale on full value. They won't give you in writing that the watch is not repairable since they very well know it is not true.

It's the latest scam trending in Titan to improve the sale at the cost of customers.

Is this the Tata value and code of ethics?

Edit on 07.10.2017 (after almost 1 and half month of putting the watch for servicing)

Today after many a calls to customer care and threatening to approach the consumer forum got back my watch after a month.

It has been repaired and working fine. The cost for repair is INR 1650. Now you can understand pretty well why they refused to provide a documentary evidence that the watch is irreparable.

Infact if I would have taken the offer of 50% coupon I would have lost straight away 8K.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5iw0uobz7raqd6g2', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Titan\n\nI bought a Titan edge in Jan 2015 worth RS 16,000/-.

Krishnadev Jaya Sreekumar,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Well, well… Let’s talk about this Indian IT company - Tech Mahindra (formerly Mahindra Satyam) and their employment bond scam.

It’s common practice for Indian IT companies to coerce new joinees, especially from campus, to sign a service bond. This bond requires them to pay an exorbitant amount if they choose to leave the company before the bond period ends. However, Tech Mahindra has taken this one step ahead.

So, my wife attended an on-campus job fair conducted by TM, way back in 2013. She got selected and was sent an offer letter, which mentioned about a service bond requiring her to pay Rs. 1.0 Lacs in case she quit the company within 2 years of joining. The offer also required her to be present at their Chennai office on 17th Jan, 2014, the date of joining, failing which the offer would stand withdrawn.

Owing to several reasons, she chose not to accept the offer and replied to the recruiting manager in unequivocal terms, that she wouldn’t be joining. As obvious, neither did she go to their office in Chennai nor did she sign and submit any document.

Considering the matter closed, she went ahead with life, as usual.

Till in March, 2014, she started getting mails from TM HR stating that she had been on unauthorized leave from office from Feb 3, 2014. A week later, she got a mail stating that she had been ‘terminated’ for unauthorized absence from work. The termination letter though stated that she had not been in office from Mar, 2014 onwards. Imaginative as they were, TM HR were as confused as they were incompetent. We were obviously baffled by this chain of communication but thought it best not to respond to these mails since it a waste of our time.

7 months later, in October 2014, the real drama unfolded. My wife started getting emails asking her to furnish Rs. 90,984 and 15% p.a interest from Feb ’14 as penalty for breaking the service bond. Concerned that the spirit of Satyam Computers may have been reinvigorated in Tech Mahindra and they had now forayed into the space of online bank fraud, we didn’t respond. Neither did we pay any money, as there was no contractual obligation whatsoever to start with.

In November 2015, physical letters started coming to her parents’ home, threatening legal action in case the money wasn’t paid. We then reached out to Mr. CP Gurnani, CEO of Tech Mahindra and Mr. Anand Mahindra, Chairman of Mahindra Group. One Mr. Nigel Franklin from their HR team responded and promised to get back with details. We asked him to show us the purported documents signed by my wife, her employee ID card, bank account to which salary from Jan to Mar was paid etc. We even shared my wife’s time sheet from her employer proving that she was in her office in Kochi on the original joining date - 17th Jan, 2014 and hence could not have joined TM. Mr. Franklin never replied, despite a reminder from us. Again, we thought the matter had been closed.

But, no. 4.5 years after the original ‘joining date’, this week, we received a Legal Notice from an advocate on behalf of his client, TM asking us to pay Rs. 90,984 and 15% p.a interest from Mar 14 onwards within 7 days, failing which he would file a case against us.

We’ve just filed a reply to this notice to their lawyer, keeping Mr. C.P Gurnani and Mr. Anand Mahindra in CC. A copy of the reply is given in the link below, in case you’re interested. (Notice Reply Final.pdf
)

To go to such extents to recover a service bond amount from a person who had never been an employee of theirs to start with, would definitely rank as one of the most creative means of boosting revenue employed by an Indian IT Company. The fact that even though senior leaders like Mr. Gurnani and Mr. Mahindra were reached out to, the issue has still dragged on till now, shows these so-called industry leaders in poor light.

We now await what new story the creative minds at Tech Mahindra HR come up with.

Edit 1: 10.08.18:

Thank you for all the support mentioned in the comments.

We just got a mail from Tech Mahindra HR as a response to the email sent to Mr. Anand Mahindra and Mr. C.P Gurnani. Mr. Vinay Agrawal (Head, Business HR) has written stating that they're investing (I hope he meant investigating) the matter and that the legal notice is being kept in abeyance.

Guess we will wait for their investment/investigation to get complete and see what new story comes up.

Edit 2: 27.08.18:

Mr. Vinay Agrawal (Head, Business HR) has written to us that ‘this clearly appears to be a case of impersonation with an intent to cause harm to you as well as the organisation’. He goes on to ask whether my wife had shared the offer letter with somebody etc., trying to insinuate that this issue is my fault.

In our reply, we call bullshit and ask them to present all documents that they claim to have in possession. We tell him in no uncertain terms that we feel he’s lying and this entire episode is just a result of Tech Mahindra’s incompetence, not a highly sophisticated identity thief.

Still no apology from Tech Mahindra for 4 years of harassment.

Edit 3: 04.09.18:

Mr. Vinay Agrawal seems to be having issues understanding simple sentences. He has just replied in a complete tangent to the last email, stating that their Ombudsman team would reach out for the investigation and that the legal notice is being kept in abeyance. Still no apology for all the harrassment and no sight of the purported documents they have in possession.

Edit 4: 05.09.18:

The Tech Mahindra Ombudsman Team calls us for what is a pointless, fruitless 32 minute conversation. Just listen in to the absurdity of the questions posed by the Tech Mahindra ombudsman team and the non committal attitude towards fixing any time frame for resolution:

Tech Mahindra Ombudsman Team Call

Edit 5: 10.10.18:

Well, long story short, Tech Mahindra surely has some of the stupidest HR personnel I’ve ever seen! At the end of all this colossal waste of time, they revert with the below email:

Dear Ms. Parvathy,

We refer to our Legal Notice dated July 19, 2018 issued to you by M/s V. Venkata Subramanyam & Associates and your subsequent responses on the same. As informed earlier, we have investigated this case. Since the matter pertains to January 2014 and that the RMG recruiter who was in touch with you at the stage of rolling out the job offer has since expired, we are unable to complete the investigations.

Under the circumstances, we are withdrawing the aforesaid legal notice with immediate effect. We sincerely regret the inconvenience this may have caused to you.

Thanking you,

Vinay Agrawal

After close to 5 years of harassment and finally, they conclude with no admittance of fault, no apology, no clarification whatsoever on the signed offer letter that they purportedly had in possession and no initiative to hold the people responsible for this stupidity accountable. They have conveniently and shamelessly tied the entire episode to a dead man and brushed it under the carpet.

From our perspective, we didn’t bother responding to this last email. The people on the other side are just too stupid to warrant us spending any more time on this. Hopefully, no one else in Tech Mahindra dies in the foreseeable future, and this issue is laid to rest permanently.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h6bl80vjzq1gkoyc', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.599, 'ai': 0.401}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Well, well… Let’s talk about this Indian IT company - Tech Mahindra (formerly Mahindra Satyam) and their employment bond scam.\n\nIt’s common practice for Indian IT companies to coerce new joinees, especially from campus, to sign a service bond.

Srikanth,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Let me share my experience with Swiggy

You can clearly see that they are showing two parathas in the above image, but here comes the twist.

To my suprise I was delivered only one partha, when I called the Swiggy team they told me that this restaurant sells one paratha for 70RS.

I ate one plate paratha (2 pieces) at the same restaurant a week ago for 70RS.

I again called the customer support but they denied, so i placed their call on hold and made a conference call with the restaurant, and I asked him to deliver a plate paratha to my room, and made an enquiry about the quantity he said they provide 2 parathas for 70RS.

Voila! they were caught red-handed, and swiggy team accepted to return my 35rs, but I asked them to make a full refund (of 70rs) for which they agreed.

EDIT1 : Swiggy people are fraudsters, they are not willing to talk to me about this. See what I found. PLEASE DON’T FALL FOR THEIR DISCOUNTS.

THEY LURE YOU WITH FREE DELIVERY OFFERS AND TRAP YOU

Now let’s check with the restaurant itself…..

Here’s the full menu from the restaurant

It’s better to call the restaurant itself.

So many people are pointing out that it is not the fault of Swiggy. Alright, I've provided them with numerous proofs, I've sent them n number of mails, why aren't they responding?

I totally lost my cool. Those idiot shopkeeper never told me, they will charge for issuing that worthless customer card. I am not going to visit the ****** pharmacy like daily and the customer card is just senseless for me and they are charging for that.

Abhishek Kumar,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Very common and rarely noticed because of the small amounts involved. But when you consider the cumulative impact across the customer base, the figures could be mind boggling.

I usually order groceries from BigBasket.com and never noticed this until recently.

Just note the weight printed on the sticker (111 gms) and compare it to the actual weight on the weigh scale (97gms)

Same here - 250 gms print, but actual weight is 227 gms.

Let's check another product.

Same issue again - 258 gms vs 230 gms

Let's give them another chance!

676 gms vs 642 gms.

Are you doubting the weigh scale to be faulty? Let's check that too.

Printed weight 905 gms, actual weight 913 gms (obviously the wrapper weight is also included)

Just to be sure the weigh scale is fine, let's check another product

100 gms printed, actual weight similar. This proves the weigh scale is working fine!

So now we know where the problem is.

When I first raised the issue with bigbasket, all they did was refund some Rs. 8 to my wallet. Just like most of us here, I thought this issue was an exception, and not the norm. But then, it happened again with my next order and then again with my latest order yesterday.

I guess I am done with Bigbasket for good!

EDIT: To those suggesting there could be loss of moisture, I find it difficult to digest that the weight would drop over 10% in a matter of just 90 minutes. Two of orders were placed under express delivery, which was delivered in less than 90 minutes.

Even if the fruits and vegetables are packed a day or two in advance—which goes against their brand positioning of supplying fresh produce—the company should at least weigh them correctly before shipping out from the warehouse.

And to those doubting the weigh scale, please see the post again. I have shared pics of Amul ghee and Parle biscuits as well. If the same weigh scale can show their weight correctly, why would anyone doubt the scale when it comes to other products.

A few readers suggested complaining to bigbasket or other government authorities. I have raised a complaint with the Legal metrology department. Will update the post once I hear back from them.

Edit 2: The mail I sent to Karnataka Legal metrology department bounced back as the email address that I got from their website seems to be incorrect. I then sent the email to 2 other email addresses mentioned on the website of Karnataka legal metrology department, but haven't heard back from them yet!

Meanwhile, a friend in my society borrowed my weigh scale after I informed him about the issue. And guess what he found?

Among other items that I am not even discussing about, the watermelon he ordered was some 1.5kg. This item should have been at least 2.8kg, if not 4kg. Check the images below!

And what's worse? Bigbasket just refunded the extra amount and brushed off the matter!

Another suggestion to readers doubting / writing off the weigh scale as cheap and inaccurate: Please keep your wisdom to yourself!

Abhishek Reddy,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"The new paytm scam!!

No, I'm not speaking about the data leak of kashmiri’s to a political party.

Paytm is more commonly used now a days instead of cash and debit/credit cards, we are using paytm more commonly. This is well known point.

We go to shop to buy something and pay via paytm and we show the success page of transaction after payment. Something similar to this.

The shopkeeper doesn't check his mobile because we showed him the success page.

Here comes the loop hole for the scammers. There are spoof apps of paytm. Here we can enter the credentials like name, amount etc…

After entering the credentials the success page of transaction is created by this app as shown below.

Tada!! They show this page to shopkeeper and he thinks that he received the money.

So beware guys. Please inform your family/friends who is/are receiving money through paytm. Check in your paytm. Don't blindly believe the fake transactions.

Pani poori waala, some not so technically educated shopkeepers are also using paytm these days. Please don't do these type of things with them. They are earning for three meals a day and for their children's education. Don't do these type of things with such type of people.

On 18 August, I went to see Batla House there.

On the counter i asked for 2 tickets for the show on Bookmyshow the tickets price was ₹150 there on booking 2 tickets the total price came ₹450. After seeing the bill I came to know he had added 2 snacks for ₹100 without asking. Here is how the conversation went next:-

Me-Sorry, I have not ordered the snacks please cancel that.

Fun Cinemas Guy-Sorry sir, it's compulsory you cannot have tickets without it.

Me- I don't want to eat snacks remove that now.

Me-Call your manager. I want to speak to him.

Fun Cinemas Guy- Here is your new ticket sir.

I didn't complain because I was getting late for the show, but after interval i saw how almost everyone had a small plastic cup of pepsi and ₹10 popcorn.

Rana Ashish,5y,What are common scams in India?,"Few days back while coming back from office, I realized that I needed to refuel my bike’s tank, since it had already touched reserve. When I reached the petrol pump, there was a huge crowd. I queued up and started waiting for my turn.

Usually I prefer full tank, so when it was my turn, I told him to fill my tank full. The guy who was filling asked me to check “Zero”, in the meter and then he started filling.

And when he was done, he filled 13.7 litres of petrol. But my tank capacity is 12 liters. How did he manage to fill 13.7 liter? Where 1 litre (approx) of petrol was already there before filling my tank.

I said, “My tank capacity is 12 litre, how did you fill 13.7 litre?”

He said (arrogantly), “You drive your bike and you don’t know the capacity of your fuel tank? It is of 15 litres.”

The kind of confidence he showed in his reply, I started doubting myself. I am riding this bike since 4 years and I am not aware of the capacity of the tank.

I knew he was telling a white lie, but I was not in the mood to engage in a quarrel.

I asked him, do one thing,

Remove all the petrol from this tank and measure whether it crosses 12 litre or not. I already had 1 litre of petrol, plus you added 13.7 litres, so the cumulative sum will be 14.7 litres.

Forget about my 1 litre, show me that you filled 13.5 litres in my bike.

Now there were other customers too, they started supporting my claim and forced him to do that.

He knew, he was caught red handed.

He said, “Okay! You don’t believe me. Let me bring the pipe to empty your tank and I will measure the petrol from your bike.”

The kind of confidence he showed in his reply, again I started doubting myself. And that’s where I made a mistake, I allowed him to go inside alone, where he never came back.

He ran away from the back door.

There was too much hue and cry about illegal way of filling petrol, but no action was taken. I paid the money for 11 litres of petrol and went away.

I am not blaming or saying that this practice happens in every petrol pump, but wherever it happens, just try to calculate the illegal profit made by them.

I leave the calculation to you guys.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r7lzx2j385e1wd49', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Few days back while coming back from office, I realized that I needed to refuel my bike’s tank, since it had already touched reserve.

Anonymous,4y,What are common scams in India?,"In Bangalore, near Brookfield mall, there is one restaurant (that starts with ‘Mo’ and ends with 'Z'). So one day I went there with my friend to have some light snacks. We had ordered 2 dishes and the waiter presented us bill as we finished. Now a days after reading about how restaurants dupe customers I have started to check the bill meticulously. So in the bill there were three items. The two were correct as per our order and the third one was some random item. They had calculated taxes including that random item. After that by pen they had subtracted the item number 3 from bill. So I called up the waiter and asked why they have done it like this. He was like by mistake it was put but after that they have reduced as well.

I said that was fine but why they have calculated GST on the entire amount and not the reduced amount and asked for fresh bill. He said he can not give fresh bill as it is already registered in the computer (I don't understand this excuse.) I told him it's not my mistake that you put wrong item in the bill. I took out my mobile phone calculator and explained him how there will be difference in the bill in the two cases. The difference was about 5 rupees. He was giving me looks as why I making fuss over just 5 rupees. I could tell from friend's face that she was also thinking why I am doing this. But no! I strictly asked that waiter to call his manager if he is not able to figure out. He went back to bill desk. They had some conversation for some times. After that he returned with the correct bill. We paid and left.

So the takeaways from this incident are:

Restaurants take advantage of our ignorance.
We must check the bills no matter how small or big the order is.
There is no need to feel embarrassed. It's your hard earned money afterall. You have right to know and take action if it is being misused.
Don't succumb to social pressure. It is not a question if 5 rupees. They might be using the same tactis for 10 more customers. We must let them know that we are no fools. We don't know how much money they are making by doing this. When we go to buy vegetables from market we haggle for even one rupee. Why suddenly in restaurant we feel obligated ignore such things.

Naveen R,6y,What are common scams in India?,"GST SCAM

Recently I had been to Stoned Monkey in bengaluru. Where I ordered ice cream and paid bill which included both CGST and SGST. But there was no GSTIN number in the bill.

When I enquired same with the cashier he said he have some problem in software so that GSTIN number is not printed in bill. when I insist him to show GSTIN number he showed Number and for moment i thought it just a problem in software.

Prachi S,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Okay, so I'm standing at Bangalore airport, minding my own business, trying to make my way to the restroom, when a strange man stops me in my tracks.

He has a heavy build, a traditional vesti around his waist and gold rings in ALL of his fingers.

He comes up to me and says he needs to talk to me about something. Not knowing what this is about, I stop to entertain him for a minute. This man proceeds to ask me if I'm interested in joining - wait for it…… the Film Industry.

I try to hastily shake my head and move on, when he insists further. Apparently he saw me from a distance and my so called features are perfect for Tollywood, he thought. Now I'm quite happy with my looks, but I know I'm no Madhuri Dixit. My bullshit sensors start running high.

I look at my watch, I have a few minutes to spare. There are quite a few people around, not to mention the security. It's not like he could kidnap me in plain sight. Let's hear him out, see where it goes, I think.

He proceeds to tell me what a big name he is in the industry and how it'll be a privilege of his to launch a face like me. If only I would give him my number and fix a meet with him next week, we can take it from there, he promises.

While he is giving me this speech, my mind starts replaying the news stories of girls getting trapped in all sorts of trouble with the promise of a modeling job. No way this man is getting my number.

“why don't you give me your card and I'll get in touch with you?” I ask.

He pushes a little more, saying he'll need to know how to find me.

“My phone is not functioning right now.”

I come up with the worst possible excuse on the spot, and start to leave. He quickly hands me his card and asks me to get in touch with him ASAP. He has the perfect role for me, apparently.

On my way back, I check out his credentials from the card. He works for a mining company with a nonexistent office address and no trace on the internet. His ‘big name’ comes up nowhere in the industry.

Did I almost become a victim of a modeling scam? I ask myself. Thank God I'm well-informed. Otherwise this could have been the start of a much more horrifying story.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yo8n6qjxhz9b01pk', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9945, 'ai': 0.0055}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Okay, so I'm standing at Bangalore airport, minding my own business, trying to make my way to the restroom, when a strange man stops me in my tracks.\n\nHe has a heavy build, a traditional vesti around his waist and gold rings in ALL of his fingers.\n\nHe comes up to me and says he needs to talk to me about something.

Rohit Joshi,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"A month ago, I ordered Huawei Honor Band 3 from Amazon.

I had done payment online for ₹1800. After some days, I get an SMS from delivery courier services that my package from Amazon will be delivered today. I was a little suspicious that why delivery is sending me SMS instead of Amazon. But then I thought maybe there is some arrangement between them so doesn't matter.

Delivery guy came, delivered my parcel. What iIgot? Have a look.

I was furious. I had paid 1800₹ for this plastic toy watch. I called that delivery guy, he said his company is not responsible, contact Amazon.

So I called amazon. They told me to wait for some days. They told me that the seller sent me this without notifying Amazon. After calling them repeatedly, sending them these actual photos, my refund was initiated.

Thanks to Amazon, that seller was banned from selling on Amazon. So I would advice all of you to be very careful when you buy something online.

Madan,6y,What are common scams in India?,"Yesterday, my wife and I had gone to Elliot's beach in Chennai. An old lady very close to the shore was selling roasted corn.

PC Google

We tried one and loved it! We ended up buying 2 more. Each roasted corn is sold for 30 rupees. We didn't bargain and gave her 100 rupees and got 10 back.

As soon as the transaction was over, we started walking towards the beach. My wife was holding corn in one hand and the 10 rupees note firmly on the other. I kind of saw partially/sensed some kind of hand gesture from the old lady behind our back and in no time a young woman holding a tiny baby approached us and started asking us for the 10 rupees in my wife's hand to feed her baby.

It was a real awkward situation and after a couple of minutes we caved in. My wife handed her the 10 rupee note. The young woman turned quickly, walked towards the corn lady and dropped the 10 rupees note in a box next to her. I JUST COULDN’T BELIEVE I SAW THAT!

By the time we realized they are in the same team and we got scammed, it was too late.

Rahul Sharma,2y,What are common scams in India?,"This scam isn't common but surprising.

This is the entry point of Jaipur Railway Station. As soon as you enter the station and you walk towards the platform, some people in red uniform ask you to put your bag in a machine which looks exactly same as a machine that is used at security gate to scan the luggage. You would feel that it's a security check point and keep your bag in that machine. As soon as your bag crosses the machine and you pick it up, the staff asks you to pay 10 rupees per bag. They have sanitized your bags, without you even asking for it.

If you say that you didn't want your bag to be sanitized and you thought it was a part of a security check, they show you a poster which you missed to read :

9 out of 10 people who travel to this particular station for the first time, miss this poster and end up being trapped. The staff at that machine only sanitize your bag and not your hands or clothes, so you hold your bag again with unsanitized hands and move on. What's the purpose of this sanitization excercise, who approved it and how could these people stop passengers and ask them to keep their bags on their machines. I couldn't believe this open scam when I saw it first at a railway station.

There are some poor people who carry more than 10 small size bags and they are being forced to pay over 100 rupees. Some of them cannot even read those instructions. They don't hire a coolie to save money and then they are forced to pay here, for a service which they never wanted.

This UV sanitization cabin is made to look exactly like a security desk and kept at the entrance and it is almost impossible to not get trapped. I was trapped once too. I didn't pay the amount because I thought it was unethical business and they allowed me to go without much trouble.

I have reported them to the Indian Railways and PMO. I hope this fraud is stopped or Railway at least makes sure that these people don't stand on the way to direct people to use their services. They should take payment before they process the bags. That way people won't be trapped.

Thanks for reading,

Ram,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"This happened after the completion of my B. Tech and i was in the search of my first job.

It was a boring evening and i was scrolling newsfeed on facebook.

Suddenly got a message from one of my intermediate college friend.

the conversation went like this….

Him : Hi Bro

Me : Hi

Him : How r u

Me : I’m good,how about you ?

Him : By god's grace I am well settled now.

Me : That's great, what are you doing now.

Him : I am working now for so&so company as marketing executive.

Me : How much are you earning (As a jobless enthusiast)

Him : Send me your contact number, I will call you.

Me : XXXXXXXXXX

Him : Ok, I am busy now, i will call you when i have free time

Me : Ok bro !

**evening i got a call from him**

Him : Hi Bro (In a Posh manner)

Me : Hi dude (I tried to be posh)

Him : So tell me what are your doubts ?

Me : Nothing,How is your Job ?

Him : All good, I am staying here at Bhubaneshwar

Me : Oh !!

Him : are you doing any job ?

Me : No bro, still in search

Him : If you want i will refer here. easily you can earn 50k per month.You are completely wasting your valuable time by searching for a job. We are average grade students and we didn't get good jobs. Even if we crack interview they pay only 8k-10k per month.But if you come here you will earn 10 times more than it.I left my 15k job for this opportunity.And I am happy because, now i am earning 5 times more than of it.

Me : **Speechless** (As i am from lower middle class family 50K sounded like a big dream for me)

***********(I THINK YOU GOT WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT ?? IF NOT, IT’S…….MULTI LEVEL MARKETING)************

Again Me : Really ? But what is the Job ? what i have to do there ?

Him : Yeah, i can’t explain everything on phone.If you come here, you will get to know everything.

Me : I have technical knowledge in computers ,will i get any job related to computers there ?

Him : Yes bro, all kinds of jobs are available here. you no need to worry about it.

Me : But ?

Him : I know, you're in confusion that how you will earn such big amount. Earning money is easy, most of the people don't know the way. Here you can learn business skills,money management & everything. Then after you can start your own business also. One of my colleague he joined just 6months back & bought Duke200 bike recently with only the amount of incentives he got every month & if you talk about me, I am planning to buy a ""car"" next month.

*Btw Duke200 is my favorite (one of the reason that got into this trap )

Again he : If you come here,after you attend few training sessions & you will understand everything !!

Me : yeah, ok but how to join ?

Him : As a joining fee You will have to pay Rs 10,000 to company, don't worry you will earn 10 times of it in just few months. Remember one thing,

“if we want to become rich we have to bear small investments”.

And i think Rs 10,000 is not a big deal.you can just pay it as a security deposit !!

Me : Ok, when should i come there ?

Him : I will check with the superiors about vacancy and i will get back to you.

Me : Thanks bro, its really great thing for me !!

Him : Ok bro,I have some important work ! catch you later

Later i asked him so many questions on phone and every time his answer was same ""Come Here first, you will get to know everything""

Meanwhile, I had spoken with my mom regarding this, and i asked her to tell my dad about Rs.10,000)**

————(Some introduction about my lovely parents)———-

My mom has not even studied 4th class & my dad is somehow smart than my mom as he completed his 5th class and got fed up with education when he was in 6th standard.

After their love marriage, they shifted from village to Hyderabad city.

Initial days they struggled a lot and they even worked as daily labours.

They used to live in small hut.oh man !! thats a big story.............

*they know the value of money

*they know the value of time

*they know the value of education

*they know the value of work

My parents did not want their children to struggle like they did. They always think about me & my sibilings’ education.

They struggled a lot to put me into intermediate(after 10th Std. and before University) (The 1year college fee of mine is thier 4months total income).

Somehow i got rank in EAMCET & Completed my Engineering with the help of Fee Reimbursement Scheme, Scholarship & a Part-time Job.

So, my parents paid my sibling's education fees with their hard earned money.

Coming back to the main Story-->

My mom told to my dad regarding this job, later he called me & asked me the following:

DAD : Are you really interested in this ?

Me : yes dad !!

DAD: It’s ok. But how can you stay without us?

Me : Don’t worry Dad.They will Provide accommodation & Food !!

DAD : Ok i will arrange money But get me details about job.

Me : Okay !

**He borrowed money from a relative & gave it to me**

The next week, I reached railway station with my dad. I stepped into the train and left for Bhubaneshwar.

Next day, I reached Bhubaneshwar with lot of hopes about future and bunch of expectations on life.

My friend with one of his colleagues came to railway station to pick me. We went to their room.

It was a newly constructed house and divided into smaller rooms. There were a group of 6-7 members staying in each room. And i observed that most of the people were talking on phone regarding this job with friends, relatives etc.

I observed one more thing here, that every person is calling other person as ""Sir""

When i asked my friend about this, he told me that, its kind of respect, gratitude..bla..bla etc something he said..

Next day, he took me to the training session, at the entrance two members (they were just like Bouncers) were asking names of each person and noted in a book and collecting money of Rs.10,000 /-from each.

I told my friend that i wont pay money until i get to know about job.

He tried convincing me but i didn’t compromise. Some of his colleagues came and they even tried to convince me.

At last, one superior person came to me & told me that he will be responsible to return the money if i didn’t like the job.

And here, I understood that ""something is going wrong""

My friend again came to me, told me that ""Bro just believe in me"". we wont force you to join here. But it is a procedure that they will allow only the people who came with joining fee and at the end of the session they will return money.

Hell…i did not compromise, and in return i asked him like..

Me : Bro, I don't want to pay money without knowing anything about this ?

Him : So you don’t believe in me ?

Me : **Speechless**

Again Me : OK fine, will do one thing. Just pay that Rs. 10,000 /- on behalf of me. And at end of the session once they return my money, I will give it to you.

After lot of discussion with his superiors, he came with the money and gave it to me.

I paid that money to them and finally went into one big hall.

When I reached there, there were a lot of people waiting for someone, but most of them had no idea about that business.

There i saw lot of the students who came from villages and cities (Most of them are from Andhra & Telangana)

The company people did not even allow us to talk to each other. The rules were strict that we can’t even look at others until the session ends.

**This silence continued for half an hour**

One guy came to hall. Everyone in hall stood up and some company people gave him a shake hand (they were treating him as a celebrity)

I didn’t even stand up and i just sat like as I am. In fact I was the only guy who did not stand up.

After sometime, the meeting started, and he explained about their product, chain system, how to join others, etc etc...

""ALL MULTI LEVEL MARKETING CRAP""

Definitely, we will get attracted to their words and plans.

It is a chain where a person is fooled and then he is trained to fool others to earn money

After one hour of session, he called some boys. they were in different colored suites (they don’t even have dressing sense, they don’t know how to wear a suit, even how to behave)

He told them to introduce themselves.

First guy came to front and he said like:

-My name is Ajay

-I came from so & so

-My father is from very poor family.because of this opportunity that i got, Currently now I am earning 1L per month & I am sending 50k to my parents every month.I started constructing a new house in my hometown.

- Now the second guy came up & he said different story and after that, another one.

They said that they are earning 1 - 2 lakhs per month but no one looked like someone who is earning 1 Lakh.

I realized that they were lying and decided to not join in this Trap/actually Crap....

After the session, when I asked for the money they refused to return me Rs.10000 /- and they told me that i have to attend few more sessions to understand better.

It's my friend money not mine, so i know they will surely return him back.

Came back to Room, packed my bag and i told my friend that I don’t want to discuss anything more about this as I am not interested in this.

I understand ""why you called me here"". its your situation. I really don’t want to step into this shit.

Him and his colleagues tried to still convince me but i didn’t listen to them.

I came to railway station and returned to Hyderabad

****** I only lost Rs.2000 for train tickets and all

but he lost trust of ""Friendship"" *********

I told my dad everything and to my surprise he didn't even get angry at me.

He appreciated me, as i realized this sooner.

Guys, There is No Shortcut way to earn money.

“If you want to become rich”

Do hardwork, smart work, Learn Skills, Get Experience.

“DON'T GET INTO THIS MULTI LEVEL MARKETING SHIT” for easy money.

It's all Scam. Everything is fraud.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,5y,What kind of scam have you experienced?,"I have seen a bunch of interesting small scams.

On my last trip to China in September 2017, I was accosted by two women in 20s as I was walking in the forbidden city. They initially said they wanted to practice their English and thus I let them walk with me. As I went through the monuments they kept asking more asking more questions about me, my company and India.

I was curious about what scam they were going to pull and was looking for that. Since China is quite safe for foreigners and this is right around the Tianenmen square — their seat of power, I didn’t feel quite threatened. I was fairly sure that I could call the cops anytime.

I made sure that we walked only in the bigger streets as we kept getting into the heart of Beijing. Then they took me to a restaurant. I just watched out for if they would drug me and in any case put my WeChat and Whatsapp status as that location. I also made a call from there to a local friend just to let them know the my hosts know.

Finally, the scam turned out to be outrageously priced menu items. I didn’t eat anything for fear of what might be there, but the bill for the 2 ladies came out to be be somewhere around 1000 yuan. Amidst much protest from them, I just said we can only share the bill [they were like how can a lady be charged] three ways and just departed with placing 300 yuan.

Anish Kumar,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"So, This happened with me today, I posted an ad of a digital camera on OLX, which I have been trying to sell for quite a time but was unsuccessful to do so. Today one customer called me and this is how the conversation went :

HIM: Hello, You posted an ad and I want to purchase it.

ME: Okay, for how much you will take it?

HIM: 2550 (3000 was the price I posted on the site).

ME: okay.

HIM: Give me your Gpay QR code on my WhatsApp and I will send you the amount and my boy will pick it up.

So, as you can see here he didn't even ask anything about the camera defect or how old it was, any person who has even a minute interest would ask a question about the product they are about to buy. (First red Flag)

Being an avid reader on Quora I read some scam related posts, so I was a little suspicious.

After I gave him my Gpay details this is how the conversation went:

HIM: open your Gpay app, I am sending you the money.

ME: I was like what? why do I need to open the app? if you send me the money it will show on the notification.

HIM: See I am sending you from Military payment, And do you have balance in your account? (Second red flag)

ME: Why the heck do you care if I have money in my account or not (At this point, I knew something isn't right).

HIM: Okay, okay !! I am sending you the money.

**And something like this popped in my Gpay app**

ME( infuriated): WHAT IS THIS? YOU DIDNT SEND ANY MONEY IN FACT, YOU HAVE REQUESTED MONEY FROM ME AND HAVE WRITTEN” Received 2550 ” in the message box.

HIM: Just press on pay option and the money will be deducted from my account and will be transferred to you.

ME: THIS IS NOT HOW Gpay WORKS, What do you think I am a fool or what? (I lost all my patience and at this point, I cursed him so much that it's not appropriate to write here. )

He hung up the phone.

I mean just imagine if someone who doesn't know to use these apps would have really lost a lot of money.

Even if I was naive enough to pay him the money I would have had the last laugh, because you see I didn't have that much money in my account, I am a student also broke :)

All thanks to QUORA and its amazing users, I read something similar and was very suspicious.

Thank for reading.

EDIT 1: Overwhelmed by responses, thank you everyone.

EDIT 2: Now I am receiving random request from Gpay :

Bhuvnesh Verma,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Year 2018,

Fraud at the cost of PATRIOTISM

I encountered this scam before too!

I was returning from Hazarat Nizamuddin Railway Station, Delhi towards ITO Metro Station. I was in an auto rickshaw. As soon as I reached the ITO Metro Station entry stairs, I was stopped by a group of three women. Without saying anything, they just pinned a small paper on my right shoulder on which our own country’s National Flag, that is, our Tiranga(Tricolor) was printed. I smiled in gratitude thinking that maybe they were just doing it for increasing patriotism among us Indians and then I just started going towards the entry premises. But no, that was not the end of course. They stopped me by holding my hand and said, “We are collecting money for ORPHAN CHILDREN, we are from an NGO”.

Without wasting my time, I took out some changes and gave a ₹20 note to them. But their greediness show had just started. She again asked for more money, “Your wallet has more money and you are just giving me 20₹, give me some more money”.

I finally gave her ₹30 more, in total I gave her 20+30=₹50 and finally I was on my way. But later when I thought about this incident, I realized that something is wrong and an NGO never ask for money like this, never. They can request you, they can have relevant documents but in this case, nothing was there, no documents, no uniform of that NGO, nothing, nothing and nothing. So guys finally my case was completed.

But! But! But!

Last month, I mean in May,

I was near AKSHARDHAM MANDIR, Metro Station, and I saw that SCAM again. I went near them & I stood near those “Unethical and greedy” women for about one hour. And I observed each and everything keenly, I even made a footage and circulated that video on social media too for public awareness for all these fraud peoples & their extra-fraud techniques.

So, here are some of the screenshots, from the recorded video.

STEP - 1 :- STOPPING PEOPLE AND PINNING FLAG ON THEIR SHOULDER.

STEP 2 : - ASKING FOR THE MONEY AND INTRODUCING THEMSELVES AS THE MEMBERS OF SOME NGOs.

STEP 3 : - FINALLY ASKING FOR MONEY! -_-

Guys, when I was observing them, one of those women, was continuously observing me too but none of them came to me for pinning the flag and the money.

They have experience of this “Scam” and they stop only the innocent people and the ones who are new in Delhi because the outsiders don't know much about these scams and frauds in Delhi.

So, dear readers please be careful around such fraud people and don't spend your money on these things. This group plays with our feelings for our Nation. This group is very common on the roads of Delhi. So please be careful.

Thanks,

Swapnil Nimbalkar,5y,What are common scams in India?,"ICICI PRUDENTIAL (Insurance Scam)

I have taken home loan of Rs.53,00,000/- from ICICI Bank for the period of 20 years. While filling up the loan application form sales person told me about the iShield 360° insurance policy, its benefits etc and gave me estimate of Rs.1,85,432/- (one time payment) which will be added to my loan amount. (refer image) Along with loan application form I signed the insurance form too.

The policy includes critical illness cover, all type of death cover/loss of limb, in case of my death Rs.48,96,875/- will be credited to the loan account. The policy I opted for is of 10 years, as I feel that I will be in a position to repay the amount within this period.

I did not receive the policy even after 15 days of making payment. Contacted the bank sales manager, he promised me that it will be resolved soon. 10 days passed, he got frustrated (due to my repeated calls) and gave me contact no. of Mr.’X’ who belongs to the insurance company. He also made false promises for 15–20 days without any concrete solution (It was very frustrating)

I contacted the customer care, they said that there is no policy linked to my loan a/c no or phone no. I was advised to visit nearest branch, did same with no luck.

Filed a complaint with the nodal officer, who took matter seriously and emailed me the policies after 7 days (total one and half month after making payment)

I contacted the customer care to cancel the policies, they told me to drop an email, the request can not be taken over a phone call. I did email them and received a reply saying “your ID is not registered with us”. The sales guy had deliberately put wrong email ID.

Went to the branch, changed email ID, emailed them to cancel the policies.

Now here’s the scam (see image)

I visited the branch to see the scanned copies of my application form. I came to know that the sales guy had made my false signature and I was issued a policy of Rs.1,13,60,840/- (why would I go for this amount if my loan amount is Rs.53L) for a period is 5 years (I had applied for 10 years)

I had to visit the branch office 3 times for different reasons.

I had to fight to get my money back.

I paid interest on the above amount.

Today (after 2 months and 15 days of making payment) I received SMS that money will be deposited shortly.

I consider that insurance companies in India are scammers. The sales team will always make false promises and later they will tell you to contact customer care for any queries.

I still don’t know why did Insurance guy do this (to achieve his monthly target?)

Let me know if I should move to IRDA/Consumer court to get the interest back or I should file a complaint for compensation.

OneForAll,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Regarding Fake NCERT Books.

Nowadays educational motives of private schools are just backed by the huge marginal profit.

Here's my story.

( My sister needed books for her new class so she told our father )

Sister- Father, i want books for my upcoming class.

I was right there.

Me- You don't have to purchase the books because i had some ncert books of mine for your class and you can buy rest of the books from your store.

Sister- No, i want new ones, because mam told us to buy new books from the store.

Father - ok fine, buy the new books but how much does it cost ?

Sister- Between 4000–5000.

Me-

I was totally shocked.

Me- Are you kidding me, NCERT books do not cost that much.

Sister- yes, but we don't read NCERTs. Our school published different books from different publisher and we bought those.

Next day, we went to her school and asked the storekeeper for the books and he made a bill of 4800 and aftermath, i matched the whole syllabus of the books with NCERTs. Everything is same, almost everything even some page numbers are also same.

I was totally shocked that how these Private schools are fooling us. They just change the book cover, with colourful pages, a different writer and with some other unnecessary things and also you can't read with NCERTs in your class, you must have to buy the new ones.

Just Imagine, if we buy the NCERT books then it costs us somewhere between 700–800 against this fake books. So that's why For me this is one of the common scams in india.

Madhav Arora,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"“Another loot under GST regime”

So the growing fever of e-commerce enabled food delivery services by companies like Zomato, Swiggy & Uber Eats has taken people by storm.

& why not?

They are serving us delicious food from our favorite restaurants & joints @ flat 50% rates!!

But recently I found myself in not so very comfortable position with respect to my transaction with Uber Eats.

Some random day, I placed an order of ice cream with them. Below is the bill for same as issued by Uber Eats-

The bill amount before discount, i.e ₹230 (₹194.92 + ₹35.09) is correct by all means & matches with the bill issued by the restaurant!

Now here comes the scam!

Another day, I ordered ice cream again from the same restaurant & placed my order with Uber Eats for the sake of mouth-watering 50% discount. (flavor was different this time but was of exact same rate as the previous one)

The bill I received from Uber Eats is below-

& The bill issued by the restaurant which was taped with the packing itself is below-

Being a Chartered Accountant, I sensed something very fishy!

The amount of ₹230 already included GST @18%. The same is clearly evident from the restaurant bill. Also, the amount exclusive of GST mentioned in restaurant bill i.e ₹194.92 exactly matches with the amount of the first order I mentioned above.

So, Uber Eats further charged me GST @18% on the amount of ₹230 on which the restaurant had already charged w.r.t same.

I am assuming here that they did this to everyone who ordered!!

I connected with their customer support team & they seemed to have zero knowledge for same. They even claimed the amount of GST i.e ₹41.40 to be the GST charge on their services, which also isn't true.

GST is charged on the value of goods & services. Here the value of services provided by Uber Eats is ₹1. So GST @18% on the value of ₹1 can’t come out to be ₹41.40.

Also, the amount of ₹41.40 is 18% of ₹230. So they clearly have levied GST on the value of goods which already included taxes & wrongfully recovered the amount in name of GST.

The customer support is responseless as of now & they have deleted the conversation too that took place through the app itself. Otherwise would have also shown their responses as well!!!

I wonder what fortune have they made in this scam till date!!!

It is my request to all that we must always check the bill details in shops, hotels and everywhere. I am sure there are many such examples of looting under the name of GST. Beware!

Edit 1:- There’s a lot of confusion over the rate of GST applicable to restaurants. A clarification w.r.t same is mentioned below-

In nutshell, a restaurant has 3 options to choose from under GST regime where-

It can avail “Input Tax Credit (ITC)” on the inward supply of goods & services & has to levy GST @ rate of 18% on the outward supply.
It can not avail ITC on inward supply & has to levy GST @ rate of 5% on outward supply.
It can opt for “Composition Scheme” where GST @ 5% has to be paid to the government but it can not recover the said amount from customers in name of GST, i.e the said amount shall not be mentioned anywhere in the invoice & has to be paid from own pocket. The scheme attracts lesser compliances & has been introduced for small-scale businesses.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hmd36jik7pxuz48g', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.8116, 'ai': 0.1884}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""“Another loot under GST regime”\n\nSo the growing fever of e-commerce enabled food delivery services by companies like Zomato, Swiggy & Uber Eats has taken people by storm.\n\n& why not?\n\nThey are serving us delicious food from our favorite restaurants & joints @ flat 50% rates!!\n\nBut recently I found myself in not so very comfortable position with respect to my transaction with Uber Eats.\n\nSome random day, I placed an order of ice cream with them.

Sarthak Chaudhary,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Pizza delivery scam

So this happened a day before Diwali. I had ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut through Zomato app. Since it was my first time ordering through Zomato app I got a discount of 100Rs. and I paid the entire amount through card.

When the delivery guy came to deliver my pizza he said that I had to pay 100Rs as the discount was not applicable on holidays. I told him that if there was any such condition then the coupon would not have applied. But he said that is not his problem and demanded the remaining amount. But I was in no mood to pay the remaining amount and i told him to give me the number of his manager so I can talk to him.

As soon as I asked him his manger’s number he suddenly changed his tone.

He said “Sir there is no need to talk to the manager, I will myself resolve the issue on your behalf and if you still have to pay then I'll call you.”

After that I never received his call.

Later on I talked to his manager and told him about the entire incident and he assured me that necessary actions would be taken.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/i4owjtexchd7pyun', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9981, 'ai': 0.0019}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Pizza delivery scam\n\nSo this happened a day before Diwali.

Pankaj Kumar,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"I am writing this answer to save innocent people from open scam, which doesn't look like a scam.

This is a story of Indian parents, who are old and have difficulties to understand and embrace technology and a guy, who is excited to make the life of his parents simple using technology. Yes, I am that guy, who is fascinated by technology just like many of you.

My mother was ill for three months and my father was also weak due to prolong sickness. I asked them to go to Kolkata for medical check-ups. My father used to book ticket manually, book hotel physically, travel in yellow taxi or bus and have meal in restaurants.

I thought to make the things easier so I booked their train tickets, then booked cab (Uber) to Hotel. I had already booked the Hotel through OYO and had made the advance payment. I was thousands of mile away from them but I tried to give them a good feelings of technology. I had planned to order food from Swiggy to hotel too.

On judgement day, my parents started the journey at 4am, they reached Kolkata at 1 pm and got the cab (Uber) after 30 mins wait to OYO hotel. They were very hungry and tired, but I had booked the hotel just near Fortis hospital for lesser inconvenience. My mother was too sick to move but mentally too strong to not show emotion or weakness.

When my parents reached hotel, the hotel owner denied the Check-In. My parents called me to say Hotel was asking another 1200 as OYO booking amount was less. I was like - what the hell! I have already paid to OYO, how can they deny it.

I first talked to Hotel and they were rude to me when I explained I have already paid for it. I was in a meeting in office, I excused it and called OYO multiple times. They were sorry.. Yes sorry and shocked. I thought this is unusual and rare case. Then OYO asked me to put my call on hold. Call was on hold for 20 mins. Then again 20 mins. Then OYO assistant offered me to SHIFT to other nearby property. I was shocked now. How can hotel deny check-in after payment and how can OYO be so lenient on this. I requested OYO that my ailing parents are standing at reception and they have already taken 1.5 hours to resolve my issue. Then call got dropped.

I called again and repeated the story to new assistant. Ticket was raised without any severity or deadline, and assistant asked me to put my phone on hold as he was checking with ground team. Then after 40 mins they suggested near by property, which was in other side of EM bypass near Fortis in Kolkata. That means 1 km away from current hotel. I explained the situation to my parents and asked them that I was booking cab for it. I couldn't book cab because of unavailability. I was helpless. I asked them to book rickshaw or yellow taxi. Those were also not unavailable. Then I again tried to book cab, and by that time, my parents had left for other hotel (suggested by OYO) by foot with luggage. They crossed the busy bypass(those in Kolkata would know) and reached the new Hotel.

Then they found the new Hotel was not registered to OYO. They denied any tie-ups. They had tie-ups before 2months but now now.

I angrily called OYO and asked them to handle the situation. They again put my phone on hold for 30 mins and came up with reason/excuse - it's a technical glitch sir. I asked for solution and they offered me refund (may be in 7–14 days as per their policy). Finally, my father explored the place, enquired with people and booked a near by property himself without using internet. They waited 4+ hours to get a room and 18+ hours to get food. I felt like a failed son.

I can't even imagine what inconvenience were caused to them and they never complained.

I am sure you would have thought where is scam in this?

It can be a business strategy for OYO but it's a scam as it's happening more often with my friends and family…and may be with you too.. I have read quora answers and blogs, reviews and tweets where people have faced similar problem. It's not a technical glitch, it's a planned strategy.. Yes Scam.

This is new business model of OYO

You book a hotel at comparatively cheaper price at OYO. You even pay entire amount for booking confirmation.
You visit hotel and Check-in is denied as OYO has flexible tie-up with hotels, where a hotel can deny booking if money is not sufficient.
OYO suggests you another hotel but doesn't pay for inconvenience or transport.
OYO shifts you to property, which is far from your destination (hospital, college, office, etc.) and OYO makes 20% from booking.
Another hotel can again deny and OYO again offer you to shift to other property.
Many properties are not listed with OYO but OYO app shows you those unlisted properties and even allow you to book without confirming with Hotel.
At max, at max, OYO cancels your booking and refunds your money in 7 to 10 days. They still make money from 7 days interest.

They have No Loss. Either they anyhow put you in some hotel or they refund your money after some days. Unreliability and fooling the customer by knowingly giving trouble is also a scam… it's monetary, mental as well as physical torture.

OYO is now only good for hook-ups space, that too at On Your Own (OYO) risk.

Edit: After escalating the issue at various social media platforms, OYO called me at 3am and again at 9am. They offered me 500 ruppees as compensation. I straight forward denied and apprised them how many people like me are victim of OYO's inhuman policies. Please note, don't fall for OYO's compensation, OYO money can't be used in one go. You can use a part of(20% around) OYO money only. It is OYO's evil way to silence the victim.

Edit: After escalating the issue at every platforms, after discarding multiple calls and mails from OYO, I got a call from OYO's central office, who looked more professional. We discussed some critical points:

Change in Booking Rejection policy for all.
Compensation/Refund for all victims in comment as they have more traumatic inconvenience than I had.

They assured me of action, which I wasn't (isn't) optimistic about. However, OYO compensated Rs2780 that I had to pay to hotel after rejection to book it physically. Though monetary compensation can't compensate the actual loss to me, my family, close relatives, friends and followers, but don't let the matter go easily.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/35tfxe1jh92go0zb', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.55273333333333, 'ai': 0.44726666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am writing this answer to save innocent people from open scam, which doesn't look like a scam.\n\nThis is a story of Indian parents, who are old and have difficulties to understand and embrace technology and a guy, who is excited to make the life of his parents simple using technology.

Yes, I am that guy, who is fascinated by technology just like many of you.\n\nMy mother was ill for three months and my father was also weak due to prolong sickness. I asked them to go to Kolkata for medical check-ups. My father used to book ticket manually, book hotel physically, travel in yellow taxi or bus and have meal in restaurants.\n\nI thought to make the things easier so I booked their train tickets, then booked cab (Uber) to Hotel. I had already booked the Hotel through OYO and had made the advance payment. I was thousands of mile away from them but I tried to give them a good feelings of technology. I had planned to order food from Swiggy to hotel too.\n\nOn judgement day, my parents started the journey at 4am, they reached Kolkata at 1 pm and got the cab (Uber) after 30 mins wait to OYO hotel. They were very hungry and tired, but I had booked the hotel just near Fortis hospital for lesser inconvenience. My mother was too sick to move but mentally too strong to not show emotion or weakness.\n\nWhen my parents reached hotel, the hotel owner denied the Check-In. My parents called me to say Hotel was asking another 1200 as OYO booking amount was less. I was like - what the hell! I have already paid to OYO, how can they deny it.\n\nI first talked to Hotel and they were rude to me when I explained I have already paid for it. I was in a meeting in office, I excused it and called OYO multiple times. They were sorry.. Yes sorry and shocked. I thought this is unusual and rare case. Then OYO asked me to put my call on hold. Call was on hold for 20 mins. Then again 20 mins. Then OYO assistant offered me to SHIFT to other nearby property. I was shocked now. How can hotel deny check-in after payment and how can OYO be so lenient on this. I requested OYO that my ailing parents are standing at reception and they have already taken 1.5 hours to resolve my issue. Then call got dropped.\n\nI called again and repeated the story to new assistant. Ticket was raised without any severity or deadline, and assistant asked me to put my phone on hold as he was checking with ground team. Then after 40 mins they suggested near by property, which was in other side of EM bypass near Fortis in Kolkata. That means 1 km away from current hotel. I explained the situation to my parents and asked them that I was booking cab for it. I couldn't book cab because of unavailability. I was helpless. I asked them to book rickshaw or yellow taxi. Those were also not unavailable. Then I again tried to book cab, and by that time, my parents had left for other hotel (suggested by OYO) by foot with luggage. They crossed the busy bypass(those in Kolkata would know) and reached the new Hotel.\n\nThen they found the new Hotel was not registered to OYO. They denied any tie-ups. They had tie-ups before 2months but now now.\n\nI angrily called OYO and asked them to handle the situation. They again put my phone on hold for 30 mins and came up with reason/excuse - it's a technical glitch sir. I asked for solution and they offered me refund (may be in 7–14 days as per their policy). Finally, my father explored the place, enquired with people and booked a near by property himself without using internet. They waited 4+ hours to get a room and 18+ hours to get food.

Yes Scam.\n\nThis is new business model of OYO\n\nYou book a hotel at comparatively cheaper price at OYO.

They still make money from 7 days interest.\n\nThey have No Loss. Either they anyhow put you in some hotel or they refund your money after some days.

Jagadish T,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Inovative scam by delivery agents - and equally responsible customer support.

This incident happened last week, I frequently order online due to my irregular work timings. Following are events unfolded:

Ordered some food from local shop through swiggy app as COD payment.

Received confirmation sms from swiggy.

Waited for nearly 45 minutes, checked on app to see status, found delivery person as already left the shop, but can be seen on tracker half way through and standing in same location 15–20 minutes for some unknown reason(part of scam keep reading).

Finally received my order, delivery agent asked for mobile number (found bit suspicious)

I paid the total amount in CASH, so far so good. Wait scam just not started yet.

Interestingly after receiving my order and fully paying it, I got an SMS stating your order is cancelled and cancellation fee of 75 is charged.

I was surprised and furious, felt that there must be honest mistake from swiggy.

But this was no mistake. It's a scam by delivery agents - they collect COD amount and check the order as undeliverable (remember he purposely wasted around 15–20 mins midway through in the same location without moving an inch). This way they pocket the COD money and the great swiggy punishses honest customer. And why not they have hired only gem of a person, critically acclaimed for their honesty, no reason to doubt them.

Contacted swiggy customer care for resolution. Instead of correcting their mistake, they replied back rejecting my claim, which literally means I lied. After being a long time customer of swiggy I feel betrayed and it's definitely not about 75 rs , it being cheated that get to my nerves.

I have made resolution to not to order anymore from a company which breeds cheaters and treats it's customer with no respect, at least I would have expected them to give a second thought before coming to conclusion.

I request my fellow quorans to avoid payment in COD.

Edit 1:

Received a call from resolution department of swiggy. Appreciate that they acknowledged the issue and agreed to refund the cancellation charges.

Sarthak Bhatt,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"The ola drivers' scam

A few days ago my family attended a marriage ceremony. When the ceremony was over, I booked an Ola. It arrived in 5 minutes. I confirmed the OTP with the driver.

But just when he was about to start the ride, he turned to me and said :

Sir, I have pressed the ‘Ride Completed’ button by mistake.

I checked my phone and yeah it was showing that the ride was over.

Now generally the fare from the banquet hall to my home is Rs.140–160. But since the ride ended after travelling a few meters the total was Rs.96.

He then told me that he will drop us home and asked me to pay Rs250.

He claimed that he had dropped many people to this location and the ola app showed around Rs250 as a total fare.

Luckily on that day, I had taken a screenshot of the bill that the app displayed before checking in for the ride.

Image source: my phone’s gallery.

I showed him the screenshot and gave him Rs141.

Now yesterday I faced the same situation again but this time I didn't have the screenshot. So, I ended up giving the money that driver asked (that was toooo high than the general price).

This is a common scam ola drivers are using to earn more money. So do take a screenshot before riding an ola.

Mandeep Singh Gulati,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"I am going to talk about a scam by the Matrix SIM card provider employees at the New Delhi Airport.

Many of you might be aware of this company which sells SIM cards for international travellers with plans which can work in the destination country. Its a very good service and their SIM cards cost much less than the international roaming packs provided by Airtel, Vodafone, etc. I was travelling to Bali, Indonesia and I saw their kiosk at the airport where 2–3 sales agents keep inviting passers by to buy their SIM cards. I went to their kiosk and this is how our conversation went:

Matrix Guy: Hello sir, which country are you travelling to?

Me: Bali, Indonesia. Do you have SIM cards for that country for like 7 days ?

Matrix Guy: Yes sir, we do

Me: How much will it cost?

Matrix Guy: Sir it will cost 1500/- INR

Then he went on and explained the plan details. I felt it was a good deal because my cellphone provider (Airtel) was quoting me 3000/- for an international roaming pack with almost the same services.

Me: Okay, I will buy 2 SIM cards, one for myself and one for my wife

Matrix Guy: Okay sir. May I have your passport?

I handed over my passport, he took a photocopy of it and kept it with himself. He also asked me my email address. Then he handed over the SIM cards to me and showed me the amount on screen which was 3064/- INR for 2 SIM cards

I gave him 3100/- in cash and he was supposed to return me 36/-

Matrix Guy: Sir, I don’t have change

Me: Okay, no problem. I will pay with my credit card.

This made him a little uncomfortable and he and his colleague looked at each other. I thought perhaps he wasn’t willing to return the change but the actual reason was something else

Matrix Guy: Sir, please see if you have change?

Me: I am pretty sure I don’t. But I can pay with credit card. What’s the problem with that?

Matrix Guy: Let me see if I can arrange the change.

He asked another colleague of his for change and he handed over the change from his wallet. He gave me those 30/- INR and asked me if it was ok? I said fine, took the change and left. I didn’t bother to ask for a receipt or a bill and that was my mistake.

Next day I get 2 emails from Matrix with the bill for both the SIM cards and then I realised why the guy became uncomfortable when I offered to pay via credit card. This is the screenshot of the bill

The total amount for each SIM card that I was supposed to pay was 1331/- and the actual amount I paid was 1532/-. The difference is insignificant for the customer but depending on how many SIM cards they sell everyday, they are earning a good amount of money scamming people and their own company as well.

Remember he never gave me any receipt for the payment? That’s why!

Also, if I had transacted via credit card, then he could not have initiated a charge of more than the actual amount.

So, next time you buy a SIM card from Matrix, make sure to pay via credit card and insist on getting the receipt for the payment. Hope this answer helps other people from getting scammed by those Matrix employees and I hope the company takes some strict action against those employees engaging in such unethical behavior.

UPDATE: I have received the full refund from Matrix. For two weeks they did nothing and after posting about the incident online, I got my money back in 2 working days. I don’t know if they took any action against their employees at the airport who are scamming people but at least I got my money back and since this answer has gathered so many views and upvotes, I hope a lot of people have been made aware of this scam.

When I called the customer care, they agreed to send an engineer. But he's to be paid a “conveyance n consultance” fees of 400/- irrespective of the issue and subsequent charges to repair it.

I reluctantly agreed.

An engineer visited the home and inspected the device jus by tapping on the TV screen at random places ; didn't even unmount the TV from wall stand.

He then asked me to sign a form regarding inspection details and asked for the “fees”

When I asked him what the issue was, he attributed it to a fault in motherboard panel and it had to be replaced wholly at a whopping cost of 16k INR since the TV is past its guarantee period !

He also dismissed any alternate less-expensive solutions.

As he left, I wondered if I had to buy a new basic model LED TV or a second hand feature rich model .

Hours spent on Google, Flipkart, Amazon, Quikr were of no use.

After a colleague's suggestion, finally, it struck me to search for a local electronics service center.

And lo ! A guy arrived at an agreed time, unmounted the device and inspected. Then he requested the device to be taken to his shop to check for further issues. Only upon his confirmation of possibility to repair along with cost details he said he'd proceed .

Next day he said he could repair the TV by changing few ICs at a cost of 2500 INR. I struggled to agree to the cost without sounding surprised.

Few days later, he came back with the TV, connected the DTH himself and demonstrated it worked normally again.

I finally gave in to my temptation and narrated my ordeal before reaching out to him.

When asked why there's so much cost difference, he smiled signing off “If companies attend to repair works at IC level, then they can hardly thrive”

Beware of Samsung !

A few days later when I got a call from Samesong seeking my feedback they received an earful.

It's been few months then since my TV was repaired and I almost forgot it till I saw this question.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fdc0ebwusp8ao71j', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Not sure if this is common but definitely worth highlighting.\n\nOur 4 year old LEDTV suddenly didn't work.\n\nWhen I called the customer care, they agreed to send an engineer.

Jeswin Jose,4y,What are common scams in India?,"December 2014. It was my 3rd month in Bengaluru. I was in a Tea shop, waiting for a friend. A strange young man came to talk to me. He was around 25 with a gentle man look. For now, let’s call him Gentle Man.

So, the conversation went like this:

Gentleman : Hey, sorry, can you tell me what the time it is?

Me : Hi, It’s 6pm.

Gentleman : Okay. I’m waiting for my friend here for last 20 minutes. What are you upto?

Me : Same here too.

(Some casual talks went on for sometime)

Gentleman : I guess we are like-minded people. Even I used to work in IT and then quit to follow my passion. I now work as a tennis instructor.

(Well, that was the first time I have met someone who actually doesn’t work for IT in Bengaluru. That too someone who is following his passion! Impressed!)

Me : That’s great. I’m happy for you that you are following your passion. I fell into the IT trap and I don’t think there is an escape from this.

(My friend came in between, and I introduced him to the gentleman)

Gentleman : We actually have a group of people who are into day jobs, mostly IT, and trying to follow our passion. It’s like a self-help group who can mentor you to achieve your passion. Why don’t you guys join it?

(Well, at this point, we were pretty impressed by this idea, and thought that we would give it a try.)

Friend : We’d love to. (And exchanged phone numbers)

The next day, we got a call from him, asking if we can make it to a party this weekend. We got excited as we had never been to a party in this city before. We accepted the invitation , and got dressed up for the party.

We followed the Google Maps to get to the location he gave and, it felt a bit unusual because it took us to a residential area. I could see no trace of any party happening there and felt quite doubtful about the whole thing. Then, the gentleman called us on the phone and directed us to a house there.

We could see around 40–50 people dressed up in formals in the house. It didn’t look like a party but more like a business meeting. And we were, there in the middle of all people there, in bright colored dress, trying to figure out what is happening? The gentleman greeted us with a smile of accomplishment on his face and asked us to be seated in the carpet along with the fellow guys in the formals. I looked around, there was no trace of any drinks, food or anything. I slowly realized that there is no party. *Sigh!*

And then, a power-point presentation was started and only then we realized what we have fallen into . It was actually a meeting of a Pyramid Scheme
 business. Adding to the damage, an award was given to our gentle man during the meeting, for trapping more people into their so-called business. He then asked both of us to stand up during the meeting, and asked us to give a testimony on how we feel about joining the business. I went to the mic and told something like

“I feel so excited to be part of this meeting. Nice to meet you all. Thank you.” (All I wanted then was to run away). My friend also repeated same sentences.

After the presentation, the gentleman introduced us to many people there in the group. Everyone had a fake smile on their face and it read like- You are trapped mf! The Gentleman asked us to submit a blank copy of our bank cheque, PAN and other details to join the business. We assured them that we will submit everything on the next day.

They gave us a bag of some books, catalogs and DVDs, to learn the act of trapping more people. We thankfully accepted everything and went out of the house and dumped everything into a drainage just outside that house and went home.

The next day, the gentleman called us to collect the PAN and other details and we literally asked him to f*uck off. He was so pissed off and was swearing at us. This ended up in a swear war and he lost it. He threatened us that if we don’t return books and DVDs, we would face its consequences. And we asked him to collect it from the drainage near his house and disconnected the call and blocked his number.

Months later, this business was blacklisted and associated people were charged for fraud. Well, ours was a narrow escape!

Raman Khandelwal,4y,What are common scams in India?,"India's water purifier scam.If you have a RO you should definitely read this.

These big companies loot us indians Because of our lack of knowledge and fool us.

*Edit 1 and 2 are important*

While selling a purifier many sales man use two tactics to dupe us into believing that we need purified water from their RO.

They use TDS meter.

This tool is used to check the impurities in the purifier

And according to those deceiving salesman the lower the number the better it is.The bigger the number the more impurities it has.

So what they will do is ,they will use this in your Normal water.The TDS will be around 60–150.

And then they will use their purifier's water/PACKAGED WATER and show that TDS is only 15.

And will tell us that “See ,that's why you should buy water purifier”

But what they won't tell is that this water is not “pure” it is highly “Demineralised” which means the important mineral contents are not there in the water.

According to WHO we can drink water upto 500TDS.

Now to prove this we use this meter in a mineral bottle water .

See the TDS is 246 in mineral bottled water .

That's why a mineral water bottle is better than a packaged water bottle cause it has essential minerals in it.

The second trick they will use it through this Device

“Electrolyte”.

So basically what they will do is ,they will place one end in your Normal water which is purified mineral water in this case and their “purifier's water “ in other.

After some time our normal water will turn yellow and they will tell us that we were drinking all these impurities.

Truth- These are not impurities but dissociated minerals because of the electrolysis process.

Just think for a second.Everyone knows this.

Distilled water is a very bad conductor of electricity coz it doesn't have any minerals in it.

Now using the same principle we now know that since the RO water has close to no minerals at all ,then electricity hardly passes through it and hence nothing happens.

So beware of those salesman who use these methods to scam you . who make you believe that your normal water is bad.There are other ways to find this out but not these two.They just there to scam you.

“Jaago Grahak Jaago!”

Credit to YouTube/Innovative Technocare .

Edit : I am not suggesting that ROs are bad .My motive was to spread awareness regarding the malpractices used by sellers.

Edit 2: TDS is not a right measure to check if a water is drinkable or not.Water which has 300TDS is drinkable if it doesn't have harmful minerals.

Also water with TDS 200 can be harmful to drink if it has harmful minerals.

A TDS meter does not measure contaminants. It will not tell you if your water is healthy. Some healthy minerals like potassium, magnesium, and calcium can actually cause your TDS meter to spike.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ydh3efsb52i4jgtl', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""India's water purifier scam.If you have a RO you should definitely read this.\n\nThese big companies loot us indians Because of our lack of knowledge and fool us.\n\n*Edit 1 and 2 are important*\n\nWhile selling a purifier many sales man use two tactics to dupe us into believing that we need purified water from their RO.\n\nThey use TDS meter.\n\nThis tool is used to check the impurities in the purifier\n\nAnd according to those deceiving salesman the lower the number the better it is.The bigger the number the more impurities it has.\n\nSo what they will do is ,they will use this in your Normal water.The TDS will be around 60–150.\n\nAnd then they will use their purifier's water/PACKAGED WATER and show that TDS is only 15.\n\nAnd will tell us that “See ,that's why you should buy water purifier”\n\nBut what they won't tell is that this water is not “pure” it is highly “Demineralised” which means the important mineral contents are not there in the water.\n\nAccording to WHO we can drink water upto 500TDS.\n\nNow to prove this we use this meter in a mineral bottle water .\n\nSee the TDS is 246 in mineral bottled water .\n\nThat's why a mineral water bottle is better than a packaged water bottle cause it has essential minerals in it.\n\nThe second trick they will use it through this Device\n\n“Electrolyte”.\n\nSo basically what they will do is ,they will place one end in your Normal water which is purified mineral water in this case and their “purifier's water “ in other.\n\nAfter some time our normal water will turn yellow and they will tell us that we were drinking all these impurities.\n\nTruth- These are not impurities but dissociated minerals because of the electrolysis process.\n\nJust think for a second.Everyone knows this.\n\nDistilled water is a very bad conductor of electricity coz it doesn't have any minerals in it.\n\nNow using the same principle we now know that since the RO water has close to no minerals at all ,then electricity hardly passes through it and hence nothing happens.\n\nSo beware of those salesman who use these methods to scam you . who make you believe that your normal water is bad.There are other ways to find this out but not these two.They just there to scam you.\n\n“Jaago Grahak Jaago!”\n\nCredit to YouTube/Innovative Technocare .\n\nEdit : I am not suggesting that ROs are bad .My motive was to spread awareness regarding the malpractices used by sellers.\n\nEdit 2: TDS is not a right measure to check if a water is drinkable or not.Water which has 300TDS is drinkable if it doesn't have harmful minerals.\n\nAlso water with TDS 200 can be harmful to drink if it has harmful minerals.\n\nA TDS meter does not measure contaminants.

Chirag Garg,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"**Beware of Rental Cars Scam**

So I took a rental car from Zoomcar for a trip from Pune to Mahabaleshwar. The car they have provided is all dirty and have an almost empty fuel tank(I had booked with fuel).

Remember whenever you choose for the with fuel option they provide you a car with an almost empty tank so that you will ask for a refund and they can play their trick.

After filling petrol we started our journey after some time, car breakdown happens. We were in the middle of Pune and Mahabaleshwar. We tried their customer support number many times but it was not working. After wasting an hour like this we decided to repair the car ourselves from a local mechanic(It costs us too).

After completing trip we park the car and lock it safely. We paid 2313 for the car + 3000 security deposit + 1000 fuel refund. So we should get 4000 as a refund(3000+1000).

After 2 days we found out that they have charged 4000 on the name of damage charges. The exact amount that should be refunded to us. Here is the receipt they have provided.

Yes, they charged twice for the same damage(1000+3000). I have no idea why? We should ask them to refund our money, to provide faulty car instead they are asking for damage charges from us. Can you believe that?

I was trying their customer support number but still, it is unreachable. After 2 weeks got a call from them, please clear the due charges in your zoomcar account. I asked them about the charges, they told me it is for car tyre damage(I returned it in perfect condition). I asked them did they have any proof, they told me yes we can link damaged car pics in your account, I said do it. After holding the call for about 15 mins they told me they are not able to find the pictures now, they will do it in two working days. Two months passed neither I got pics from them nor I got a call again. But the amount is still due in my account.

Deepanshu Puri,4y,What are common scams in India?,"THE UBER CANCELLATION FEES SCAM

(Uber drivers scamming for cancellation fees)

A few days back i booked an uber to the airport for my dad.

The uber map was showing that the driver will arrive in 4 minutes.

But 10 minutes had already passed and the map was still showing 4 minutes.

I called the driver as i was getting late. He picked up the call after 3-4 attempts.

Me: Bhaiya (Brother), where are you? The app is showing you are just 4 minutes away for the past 10-15 minutes.

Driver: Where do you have to go?

Me: To the Airport.

Driver: I'm not going there. You cancel the ride and book a new one.

Me: Wtf? You could've called or texted and told me that you will not go or atleast cancelled the ride. Also, you are the one who is not coming, you have to cancel the ride. Because of you we are already getting late. Now cancel the ride. Why should i get charged for your mistake?

Driver: I won't cancel the ride else it'll be deducted from my salary. You cancel the ride. It's not my mistake that i'm not going that way. You can cancel the ride and book a new one.

And the heated conversation continued for another 2-3 minutes but he refused to cancel it no matter what.

Finally, we were getting late, i said fuck it and cancelled the ride. I was charged ₹42 for the cancellation.

Not only me but it has also happened with a few of my relatives and friends. You don't expect this from a company as big as uber. It is so frustrating.

A petty amount like ₹42 doesn't matter that much but it takes away from the trust and loyalty with the service provider.

The customer care number too doesn't work. I don't think they attend calls and care about the customer. I hope they review their policy and bring some changes to this before people start deleting their app.

Edit : (Because of too many similar comments)

I got my refund as uber credits. But a friend of mine didn't get the refund. Uber said that they'll review with the driver and then they'll give the refund but he never got the refund despite sending emails.

As i said in the answer that more than the money lost the main issue is

Time of customer gets wasted. The person may be in a hurry like my dad was as he had to reach the airport.
Unnecessary arguments with the drivers can be so frustrating.
Also after that they refund the amount as uber credits which is of no use unless the uber app is used again.
Sometimes they don't even refund the money.
Trust and loyalty with the brand suffers.

And i have had bad experiences with ola in the past, that's why i switched to uber.

Tejasvi Sharma,Updated 8mo,What are common scams in India?,"This one SCAM always make my blood boil. I have fought a few times also but to no avail. I have raised the complaint as well but nothing happened.

So, the scam i am talking about is of DMRC. Yes, Delhi metro employees.

I am facing this scam from last 4–5 years and every now and then i see people getting scammed.

So, let me tell you how it works.

Suppose, i go to the ticket counter to get a token for myself.

Now, suppose the token money is ₹50. Now i don't have change so i gave the person on ticket counter ₹500.

So, he is supposed to give be ₹450 back right?

Now here the scam begins. The person on ticket counter would make sure that I am looking at him while he keeps ₹500 in the money box and takes out ₹450.

He will count it 5–6 times in front of my eyes very clearly so that I would realise that he has 4- 100 rupee notes in his hand and 1- 50 rupee note.

After he has done this and he has seen that you paid attention, now he would just slide his hand little inside the money box where the box's lid covers his hand and will quickly fold the money and give it to you along with the token.

Now, since he had already taken a lot of time and mostly people are in hurry so they just keep the amount in their pocket and move away. But, as soon as the person would count the money he would have ₹100 less. Now, if you go back to the counter and say you got less money they wouldn't even dare to ask a question. They would just handover the money to you and will say that why were you in such a hurry that you forgot your remaining amount.

The amount of time that will take you to realise that you received less money would vary and not everybody can go back and argue with the person at the counter.

So, now the person easily made ₹100 by scamming people. Now, just assume the number of people who board metro and who buy tokens.

In my experience, almost every time i give ₹500 note i receive ₹100 less. Many a times i have fought them as well.

Now, that I have learned what they do i usually wait till they do their trick and then just look dead in their eyes and they will give ₹100.

But, it really makes me angry thinking about the people who couldn't get their money back and were scammed and are still being scammed by these so called DMRC employees.

Image- Taken from Google for reference only.

EDIT :— All of the people who were telling me that I should use UPI or get a metro card, i have a metro card and yes we can pay with UPI now and i do give ₹500 note now but i know the scam so i count it well. But, the problem doesn't end here. I am more concerned about other passengers who don't use UPI and those who don't have metro card. In Delhi, almost on every metro station we can find a long queue on token counter. So, i am more concerned about the people who do not know about this scam.

EDIT 2- I have officially filed a complaint about this and have made the supervisor file a Staff Deficiency Memo about this as this time when it again happened the supervisor was standing right beside him. I wish I had my camera on. I also showed the supervisor this post and also raised concern if other employees are also involved in this including the supervisors.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/de8jwlsapr35x4tk', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.6077, 'ai': 0.3923}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This one SCAM always make my blood boil.

Anonymous,5y,What are common scams in India?,"I am going anonymous as I had not shared this incident with someone and don't want them to know about it.

My personal experience of Urban clap. Booked for a plumbing service. The guy just had to change 3 leaking pipes of the overhead tank.Plumber arrives and inspects. Normally it would take maximum of 1–2 hours. . The guy asks an amount of 3500 for the service and but the amount shown on the app for service was nearly less than 500 or 1000. After a lot of discussion he asked 100 for this service and not actual work. Amount given the plumber walks away. I receive an email from urban clap: “ payment of 100rs received as per your request the service has been cancelled ”. I was literally in shock the plumber just acted over smart.

2nd time: same issue next day.

Booked for plumbing service. Guy arrives, inspects and says the work is a bit more and cannot be done by a single person. Tomorrow I'll apply for a holiday at office and complete your work and bring another person with me. Here amount remaines same 3500. Again I had to pay 100 but this time he said truth and asked the amount. Next day early morning he arrives with his co-worker(his 10 year old son) and starts working. I had bought all the pipes and stuff already. Within 3 hours he completed the work. Amount 3500 paid.

Now comes the real part the guy had not understood the connection properly and gave a cross connection. The tank had water but the taps were dry. I called him and said the issue. He replied it might be due to an airlock and suggested me some tricks to try. Nothing worked a Nd asked him to sort it out . After that he blocked my number.

After that I went to local plumbing stores to ask help of a plumber. Nearly after 4–5 plumbing stores found a plumber. He now checks for nearly 30min and then understands that a cross connection has been given and it is not an airlock. The plumber earlier has messed up all the connections. The whole work had to be done again and I had to spend an amount of 4500 this time.

Total amount I spent to change 3 pipes:100(cancellation) +125+3500+material cost + 4500+ material cost again. .. Nearly 8500.

I complained to urban clap but what action was taken I am unaware but that moment I uninstalled the app and shared the incident with max number of person I could.

I guess I learned the hard way.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lx0dmbpaw3vtsihg', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am going anonymous as I had not shared this incident with someone and don't want them to know about it.\n\nMy personal experience of Urban clap.

Anonymous,5y,What are some common frauds experienced in India?,"Quikr/OLX add Scam,

Reason I am writing it annonymous is many of my friends are on qoura and I don't want to look stupid to them. I lost 5000 today and don't want others to be victim of such fraud. Kindly read this answer carefully and it might help you to save your hard earned money.

I wanted to buy a second hand scooter and searched on Quikr to Check if any available. I came across this add.

I called the person and he introduced himself as a airport security personnel(Army) working at Ahmedabad airport. He asked me to meet at Ahmedabad airport terminal-2 for further check on scooter. I reached at airport morning 11:00am and called him. He recieved my call and asked me to send him my ID proof. When I asked him why he needs my Id he said as he is on duty, if he wants to go out he has to get written permission from office and as a proof that he is meeting me he needs my Id. I didn't thought much and send him my ID on whatsup. In few minutes He called me and asked me that as scooter is parked in airport cargo yard, I need to submit security amount 3020 rupees to get it out. If I don't like the scooter they will return 3000 rupees. When I asked him how can I trust him he send me photo ID proof of army personnel named Sreekant. Also another person called me introducing himself working in airport cargo office. I trusted him and transferred 3020 using Paytm on provided number by him

Immediately he called me to thank and said he is sending office boy along with scooter as written permission is under process and it may take 10–15 minutes. In few minutes I got call from so called office boy and confirmed that he is in cargo parking and coming with scooter. In next 5 minutes I got call from the same person whom I was dealing with and asked me to submit another 2000 rupees. By now I sensed something fishy but he convinced me by stating himself as an army officer and can't make fraud. I transferred another 2000 rupees

Again in 3–4 minutes I got call from the so called office boy asking me to submit remaining amount to scooter price as it's airport cargo policy. Now I realised that I am being hoaxed. I called the first person and he assured me that he is really working in airport and coming with scooter. He didn't came and again I called him about when he is coming. He tried to convince me that as a airport procedure I need to submit full amount of scooter price and he is submitting 15000 on my behalf and I have to submit 10000. By now I was sure about scam and asked him to return my 5000. He tried to convince me to send him 10000 more and said just check the scooter and refuse to buy it so that cargo office will return full amount. When I refused to transfer that amount and asked him detailed questions about his exact location in airport, he became furious and started abusing me and cut the call. Airport police station was there only so I decided to fill a complaint about this fraud. On speaking with police officer I came to know this is common Scam and so many people lost their hard earned money on such scam. Modus operandi of this gang is citing address of airport in the city. They will introduce themselves as a army personnel and speak very professionally. I request all off them whoever is coming across such adds, please don't transfer a single penny. Report immediately if you come across any such adds.

Kuldeep Singh,Updated 1y,What are common scams in India?,"Flipkart - The Biggest Scam!!

I ordered a Flipkart marQ laptop worth 41K Rs in 2020 having 1 year warranty, I started facing issues since day 1.

During order placement product warranty mentioned home resolution for any issues. After few days laptop started showing issues & condition worsened from bad to worse to finally dead state.

I kept on calling customer care & even tried sending emails for home resolution. But forget resolution, they never ever listened to the problem.

Finally after not receiving any support for 1 year I registered the complaint with National Consumer Helpline.

I immediately started receiving callbacks from flipkart team with big sorry for the trouble statements.

I thought finally issue will be resolved, but No!! They started calling after every alternate days but to say the same thing - issue will be resolved shortly. Over the time their tone changed from polite to aggressive and they forced me to close the complain which I refused.

Finally after many long calls and repeated conversations, 1 day I received a call saying please provide your serial no and we will refund you the amount.

I got excited, thanked the guy on call & eagerly waited for Flipkart email. After few minutes I did received the email asking information about laptop. I had the reply ready so I just rechecked the things and clicked send.

Resolved?

No Wait.. mail rejected!!!!!!!!! I tried again.. Failed again :(

Flipkart customer care blocked my email ID :D. I could not reply over that thread any more.

I contacted flipkart again(by raising new issue over customer support), I received a call next day, I was told previous incident has been marked closed since you didn’t replied to the mail on time.

I enquired what is the time, she said 72 hrs, I said its just 24 hrs then, why don’t you capture the information now. But that was not what she was trained for, and the loop began again.

Edit - Thanks guys for the response, haven't expected this much views. Based on suggestions in comments, I have also posted the issue over twitter.

Kuldeep Singh on Twitter

Thanks @vaibhav mathur for suggesting “Flopkart”😀

Thanks again 🙏🙏

Edit2 - Friends, received a call today(31st May) from flipkart social team. I explained the issue again and was hoping for “we will get back to you line”. But instead I have been assured for full refund after product gets picked up(🤓). Feels like deja-vu but not keeping the hopes high this time. Let's see, will keep the thread updated.

Thanks for the support 🙏🙏

Edit3 - (1st June) Flipkart has finally refunded the total amount. 100+ mails, 30+ calls & lot of time was spent to achieve nothing.

Rajendra Mhatre,Updated 6mo,What are common scams in India?,"TATA, we all know, is one of the biggest industrial houses in India, known - not only for its products but also transparency, honesty, attachment towards nation and above all, it's customer-friendly service!

However, I had a bit of different experience with them. We often see in most offices, the bosses are helpful but people down the line are not so! When the boss comes to know about the irregularity on the part of his subordinates, he regularises everything.

The same thing happened to me.

Here the boss was TITAN EYE Plus and the subordinate was one of its franchisee.

It all started in June 2014.

I bought two specs from the famous TITAN EYE Plus franchise in Chembur, Mumbai at an approximate cost of about ₹.15,000.

In fact the number of this new spec and of the one I was already using was same. I had bought this new rimless frame only for restrictive use. So in the beginning, I used it only for office and parties!

Eight and a half months passed.

One night when I came home from the office, while keeping this new frame into the box, one of its arm got detached.

Nothing could be done that day but the next day, I came home early from the office and took the glasses to the nearest spec shop. He said, ""Sir, a single arm can't be replaced. The whole frame has to be replaced.""

""Okay, but still I will visit Titan once.”

He laughed and said, ""Sir, it's been eight months since you got these glasses, the guarantee is over. Now no one will entertain you there.""

Still, I took an auto and reached Titan.

The shopkeeper heard me, looked at the glasses and said, ""Sir, nothing can be done about this. We provide six months' guarantee, nothing more than that. Why not get a new frame, this one will cost you ₹.1,650, and the one here is only for ₹.1,900….”

Reached home and searched for the TITAN EYE website. Somehow, I couldn't find one but found a Titan's page on Facebook. I reported the matter to them. However, I ended my content with this..

IF ONE SPENDS ALMOST RS.10000/=(BILL NO.000000 DT.20.06.14) FOR A BRANDED PRODUCT (IN FACT THAT DAY I BOUGHT TWO PAIRS COSTING AROUND RS.15000/=), CAN'T HE RELY ON THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT?
IF THIS IS THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE, HOW CAN I VISIT TITAN EYE+ SHOWROOM AGAIN?

This was on March 3, 2015.

Next morning, I received a reply from Titan.

‘You have lodged a complaint on the wrong page. But don't worry, we have forwarded it to the right place. You will soon hear from them.’

(March 4, 2015)

The company's mail arrived before noon.

‘Your complaint has been received. Please send a photo of the bill and spectacles for verification.’

(March 4, 2015)

I immediately forwarded both.

Within half an hour or so, there was a feedback.

'We have sent a photo of your spectacles to our laboratory in Ranchi. It will take at least eight days for the report to arrive. Until then, please cooperate with us.’

(March 4, 2015)

Next mail was in another eight days ..

'With reference to the below complaint, please be informed that the replacement of frame is possible for free of cost. Request you to visit the store….’

(March 12, 2015)

In the afternoon, received a phonecall from the showroom,

‘Sir, you will get replacement of the frame from the company at 80 percent discount. Do come in the evening. '

Not agreeing with the requirement to pay, I once again wrote to Titan about the phonecall.

The reply was instantaneous :

‘You don't have to pay anything, please visit the showroom.'

(March 12, 2015)

Visited the showroom in the evening. As soon as I introduced myself, the owner stood up and politely started showing the frames.

There was a big surprise for me.

The company had offered to change not only the frame but also the glasses!

And, finally, on March 28, 2015, I got my new glasses.

While I was looking at the glasses, the owner said,

“Sir, the price of this frame has gone up by ₹.110 since you bought it. ""

""What?""

I asked without looking up.

""No no, no problem Sir, we will adjust. Thanks Sir!""

I saw the bill, it was ₹.9,481/-, but I didn't have to pay anything!

On the way home, mailed Titan Eye Plus once again and thanked the company and its employees.

Some notable things emerge out of this story.

Reputed companies like Titan value its customers and it's image more than money! They make no compromises for that. I have deliberately given dates in the reply just to know how fast the action was taken!

On the other side are the shopkeepers (they were Titan's franchisees), who give damn to ordinary customers (there could be respectable exceptions to this!).Their only purpose is to sell goods.

And finally, there are customers like you and me, who do not stand for their right, sometimes out of boredom and often out of ignorance!

Had I not followed up with the Titan, even I would have ended in paying ₹.9,481/=, like a fool!

For one thing, they don't know the power of consumer power!

Thanks

We often see in most offices, the bosses are helpful but people down the line are not so! When the boss comes to know about the irregularity on the part of his subordinates, he regularises everything.\n\nThe same thing happened to me.\n\nHere the boss was TITAN EYE Plus and the subordinate was one of its franchisee.\n\nIt all started in June 2014.\n\nI bought two specs from the famous TITAN EYE Plus franchise in Chembur, Mumbai at an approximate cost of about ₹.15,000.\n\nIn fact the number of this new spec and of the one I was already using was same.

We provide six months\' guarantee, nothing more than that. Why not get a new frame, this one will cost you ₹.1,650, and the one here is only for ₹.1,900….”\n\nReached home and searched for the TITAN EYE website. Somehow, I couldn\'t find one but found a Titan\'s page on Facebook. I reported the matter to them. However, I ended my content with this..\n\nIF ONE SPENDS ALMOST RS.10000/=(BILL NO.000000 DT.20.06.14) FOR A BRANDED PRODUCT (IN FACT THAT DAY I BOUGHT TWO PAIRS COSTING AROUND RS.15000/=), CAN\'T HE RELY ON THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT?\nIF THIS IS THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE, HOW CAN I VISIT TITAN EYE+ SHOWROOM AGAIN?\n\nThis was on March 3, 2015.\n\nNext morning, I received a reply from Titan.\n\n‘You have lodged a complaint on the wrong page.

Please send a photo of the bill and spectacles for verification.’\n\n(March 4, 2015)\n\nI immediately forwarded both.\n\nWithin half an hour or so, there was a feedback.\n\n\'We have sent a photo of your spectacles to our laboratory in Ranchi.

Vignesh Mallya,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Movie Theatre scam

I had gone to watch IT movie with my friends in PVR Cinemas. I had checked on BookMyShow application that the movie tickets were priced at Rs. 90 and seats were available so I decided to buy the tickets directly in the theater instead of spending extra money for online booking.

When I reached PVR Cinemas, the tickets seller told me that the cheapest tickets were priced at Rs. 190 . I told her that I had checked the price on BookMyShow which was for Rs. 90 . She didn't listen to me. Moreover I couldn't book from BookMyShow as the window closes 1 hr before movie starts.

I had to give a treat to my friends so I was forced to buy 3 tickets for twice the original price. Then she gave me 3 coupons of Rs. 100 each for popcorn and Pepsi. I realized that she had tricked me and all the other customers to buy the combo offer tickets though we did not want it.

I tried complaining about her to the officials around but they wouldn't listen to me.

Arvind Singh,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Recently I was travelling from Ahmedabad to Jaipur via bus. So the bus Stopped at around 11 PM somewhere 100 km after Ahmedabad at the hotel/dhaba for dinner.

On the right you can see a general store, so I decided to buy some chips and Chocolate for the journey.

I asked for the 2- 5star(10 Rs) chocolate and a lays chips(20 Rs) packet, So total =40.

He asked for 55 Rs from me. I was like, when did the rate increased. I checked the packet it was 10 and 20 ₹ respectively.

I showed it to the shopkeeper and he strated arguing. He just said, if you want to buy it pay 55₹ or else leave. As a passenger we are pretty much bound to such dhaba and shops when bus stops at such places in night. Finally I took it for 55₹ and started to observe the shopkeeper standing there. I found out that the shopkeeper was charging 5₹ extra to every product on the MRP.

Rough calculation.

Let say on an average 20 buses stops in a day at that particular shop. From which 10 passenger from each bus buys a single product.

Total product=> 20*10= 200

Total benefit=> 200*5= 1000 + margin on every product depending upon its MRP.

This is just an average figure.

Anonymous,4y,What are common scams in India?,"US consulate Chennai, India

Yes, you heard it right. The scam is happening in the US consulate too.

Recently, I went for my H1B stamping in Chennai, previously I have been to consulate stamping for almost 4 times. So I consider myself that I knew process and procedure for US visa stamping.

Usually, on the first day, there will biometric, where they will take your photo and fingerprints, and on a second-day visa interview, both are in different locations. Similarly, my biometric was done and while I was about to leave, the lady in counter who took my photo and fingerprint told me.

lady: Sir, please take two copies of your photo for the US visa interview tomorrow.

me: What!! I have been to consulate 4 times before, and I have never taken any photo, why is this time?

lady: (looked scared) Sir, the system has some problem and we are not able to take photos properly.

me: then what did you do just now, you took my photo and fingerprint.

lady: (Really scared) Sir, I don’t know all that, you have to take a photo. Photoshop is in downstairs.

me: ok, thank you.

I left consulate office, while coming down I saw a long queue for US visa photos downstairs, and thought of taking the photo there (as I am not aware of Chennai much).

They charged Rs.250 for 2 photos. I was like, okay that fine, waited for almost an hour to get my photo there and left.

The next day morning I had my interview in a different location and I took all my documents and photos too. To my surprise, they never asked for any photos for anyone. Once I came back to my hotel room. It flashed to my brain, that I never gave photos, later when I recapped all incidents of the lady in counter getting scared, I concluded this is a scam happening in the US consulate.

Every day in the Chennai consulate around 1000 people come for stamping, everyone takes photos there, and people don’t mind paying Rs.250 as it is a small amount. But this is free money for them, they make almost Rs.2,50,000 in the day.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/k9n6p1yxh5e48lvc', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'US consulate Chennai, India\n\nYes, you heard it right.

Naveen KR,Updated 1y,What are common scams in India?,"This is a very common scam that I've seen many big brands use to sell their products…

Same brand, same flavor.. . Correct?

Same manufacturing month/year - 04/22.. correct?

Now check the price & quantity.. Buy 1 get 1 (free) is ₹190/- for 700ml so you'll get one extra, that is 700ml + 700ml = 1400ml. Now the other (regular pack with no offer) is priced at ₹110/- for 900ml. Let's do the math ; ₹190/- divided by 14 (1400ml) = ₹13.57 for 100ml and ₹110/- divided by 9 (900ml) = ₹12.22 for 100ml!! So basically you are paying more for buying a product with discount offer!!!

I've seen the same scam with other brands & products, like biscuits, dosa batter, yogurt, chips & other snacks.

* EDIT *

Thank you all for your upvotes & thanks 🙏

I did not expect so many views & responses 😃

There are many people commenting that this is not a scam but a marketing technique,... I agree that this is not a direct scam but an unethical marketing strategy not less to a scam.

I also agree that nobody is being forced to buy it, but let me tell you... Generally both packs, with offer pack & without offer pack are not made available in the same store at the same time for the reason that if a customer by chance notices both packs & does a comparison (like I did) they will realise that they are being hoodwinked.

Ishtiaq,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Ola cab drivers cancelling the ride after passenger boards the cab, after confirming that he will be paid by cash for the ride.

This happened yesterday as I booked a cab for myself and a colleague to chennai domestic airport. Firstly the cab didn't arrive at my pickup place, but the ola app showed that cab has arrived.

Screenshot of the same:

Then I recieved a call from cab driver asking for payment mode I chose while booking. As it was not cash, he said to cancel the ride for which I will have to bear cancelling charges. I asked him to cancel as he denied the ride, he disconnected the call and didn't answer my call when I tried calling him back. I didn't have any other options apart form cancelling it.

After that I booked another OLA cab with payment mode as cash, as we didn't want to arrive late, to the airport. The cab arrived and we got in. I told the OTP and kept my phone in the bag. I started discussing office related work with my colleague. Meanwhile the cab driver noticed that both of us are in some discussion, he asked what was the amount showed for the ride when I booked. I thought he was asking casually and told the amount. He took advantage of our discussion and cancelled the ride. I couldn't notice as he kept his phone in hand and typing as he didn't have mobile holder with him.

He started google maps and drove to airport. When we reached he acted weird and asked for the money and I gave him as I knew the amount, he was hiding his phone and came out from the cab to take out luggage. When I checked the OLA app to give rating, I saw that he has cancelled the ride.

Literally he is cheating the OLA and the customers.

Sunny Kumar,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Few months back I got a surprising call from a girl. After talking to her for 2 mins I came to know that she was my college senior. Though I have talked to her in the past, once or twice but nothing major.

So, a random call from her did surprise me. Here's how the conversation went.

She - Hey how are you, you have forgotten me completely, you don't call ?

Me -( I'm just an average looking guy, and I know it's impossible that out of nowhere a girl will call me and without any motive would talk to me.)

Nothing like that ….I was .. little busy.

So this conversation went on for half an hour, And to be honest I was also enjoying this little chit chat. Who won't, these calls and messages became daily routine for me.

Every now and then she would call and ask me if I like my job , if I'm content , whether I have some ambitions or not.

Though this things did sound a little strange at first, but then who wouldn't like a little chit chat with a beautiful girl after a hectic day in office.

Slowly she started discussing her future plans with me. How desperate she is to buy Audi, new home, want to retire before 40 and stuff like this.

All this sounded little fishy, but I played along. I wanted to know where this thing is going to lead me.

So, this fling continued for a month and suddenly she said to me that a position has just popped up in her organization and she wants to hire a dedicated, workaholic, creative person. Till now I was listening to her patiently, but then she crossed all the limits when she said I possess all the qualities which she mentioned above!

Now here is the thing, the way she was sounding, it was too good to be true. Man, this much my mom doesn't praise me in front of my neighbors . Now I was certain that definitely there is something wrong with this girl.

So finally on the D-day she revealed the big secret, that I will have to Invest 2.5 lac in her business, so that I can buy Audi for my parents.

For next few days I just kept telling her I would think about it, I would invest in little while. I didn't want to tell her straight that I know what kind of bullshit she is trying to sell me but I ain't stupid enough to buy it.

Finally she got frustrated and asked me whether I would invest or not ?

I told her to focus on her job and… Hello...? Hello…?

Well I couldn't complete and she blocked me from everywhere.

P.S- I wrote this answer to spread some awareness among my peers. Please don't get fooled by these kind of thugs. There is no shortcut to success. I have seen people around me getting decieved and wasting their hard earned money and regretting later. You can't buy Audi by investing 2.5 lacs on some random idiotic dumb scheme.

This business could be anything Q-net,E-biz, Amway they come in different masks but their only agenda is to fool you by selling you dreams. Be smart and know the difference between investment and Ponzi schemes.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ecxo72z0hm56r1k9', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.65115, 'ai': 0.34885}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Few months back I got a surprising call from a girl.

Sawan Tank,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"This time it's Paytm.

Let me introduce the issue.

I have ordered AnyCast WiFi HDMI dongle from Paytm which clearly mentioned it is AnyCast M2 Miracast device.

Upon receiving the item, I came to know the product was of different brand and it seemed used. The shipping box also had invoices of previous order of this same product and it may have returned before.

I wanted to be replaced with original for which I have paid. So, I raised a query regarding it.

The response I got from Paytm representative was completely unimaginable.

I was surprised when he told product can be of any brand as it was imported.

What a clueless answer by Paytm.

I asked for his name for giving such a worst reply, so that I could post it social media for endorsing fake products from other brand.

Now, I found something unusual, instead of giving his name, the representative wanted to end this query by applying a strategy. He told me there is duplicate query running on their system for this order.

Who the hell created this another query. I couldn’t find any query ending with 6339 in my Paytm ticket history. This was a plan to quit me from responding.

I replied back them that I don’t have any such duplicate ticket in my history. Please stick to this query only, but again I got the same reply in response with ‘TICKET CLOSED’ and Return Rejected.

Now I couldn’t track that ticket 46556339 even by tweeting to Paytm nor do they reply to above query even after 20 days.

I know the issue of sending duplicate item was from seller but I am quite unsatisfied with the resolution given to me by Paytm and they are endorsing to sell duplicate items by this way. They should have taken action against seller.

Note : It may be pretty uncommon right now but going to be common scam ahead.

Update: Finally Paytm has approved return and refunded after a month.

Anindita Bhatta,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY

I noticed that I’ve become a regular customer of online food delivery companies ,be it Zomato or Swiggy lately and I believe there would be so many people like me who feel the ease of getting readymade foods delivered home. For a person who works and cooks , its a boon sometimes.But what we need to understand carefully is that these companies are making fools out of people’s need. I normally order food from trusted restaurant specially where I have been to. But what I realised that there’s a huge difference in taste and quality between dining in the restaurant and getting food delivered from the same restaurant. These companies, most of the times come up with attractive offers and deals and in return serves stale food from its partner restaurants. People get trapped with such deals without even realising . Let me share my experience today.

I received fungus(mold) filled gujia from the trusted brand Bikanerwala through Zomato,upon complaining they offered an apology and the refund.just look at the pictures,

I unknowingly consumed one gujia and eventually threw up and had an upset stomach. Is their apology going to assure such things won’t be repeated? And the damages will be fixed? Practically the shop should get sealed for such practices but again this is India and It’s just a small bad experience.

Edit: Those who are sympathisers of delivery companies, I once ordered biryani at 99 for lunch in office, from Bikkgane biryani which serves delicious biryani in noida, from uber eats . I was not satisfied with the taste as I regularly visit them in weekends. Then my friend ordered biryani from Bikkgane which wasn’t having any offer from swiggy. A person with proper sense could identify the quality of taste instantly. Even by looking at both one can tell which one was fresh.Now if anyone has proper explanation to this please shed some light on it.Thank you.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fs7ew3bud8gj521p', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY\n\nI noticed that I’ve become a regular customer of online food delivery companies ,be it Zomato or Swiggy lately and I believe there would be so many people like me who feel the ease of getting readymade foods delivered home.

Ronak Saroha,4y,What is a major scam in India?,"Today Me and my wife went to GIANIS in west delhi.

Today you will notice a different type of fraud which we people generally (who often go for food in restaurants, stores ..) Don’t notice. It is something that we usually ignore and straight away see the prices and then pay the bill. BUT BEFORE YOU DO IT NEXT TIME , HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH ME.

Conversation was like this between me, my wife and Gianis counter boy -

Me - what is the price for Belgian chocolate ice cream?

Counter Boy- Sir, ₹80 per scoop

Me - Give me 2 scoops in Cone.

My wife- I want one scoop of punjabi delight in cone.

Me - How much to pay?

Counter boy-₹310

Me - Bit confused ( I know Gianis ice cream are costly)but then I paid ₹310.

We were enjoying our ice cream, our house is on 10min walking distance from Gianis, so, I asked her to let’s eat while walking, she declined and said it’s too hot outside so let’s finish it here. I said .. ok and after 5min she asked me how much did your ice cream cost? I said ₹160.

She was like how come the bill be of ₹310 then. (Her scoop was ₹70–75) .Then she saw the bill (understood that they cheated us) and asked counter boy, conversations were like-

My wife- How did it cost ₹310?

Counter boy- mam, ₹160 double scoop and ₹75 your single scoop and ₹10 per cone.

My wife- Total is still ₹255. How did you charge ₹310?

Counter boy- (scared, thinking what to say) .. Mam there is some confusion . Sorry mam. It happened by mistake.

It all happened when there was no other customer in the store. He knowingly added a higher price item to increase the bill.Otherwise how could he add banana shake when we both were just standing next to him having icecream . + he asked his staff about our food items in front of us and they simply told him. Still he added something else that costed us somewhat double. However, he gave me back ₹55 after this
.
.

So , like a aware person check not only the price but the Food Item that they added in your bill.

Agni Kumar Shukla,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Hospital scams

My brother was admitted in Sunrise hospital Rohini Delhi. He was suffering from dengue and then weakness.

Here doctors priscribe unnecessary tests .. costly medicines.

Example they give curezone injection which cost whooping Rs 535.00.

Same salt composition in renowed pharma company is available at Rs 60.

They write locally rebranded medicines like Rabzen , cunext 100.

They were giving almost same medicines to all patients.

These medicines are available only at hospital chemist shop. You cant find them at any good chemist shop.

Every day i was forced to buy medicines of Rs 3000 .The hospital chemist never gave discount of single Rs.

A normal USG of KUB cost Rs 800-1000 in market. But they force us to get it done at Nasa rohini which charges Rs1800 for same.

I spent 21000 only on medicines. And 15600 as bed fee. 3600 for USG ( they told us to do it twice ) 5700 for differnt tests . For 6 days

The doctors ( espcially senior MD) never even touch the patients.

The day before discharge i asked the doctor about progress of my brother. As medicines were not working. He was still suffering from high fever. The senior doctor told me “ bahut internal problems h. Fir se KUB USG krao” . He wrote same medicines again.

He just see the reports and suggests new test.

When i consulted with our Army doctor ( my dad is in Indian army ) . He told us that there is nothing serious. No more test is required . Take the discharge.

Why some doctors play with patient's health. This is very common scam atleast in Delhi.

Edit : Thank you for your support . I really appreciate your comments , ...

Anurag Sharma,6y,What are common scams in India?,"Neeta Travel Hinjewadi Pune.

I am not sure if every Neeta travels does the same or not, but this one branch sure scam people. Please do not book ticket from Neeta travels hinjewadi Pune.

Let me tell you the scam part :

As I had to catch a flight from Mumbai at 1 p.m, I booked a ticket from Pune to Mumbai at 7 a.m same day. One night before my journey date, I received a call from Neeta Travels that my bus has been cancelled and they want me to shift in another bus at a later time. I asked them to cancel my ticket instead and refund me. The guy agreed and cut the phone.

Later on I booked ticket from another travels and went to Mumbai. A few days after that when I checked for my refund, I was shocked to see that bus was not cancelled and rebus was showing my journey as completed. When I called them and asked about this they said they don’t have any information about bus cancellation and as per Neeta travels, I boarded the bus and traveled to Mumbai so there was no question of refunding my money.

Luckily I had ticket from other travels too, so I showed them both the tickets and asked how is it possible for me to travel in two different buses on same day at almost same time. They checked and accepted their mistake and returned my money.

Today same thing happened with my friend too and I couldn't stop myself from writing about it this time.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b4emltuo1cd8kjgx', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9984, 'ai': 0.0016}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Neeta Travel Hinjewadi Pune.\n\nI am not sure if every Neeta travels does the same or not, but this one branch sure scam people.

Dev Chouhan,5y,What are common scams in India?,"I recently quit my job because I did not like what I was doing and wanted a change of profession . I registered myself on Shine(A place where you can view and apply jobs ,very similar to Indeed and Naukri) .

The very next day I get a mail from TATA Group of Companies with an interview call letter . I was surprised as I hadn't applied for any jobs and had just created an account . I opened the E Mail and was in for a few surprises ,

1st Red Flag :: Download link seemed suspicious ,looked more of a file sharing website.

Now going to the contents of the letter

No mention of the position I had been selected for screening , just a generic link to careers of the website .
“ As per your Designation, your starting salary will be (Rs. 59, 689, -To Rs. 7,45,689) per month in hand. “ - Well I hadn't discussed anything .
“ Normal working hours are 09:00AM to 5PM Monday to Friday. Saturday and Sunday are holidays. “ - I laughed at this .
“ If you want to go London so for the further details you just contact to Human Resources Manager “ - Fake promise to take you to London
“ Your Interview Process will be held at Company Office. Venue: Sector 13-M Block A-263, Selaqui Industrial Area, Selakui, Dehradun Uttarakhand 248011 India. Date:- 24th of September 2018. Time:-11:30 AM To 04:30 PM. “ - The address is hoax .
The Main Part - “

(So follow these company Rules and Regulations) (Mandatory): - The Candidate have to Deposit a Refundable Interview Processing & Maintenance & Courier & Accommodation & Assurance charges Rs. Eight Thousand Two Hundred Ninety Nine Rupees (8,299, -with GST) by down payment only on 10-09-2018 before 04:00 Pm in Favor of Tata Group Of Companies Ltd . by

Paytm Wallet (5% Cashback on Paytm Wallet) - LOL ( Cashback ) “ If you want to pay the amount by the Paytm Wallet so just Add the Sufficient amount in your Paytm Wallet, and just contact to your Human Resource Manager – Dr. Ashutosh Anand. for the Paytm Number or QR Code / Bank Account Number. “
By Debit Card
TEZ and other UPI

I feel for all those unemployed people who are desperate and fall for these .

Edit - I thought it would help some people if awareness is spread. Keep in mind a few things I have listed below , some are from my own experience and few I have picked online .

1.Never pay money upfront - employers and agencies should pay you, not the other way round.

2.Always do your Homework - Be very wary if you are offered a job you did not apply for out of the blue from a person you do not know, and without any interview or meeting. If in any doubt, always check out the company supposedly advertising the job, verify the phone number on the company website and call the employer to check the job exists. Other tell-tale signs of fraud could be poorly written job adverts, and generic email addresses (such as Hotmail or Gmail) that can’t be traced to a business.

3.Never agree to phone a would-be employer for an interview - If an employer wants you to work for them, they will call you.

4.Never provide private details up front – any requests for personal data ahead of an interview or registration meeting (if an agency) should be treated with suspicion. Until you have the job, keep your bank details safe and only provide identity details once you have met face to face.

5. Make sure there is a Job Description - Legit call letters will have Job Description and will not be generic .

6. Be cautious of emails with grammatical and spelling mistakes - Legit Call letters are written by professionals . Does the language used in the posting sound odd or strangely written, if yes its red flags .

7. Jobs through Social Media - Never trust any job offers received through Facebook , Insta .

8.Never pay to access a hidden job market- Avoid making payments for getting a premium account at any job portal .

9. Check for complaints - When suspicious search online , there will be other people who would have posted about the same .

Ketan Ramteke,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Electronics Repair Shops.

Most of them are total scammers and take advantage of people’s ignorance and charge exponential amount for even a small repair work by making up stories.

First Incident :

One day our TV stopped working. I went to local repair shop and asked how much will it cost to repair TV and he(technician) with smile on his face replied, “Sir ji sirf Rs.4000 kyunki tv ka motherboard aur power supply board kharab ho gaya”(“Only Rs. 4000 as motherboard and power supply board are completely damaged.”). Checked some electronics repair forums and a couple of YouTube videos later I got to know that it was a very common problem with LCD TVs and the main culprit for TV problem was not damaged motherboard or power supply but leaked Capacitors. Went to an electronics shop and bought two capacitors which cost only Rs.5 each. TV started working fine after replacing damaged capacitors.

That TV repair guy was charging Rs. 4000 for something which could have been repaired for just Rs. 10!

Note: You can easily spot damaged capacitors, they look bloated and in some cases they also leak.(In below pic one cannot see the bloated top as I pressed it just to see if it worked, it did not :P)

Second Incident :

My Laptop was overheating and because of that it was constantly switching off by itself. went to computer repair shop and guy there started telling me that there is a problem with temperature sensor + cooling fan and replacing it will set me back cool Rs. 2500/-. Went home and grabbed Phillips screwdriver, opened a laptop and found a chunk of dust in cooling fan which was blocking the airflow near heat sink. Cleaned it and problem was Solved. Cost = Zero.

So friends, whenever you face some problem with your electronics gadgets then do try to find out what may be the cause of a problem and do not trust technicians blindly. They will overcharge from you for sure.

Edit: Read more such incidents in comment section below.

All technicians are not scammers but most of them are.

Caution:

Repairing electronics is dangerous.

If you don’t know how to solder/de-solder, check polarity, use multi-meter and general stuff of that sort then refrain yourself from tinkering with them cause you might end up further damaging the device or might as well get yourself injured.

Kamal Kishore,Updated 3y,What are common scams in India?,"Instagram scam.

You might have heard many types of scams but have you ever listened to Instagram scam? That is based purely on Instagram.

Let me explain you a incident that happened to my own brother.

My brother while scrolling his Insta feed, he came across a page that was selling mobiles for cheap rates.

I will share some screenshots that I took in my mobile

My brother got excited because he always wanted to buy iPhone Xs.

After seeing this one, he texted them and asked for the details.

At first they told him that there is no COD available, and should pay all the money in advance.

But my brother bargained with them... so They told my brother that, my brother should pay 500 rupees as advance then the rest of the amount can be paid after the delivery(my brother thought the seller must be very kind).

He even told that the delivery will be placed through amazon and will be getting regular updates in Amazon account.

My brother felt happy, even though I told him that it's all scam, he went on.

In my brother's voice…. he told me that 500 is not a big deal and wanted to try his luck.

My brother sent him money through online payment, and waited for the delivery date.

But all he got was nothing… after a day he was blocked from Instagram. My brother thought something was wrong so I checked in my account and it was opening fine. That's when I understood my brother was cheated.

I sent him request and sent him message too but I was also blocked by them. (Must be seen that my brother and me are having mutual friendlist)

So, what's the common scam?

Fooling people with the Instagram.

There were many people who were cheated like this, and still people are believing in them.

I don't understand how can someone sell a phone for 1500 which will be about 75k?

They are good at manipulating.

They say that only few pieces are available and we should hurry up.
We should pay some money to book the product or else it will be taken by someone else
They will deliver through amazon or flipkart that way citing they are genuine.
They will show some fake delivery status, and post it online.
Their own men does comment on their posts, saying they got the product and it's the best website ever. But trust me it's not.
Once you pay him, they will block you.
Even if they tell that COD is available, don't trust them because they will send some soapbox Instead of mobile phones.
In no way you can trace them nor you can find them, all your hard earned money will be lost.

If you were thinking there were only one or two such pages, you are mistaken. There were many such pages.

There were many other things which they pretend to sell, that includes… power bank, backpacks, pouches, shoes, chappals, earphones, headphones. What not everything.

Next time if you ever come across such pages, don't give it a try.

Thank you for reading. Have a nice day.

Edit:

Wow I never realised the power of Quora, I thought only to bring awareness but I didn't expect anything in return.

But guess what? The one who cheated have texted my brother, requesting him to delete the answer.

This time he renamed his display name as @hana_kuma21.

(Deleted all the posts, and even removed the display pic. So that no one can find him)

At first he told that he will return the money, then he told that he will give the actual iPhone mobile and Apple watch.

This time I told my brother not to trust him, but he requested and even told us that he will send the money to our address.

We wanted to see what he gonna do, so intentionally we gave him wrong address.

And very little did I known that these scammers are more intelligent and manipulative than us…

He has told that he created a email id and created a account in Amazon.

(Now here is the point, we may think it as true… but the thing is… the email-id is invalid.

There is a website which can create 10 minute mail. after 10 minutes, it gets deleted on its own.

So he created such mail and he used it as Amazon account… you can see 0hcow.com
 which is neither a e.mail one or any website.

And look at the password… for any password there has to be atleast 8 words… but he only sent 6(you123). Thinking that we can't Identify all of it)

Still we acted as if we trust him, he also told that he gave the order of iPhone and watch on Amazon.

He even sent us his credit card.

When we asked for screenshot, he sent us this….

It was indeed ordered, so I thought how it's possible or is he serious about it?

We are thinking what he gonna scam us now, still we had no idea.

Till then he requested us every other day to delete the Quora post. (I never knew a single post can scare a person to such extent)

I declined him, and I said I will do only if I got the mobile (actually I won't delete this post, even if I got the mobile)

He even sent the tracking, saying that he is indeed genuine.

And then he started blackmailing us that, he will cancel the order unless or untill we delete the post.

Now there is no guarantee that he will deliver the package once if I give up. So stood firm and told him that am not gonna delete the post.

More than anything, I was only determined to bring awareness.

I got an idea and we called Amazon customer care… we have given the track order I'd… and asked him about the status… the person on the other end told me that This order got cancelled on the day 1 itself.

Then everything made sense to me, he indeed ordered, but carefully cancelled so that we shouldn't get fooled.

He thought that we will delete the post, once we see the tracking process.

So, What did I learn today?

Don't believe in those tracking process, they can be taken from past other orders too.
Don't give your original address, you may never know what gonna follow next.
No person will give us 1 lakh mobile for free.
Never pay a single rupee till you see the actual product.

And now we have decided to file a complaint in cybercrime police station. Atleast they will find him and punish him.

Now can anyone please tell me, why is he so scared of this Quora post?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kf4tsjdmlcu91op6', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.65856666666667, 'ai': 0.34143333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Instagram scam.\n\nYou might have heard many types of scams but have you ever listened to Instagram scam?

Govinda Agrawal,Updated 3y,What are common scams in India?,"Last year I was traveling in Shatabdi express for the first time from Puri to Kolkata.

(pic credit:Google)

I was little bit excited too, as I don't travel by train much.

We were served with breakfast as it was included in the ticket cost. Then at the time of lunch, the same was served. While the quality of the food was far below the average, the scam wasn't this.

Now after we finished the lunch, one of the Pantry guy came with a tray in which he had a box with saunf (fennel seeds) which we Indians generally consume after lunch / dinner.

And apart from the saunf part, the tray had few Rs. 2000/- and many Rs. 500/- Rs. And very few Rs. 200/- notes.

I was observing that, pantry guy was going each and every seat to offer saunf, but seeing money in the tray, all the passengers also started to put money in the tray as a tip.

Now since the tray only had high denomination notes and normally a person traveling In Shatabdi is well to do, mostly everyone was putting at least Rs. 500/- and a few people put Rs. 200/- notes.

These pantry guys themselves put these high denomination notes so that other passengers would think that it's a tip that everybody is giving.

Just imagine the amount they are making inadvertently everyday.

Akash Kumar,4y,What are common scams in India?,"This happened around a year ago when I tried to change my broadband to Hathway. I filled the form on their website and the very next day got a call from their service team that it is not feasible in my locality.

But after 2–3 hrs I got another call that the visit is scheduled at my location when I informed about non-feasibility in my locality he convinced me that it is feasible and called few names in my area to which he recently provided connection. So, I asked him to visit on the weekend for my availability.

On Saturday, 2 Hathway professionally dressed guys visited my home and informed me of the plan and convinced me for a 3-month advance payment plan of 2400 with an additional month discount and free router.

Me: Do you have any pamphlet or any brochure?

Him: No, you can verify the plan online we do not have paper works.

Me: (With a bit doubt)Okay, How Can I make the payment?

Him: Cash will be faster i.e. by today we’ll be able to process router request and other things. If by cheque it may take 4–5 working days.

Me: Okay there is no hurry, I’ll go with the cheque.

Him: Sir why going the old way, in case if clearance delays offer may get expired I always prefer cash and quick work.

Me: But giving cash in advance without any proof doesn't make me confident.

Him: Sir its a company work, you’ll get the receipt and by evening we’ll get router connected.

Me: I agree. Paid cash and got the receipt.

Him: Sir do you have any other reference in the nearby area so that we can make some extra and you’ll get a month rewarded.

Me: Yes have two friends looking to change broadband and given the contact info to them.

and they left…

I confirmed my friends but they didn't got call. I tried calling them in the evening but it was switched off. Tried calling on Monday, Tuesday for few continuous day but I finally got to know that I was being cheated.

After a month and after thinking I thought to repeat the process, again filled the Hathway form with a different name, mobile, address in the locality. after a few hours got the call that not feasible in my area.

But Interestingly to my surprise I again got call visit to be scheduled as its feasible in my area. Now here I was one step forward than the cheaters :)

After the same scheme info and everything, I asked them to come near a shop and got 4–5 my friends ready to raid them. And finally, it happened they cam we raided, beaten when they tried to dominate, took their mobile phones and after they understood no way out they accepted.

Now the real game begins, We called the police and for calling 20+ time the Delhi police didn’t come even after waiting 3 hours and calling again and again.

We loosen the cheater to check what they do and they ran, we let them run. Never get call from police and cheaters left their mobile with us. We went to police station to file a complaint to which police guy was very happy to see 2 mobiles coming in his pocket. He asked us to write on piece of paper the incident and submit the phones. We did and even after asking for acknowledgment he didn’t gave and started threatening us for looting phone seriously.

Divya Sharma,3y,What are the scams happening in India now?,"I saw this ad on Instagram. They were selling this suit:

Being a fan of this colour, I decided to order it.

The price was unbelievable. ₹699. I thought even if the quality doesn’t turn out to be not that great, I can use it for daily wear if not for parties. I kept my order as COD to be sure.

I would also like to mention here that I had purchased a lehenga from an Instagram store back in 2017 and it turned it to be amazing. That was also just for ₹2000. It is good for a fully stitched piece in tafetta silk.

I was very satisfied with that purchase and hence decided to go forward with this one too.

I received a mail of order confirmation. No communication thereafter. We generally get a lot of mails while buying things online. This made me feel a little suspicious.

I let it be thinking they are a new homegrown brand and they won’t be having systems like that of amazon and Myntra in place.

The product I received was this:

This is such a poor quality fabric. I won’t buy it for a ₹100 and I ended up paying ₹699 for this.

I mailed them. No response.

I have talked to the consumer redressal forum. I won’t let them get away with this.

I feel hurt at such practices.

There’s so much more to this.

A brand created trust. Another one broke it.

Satyajeet Kadam,6y,What are common scams in India?,"*'NEW HOTEL SCAM!!*

This is one of the smartest scams I have heard about.

You arrive at your hotel and check in at the front desk. Typically when checking in, you give the front desk your credit card (for any charges to your room) and they don't retain the card.

You go to your room and settle in. All is good.

The hotel receives a call and the caller asks for (as an example) *room 620* - which happens to be your room.

The phone rings in your room. You answer and the person on the other end says the following:

*'This is the front desk. When checking in, we came across a problem with your charge card information.*

*Please re-read me your credit card numbers and verify the last 3 digits numbers at the reverse side of your charge card.'*

Not thinking anything wrong, since the call seems to come from the front desk you oblige. But actually, *it is a scam by someone calling from outside the hotel*. They have asked for a *random room number*, then *ask you for your credit card and address information.*

*They sound so professional, that you think you are talking to the front desk.*

If you ever encounter this scenario on your travels, *tell the caller that you will be down to the front desk to clear up any problems.*

Then, *go to the front desk or call directly and ask if there was a problem.*

If there was none, *inform the manager of the hotel that someone tried to scam you of your credit card information, acting like a front desk employee.*

This was sent by someone who has been duped........

and is still cleaning up the mess.

*P.S.*

Please, consider spreading the word by forwarding this msg.

Who knows, you might just help someone avoid a nasty experience.

Harshit mantri,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"This!

The Scams by Hotels in India (The image is of actual hotel)!

This happened with me during my recent visit to kanpur for some office work. It's a well known semi luxury hotel situated in city. Now the scam part:

Incident goes like this, During check in, one of the guys at counter informed me about an additional charges which I have to paid for, considering this booking was done by my company & whole amount was already paid (like in general for any stay), I had a little doubt over these additional unpaid charges. At that day as I was in a hurry due to the work, I left this to resolve during my check out. Here is my stay receipt:

Now here comes my communication with one of their staff at reception during checkout:

Staff: Started with the cliche hospitality gestures & asked to rate on OYO.

Me: Thank you, will do. Any amount due here to pay (I know I have not ordered anything in hotel, still asked just for clarification)

Staff: Sir, wait for the bill. Now here comes the bill which mention Rs 168 as unpaid for the stay!

I had tried to convince him that the whole amount of stay which was mentioned in OYO was paid already & have re confirmed with my office for the same. Now here comes the trick part:

Staff: Sir, actually the booking amount mentioned in oyo was 13×× while our minimum booking starts at 14××. This is why as we have tried to generate the bill, it is taking the minimum booking amount & due to this you have to pay the extra amount.

Me: Surprised! I know that they have just consumed my 10-15 minutes as I know how to resolve this, thanks to my frequent travellings. I first just try to put him down logically.

Me: See, it doesn't matter to me whatever your minimum booking amount is as I had booked it through oyo & have already paid what they have asked. I will not pay this amount in any case. I have asked him to re check.

Staff: Sir but this is the unpaid amount to be cleared before check out.

Me: See you can change your minimum booking amount to a hundred thousand rupees, but I will only pay for what I have booked for (with a little anger, which I rarely show in my real life).

Staff: Sir, we will provide you a bill copy for the same. And he was with a printed bill!

Me: I will get the bill copy on mail from oyo, this bill is not a necessary (I am sure they have printed the bill by tampering the original bill).

No assistance from staff, still they continously trying to request me to pay. I have told them that if amount was genuine I was ready to pay even 2K, but it was just a fraud amount which they have presented.

Now in the last, I have called to OYO helpline & after confirming my booking ID, the customer care representative requested me to give the line to the reception staff. The moment I told them that this is consumer care of oyo, they have accepted the mistake & requested me to cut the line.

Staff: Now some well suited man (most probably the manager) came there & tell me that it was a printing mistake from one of their staff & upon re checking they have found that no unpaid amount is there to pay!

So what I have learned here is:

They were fraud charging this additional amount which was not in the bill.
As the amount was nominal, even half of the public will pay to avoid any delay (as in case one have to catch bus/train he couldn't resist them due to time constraint & would simply pay)
I am not sure whether this amount is shared by their staff in between, or this is actually a cheap sale trick by the hotel itself.

A big thanks to OYO for their support system, otherwise I was left with only one option to pay.

So, the industry which is called hospitality is showing hospitality in a different manner. Although I had not mentioned the hotel name, the image shown above is of the actual one. Unfortunately was not able to take image of their tampered bill as I have not paid the amount.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xr4w9s10n3qabtp5', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.79875, 'ai': 0.20125}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This!\n\nThe Scams by Hotels in India (The image is of actual hotel)!\n\nThis happened with me during my recent visit to kanpur for some office work.

Now the scam part:\n\nIncident goes like this, During check in, one of the guys at counter informed me about an additional charges which I have to paid for, considering this booking was done by my company & whole amount was already paid (like in general for any stay), I had a little doubt over these additional unpaid charges. At that day as I was in a hurry due to the work, I left this to resolve during my check out. Here is my stay receipt:\n\nNow here comes my communication with one of their staff at reception during checkout:\n\nStaff: Started with the cliche hospitality gestures & asked to rate on OYO.\n\nMe: Thank you, will do. Any amount due here to pay (I know I have not ordered anything in hotel, still asked just for clarification)\n\nStaff: Sir, wait for the bill. Now here comes the bill which mention Rs 168 as unpaid for the stay!\n\nI had tried to convince him that the whole amount of stay which was mentioned in OYO was paid already & have re confirmed with my office for the same. Now here comes the trick part:\n\nStaff: Sir, actually the booking amount mentioned in oyo was 13×× while our minimum booking starts at 14××. This is why as we have tried to generate the bill, it is taking the minimum booking amount & due to this you have to pay the extra amount.\n\nMe: Surprised! I know that they have just consumed my 10-15 minutes as I know how to resolve this, thanks to my frequent travellings. I first just try to put him down logically.\n\nMe: See, it doesn't matter to me whatever your minimum booking amount is as I had booked it through oyo & have already paid what they have asked. I will not pay this amount in any case. I have asked him to re check.\n\nStaff: Sir but this is the unpaid amount to be cleared before check out.\n\nMe: See you can change your minimum booking amount to a hundred thousand rupees, but I will only pay for what I have booked for (with a little anger, which I rarely show in my real life).\n\nStaff: Sir, we will provide you a bill copy for the same. And he was with a printed bill!\n\nMe: I will get the bill copy on mail from oyo, this bill is not a necessary (I am sure they have printed the bill by tampering the original bill).\n\nNo assistance from staff, still they continously trying to request me to pay. I have told them that if amount was genuine I was ready to pay even 2K, but it was just a fraud amount which they have presented.\n\nNow in the last, I have called to OYO helpline & after confirming my booking ID, the customer care representative requested me to give the line to the reception staff. The moment I told them that this is consumer care of oyo, they have accepted the mistake & requested me to cut the line.\n\nStaff: Now some well suited man (most probably the manager) came there & tell me that it was a printing mistake from one of their staff & upon re checking they have found that no unpaid amount is there to pay!\n\nSo what I have learned here is:\n\nThey were fraud charging this additional amount which was not in the bill.\nAs the amount was nominal, even half of the public will pay to avoid any delay (as in case one have to catch bus/train he couldn't resist them due to time constraint & would simply pay)\nI am not sure whether this amount is shared by their staff in between, or this is actually a cheap sale trick by the hotel itself.\n\nA big thanks to OYO for their support system, otherwise I was left with only one option to pay.\n\nSo, the industry which is called hospitality is showing hospitality in a different manner. Although I had not mentioned the hotel name, the image shown above is of the actual one.

Tushar Dwivedi,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Incident 1:
(Story: There’s a case filed against you. Pay up, or go to jail.)

Got this call yesterday, from a lady:

Lady: Tushar Dwivedi speaking?
Me: Yes.

Lady: I am calling from Delhi Consumer court, information department. We have got a case filed against you, in section 420, for money laundering.
Me:(thinking… money laundering case, that too in consumer court, that too under section 420, thought to play along) Okay, who has filed the complain?

Lady: I can’t tell you that. I am giving you party’s number. You can call them, give my reference, and settle the case, if you want.
Me: Anyways, I am already talking to you. Why don’t you simply tell me what is the complain, and who has filed it? Moreover, who are you?

Lady: I am Pooja.
Me: Who Pooja?

Lady: I am lawyer’s assistant.
Me: Which lawyer?

Lady: From Delhi consumer court, information department.
Me: Yes, yes, that’s okay. But there must be some name of the lawyer, right? He must have some name registered in school as child, and also with Bar council.

Lady: Ayeee… Why are you wasting my time? Tell me if you want to do settlement or not? I will send it to legal cell, and you will be arrested in no time. I can get the case settled for nominal fees, later you will have to pay a few lacs. I am sending you a legal notice, nothing can happen after that.

Me: Sure mam, send me a notice. And why only police, send army as well. Neither I own any business, nor any shop. Still consumer forum is giving me so much respect, and filing case under shiny sections of money laundering. Please go ahead, so that my name also comes in news with big people. Or may be, call your friends in Tees Hazari court(another name these scammers use frequently), and get 1–2 cases related to Panama papers as well. That will be more fun. Anyways, I hope you already know that I know who you are.

(Call disconnected)

I called back a few times to tease her, as I was free. But the number was busy. She was working with next victim without wasting a minute.

Checked on true caller:
Name: Delhi Court
255 spam reports

Thought of looking up on google, to understand it in more detail(was already sure, it’s a scam, by now)

Found this:
Citizens get fraud calls related to consumer court cases - Times of India

A scam that is going on for almost 4 years, but somehow I hadn’t heard of it, unlike all the other credit card CVV-OTP, kind of scams. But turns out these people, actually end up asking for big amounts, in the name of escaping legal troubles of a non-existing case.

Posted it on facebook first in Hindi, and today writing a translated version on Quora, for the same.

(I have removed reference to my other answer & my facebook post, as this answer was flagged by Quora moderation, as a SPAM answer. As they don’t tell the reason, it’s all just guess work to decide what exactly they considered as SPAM)

Incident 2:
(Story: Pay our fake telecom bills, or we are filing a 420 case on you. Indian courts are shitty, and whatever proofs you might have, are useless, so we will win, and you got to Jail)

Another thing that worths mentioning here, is that such calls are also done by petty collection agents, imposing as lawyers, which are hired by local telecom companies, etc.

I have once ended up paying 2 months rental for an internet connection, that I had already requested to be cancelled, as I was not much careful back then. But soon realised that it’s a common trend in such companies to make up fake bills, and then while knowing that they can’t really do anything legally, paying money to collection agents to scam people, and threaten them of fake police cases, to get the money. Got a few such calls again, every time I asked any company to close my account. And now I just enjoy pulling their legs, if I have time, and just throwing a few abuses, and disconnecting, if I am busy.

Update: I have written about this incident, in further detail, in below answer.

(I have removed reference to my other answer & my facebook post, as this answer was flagged by Quora moderation, as a SPAM answer. As they don’t tell the reason, it’s all just guess work to decide what exactly they considered as SPAM)

Silly me, if you read this answer, you will realise that the time I wrote that answer, I actually paid them the money, and I even believed that Tikona had actually filed a case against me. I guess, there are few things, you can just learn from experience.

Incident 3:
(Story: Come to the police station, or we will come and arrest you. Ok I am coming, which police station? Didn’t think of the name)

I have even received one call from someone claiming to be calling from police station recently, asking me to reach the nearby police station ASAP, as there’s a complain against me for eve-teasing in market yesterday. Imagine getting such call, while lot of genuine/fake #MeToo stories floating around. :D

Moreover, I was on sick leave for last 4 days. I asked them, which market, and how did they get my number, even if I have done something like this. I also asked to tell them the name of police station, I need to come to.

They didn’t give any answer, and rather started yelling at me that they will send someone to arrest me soon, if I don’t appear.

I again asked, okay tell me the name of the police station, I am coming right now.

To which the guy responded, asking my age. I told them 18 years(actually, it’s 28). He told me that the lady who complained, is standing there itself, and she wants to give me another chance, as I am just a young boy. And told me to settle the matter with her “unofficially”, because (mark his words), I am of his son’s age, and he doesn’t want to see me getting into some trouble. Because if she doesn’t take back the complain, they will have to send a team to arrest me ASAP.

I literally started laughing at this point, and asked them that they are more than welcome to do so, once they manage to find out my address, the same way they have found my number.

Though this time, I felt it’s might be, some friend trying to mess with me. Didn’t get any information from true-caller, suggesting it was a new number.

These cases, I have mentioned above, however, are full fledged scams, and people should really think many times before trusting something “a (wo)man says over a call”.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/io5b6j93dxsqrn40', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.78226666666667, 'ai': 0.21773333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Incident 1:\n(Story: There’s a case filed against you.

Shankey Jain,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Two days ago I was traveling to a town In uttar Pradesh where my maternal uncle resides.

I boarded a govt run bus, from Meerut (a district in uttar Pradesh).

We were 4 people and we were traveling to Sardhana. (A small town). Ticket was of 30 rupees, so I asked the conductor for 4 tickets while I was interrogating about the route and bus stand etc. So conductor realized that they are not frequent commuters.

I gave him 120 rupess and he gave me printed tickets. I kept the tickets in my wallet.

After 4–5 kms in journey, the bus stopped and ticket checkers boarded the bus.

The ticker checker came to me and asked for ticket, I searched for the ticket in my wallet and showed it to him confidently. He said these are only two tickets printed on it, where are the other two. I said I bought 4 tickets for 120.

They understood because luckily bus had only 10–15 passengers so conductor could have easily found out if I was doing sth wrong.

They took the conductor and fined him for 900 rupees.

When conductor returned back to the bus he never made eye contact with me.

I went to him and asked to stop doing such petty crimes, he said he forgot and mistakenly gave you two tickets, but we both knew he was lying.

Guys please be aware of such scams and take notice of the tickets while traveling.

Shobhit Gupta,4y,What are common scams in India?,"Roadside Dhabas on GT Karnal Road

This is a very common scam in North India and I was caught off guard the first time I faced it.

In April, 2015, I, with four friends, was travelling to Mcleodganj from Delhi in a private deluxe bus. Most people prefer travelling at night to Himachal to avoid traffic and save time. The bus started from Delhi at 7 pm and was supposed to reach the destination early morning the next day.

At around 11 pm, the bus stopped for dinner at a roadside Dhaba on the GT Karnal Road. It was surprising to note that a lot of other buses too had stopped at the same Dhaba.

The Dhaba was busy and packed. Only two waiters could be seen running around, serving people. I, being hungry and reckless, hurriedly grabbed a seat with my friends and glanced at the menu. The price of the dishes was unexpectedly higher than usual. We being hungry, did not want to waste time pondering on the same so quickly ordered Shahi Paneer, Dal and Rotis for ourselves.

After about 5 minutes, the waiter kept five compartment plates on our tables. To our surprise, two sections of the plates already had Curd and Salad in them, while the food ordered was separately served to us. Considering those items as complimentary, we quickly had our food and walked to the counter to pay the bill.

To our surprise, we were charged twice as much the expected amount. Seeking clarification, we realised we were charged Rs. 600 extra for the curd and salad. (These items were not listed in the menu either so one could never know if they actually were for Rs. 600.)

Me: “Bhaiya, humne dahi aur salad order nahi kia tha .” (Brother, we did not order for the curd and salad)

Owner: “Toh fir khaya kyu?” (Then why did you eat it)

Me: “Humein laga complimentary hai’ (We thought it’s complimentary)

Owner: “Ab toh paise dene padenge” (You will have to pay for it)

I paid the complete amount because i did not want to have any argument with them. Upon observing for a few minutes, I found that almost all the people at the counter had the same issue with the bill.

Adarsh Krishna K G,Sep 1,What are common scams in India?,"This is one of the scam which happened with me in my recent journey to Delhi from Thrissur, Kerala.

So as usual I ordered a thali (veg) of 80₹ but the irctc employee asked me for ₹180 . Upon asking about the price hike he said, that it was a Special Thali and I gave ₹180 and upon asking about the bill,he gave me this .

I immediately searched for irctc food bill and I came to know that I was scammed because there was no mention of IRCTC bill.

I just tweeted by tagging Indian Railways Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) and also the photo of the food. They had already added ₹95 for a paneer curry which I even didn't get .

In 20 mins, I was asked for my PNR and my mobile number by the railmadad in my DM. I gave it and in 10 mins , the suprevisor of the pantry came and first tried to justify by saying it was a 'special thali ‘ .

And after around 2 mins of argument he agreed to give me my ₹100 back .

The food items were 4rotis , Rice, dal, paneer and some other sabji and an extra soan pappdi.

Gaurav Kr,Updated 1y,What are common scams in India?,"Beware when are doing an Interstate travelling.

When you are travelling from one state to another using National or state highways , there are certain locations which crosses certain cities and has regular traffic , please be aware because there is a gang ready for a well planned accident in order to extract money. The traffic constables are a part of their group as well. They are on lookout for cars from different states .

I have experienced this first hand since I have a car registered with WB number plate and I reside in Hyderabad, we generally plan long weekend trips. I have travelled Karnataka, Maharashtra , Andra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Pondicherry.

I have travelled twice to Kolkata and back to Hyderabad with my vehicle.

This has happened twice with me now.

First incident took place on my way from Hyderabad to Vizag . We were travelling at night and were about to reach Vizag by 12 am. At around 10 pm we were crossing a town with some mild traffic , pretty exhausted I was driving at around 50 kmph . I did not realise however two bikes with two gentlemen on each bike were blocking the sides and I had no option but to drive straight. There were no dividers but just the lines separating the lanes. One guy on a Luna suddenly made a U-turn in front of me from the opposite lane. Though he was not hit , he purposely fell of his scooter and we had to stop .He did not have a stractch on his body. The people on the two bikes suddenly stopped me. I was surrounded and they started talking in Telugu , I understand Telugu somewhat hence was able to make out this people had started asking for compensation . They asked for 20k right away . The conversation was not going smooth as there was a language barrier. One guy was able to speak broken Hindi though .

With the argument going on , where I was adamant that I was not going to pay a single penny and was ready to take the man for medication and if needed to the police station as well. With no way out , the group which consisted of just 5 people decided to call up the traffic police. They did not dial the number for control room ,instead they dialled a police constable directly who happened to come pretty quick . He started howling without knowing what had happened finally ordered me to pay compensation to the man. I denied straightaway and maintained my stand about taking the injured to the hospital and to the police station as well and will give my explanation there.

With no way out one of the person grabbed my collar. The situation was getting ugly with them making racist comments and me abusing them in return. Finally two CISF personell arrived at the scene. They were able to identify the people and their stupid ways of making money. The constable now understood the racket was being exposed left the scene. The individuals also were cooling down. Though I was pretty nervous up until now finally got some strength now. Now we were the ones pouncing on the indivisuals. They finally left as well and we were ready to go. I was still shaking after the incident. This was the first for me.

Last week I was returning from Hampi back to Hyderabad , the same situation happened. It was just a replica of the previous encounter. I dialled 1033 this time , two individuals in Bolero (the state highway patrol car) came and contacted the police. By the time the police could arrive , the culprits had left the scene.

Always remember when you are the only one driving :

Get proper sleep before you drive.
Do not eat spicy or oily food as it might make you drowsy or even give u the feeling that you are getting Ill.Carry fruits and juices instead.
Make sure you make a pit stop after every 2 or 2:5 hrs depending on your capabilities and roads but do not drive for more than 3 hours at a stretch( no matter what car/truck you are driving).

Driving is fun.

Kishore Kumar,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Petrol bunk scam

I was driving back from college and wanted to check the mileage of my bike, so I decided to fill the tank. Went to HP petrol bunk near Ekkattuthangal metro, Chennai).

I asked the attendant to fill the tank. I ensured Zero before he started to fill petrol. While he was filling he asked me to Close the fuel valve. Nobody has ever told me to close the fuel tank since it has no meaning. I felt something fishy and suddenly my friend who was scammed few weeks before came to my mind. He told me that, “Whenever you are alone and an pump attendant tries to distract you, be very careful”.

He was scammed in the exact way I was about to be scammed. (I am glad he shared the story).

The fuel counter was running and stopped at Rs.100. Upon enquiring, he told me that he had set the counter to Rs.100 only as he did not hear me clearly. Since I was wearing an Helmet, I thought my voice was muffled and thus he couldn't hear me properly. I again asked him to fill the tank.

He goes to the fuel dispenser and adjusts the value to Rs.500 . I observed that the counter was not reset to zero but continued from Rs.100. After filling Rs.500 I told him I’ll pay by card.

Him: Should I put both transaction in one bill?

He entered Rs.600 in the swipe machine.

Me: Both transactions? What do you mean by both, I saw the counter run from Rs.0 to Rs.100 and then from Rs. 100 to Rs.500 and thus the bill is only Rs.500.

(Translation to English from Chennai Tamil)

He was numb and didn’t reply anything. He entered Rs.500 in swipe machine without uttering a single word and went to the next customer. I was ready to confront him if he had uttered another word

Srinidhi Rao,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Warning: This is my first answer here and it's going to be a lengthy one.

Today I was just cheated of my hard earned money.

Location: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India

As it happened: It was around 4:15pm in the evening when an aged woman approached me, and my friend near the BTM layout park. The woman looked humble and sought our help. She said that she needed some money to return to her native Magadi the same day and had not eaten anything the entire day. Apparently, she was looking for her son, who was a mason, and had brought her here. Somehow she lost her way and she couldn’t reach home without our help.

We were sympathetic and offered help. At first, we offered to take her to a nearby hotel so that we could get her some food. She was reluctant and said that it was getting late and that it would be dark by the time she reached home. We thought that was reasonable and didn't force her into it and decided to help with whatever money we could.

Luckily, I had just ₹10 with me in cash and nothing more. My friend had no wallet with her. We decided to walk to an ATM, withdraw some cash and help the old soul. We withdrew ₹500 and decided to give her ₹100 so that she could reach Magadi (Our calculation: BTM to Majestic - ₹15, Majestic to Magadi - ₹70 approximately). We handed over a crisp ₹100 note and felt good for doing so. To help her out some more, we offered to drop her to the bus station nearby. She reluctantly refused and started briskly walking away, which raised a red flag!

We decided to observe her, and to our surprise, she was joined by another lady, who was in her early 40s, from a crossroad which was hardly 100mts away. We thought, “something is fishy!”. We decided to follow them. They started walking briskly and didn't notice that we were behind. Soon, they found another target - A female standing by the road, maybe a college student. I got nearer to them and heard the same story again from a distance. The girl saw us approaching her. I signaled to her to not to pay them anything as they were scammers. The girl got scared and swiftly moved on.

Now, the duo knew that we were behind them and started to run. The oldie was literally running! Now, it was time for action. I decided to give them a chase. Firstly, though it was a small amount of ₹100, I didn't want to lose it this way. It hurt my ego to know that I was scammed. I wanted to get my money back. Secondly, I wanted to teach them a lesson! I asked my friend to go into a restaurant nearby and wait for me and I would return in a while. I didn't want to put her in trouble (in case anything happened) for my adventure.

By this time, maybe they didn't expect me to give them a chase, they were at their job again. Before I could reach them, a guy wearing a Swiggy uniform was already scammed.Before they could get to their next target, there I was, right in front of them shouting at the top of my lungs. I stand tall at 6′1′’ , with a fairly built physique. Add to this my hard voice. They were scared.

Now, 2 men in their mid 20s came to their rescue and started to yell at me. I didn't budge. I started hurling abuses at those crooks. I was high.. Literally! All this while, I was trying to call 100 but to no luck. The call wasn't getting connected. I showed them my phone screen where it was clearly visible that I had dialed 100 and police were on their way here. The next moment, those men were no where to be seen. I managed to click a few good pictures of the 2 ladies! I looked all around for those 2 men. But they were gone. The old woman at the next moment dropped my ₹100 note on the bike seat that was by the roadside and started to walk away briskly. There I was, back with my money. A sense of satisfaction. :)

My first task of getting my money back was accomplished. Yet, the second task of teaching them a lesson was still incomplete. I Googled for Mico layout police station number and called them and explained them what had just happened. They noted my phone number and a hoysala (Bengaluru City police patrol squad) was at the location in 5minutes and called me. I shared the pictures with them. They assured me of help. I requested them not to hurt them but to warn them so that they don't scam. I didn't file any written complaint. I thought my job was done. Task 2 partially accomplished. This is the best I could do.

I returned to where my friend was, we had a cup of hot coffee and started heading home. I dropped off my friend and boarded a bus to Banashankari.

At Banashankari bus terminal, in my wildest dreams didn't expect to meet them again. There they were waiting to board a bus to Kengeri. How do I know their destination? They asked it to the bus conductor I was sitting in. The bus conductor had a friendly conversation with them. Now I was curious again. I asked the conductor about how he knows them. He knew them since morning when they arrived to seek help in the Bus depot. The morning story was that they had come near the depot to meet a person who had promised them some money. The conductor himself and few of his colleagues had helped them with whatever they could. A scam again! I explained the conductor about what had just happened and he was surprised to know what had just happened!

So friends, taking our sympathy and goodwill for granted is the biggest scam we can ever undergo. This is pure daylight robbery.

Beware of such people.

This is my first answer. Thanks for the patience :)

Karan Kanwal,6y,What are common scams in India?,"Arun graduated from engineering college with no job in hand.

Arun’s branch is Mechanical Engineering.

Arun is depressed as he knows his family needs support from him financially.

Arun needs a job so he submitted his resume in various job portal.

After a week, he got a call from a xyz job portal and they told him that his resume has got shortlisted for tata motors, they fixed a telephonic interview.

Arun is happy, finally he has a chance to support his poor family.

He was asked some really easy question in a telephonic interview which he answered correctly and interviewer congratulated him as he was selected for HR round on next day.

Arun prepares for the interview whole night, he mugged up all the possible answers as he did not want to miss this chance.

Arun got a call next day, again some obsolete question was asked which Arun answered perfectly. He was sure that he will get a job but he did not tell anybody as he wanted to surprise everyone.

He got the call next day, a lady congratulated him for the job. Arun was on a cloud nine, he knew the importance of the job, somehow he controlled his emotion and thanked the lady on the phone.

She asked him for all the documents for verification and 5000 rs security money (which is refundable if he join the company).

Arun knew he could not ask for money to his parents so he gave all his savings to that lady.

She called him again and said his documents are fine and he can join his company from xyz date. But he got a job in another state, so he has to give another 10,000 rs for dress, room etc etc.

Now, Arun has already given him his savings and he was left with no money, so he contacted all his placed friends and asked for money, somehow he collected 10000 rs and submitted it to them.

Now, he was waiting for a call.

2 Weeks passed he was still waiting. Now, he called on lady’s no. which is either switched off or not reachable. He tried all the no. from which he got the call, all were switched off.

Arun waited for another 2 week.

No call, no messages, no email.

Ajay,5y,What are common scams in India?,"Max Fashion

I have been purchasing regularly from Max Fashion for some years now. So, when the received the following message on my phone, I was naturally inclined to make a visit.

I purchased for Rs 6k that day. While billing, was given two coupons which I made a mistake of not paying attention to at the moment. Upon reaching home I realized it was not a discount coupon but some other offer. Immediately searched the showroom on Google Maps and called them to ask what this offer was and why I wasn’t given the discount coupon. Was told that the Rs 500 offer is no longer valid and the offer is for Rs 300 now and if possible I could visit the showroom again to collect it.

Now this was still acceptable.

I visited the showroom again the very next day and was told that since I purchased for Rs 6k, I was “upgraded” for the higher offer and could not get the coupons. If I was explained this while billing, I would have split it into two bills and got the coupons. The offer I received was the following

“Assured Free Holiday “ doesn’t look that believable, but still decided to give it a shot.It promised a one day outing at a resort of choice from the available options. Sounds like a good deal, right ?

Made the online booking, selected the main and back up dates and venues and got the following confirmation.

Notice how the mail has no codes or unique numbers for future reference or tracking.

Coincidentally, my friend also had the received the same coupon. We had planned to together and booked the same resorts for the same dates. We were looking forward to the “Assured Free Holiday“

Now, 24 hours before the day, we receive the following SMS.

My Phone

My Friends Phone

It’s a big coincidence that both our phones were “Non - contactable “

( Its the first time that I’m seeing such an error message - “Non - contactable “ )

Jack Neil,7mo,What are common scams in India?,"Food Bill Scam at Movie Threatre

Recently I went to watch Adipurush with my family for a night show at a reputed movie theatre. During the interval, I decided to have some snacks though I completed my dinner at home as it was a night show.

I went to the food counter and waited in the queue for around 5 mins as there was a huge crowd on that day. I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and 2 medium Pepsi and 1 bucket of caramel popcorn. They told me that it will take 10 mins to make the food so I provided them with my seat number and they would provide me with the food there.

Till now it was all ok, then they gave me the bill which I didn’t check due to hurry, the interval would end within 1-2 minutes. So, I paid them online and went back to my seat. Then after 15 minutes they came to my seat and gave me my food. It was 11 PM and then I found something suspicious, my sandwich was grilled.

I checked my bill and I saw they charged me an extra 100 rupees by adding the grill and extra cheese option in my sandwich which I didn’t order. At first, I thought to let it go because it was night and they might have done some mistake. But then my mom told me that I must report it at least, so I went there immediately leaving the legendary movie-Adipurush.

I went to the person and told him:

Me- Hey! This is Bill and I ordered two normal chicken sandwiches but you gave me grilled sandwiches with extra cheese

The person at Food Counter- Sorry Sir but we don’t have chicken sandwiches so we gave you grilled sandwiches with extra cheese.

Me- So you could have told me, I wouldn't order it.

The person at Food Counter: Sir we serve it like that only, it is our signature item.

Me: You are charging me extra for that without even asking me? How does that work? Did I order your signature item?

The person at Food Counter: No Sir, but we want our customers to try our signature item.

Me: You can charge me extra without taking my permission. Call your manager!

The person at Food Counter: Sir, I am not keeping the money with myself I am giving you the item you have paid for.

Me: I got furious and shouted at him, how can you charge me extra without even asking me and after that, you are arguing with me?

Manager Enters

Manager: What happened, sir?

I explained the full problem

Manager: Sorry sir, we really apologize for the inconvenience and he refunded me the full amount for the sandwich.

Total refund of Rs.400 cash.

The manager didn’t tell anything to the person serving at the counter, maybe they were trained to do that. Most people don’t check their bills in the movie theatre as they rush to watch the movie and also can’t see in the dark hall. So they might take advantage of that. I always recommend everyone to check the bills before paying, else you might end up paying more.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0g1xuhsm2vk45eq8', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.41755, 'ai': 0.58245}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Food Bill Scam at Movie Threatre\n\nRecently I went to watch Adipurush with my family for a night show at a reputed movie theatre.

Pulkit Aggarwal,4y,What are common scams in India?,"My most recent experience with NISSAN GOA

So it time for a routine service of our car.

There was no problem with the vehicle, it was smooth as butter and didn’t really require servicing but they keep calling you and telling you something might go wrong.

Day 1 - I drop the car at the service station, they told me they’ll service the car and deliver it by the evening.

I get the car back and here’s when the problem starts.

The engine malfunction light kept popping up if I went above 60 km/hr or accelerated a little hard.

So I call the service centre back and tell them the problem.

They ask me to drop the car back immediately and not to push the car to hard.

Next day, evening I get a call and the technician on the other side tells me that a fuel injector has broken down and it needs to be replaced and it will cost around 1.2Lac. I was like wtf…I knew something was not right..I took the car back and showed it to the nearby garage.. note: when I took the car back from them I could hardly drive the car, it couldn’t pick up speed after 2nd gear and the vibrations were equivalent of those in tata busses. The engine sounded entirely different as if there was no silencer.

Anyway, after I showed it in the garage the guy tells me the same thing, the injector has broken off and he could fix it up but it would cost around 40k. Again I felt something is fishy and brought the car home. If The injectors would have broken off then there would have been no chance that the engine would even start up.

So, I tell my dad all this and he tells me to give it back to the nissan dealer next day and let them fix it up.

Next morning, I was about to give the car back but thought of just having a glance of the engine myself. I removed the upper engine cowling and started inspecting the cylinder and found one connection was amiss.

I randomly connected it and started the engine.

Viola

All problems gone. I car was back to normal.

No warning light, smooth as hell.

Later I did a bit of a research and found that they had disconnected the intake pipe. The car was running on 3 pistons instead of 4 and the mismatch of the cam shaft timings caused the intense vibrations.

I would say I got lucky,

but people beware..","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0bumsrpcazh1kiv9', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My most recent experience with NISSAN GOA\n\nSo it time for a routine service of our car.\n\nThere was no problem with the vehicle, it was smooth as butter and didn’t really require servicing but they keep calling you and telling you something might go wrong.\n\nDay 1 - I drop the car at the service station, they told me they’ll service the car and deliver it by the evening.\n\nI get the car back and here’s when the problem starts.\n\nThe engine malfunction light kept popping up if I went above 60 km/hr or accelerated a little hard.\n\nSo I call the service centre back and tell them the problem.\n\nThey ask me to drop the car back immediately and not to push the car to hard.\n\nNext day, evening I get a call and the technician on the other side tells me that a fuel injector has broken down and it needs to be replaced and it will cost around 1.2Lac.

Nowadays you travel in train or shop roadside, you are sure to see hawkers selling Power Banks for a much less rate say ₹150-₹200

So these are really cheap compared to those online and with all those Brand tags, you may feel it's a great offer!

But,

Take a look inside the device

One battery with a LED strip and pouches filled with sand to fake the weight

And believe me that battery lasts just for the time being to let the hawker gets away from your sight.

Your phone would probably charge your power bank!

Beware friends,

Not everything cheap is genuine!

Note: This has happened with my cousin and my friends initially and not with me so ain't got a live picture of the Power bank.

Deepika M,5y,What are common scams in India?,"Cafe Coffee Day, Alwarpet, Chennai.

Yesterday, I ordered a Classic Cappuccino Regular at a CCD outlet. The price on the menu was Rs. 110 so I was expecting to pay around 120/- including GST. To my surprise, the final amount was Rs. 140/-. At this point, the person at the counter hadn't given me the copy of the bill yet. I repeatedly asked her for it so as to confirm the price (in case the menu was an older version and they had revised their rates). She said she'd give me the copy along with my order.

10 minutes later, she brought me the coffee but not the bill. On reminding her a couple more times, she finally hands it over to me wherein I noticed that I had been billed for a Toffee Cappuccino with a base price of Rs. 133/- plus 5% GST so Rs. 140/- in all.

On confronting her, she said that their billing machine didn't show the Classic Cappuccino option in the drop down menu so she had to select the Toffee option.

Finally, she came over and handed me Rs. 24.

Rohit Jain,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"This is what happened to me Yesterday.

After a long day in office, I decided to go to Burger King with my friend. The person taking the orders asked me for my order.

I told him that I want 2 medium veg supreme meals. To which he straight away, without entering any information in his computer, said that the total was Rs. 271/-. Since I am a frequent customer at Burger King, I knew that the amount would be this only, but since he didn’t enter any information in his computer, I asked him to enter my order in the system. (Remember that no customer need not to inform the counter guy to do this, as it is his/her duty to feed the information on the computer)

Then after entering, he showed me the screen of his computer. The order bill was Rs. 271/-. He reacted in such a way that it was my fault that I asked him to put the order details in the system.

I made the payment with my card and got the payment receipt immediately. But then I noticed that he had deleted the order details and therefore neither the bill got printed nor my order went to the display in the kitchen (I knew this because I was observing everything after he showed me, in disgust, that my order amount was Rs. 271/-).

Then I asked him to give me my bill. He said that the bill was supposed to be kept by them only and need not be given to customers (My order still didn’t go through). I told him that I was not born yesterday and I wanted my copy of the bill. After this he told me that the bill printing machine was not working and the bill got stuck in the machine. I still demanded my copy of bill. He then entered the details again in his computer, and gave the order. Then what I noticed was that the bill printing machine was working just fine and that there was no bill stuck in that machine.

Sushant Bansal,6y,What are common scams in India?,"This happened to me a few days ago at KFC.

I was returning home after attempting an exam from my test center which was 70kms away. I was exhausted and starving, so I decided to stop at the first restaurant I see and grab something to eat. I came across a KFC and ordered a Veg. Potato Krisper. As expected, I was given the extra cheese and combo offer which I cleverly declined.

I was asked to pay ₹45 and I did. I was exhausted but while the burger was being prepared I glanced at the bill as I wanted to see the implementation of recent 5% GST law on food items.

I noticed that the burger was for ₹38.33 before tax, and should be charged ₹40.25 after taxes, but was billed ₹45.

Even though ₹5 is nothing, I was curious about it and asked the server why was I charged ₹5 extra in name of HOPE. He got a little nervous, stared at the bill for 10 seconds and then passed the bill to his colleague and asked me to talk to him. This person also got nervous and offered me to refund the ₹5. I told him that I wanted to know the reason for this charge. He then called his manager and showed him the bill. The manager saw it and then, facing his left, shouted in thin air “Tum logo ne abhi tak theek nahi kara isse?” (You guys haven’t repaired it yet). I now thought that it was an honest mistake and will be rectified, and so went home satisfied.

A few days later I was telling this to a friend who lives nearby that outlet, and he told me that he’d visited KFC just the day before and started searching for the bill to check the amount. Alas, I find that he was also charged extra.

The scam here is that they deliberately charge this extra amount. Since it’s a small amount, no one seems to notice especially after reduction in GST. This amount goes directly into their pockets, which is highly unethical.

Edit 1:

I have received a lot of comments suggesting me that HOPE is an NGO or that this may be a mistake.

I know what it is, the name gives you a clear indication and I searched about it as soon as I left the outlet. The issue was they added it without asking or notifying, I’ll be happy to donate if it’s genuine and for a good cause.
I also thought it’s an honest mistake and went home, it was only when they also charged my friend that I got suspicious.
What was even more surprising was that none of the staff was aware of what it is.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/oy5h2avu9t7dzbw4', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This happened to me a few days ago at KFC.\n\nI was returning home after attempting an exam from my test center which was 70kms away.

Prasanth Raj,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"There are 100+ answers for this question. Pardon me if this is redundant.

I’m describing my experience in Amazon (not stereotyping, might happen in any online shopping website) which everyone needs to be aware of!

We recently moved to a new house at Urapakkam, outer suburb of Chennai. We wanted to buy some new things like cot with mattress, sofa set, chairs etc. We decided to go with Amazon as it is one of the most trusted shopping website. So while surfing sofa sets, we came through a beautiful five seater sofa. We checked its price and it was lot less than we thought! Rs. 20000! Check it for yourself.

Then we ordered it and paid using debit card. After 2 - 3 days, I got a call from the seller itself. I received the call and the conversation went like this.

He : Hello, am I speaking to Mr. Prasanth Raj? This is regarding your enquiry about the five seater sofa set at Amazon.

Me : Yeah, tell me.

He : Sir, have you paid for the product or it is a cash on delivery?

Me : I paid for the product and it is supposed to be delivered by tomorrow, right?

He : Sir I have a concern, actually, Amazon will take 14 days to credit us your money, could you please cancel the product and order it again with COD as payment option?

Me : Nope. I won't cancel it. If that’s the case, you should have mentioned in the product description that Cash on Delivery option is preferable.

He : Sir, if you need the order right away, I’m located in Vanagaram, Chennai only. I can ship it personally to you. Could you please cancel your order?

Me : I’ll call you back in an hour.

(Hung up the Phone.)

I was pretty doubtful at this moment as he was insisting me to cancel the order. So I went to Amazon website to check the product again. That is the point where I realized he was trying to scam me. The Price of the product shot up to Rs. 32000!

That was the reason why he wanted me to cancel the order and order it once again, by putting a lame reason (Cash on delivery) for it .

I called him right away and the conversation went like this.

Me : Hi, I’m Prasanth again. (In a stern voice) It won't matter if it is late, you can ship the product after 14 days once you receive the payment.

He : In 14 Days? But..but..

It is a highly delicate one. It has cushion in it. It has to be handled safely. I don’t trust Amazon delivery as they might mishandle it and at last you’ll return the product. We had experiences like that.

Me : (Chuckled) Then Label the product “Handle with care” and Amazon will handle it safely during the delivery. I’ll also intimate Amazon regarding this.

He : Amazon won't respond properly to these. They will liberally fail on their delivery.

Me : You are talking trash about an organization which has one of the best customer service experience in the world? Uh? I won't cancel the order and that is final and you need to ship it.

He : Ok.. (Hangs up as soon as I told him that.)

I reported this incident to amazon and they thanked me for reporting the incident and assured that I’ll get the product in perfect condition. They also told me that, never have any personal assurances with the seller on online shopping portals. (They could have simply mentioned “on amazon”. Instead they wanted to teach the ethics of Online shopping to their customers. Wow!)

Moral : Never ever have personal assurances with seller. Mostly, it will be a scam. Your communication should be with your online shopping portal and not with the seller. It is really unprofessional that a seller calls you and talks to you convincingly. Please turn those things down!

I request everyone to be aware of this.

Edit :

The seller might also try other stuffs like these to make you cancel the order :

Telling you that the product is out of stock.
If the payment is Cash on delivery, He might ask you to cancel it and order it via Online Payment. (Other way around of what I experienced.)
He has shipped to the wrong address.

In all these cases, seller wants you to cancel the order. So please decline it and ask him to contact amazon (or the particular shopping portal) instead of contacting you. Tell him firmly that you need the product anyways.

Edit 2 :

Some of the Questions by the fellow Quorans.

Q : How did Amazon gave my contact info to the seller?

A : Seriously, I don’t know, how he got. But Anneerrudh Mmahepate in the comment section pointed out that, the maximum dimension of product that Amazon delivers is 70 cm x 70 cm and 45 cm, max weight 18 kgs. So Amazon would have directly asked the seller to ship it to me and thereby passing my contact info.

Q : How was the Product’s condition when it got delivered?

A : This incident happened just yesterday (5/12/17) and I’m also eagerly waiting for the product to be delivered to me. Will update you on the condition on the sofa set.

Final Edit :

The seller cancelled the order by himself. Amazon sent me a mail like “Sorry for the order cancellation, the seller didn't ship the product within the speculated time.” :(","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7tnz9uveq8513csi', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9608, 'ai': 0.0392}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""There are 100+ answers for this question.

I received the call and the conversation went like this.\n\nHe : Hello, am I speaking to Mr. Prasanth Raj? This is regarding your enquiry about the five seater sofa set at Amazon.\n\nMe : Yeah, tell me.\n\nHe : Sir, have you paid for the product or it is a cash on delivery?\n\nMe : I paid for the product and it is supposed to be delivered by tomorrow, right?\n\nHe : Sir I have a concern, actually, Amazon will take 14 days to credit us your money, could you please cancel the product and order it again with COD as payment option?\n\nMe : Nope. I won't cancel it. If that’s the case, you should have mentioned in the product description that Cash on Delivery option is preferable.\n\nHe : Sir, if you need the order right away, I’m located in Vanagaram, Chennai only. I can ship it personally to you. Could you please cancel your order?\n\nMe : I’ll call you back in an hour.\n\n(Hung up the Phone.)\n\nI was pretty doubtful at this moment as he was insisting me to cancel the order. So I went to Amazon website to check the product again. That is the point where I realized he was trying to scam me. The Price of the product shot up to Rs. 32000!\n\nThat was the reason why he wanted me to cancel the order and order it once again, by putting a lame reason (Cash on delivery) for it .\n\nI called him right away and the conversation went like this.\n\nMe : Hi, I’m Prasanth again. (In a stern voice) It won't matter if it is late, you can ship the product after 14 days once you receive the payment.\n\nHe : In 14 Days? But..but..\n\nIt is a highly delicate one. It has cushion in it. It has to be handled safely. I don’t trust Amazon delivery as they might mishandle it and at last you’ll return the product. We had experiences like that.\n\nMe : (Chuckled) Then Label the product “Handle with care” and Amazon will handle it safely during the delivery. I’ll also intimate Amazon regarding this.\n\nHe : Amazon won't respond properly to these. They will liberally fail on their delivery.\n\nMe : You are talking trash about an organization which has one of the best customer service experience in the world? Uh? I won't cancel the order and that is final and you need to ship it.\n\nHe : Ok.. (Hangs up as soon as I told him that.)\n\nI reported this incident to amazon and they thanked me for reporting the incident and assured that I’ll get the product in perfect condition. They also told me that, never have any personal assurances with the seller on online shopping portals. (They could have simply mentioned “on amazon”. Instead they wanted to teach the ethics of Online shopping to their customers. Wow!)\n\nMoral : Never ever have personal assurances with seller. Mostly, it will be a scam. Your communication should be with your online shopping portal and not with the seller. It is really unprofessional that a seller calls you and talks to you convincingly. Please turn those things down!\n\nI request everyone to be aware of this.\n\nEdit :\n\nThe seller might also try other stuffs like these to make you cancel the order :\n\nTelling you that the product is out of stock.\nIf the payment is Cash on delivery, He might ask you to cancel it and order it via Online Payment. (Other way around of what I experienced.)\nHe has shipped to the wrong address.\n\nIn all these cases, seller wants you to cancel the order. So please decline it and ask him to contact amazon (or the particular shopping portal) instead of contacting you. Tell him firmly that you need the product anyways.\n\nEdit 2 :\n\nSome of the Questions by the fellow Quorans.\n\nQ : How did Amazon gave my contact info to the seller?\n\nA : Seriously, I don’t know, how he got. But Anneerrudh Mmahepate in the comment section pointed out that, the maximum dimension of product that Amazon delivers is 70 cm x 70 cm and 45 cm, max weight 18 kgs. So Amazon would have directly asked the seller to ship it to me and thereby passing my contact info.\n\nQ : How was the Product’s condition when it got delivered?\n\nA : This incident happened just yesterday (5/12/17) and I’m also eagerly waiting for the product to be delivered to me. Will update you on the condition on the sofa set.\n\nFinal Edit :\n\nThe seller cancelled the order by himself. Amazon sent me a mail like “Sorry for the order cancellation, the seller didn't ship the product within the speculated time.” :("", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9608
Pritish Nair,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"My Aqua-guard stopped working. Called customer care and asked to send representative. Customer care told me that as my machine is out of warranty it would be paid visit (Rs 425) + cost of spare parts, to which I said okay.

On the same day technician from Aquaguard arrived. He asked me the problem.

Me - I’ve been told that there was a spark sound from inside and it stopped working afterwards.

Technician - Your filter’s PCB (Printed circuit board
) has gone. Do you have AMC?

Me - No, how much would it cost?

Technician - Rs 2200 + Rs 425, If you would have AMC then it would have been replaced for free.

Me - How much AMC would cost and what does it cover?

Technician - Rs 1800 per year. Filter replacement twice in a year. If anything else happens that is also covered.

Me - Hmm, Okay so do the AMC and change the PCB. (You see I am trying to be over smart here)

Technician - Okay thanks. Takes out pen and paper. Calls someone, spoken to few mins and realized his mistake. If you want PCB replacement then you need to take 2 years AMC for Rs 3600.

Me - Just change the PCB yaar for forget about AMC.

Tech - Okay, I will take the filter and will come back tomorrow.

Me - At-least, try to switch on the filter and see what is the problem. It could be some loose wire, fuse might have gone.

Tech - Sir, I can tell you by my closed eyes, it’s PCB. We do it day and night.

Me - Please I insist, open the filter here and take PCB out of it and get a new PCB tomorrow and replace it over here.

Tech - Sir, I get only 40/- per call. It would take too much time.

Me - I will pay you additional 40 Rs. Please descend it from wall and inspect it.

Technician descent it off wall and and plug in. Nothing happens.

Tech - See I told you, PCB has gone.

Me - Where is fuse? Is there any reset button in it.

Technician - No, there is no reset button.

Technician starts preparing job card and I discovered the fuse and pulled it out. The fuse wire was broken.

Me - Do you have spare fuse? It seems that fuse wire is broken.

Technician - No I don’t have.

Me - Can you please check once in your bag. If you can’t, allow me to check your bag please.

Technician (After searching sometime) - There is one.

He changes the fuse and hurrah, my filter was back in business. I just saved Rs 2200.

Technician : Sir you told me that there was a spark.

Me - I had said, “I’ve been told, that there was a spark”. and I have also told you to check fuse but you were hell bent adamant on changing PCB and taking filter along with you. Anyways, how much do you want now?

Technician - Rs 425 my visit charges. Take it man and have a good day.

After his departure, I was thinking for long time whether I had saved Rs 2200 or lost Rs 425.

Summary -

This is not my first bad experience with Aquaguard technicians. While Aquaguard is good company (but expensive), their agents executes malpractices.

Last time, A guy had visit to change the filter and he didn’t give me the invoice. After so much arguments, he called up his boss and they asssured me that tomorrow we will get our bill but no one turned up later.

EDIT 1

After reading comments, I realized there are lot of people who have been victim of Aquaguard’s service partners money making practices.

I would suggest everyone to report their incidents to Aquaguard through proper escalation channel and it it does not resolve your concerns, put up your review on channels where company responds like M
outhshut or Indian Consumer Complaints Forum
 .

Kumar,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Scam by Taxi drivers at Mumbai railway station

This happened to me a few days back. As semester holidays are over by the end of July, I traveled on the train to Mumbai LTT railway station and to get to my hostel, I decided to take a cab from LTT railway station to IIT Bombay.

So, while the train is about to reach the station, it’s early morning and at 5:00 AM, I booked a cab in the Uber. The app showed the estimated cost to be about ₹180.

It might be even less as there would be no traffic early in the morning.

When the train reached the station, I got off. Immediately, a taxi driver came to me and asked me if I need a taxi to which I denied and started moving. But he kept following me insisting, asking me where should I go. I told him that I booked a cab in Uber. Then, he said that Uber and Ola were not allowed near the railway station saying their fair was not constant and some other reasons.
He even told me, he won’t charge any extra and he’ll just go by meter.
(I’m from Andhra Pradesh, so I can’t speak Hindi very fluently. So, I have issues in communicating with him)
So, I agreed to him and followed him to his taxi.

Then I asked him to turn off night meter(something that calculates extra fare when you take a taxi at night) to which he agreed.
Then, in about 20 min, he dropped me in front of the IIT main gate. It’s still dark outside.
Then he showed me the amount on the meter. It’s ₹402 and it’s a shock for me. (I understood that he turned on night meter)
I tried to argue with him saying it’s too high but he had some explanation for every argument. I felt it’s useless to argue, got off the cab, took ₹100 from him, gave him a 500 rupee note and took my bag to move.
Then he called me back.
Showing a 200 rupee note in his hand, he said that I forgot and gave him a 200 rupee note instead of 500 rupee note in the dark. So, I checked my purse back.
(Just before getting on the train, I withdrew two 500 rupee notes from ATM. Then, I had only one 500 rupee note. So, I must have given him one).

So, I started arguing in a little bit loud voice saying he was trying to cheat and I actually gave him a 500 rupee note. (Just to remind, I can't speak Hindi fluently and it’s difficult for me to even argue).
After exchange of some words, he acted like he was frustrated and decided to let it go.
Then when I’m about to leave, he again asked me extra ₹100 as parking fee for parking his cab near the railway station.

I replied to him saying that that’s not an airport, there will be no parking fee at the railway station and left that place without looking back.

So, guys, always opt to Uber or Ola, especially at railway stations. The taxi drivers have a hell lot of ways to cheat you and be careful.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2y06isjd7k5f189v', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.47695, 'ai': 0.52305}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Scam by Taxi drivers at Mumbai railway station\n\nThis happened to me a few days back.

So, I must have given him one).\n\nSo, I started arguing in a little bit loud voice saying he was trying to cheat and I actually gave him a 500 rupee note. (Just to remind, I can't speak Hindi fluently and it’s difficult for me to even argue).\nAfter exchange of some words, he acted like he was frustrated and decided to let it go.\nThen when I’m about to leave, he again asked me extra ₹100 as parking fee for parking his cab near the railway station.\n\nI replied to him saying that that’s not an airport, there will be no parking fee at the railway station and left that place without looking back.\n\nSo, guys, always opt to Uber or Ola, especially at railway stations. The taxi drivers have a hell lot of ways to cheat you and be careful."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.47695
Archana Ganeshan,6y,What are common scams in India?,"When you travel from Bengaluru airport by any taxi service, you are bound to pay ₹125 toll charge. There are 2 scams here:

There is no single route toll charge. So you need to pay the return route charges though you don't come back to airport.
The fare in Uber/Ola do include toll charges but still the driver asks you to pay them.

This happened with me recently and accidentally I went through the fare breakup of Uber receipt where I found the charges for toll are already included. Luckily I raised a complaint and got refund! Thanks to Uber! But many people won't bother to read the receipt. Next time when you take a ride from Bangalore airport, do take a note of this!

Thanks,

Archana

Ashutosh Moharir,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Incident 1:

My phone rings, and thanks to TrueCaller app, the caller is identified as ATM Fraud.

Still to play along I decided to pick it up.

The person on other side was speaking in typical Bihari Hindi accent.

Scammer: Sir mai ATM head department se baat kar raha hu (I am talking from head office of ATM)

Aap jo ATM card use kar rahe hai, wo expire ho gaya hai (The ATM card you are using is expired now)

Kya app extend karwana chahte hai? (do you want me to extend it?)

Since I already knew who he was, I responded cautiously

Me: Uske liye kya karna hoga? (What do I have to do for it?)

Scammer: Aap Debit card ka number, CVV aur pin share kijiye, mai yaha se aapko authenticate karke card ko extend karwa deta hu (Share your ATM card number, CVV and pin so that I can authenticate you and extend the validity)

Me: (after a little pause) kyu karte ho ye sab? accha kuch kaam karo (Why do you do all these scams? Do something good)

After this he started abusing me and disconnected the call

Incident 2:

I was roaming on the streets near Calangute beach, all of a sudden a person appeared in front of me. He had bunch of tickets in his hands. He asked me to pull a random ticket saying it is a lucky draw .

When I picked a card and checked, it said “Better luck next time”

Then he handed over another ticket to my wife and asked her to check.

To our surprise this time we had won a laptop in our lucky draw.

As always, I suspected that there is something fishy about it. Because no one gives free laptops on the street just like that.

But when he explained us how to “claim” this prize, we were certain that this is a scam.

Basically the clause was to visit their office somewhere in Goa, look at their products. Buy them and then collect my “lucky prize” laptop somewhere in Mumbai.

We immediately shun him.

Bottom line: Nothing is free here. Behind every free offer, there is always a jobless scammer brain trying to loot your money","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zu7wf19y5bqlom4h', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9986, 'ai': 0.0014}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Incident 1:\n\nMy phone rings, and thanks to TrueCaller app, the caller is identified as ATM Fraud.\n\nStill to play along I decided to pick it up.\n\nThe person on other side was speaking in typical Bihari Hindi accent.\n\nScammer: Sir mai ATM head department se baat kar raha hu (I am talking from head office of ATM)\n\nAap jo ATM card use kar rahe hai, wo expire ho gaya hai (The ATM card you are using is expired now)\n\nKya app extend karwana chahte hai?

Jalaj Kumar,4y,What are common scams in India?,"No, Ola and Uber are not scams but few people are using these services to scam other people.

The following incident happened with a colleague of mine -

One day my colleague (Let's call him X) was returning to his room after the work (around 10 PM). He was waiting at road for a shared auto and then 3 young guys came near to him. One of the guy said that their friend is really sick and due to some network issues they are not able to book a cab. Mr. X is a very innocent person and he is always ready to help anyone and without giving any second thoughts he booked a cab from his account.

Next day, he was busy working at his desk and someone called him. He picked up the call and it was a call from police station and they asked him to reach police station. The guys for whom he booked a cab had beaten the cab driver and took away all of driver's money, his mobile and other accessories like watch etc. The police men grabbed his collar, started abusing him and also threatened to file a criminal case against him. He explained his side and said he got nothing to do with those guys but all in vain.

Now the police men saw this as an opportunity to squeeze money from him. Police said give us 1 Lakh Rupees and we will set you free from this case. 1 Lakh is a very big amount, especially for a young guy working in BPO. Police men gave him time period of 2 days to arrange money. Mr. X somehow arranged 30 thousand rupees which he saved from his salary but soon he realized he can't arrange 1 Lakh Rupees in 2 days. So, he decided to leave the city and he packed all of his things and left for his hometown in Jharkhand in midnight. Police came to our office to inquire about him and also filed a case against him.

Due to criminal case no one from our office is in contact with Mr. X and we still don't know how he is doing.

Mr. X belongs from a lower middle class family and he arrived Delhi with high hopes but due to a small mistake of booking a cab his dreams got shattered and now he is living in his home town which a very small city in Jharkhand with no opportunities.

I request all of people to never book a cab for a stranger. Your one act of kindness can turn out to be your biggest mistake.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4i7h2mgtpe3wyork', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""No, Ola and Uber are not scams but few people are using these services to scam other people.\n\nThe following incident happened with a colleague of mine -\n\nOne day my colleague (Let's call him X) was returning to his room after the work (around 10 PM).

Vaibhav,6y,What are common scams in India?,"AIRTEL POSTPAID ( Please read this )

** charged extra for using previous unused data.

“Your unused data at the end of the month, will be always added back to your data allowance for the next month” - This is what Airtel promised recently.

This whole 'promise' thing was implemented from the month of September 2017.

I have Rs. 199 postpaid plan ( 100 local mins and 675mb data/month).

From September my unsused data was being added to current month data (September-> October-> November)

As you can see above around 1.81 Gb unused data was added to my current ( November) monthly plan + 675 mb.

Scam starts here :

Today, I received my November month bill which was Rs. 556. I was in shock since I never have paid or received a bill more than 300 rs.

I requested bill details. And you can cleary see from my bill details that they charged me for using previous months unused data.

My allocated qouta - 675mb (converted using formula they provide)

Total usage - 1690mb

Chargeable usage - 1015 mb (WHY??)

There is no mention of my previous unused data ( 1.8gb )in the bill. They should clearly mention the total unused data from previous months in the current month bill.

Edit: Airtel just called me and agreed to waive off extra charges.

I don't know if it was intentional or due to technical error. But guys, ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BILL PROPERLY. DON'T BE IGNORANT.

Just think if same error happens to 10 people and 6 out of 10 ignores and pays the bill with extra charge. Now, you can calculate how much profit such company will earn.

Here, I am not trying to defame Airtel. But the thing is most people don't check their Bill properly and pay extra amount. I think I should keep this anwer just to make people aware about such incident/error.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bc2m5rv6ftak0xle', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""AIRTEL POSTPAID ( Please read this )\n\n** charged extra for using previous unused data.\n\n“Your unused data at the end of the month, will be always added back to your data allowance for the next month” - This is what Airtel promised recently.\n\nThis whole 'promise' thing was implemented from the month of September 2017.\n\nI have Rs. 199 postpaid plan ( 100 local mins and 675mb data/month).\n\nFrom September my unsused data was being added to current month data (September-> October-> November)\n\nAs you can see above around 1.81 Gb unused data was added to my current ( November) monthly plan + 675 mb.\n\nScam starts here :\n\nToday, I received my November month bill which was Rs. 556.
