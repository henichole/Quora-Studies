Timothy Wong,5y,What is the best philosophical question?,"How do you decide if a human life has value?

In The Dark Knight, there are two boats.

One boat contains a group of hardened criminals who have done terrible things.

The other boat contains ordinary, ‘good’ people of Gotham City.

Unfortunately, both boats are rigged up with explosives. In each boat contains a detonator.

Here is The Joker’s proposition:

If the citizens of Gotham City blow up the criminals, they will not die.

If the criminals blow up the citizens of Gotham City, they will not die.

If neither of them decides to take any action by 12 AM, the Joker will blow both of them up.

How do you decide that a life is worth saving? Will you kill someone else in order to preserve your own life?

One man on the boat with the citizens of Gotham tries to justify blowing up the other boat:

They had their chance. But they stole and they murdered other people.

The black man on the other boat understands what it is like to have committed a crime. His life is over. If he gets blown up, that's the end. If he isn't, he will still go to jail.

The black man takes the key to the detonator and throws it out of the window. When he returns he is surrounded by the other criminals. They understand the weight of his decision.

A man on the other boat takes the detonator in his hands and he contemplates turning the key that will blow up the criminals on the other boat.

He places the detonator back inside of the box.

He has the courage to realize this is a bad decision.

Neither the citizens or the criminals have the will to blow each other up.

As the Joker was about to pull the detonator that will blow both of the boats up, Batman knocks him off the ledge. The Joker was about to fall to his death, but Batman also abides to one moral code.

Do not kill.

Even though The Joker has killed many, many people, he still has value to Batman. The Joker is like a moral compass. He cannot kill The Joker, because if he does, Batman will stoop down to his level.

The Joker is a morally reprehensible man. He kills people just because he enjoys their suffering. He confuses the police and terrifies the citizens of Gotham because he just wants to watch the whole world suffer.

The Batman cannot kill The Joker. Unfortunately they need each other to coexist.

How do you decide whose life has value and who doesn't?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/m0dsak648ohbxy5p', 'title': 'What is the best philosophical question?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""How do you decide if a human life has value?\n\nIn The Dark Knight, there are two boats.\n\nOne boat contains a group of hardened criminals who have done terrible things.\n\nThe other boat contains ordinary, ‘good’ people of Gotham City.\n\nUnfortunately, both boats are rigged up with explosives.

The problem is his fanbase. Particularly his vocal fanbase. They are a lot like Infowars guys, albeit with less body building and more pretention.

Travis Friesen,Updated 2y,What is your favourite philosophical puzzle?,"My favourite philosophical puzzle is the Grandfather’s Axe or Ship of Theseus problem.

To put it simply: This is my grandfather’s axe. My father replaced the head and I replaced the handle. Is this still my grandfather’s axe?

The beauty of it is that most people, even those not versed in philosophy, can grasp the problem immediately. Some, however, are dismissive. They say of course not, it is completely different axe and this question is stupid.

To these people, I then introduce a more advanced version. The Ship of Theseus.

Theseus was an ancient Greek hero, who, at the end of his career, had his ship preserved by admirers long after his death. As individual components - ropes, boards, sails - would wear out, they would be replaced, until not a single component remained that had not been replaced once.

Even though not one nail is original, is it still the ship of Theseus? (For a real-world analogy, you can also use the USS Constitution, an 18th-century sailing frigate which has been similarly preserved).

You can take the problem in all sorts of interesting ways from here. For instance, if your student says that it is, in fact, still the ship of Theseus, ask them this: if every component of the ship were preserved after it had been replaced, and then later the old ship were reassembled from these original parts, which was then the ship of Theseus? The new one or the original?

On the other hand, if they say that, like the axe, it is no longer the ship of Theseus, you can introduce them to the problem of personal identity: every cell in our body is (supposedly) replaced every 7 years. If not one original cell remains in my body, am I still the same person I was 7 years ago?

And all along, of course, ask them why they think this, and if they start making distinctions, ask them what makes the ship different from the axe, for instance? I’ve had many people change their views as they work through the puzzle, and had many interesting answers given. One person claimed that while it was not my grandfather’s axe, the ship and the person retained its identity, because unlike an axe, ships (and people), have ‘souls’. I think he must have been a sailor in a previous life…

It’s a fun puzzle with no clear-cut or correct answer that just about anyone can grasp and appreciate. I love to use it to get people talking about issues that are abstract, but still relatable.

Edit to add:

I wanted to edit this to address some common responses in the comments.

First off, please don’t get caught up on the notion of possession. ‘My Grandfather’s axe’ is just a handy label for the axe. My grandfather may be dead, or I could just call the axe ‘Thelma’ or something. Likewise with the Ship OF Theseus. Don’t necessarily think of it as ‘The ship that belongs to Theseus’, although that way leads to interesting questions (and maybe even solutions) as well.

Secondly, a lot of people make the distinction for the case of our personhood that it is not derived from our bodies, but from, say, our memories. I don’t disagree, but I would highly recommend reading A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality by John Perry. In it, the narrator, who is an atheist and materialist, is dying, and challenges two friends, one a priest and one a mathematician, to prove to her that her personal identity is more than her physical identity, so that she may have hope for an existence after she dies.

To borrow a couple of examples from that book: let’s say that in the future, we are able to upload our memories and consciousness into a virtual reality world, like in Tron (perhaps a poor example, as Tron takes our bodies as well, but hopefully you get the point). Most people would say that our personal identity remains, being transferred into this world.

But what if, instead of being transferred, or moved, it is copied instead? And my original body still has all of my consciousness and memories? Again, most people would say that the personhood remains with the original body, even if they can’t exactly say why.

Fair enough, but what if when the transfer is made, the original is destroyed, but two copies are accidentally made and uploaded into the VR world instead. Which one is ‘you’? What if one copy is uploaded into the VR world, but another is copied into your clone?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cy4np5g96elt0mkh', 'title': 'What is your favourite philosophical puzzle?', 'score': {'original': 0.96445, 'ai': 0.03555}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My favourite philosophical puzzle is the Grandfather’s Axe or Ship of Theseus problem.\n\nTo put it simply: This is my grandfather’s axe.

Frederick Dolan,Updated 1y,What are some weird obsessions of famous philosophers?,"Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), with the help of his faithful and long-suffering servant Martin Lampe, wrapped himself tightly in a sheet every night before going to bed.

Kant believed that sleeping less prolonged life, while sleeping more shortened it. He also placed great importance on going to bed and rising according to an unvarying schedule. Indeed, virtually everything in Kant’s life was done on schedule. As Manfred Kuehn describes a typical day:

He got up at 5:00 A.M. His servant Lampe, who worked for him from at least 1762 until 1802, would wake him. The old soldier was under orders to be persistent, so that Kant would not sleep longer. Kant was proud that he never got up even half an hour late, even though he found it hard to get up early. It appears that during his early years, he did sleep in at times. After getting up, Kant would drink one or two cups of tea – weak tea. With that, he smoked a pipe of tobacco. The time he needed for smoking it “was devoted to meditation."" Apparently, Kant had formulated the maxim for himself that he would smoke only one pipe, but it is reported that the bowls of his pipes increased considerably in size as the years went on. He then prepared his lectures and worked on his books until 7:00. His lectures began at 7:00, and they would last until 11:00. With the lectures finished, he worked again on his writings until lunch. He would go out to lunch, take a walk, and spend the rest of the afternoon with his friend Green. After going home, he would do some more light work and read.[1]

For more on Kant’s eccentricities, especially in the last year of his life, read The Last Days of Immanuel Kant (1873) by Thomas de Quincey.[2] You might also enjoy Phillipe Collin’s 1992 film Les Derniers jours d’Emmanuel Kant
.

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was another thinker who kept a rigorous schedule. You can find hints of it in his quasi-autobiographical work Ecce Homo (1908), but Curtis Cate lays it out in detail:

With a Spartan rigour which never ceased to amaze his landlord-grocer, Nietzsche would get up every morning when the faintly dawning sky was still grey, and, after washing himself with cold water from the pitcher and china basin in his bedroom and drinking some warm milk, he would, when not felled by headaches and vomiting, work uninterruptedly until eleven in the morning. He then went for a brisk, two-hour walk through the nearby forest or along the edge of Lake Silvaplana (to the north-east) or of Lake Sils (to the south-west), stopping every now and then to jot down his latest thoughts in the notebook he always carried with him. Returning for a late luncheon at the Hôtel Alpenrose, Nietzsche, who detested promiscuity, avoided the midday crush of the table d’hôte in the large dining-room and ate a more or less ‘private’ lunch, usually consisting of a beefsteak and an ‘unbelievable’ quantity of fruit, which was, the hotel manager was persuaded, the chief cause of his frequent stomach upsets. After luncheon, usually dressed in a long and somewhat threadbare brown jacket, and armed as usual with notebook, pencil, and a large grey-green parasol to shade his eyes, he would stride off again on an even longer walk, which sometimes took him up the Fextal as far as its majestic glacier. Returning ‘home’ between four and five o’clock, he would immediately get back to work, sustaining himself on biscuits, peasant bread, honey (sent from Naumburg), fruit and pots of tea he brewed for himself in the little upstairs ‘dining-room’ next to his bedroom, until, worn out, he snuffed out the candle and went to bed around 11 p.m.[3]

Nietzsche sometimes ate over six pounds of fruit a day, according to the innkeeper.[4]

Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) played the flute every evening, but that’s hardly an obsession.[5] Although Schopenhauer was one of the young Nietzsche’s heroes, in later life he found Schopenhauer’s appreciation of the flute cause for suspicion:

Schopenhauer, although a pessimist, actually - played the flute . . . Every day, after his meal: just read his biographer on this point. And here's an incidental question: a pessimist, a man who denies God and the world - who halts before morality and blows his flute, to the laede-neminem [hurt no one] morality - How’s that? Is that essentially - a pessimist? (Beyond Good and Evil §186.)

Perhaps more obsessively, Schopenhauer owned a string of poodles throughout much of his life and named each one of them Atma, the Sanskrit word for “soul.”[6]

Schopenhauer’s bête noire, G.W.F. Hegel (1770–1831), found it difficult to write unless wearing over his clothes an ancient sleeping gown, together with a large black beret.[7]

We’ll end with the father of modern philosophy, René Descartes (1596–1650), who went about (ironically enough) incognito. Ego visibilis, ergo abscondam. He also changed residences often and generally kept his whereabouts secret. He adopted these habits, according to A.C. Grayling, “after a private audience with the notorious Cardinal Berulle – then one of the leading figures in French politics – [whereupon he] decided to go into permanent, and apparently self-imposed, exile in the United Provinces.”[8] The reason?

The standard explanation of this is that he desired privacy and seclusion for his philosophical work, and chose the United Provinces because he found the climate, both meteorological and social, congenial for it. Some add or substitute the idea that he wished to keep hidden from his family, which disapproved of his choice of career.

My suggestion is rather different. It is that Descartes was a spy. More circumstantially put, my suggestion is that he was in some way engaged in intelligence activities or secret work during the period of his military service and travels. Because of this, I further suggest, Cardinal Berulle warned him that he was no longer welcome in France.[9]

Descartes’s nocturnal ways were the opposite of Kant’s and Nietzsche’s: he snoozed a good 12 hours a night. But when he moved to Stockholm to tutor Queen Christina, she insisted on morning lessons. Descartes was dead within the year – possibly due to sleep deprivation.[10] [11]

Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.
Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

Daniel Šlechta,Updated 3y,Who are the most underrated philosophers/thinkers of the last century?,"In my personal opinion?

ALBERT CAMUS

Camus was a 20th century French-Algerian philosopher. Although he personally rejected being labeled as such, Camus was and still often is called an existentialist philosopher. As such, he is commonly overshadowed by the ‘bigger’ names of existentialism like Sartre, Nietzsche or Kiekegaard.

In the opening words of one of his most notable works, The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus writes:

There is only one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.

Camus argues that as soon as we really start thinking about things, many of us come to realize that life has no meaning, that we live in a cold, indifferent universe, forever doomed to seek meaning where there is none.
In Camu’s perspective life consists of two irreconcilable parts - the human tendency to look for meaning in life and the universe’s utter indifference to our existence.

Camus presents us with three ways people can cope with the realization of this dillemma:

Physical suicide
For Camus, this was the easy and intuitive, yet wrong way out. This isn’t a good option, because it doesn’t seek to reconcile our existence and need for meaning with the lack of meaning in the universe.
For Camus, physical suicide is an intuitive escape but doesn’t actually solve the problem, it only removes one of the components - the ‘human existence’ - out of the dilemma.
Philosophical suicide
People who commit philosophical suicide evade the dillemma by ignoring the meaninglessness of our existence and instead embrace something (usually a belief system like religion) that creates that meaning for them.
This is where Camus differs from most existentialists who would argue that creating your own meaning in a meaningless universe is a great idea. Instead, Camus argues that constructing meaning doesn’t change the reality of our absurd and pointless existence and that in fact such beliefs can be the source of our suffering - sooner or later we start realizing logical or other problems with those beliefs, which causes existential struggles.
It also doesn’t actually solve the dilemma, it - like physical suicide - only seeks to remove on of its components, in this case the meaninglessness of our existence.
Embracing the absurd
Instead either of the suicides, Camus argues that we must accept the absurdity of our existence. However, it’s an acceptance without resignation. By embracing the absurdity of our existence we can live our lives the best way we can. We no longer have to be reaching for meaning and be frustrated by finding none. We no longer have to be frustrated by unfulfilled hopes or belief-based fears, we don’t have to believe in anything more than what this absurd life provides.
Camus tells us that we shouldn’t reject our existential crisis by either destroying our existence or pretending there is no reason to feel anxious by embracing a reassuring belief system.

Toni Kannisto,Updated 6y,"Who can describe the overarching philosophies of (some of) the major philosophers, in a few sentences per philosopher?","Uh, yeah, ok, I’ll bite. This is going to be tough.

I’ll use, in chronological order, with some minor alterations, the philosophers that I have mentioned in this first part of this answer: Toni Kannisto's answer to I want to read the works of great philosophers. In what order should I read them?

To rise above, as it were, or plunge beneath as it may be, mere summaries of the first paragraphs of respective Wikipedia pages, I have taken the liberty to infuse my characterisations with some personal perspective in order to bring out what I find uplifting, profound, touching, and beautiful in each of the thinkers.

Parmenides

Everything is one, an all-encompassing unmoving unity. Nothing changes, for everything is always what it is, was, and will ever be. Motion is mere illusion of our senses, veiling our eyes to the hidden truth. Only through the light of reason can the veil be pierced and the immutable truth disclosed.

Heraclitus

Everything finds itself in an eternal flux, in the ever elusive move from x to not-x, between the tick and the tock. Nothing is the same now as it was, and never will it be the same again. The only constant is change. I am not, yet in the eternal process of becoming, I am.

Plato

The world of senses is nothing but a cheap imitation, a warped image of the true world of the ideas. Thwarted and dispersed by the imperfections of the material world, the light of the ideas becomes distorted and throws shadows. By turning inwards to the eternal truths laying dormant deep within us, reason can guide us past the illusions of darkness back to the luminous perfection of their source: to everything that is Beautiful, True, and Good.

Aristotle

The sensitive soul fastens us to the world and anchors the naïve flight of rational fancy. The rational soul, brought into the service of knowledge, orders the chaos of the senses by disclosing the universal and eternal forms that exist in all matter. Like for every being, the purpose of human existence is to actualise the potential inherent in its nature. Our potential for good life is actualised in the harmony of happiness and the good, and achieved by the virtuous when guided by wisdom. Political animals by nature, humans can only reach their full potential as members of a community.

St. Thomas Aquinas

Human reason is incapable of gaining insight into divine Wisdom. Though it may reveal to us many a thing in nature, and bring us earthly happiness if not moral perfection, even in its greatest exertion our reason can at best testify the mere existence of the Supreme Being. Through humility, we can beseech the Creator to bestow upon us a fraction of His infinite wisdom and so grant us insight into Truth and elevate us to His grace.

René Descartes

Knowledge without certainty is but a pretender. By stripping ourselves from all pretensions of knowledge, and by turning the light of our reason back towards ourselves, through doubt itself we can lay down the foundations: the clear and distinct idea that I think, therefore I am. By the grace of the benevolent God we can trust our senses, and so rejoin the external world. I, as a thinking being, am eternal, thinking, simple, unified, incorruptible, and hence immortal; I, as an embodied, extended being, am transitory, compound plurality of matter, corruptible, and hence mortal.

David Hume

Experience is the one and true guide to reality: that is real what we can touch, smell, taste, see, and hear. Throw away idle metaphysical speculations, the illusion of grandeur that plagues the reason of men when unchecked by the senses. We perceive no connection, no unity; so embrace the only truth known to us: the world consists only of sequences of events and we ourselves are but bundles of ideas. Cast aside the false imperatives of morality, for all there is, is nature, and you can sooner squeeze water from a stone than infer an ought from an is.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

Each mind is a self-sufficient, eternal, incorruptible, and unextended substance – a monad. The Wise Creator has set everything in motion: in a pre-established harmony every event moves to the next, like the machinery in a watch. Every alteration reflected perfectly in the opaque mirror surface of an infinity of monads. Turn inward, then, o infinitesimal creation of Infinity, for in this best of possible worlds, by the divine logic of your reason, every truth shall be laid bare!

Benedictus de Spinoza

In the all-encompassing infinity of God, we are at home: cause is reason, matter is mind, singularity is plurality, death is birth, change is constancy. Each but an aspect of the infinite facets of the Perfect Being. Our reason guides us to disclose the remotest secrets of nature and our most intimate core. The power of our will, a sliver of God’s might made manifest, together with the divine wisdom in which we partake, carve us a path to self-understanding, freedom, happiness, and the good. God is nature; nature is God – God is me, I am God.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Nature does not corrupt Man; it is Man who corrupts the nature in himself. Enlightenment has hitherto merely darkened what is primitive and authentic in Man, chaining him with fear and cruelty, robbing him of his original freedom. Yet, what reason has lowered, it can elevate once more: For through the voice of duty, justice towers over instinct, and so an ennobled Man rises to take the place of a primitive animal. Only by signing the social contract, by subjecting himself to the sovereignty of the general will, does Man reclaim his freedom.

Immanuel Kant

The manifest world is a synthesis of what is given by the senses and how it is ordered by the mind. Our island of truth in the stormy ocean of illusion: we know only what lies within its shores, yet have no claim on the seas. While the wings of reason liberate us from the dominion of gravity, if deprived of the resistance of the senses, the wings gain no traction – their pitiful flapping in the vacuum but a semblance of flight. Only in pure will can reason soar free and discover in itself the ground of all that is good and evil. We must hold fast in our faith that the harmony of rational virtue and bodily happiness will one day grant us respite from the struggles of men.

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel

Our journey to self-understanding is the world’s journey to self-realisation. A thesis rises, and an anti-thesis to meet it,* and it is in their synthesis that they are both elevated, united, and their opposition overcome – only to give birth to the next dichotomy. Through this dialectical dance of the opposites, the spirit, manifest subjectively in the mind and objectively in the world, reaches towards the absolute, the all-encompassing harmonious unity of everything that was sundered by the original separation of being and non-being.

Søren Kierkegaard

I am Paradox: desire pitted against duty, aesthetics against ethics, knowledge against faith, subject against object. Subjectivity is truth – the object: but a mirage, luring the thirsty ever deeper into the desert. To understand is to know, but to live is to believe – and so life admits of no understanding. Behind me, the wasteland of facts, the fruitless circularity of knowledge; before me, the void of the unknown. The terror and the hope. I know not what awaits beyond the precipice, and yet, eyes wide open, I must leap.

Friedrich Nietzsche

I am Destiny – Man, unchained. I bow to no authority, succumb to no will, sacrifice no desire on the altar of truth. I stand fast before the long twilight of God’s demise, for through the power of my will, I shall overcome the night, and a new world, in my image, will dawn. I am the destroyer of everything that would hold me down, define me, base me, and neuter me, the death of the slave and the rebirth of the master, for I am become Me.

Ludwig Wittgenstein

With the unyielding precision of logic, the world of facts is laid bare. Yet in this objectifying coercion of our language, the world is deprived of value and beauty. What is, can be said, and can be said logically; what ought to be, can only be revealed in the mystical, and must be passed over in silence. Language is a bridge over the impassable gulf between transcendent subjects separated beyond space and time. Yet it is just a game where the hidden rationality reveals itself only through the objective logic of its moves. What may or may not lie beyond the game, that is the inexpressible.

Martin Heidegger

Human existence, Dasein, is defined by temporality, thrown as we are into the ever elusive now between birth and death. It is through our primordial being unto death and fear of it that we care: engage with the world as primarily active beings. In the ever spinning hermeneutical circle of self-turned-to-self we must seek authenticity, the recognition of and responsibility for the bare fact: that we find ourselves always already within the horizons of possibility that we ourselves have drawn. Only by this self-reflective process can the hidden truth of being become unhidden.

This is going to be tough.\n\nI’ll use, in chronological order, with some minor alterations, the philosophers that I have mentioned in this first part of this answer: Toni Kannisto's answer to I want to read the works of great philosophers. In what order should I read them?\n\nTo rise above, as it were, or plunge beneath as it may be, mere summaries of the first paragraphs of respective Wikipedia pages, I have taken the liberty to infuse my characterisations with some personal perspective in order to bring out what I find uplifting, profound, touching, and beautiful in each of the thinkers.\n\nParmenides\n\nEverything is one, an all-encompassing unmoving unity. Nothing changes, for everything is always what it is, was, and will ever be. Motion is mere illusion of our senses, veiling our eyes to the hidden truth. Only through the light of reason can the veil be pierced and the immutable truth disclosed.\n\nHeraclitus\n\nEverything finds itself in an eternal flux, in the ever elusive move from x to not-x, between the tick and the tock. Nothing is the same now as it was, and never will it be the same again. The only constant is change. I am not, yet in the eternal process of becoming, I am.\n\nPlato\n\nThe world of senses is nothing but a cheap imitation, a warped image of the true world of the ideas. Thwarted and dispersed by the imperfections of the material world, the light of the ideas becomes distorted and throws shadows. By turning inwards to the eternal truths laying dormant deep within us, reason can guide us past the illusions of darkness back to the luminous perfection of their source: to everything that is Beautiful, True, and Good.\n\nAristotle\n\nThe sensitive soul fastens us to the world and anchors the naïve flight of rational fancy. The rational soul, brought into the service of knowledge, orders the chaos of the senses by disclosing the universal and eternal forms that exist in all matter. Like for every being, the purpose of human existence is to actualise the potential inherent in its nature. Our potential for good life is actualised in the harmony of happiness and the good, and achieved by the virtuous when guided by wisdom. Political animals by nature, humans can only reach their full potential as members of a community.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas\n\nHuman reason is incapable of gaining insight into divine Wisdom. Though it may reveal to us many a thing in nature, and bring us earthly happiness if not moral perfection, even in its greatest exertion our reason can at best testify the mere existence of the Supreme Being. Through humility, we can beseech the Creator to bestow upon us a fraction of His infinite wisdom and so grant us insight into Truth and elevate us to His grace.\n\nRené Descartes\n\nKnowledge without certainty is but a pretender. By stripping ourselves from all pretensions of knowledge, and by turning the light of our reason back towards ourselves, through doubt itself we can lay down the foundations: the clear and distinct idea that I think, therefore I am. By the grace of the benevolent God we can trust our senses, and so rejoin the external world. I, as a thinking being, am eternal, thinking, simple, unified, incorruptible, and hence immortal; I, as an embodied, extended being, am transitory, compound plurality of matter, corruptible, and hence mortal.\n\nDavid Hume\n\nExperience is the one and true guide to reality: that is real what we can touch, smell, taste, see, and hear. Throw away idle metaphysical speculations, the illusion of grandeur that plagues the reason of men when unchecked by the senses. We perceive no connection, no unity; so embrace the only truth known to us: the world consists only of sequences of events and we ourselves are but bundles of ideas. Cast aside the false imperatives of morality, for all there is, is nature, and you can sooner squeeze water from a stone than infer an ought from an is.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n\nEach mind is a self-sufficient, eternal, incorruptible, and unextended substance – a monad. The Wise Creator has set everything in motion: in a pre-established harmony every event moves to the next, like the machinery in a watch. Every alteration reflected perfectly in the opaque mirror surface of an infinity of monads. Turn inward, then, o infinitesimal creation of Infinity, for in this best of possible worlds, by the divine logic of your reason, every truth shall be laid bare!\n\nBenedictus de Spinoza\n\nIn the all-encompassing infinity of God, we are at home: cause is reason, matter is mind, singularity is plurality, death is birth, change is constancy. Each but an aspect of the infinite facets of the Perfect Being. Our reason guides us to disclose the remotest secrets of nature and our most intimate core. The power of our will, a sliver of God’s might made manifest, together with the divine wisdom in which we partake, carve us a path to self-understanding, freedom, happiness, and the good. God is nature; nature is God – God is me, I am God.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau\n\nNature does not corrupt Man; it is Man who corrupts the nature in himself. Enlightenment has hitherto merely darkened what is primitive and authentic in Man, chaining him with fear and cruelty, robbing him of his original freedom. Yet, what reason has lowered, it can elevate once more: For through the voice of duty, justice towers over instinct, and so an ennobled Man rises to take the place of a primitive animal. Only by signing the social contract, by subjecting himself to the sovereignty of the general will, does Man reclaim his freedom.\n\nImmanuel Kant\n\nThe manifest world is a synthesis of what is given by the senses and how it is ordered by the mind. Our island of truth in the stormy ocean of illusion: we know only what lies within its shores, yet have no claim on the seas. While the wings of reason liberate us from the dominion of gravity, if deprived of the resistance of the senses, the wings gain no traction – their pitiful flapping in the vacuum but a semblance of flight. Only in pure will can reason soar free and discover in itself the ground of all that is good and evil. We must hold fast in our faith that the harmony of rational virtue and bodily happiness will one day grant us respite from the struggles of men.\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\n\nOur journey to self-understanding is the world’s journey to self-realisation. A thesis rises, and an anti-thesis to meet it,* and it is in their synthesis that they are both elevated, united, and their opposition overcome – only to give birth to the next dichotomy. Through this dialectical dance of the opposites, the spirit, manifest subjectively in the mind and objectively in the world, reaches towards the absolute, the all-encompassing harmonious unity of everything that was sundered by the original separation of being and non-being.\n\nSøren Kierkegaard\n\nI am Paradox: desire pitted against duty, aesthetics against ethics, knowledge against faith, subject against object. Subjectivity is truth – the object: but a mirage, luring the thirsty ever deeper into the desert. To understand is to know, but to live is to believe – and so life admits of no understanding. Behind me, the wasteland of facts, the fruitless circularity of knowledge; before me, the void of the unknown. The terror and the hope. I know not what awaits beyond the precipice, and yet, eyes wide open, I must leap.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n\nI am Destiny – Man, unchained. I bow to no authority, succumb to no will, sacrifice no desire on the altar of truth. I stand fast before the long twilight of God’s demise, for through the power of my will, I shall overcome the night, and a new world, in my image, will dawn. I am the destroyer of everything that would hold me down, define me, base me, and neuter me, the death of the slave and the rebirth of the master, for I am become Me.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein\n\nWith the unyielding precision of logic, the world of facts is laid bare. Yet in this objectifying coercion of our language, the world is deprived of value and beauty. What is, can be said, and can be said logically; what ought to be, can only be revealed in the mystical, and must be passed over in silence. Language is a bridge over the impassable gulf between transcendent subjects separated beyond space and time. Yet it is just a game where the hidden rationality reveals itself only through the objective logic of its moves. What may or may not lie beyond the game, that is the inexpressible.\n\nMartin Heidegger\n\nHuman existence, Dasein, is defined by temporality, thrown as we are into the ever elusive now between birth and death. It is through our primordial being unto death and fear of it that we care: engage with the world as primarily active beings. In the ever spinning hermeneutical circle of self-turned-to-self we must seek authenticity, the recognition of and responsibility for the bare fact: that we find ourselves always already within the horizons of possibility that we ourselves have drawn. Only by this self-reflective process can the hidden truth of being become unhidden.\n\nNotes\n\n[*] Hegel knows only one thing: it is time for the Jedi to end. Sorry. I had to.

Benjamin Murphy,4y,What do analytic philosophers generally think about Hegel?,"When I was an undergraduate in Oxford, an interest in continental philosophy was viewed with suspicion. I told my tutor at Pembroke that I wanted to study Heidegger and Nietzsche. He found a tutor to teach me that paper, but evidently regarded this as an eccentric choice on my part. I did make some attempt to understand Hegel in my own time. Reading Hegel’s works was no help, so I tried Walter Kauffman’s Hegel: A Reinterpretation, hoping that this would provide me with enough understanding to read Hegel’s works for myself. It didn’t. Kauffman was great at telling me what Hegel didn’t mean, but not what he did say. After that, to be honest, I gave up. After all, I’d made a serious attempt to get to grips with two important continental philosophers. It was obvious that a knowledge of Hegel was considered optional by analytical philosophers. And the intense study of analytical philosophy turned out to be very rewarding.

But that same tutor who mocked my interest in Heidegger and Nietzsche also required us to read work by McDowell and Sellars. I came to realize that McDowell and Sellars were both strongly influenced by Hegel - both of them mention this. A couple of years after finishing my D.Phil. I attended a conference in Cape Town where the main speaker was John McDowell, and that’s when I realized the importance of studying the work of Robert Brandom. (Sellars, McDowell and Brandom are frequently described as the “Pittsburgh School”). Brandom’s work was obviously directly relevant to what I was doing. Making It Explicit is an important contribution to analytical philosophy, one that I should really have read much earlier. Brandom, like Sellars and McDowell, pays tribute to the influence of Hegel.

These tributes to Hegel told me that Hegel must have said something important, but didn’t tell me exactly what. (McDowell basically says “If you’ve read Hegel, you’ll see how strongly I’m influenced by him at every point.” Fine. But if I’ve not read Hegel, that isn’t much help).

So when Robert Brandom published A Spirit of Trust in May 2019, I was naturally very excited. For forty years, Brandom has been teaching a class on Hegel’s Phenomenology of the Spirit at Pittsburgh. Now, at last, there’s an opportunity to find out why Sellars, McDowell and Brandom found Hegel to be so inspirational.

So, I purchased A Spirit of Trust. It was completely engrossing. Forget about Fire and Blood, for me, 2019 is the year of A Spirit of Trust. Brandom reveals that analytical philosophers have been following slowly in Hegel’s footsteps all along.

I still find Hegel’s prose obscure, and of course I’m not in a position to say that Brandom gives the correct interpretation of Hegel. But I think he establishes that it is worthy trying to find out what Hegel is saying - not just because I want to fill in a gap in my historical knowledge, but because I can see why it is worthwhile learning to think like Hegel (but not to write like Hegel).

I don’t think I’m alone in this. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that in twenty years time, we’ll be saying “2019 is the year when analytical philosophers in general began to think very hard about Hegel.

Ian O'Grady,Nov 30,Who is your favourite ancient philosopher and why?,"Diogenes was a true representation of “Cynicism.” A man who felt no need for material things, and always found ways to simplify his life, His only possession being a wooden bowl that he discarded after he witnessed a peasant boy use his hands to drink water from a puddle.

When Diogenes was caught playing with himself in public, he said: “He only wished it was as easy to get rid of hunger by rubbing his stomach.

When he was exiled for defacing coins in his home town of Sinope, a coastal town in modern-day Turkey, he turned to his peers and told them: “I sentence you to remain in your city.”

While Diogenes was exiled to Athens, a member of the upper-class began throwing stones at him and called him a dog. In true cynical fashion, he pissed on the man’s leg, and when the upper-class man got angry he responded: “If I were a dog, why are you surprised?”

When Diogenes was asked why he was begging a statue for money, he said: “It’s to gain practice in rejection.”

When Plato defined humans as the only featherless biped, Diogenes walked into Plato’s lecture with a plucked chicken and declared: “ Behold, a man.”

When he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery, the auctioneer asked what jobs he was good at, and his response was: “Being a master.”

When Alexander the Great went to meet the cynic, he approached and asked him if there was anything he could do for him, to which he replied: “Yes, can you stand out of my sunlight?” Alexander was so impressed by the philosopher he told his friends: “If I were not Alexander, I’d want to be him.”

Benjamin Murphy,3y,What separates great philosophers like Descartes from wannabe “philosophers”? What makes them great and is there a modern day equivalent to a philosophy superstar?,"There are two kinds of philosophical superstar today. There are those who have won a large popular audience by presenting ideas that resonate with many people in a way that the public can understand - Sam Harris, for example. There are those whose work has been influential within the academy, who are sought after to speak at academic conferences, and who would be offered a job in any department in the world - Bob Hale would be an example. There are some figures who have managed to be academic superstars and also shown that they are capable of reaching a broader audience - Bertrand Russell is the most obvious example, one might also add Daniel Dennett and Jerry Fodor.

But will any of these be remembered centuries from now in the way that Descartes is? That’s hard to say.

People today study Descartes not because of what he got right, but because of what he got wrong. He’s seen as an important philosopher to understand because of the mistakes he made. That’s not quite a universal opinion, as I well know - my graduate work was supervised by one of the few defenders of Cartesian dualism - but the number of philosophers who agree with Descartes are tiny when compared with the number who read (at least some of) his works, teach classes about him and write books about him.

Descartes is a significant figure because he was an active participant in the modern scientific revolution, and he attempted to formulate explicitly the method that had opened up new intellectual horizons. He attempted to do so in a way that, he hoped, would require no knowledge of previous philosophy, starting off from a clean sheet. Subsequent philosophers (for example Leibniz, Locke and Spinoza) who wanted to delineate the limits of human knowledge could do so by reacting to Descartes, pointing out his errors and contrasting their ideas to his. This means that if you are trying to introduce students to early modern philosophy, Descartes’ works are a great place to begin. You can read The Meditations in a day, and while you would be unlikely to come away with a complete understanding, the chances are that you’d have a pretty good grasp of the main ideas. A. J. Ayer said of his own early work, Language, Truth and Logic, that its success was not entirely due to its virtues. Indeed, its huge success may be due in part to its flaws: when he wrote it, Ayer really believed that a few simple ideas could solve all the problems of philosophy. It wasn’t Ayer’s best book, it wasn’t original, and it isn’t the best presentation of the case for logical positivism, yet it did become a classic. It turned out to be the right book in the right time.

Now, I know what I have to do if I aspire to be a star in the way that Bob Hale is a star: immerse myself in technical philosophy, apply myself to interesting and unresolved problems, approach them rigorously and work out a theory in detail. I know what I have to do if I want to be a star in the way that Sam Harris is a star: take on a problem that the general public is really concerned with, don’t be afraid of controversy, express myself clearly without resorting to technical jargon. I’m not saying I would succeed, but I would know how to try.

But if I were to try to achieve the kind of success of Descartes’ Meditations, or, in a lesser way, of Language, Truth and Logic, I wouldn’t know where to begin. I’d have to be lucky in my choice of subject matter, become an expert in a field that would remain relevant for a long time, and I’d have to make mistakes that would turn out to be interesting mistakes. How do you try to be lucky?

I’m not a mathematician, but I have read Simon Singh’s excellent book about Fermat’s Last Theorem, in which he describes the important partnership between Shimura and Taniyama. After Taniyama’s tragic suicide, Shimura said of him:

He was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to imitate him. But I've realized that it's very difficult to make good mistakes.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/metfzng1ub3jdqy7', 'title': 'What separates great philosophers like Descartes from wannabe “philosophers”?

Staroslav,Updated 4y,"What did the great philosophers do for a living (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc.)?","What did the great philosophers do for a living (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc.)?

Okay, this will be an incomplete list, for obvious reasons. Also, while I could start with Thales, I will go the more traditional route (simply to whittle down the number) and start with Socrates. Finally, I’ll speak of “Western” philosophers, leaving the other traditions to those more able to provide a good account.

Socrates was a mercenary, and (if memory serves) a bricklayer. His father was a stonemason.

Plato didn’t do anything for a living, as he was a trust fund kid. Born into one of the oldest and most noble families of Athens (his ancestors were kings, but by his time Athens were no longer a monarchy), Plato was born with a silver spoon and even more expensive items to his name.

Diogenes of Sinope was a bum. No, really. The greatest philosopher of the Cynic school (founded by his teacher Antisthenes), Diogenes rejected material possessions and lived on what he could get from his fellow Corinthians. It is said that he owned only his clothes, his walking stick and a cup. When he one day saw a child drink from the stream by the aid of his hands, Diogenes was furious that a child should best him in the smiplicity of living, and threw his cup away.

Aristotle was a kept man. His father was the royal physician to the king of Macedon. After Aristotle’s parents died when he was 13 years old, he was raised by his sister’s husband Proxenus, who educated him for a while, and then sent him to Plato’s Academy. There, we can expect he was provided for by Plato’s vast wealth. Approximately 20 years later he left the Academy (at around the time of Plato’s death, though scholars disagree as to the exact date and reason), and went with Xenocrates (another Academic) to the court of Xeno’s friend Hermias. After the death of Hermias he left for the island of Lesbos and within a couple of years was invited to the court of Phillip II of Macedon. He remained there for most of his remaining years.

Zeno of Citium was a wealthy merchant, who founded the Stoic school of philosophy and thus lived an ascetic life in spite of his wealth.

Seneca the Younger was another Stoic and born into the equitarian class (knights, essentially lesser nobles that were often loaded and thus didn’t have to work). He managed to become a senator in Rome, which means he partook in the cursus honorum, holding several public offices over time.

Marcus Aurelius was perhaps the greatest of Stoic philosophers, and the emperor of Rome.

Augustine of Hippo became, after he concluded his schooling, a teacher of grammar and rhetoric. More than a decade later, at the age of 31, Augustine converted to Christianity and became a priest and later Bishop.

Roger Bacon was a Franciscan friar.

Thomas Aquinas was a Dominican friar and priest of the Catholic church.

William of Ockham was a Franciscan friar.

Sir Thomas More was a lawyer and politician (Member of Parliament; undersheriff; secretary and adviser to king Henry VIII).

René Descartes spent some time as a mercenary, and ended his life as a kept man at the court of queen Christina of Sweden.

Thomas Hobbes was a tutor to children of nobility and royalty.

Baruch Spinoza was an optical lens grinder.

John Locke was a physician.

Isaac Newton was a fellow at Trinity college, the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, and Master of the Royal Mint.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz started his career as a secretary to an alchemical society in Nuremberg. Then he got involved in politics (of France) and spent time being attached to people of lesser of greater nobility. In 1677, he became the Privy Counselor of Justice. He served three consecutive rulers of the House of Brunswick as advisor and whatnot.

George Berkeley was a priest and Bishop.

David Hume was, strangely, of noble descent, but as broke as a church mouse. To deal with the fact of being an impoverished noble, he took a job as a merchant’s assistant. He became a writer and librarian at the University of Edinburgh; after his aspirations to become a professor were dashed by accusations of atheism. He also spent some time as a tutor and assistant to nobility.

Immanuel Kant spent his entire career at the University of Königsberg (for that matter, it is said he spent his entire life never leaving his hometown).

Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and plantations.

Jeremy Bentham was born to wealthy Tory supporters. He was trained as a lawyer and called to the bar, but he never practiced.

Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller joined the military and became the regimental doctor at Stuttgart. He didn’t like the job, so he effectively deserted.

Johann Gottlieb Fichte got his first job as a tutor in the house of a noble in Warsaw. He didn’t like it and was quickly released. Later on he became a professor at the University of Jena, and eventually at the University of Berlin.

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a tutor to nobility and a university professor.

Arthur Schopenhauer was another university professor (he intentionally held lectures at the same time his archenemy Hegel held his lectures, and was then salty when no one showed up). He was also quite the playboy, so it is possible he got some sexgild that way. Or not.

Max Stirner obtained a teaching certificate in Berlin, but couldn’t get a teaching job at first. Later he worked at a school for young girls, but resigned in October 1844 in anticipation of controversy following the publication of his magnum opus The Ego and Its Own.

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon the one time mentor of Karl Marx, was a printer (he taught himself Latin to become better at printing Latin texts). Later he became a member of the French parliament (after the revolution of 1848).

Mikhail Bakunin was born to a noble Russian family, that owned 500 serfs. He planned on becoming a professor of philosophy or history, but gave up that ambition as he became more and more involved in political activism. He was a member of the First International with Marx; who tried to get rid of Bakunin and only succeeded in 1872 when he called the Hague congress at such a time as to ensure that Bakunin would be unable to attend, and went to great lengths to prevent Bakunin’s fellow anarchists (mostly members of the Jura federation) from attending the congress.

Karl Marx was the son of a lawyer, who lived in relative wealth, owning several vineyards. Karl went on to marry Jenny von Westphalen, a baroness of the Prussian ruling class. This caused some controversy, as Marx was middle class and should not be able to marry into aristocracy. In 1842 he became a journalist, writing for a newspaper. Later he became the co-editor of another newspaper. Later he was exiled for his political agitation and moved around, finally settling in London. There his family went through a period of extreme poverty, with their only source of income being Engels (whose source was his wealthy industrialist father), because Marx spent all his time engaged in activism. From 1852 to 1862 his principle earnings came from his contributions to New-York Daily Tribune.

The Anarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin was born into a wealthy family (he worked as a page for Tsar Alexander II, who reportedly considered him his favourite cousin), where he was raised mostly by serfs. As a result, Kropotkin was greatly pleased when the Tsar decided to emancipate the serfs in 1861. Nonetheless, the work at court disillusioned Kropotkin, and he gave up his title of Prince at age 16 and became an anarchist. In 1872 he became a member of the First International, but quickly decided he didn’t like their style of socialism and decided to study the more radical programme of the Jura federation. When he returned to Russia he joined the Circle of Tchaikovsky; renouncing the actions of Sergey Nechayev. As a result of his participation in the revolutionary activity, Kropotkin was arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress in 1872. Because of his aristocratic background he was allowed to continue his work in geography, delivering a report in 1876 on his findings that the Ice Age didn’t happen as distantly in the past as previously believed. In the same year he escaped, when he was moved to minimal security prison just before his trial. He celebrated the escape with his friends in one of the finest restaurants in St. Petersburg, assuming the police wouldn’t look for him there; before boarding a boat to England. From there he went to the Jura federation in Switzerland, moving to Paris in 1877, and returning to the Jura mountains in 1878. All the time he continued working in the fields of geography and biology (his greatest contribution to biology is the work Mutual Aid - A Factor of Evolution), as well as his political activism. Anarchists, socialists and communists have never doubted his status as a member of the working class, for even though his work was mostly intellectual, not physical, he worked as hard as anyone.

Sergey Nechayev was born to a waiter. His mother died when he was 8 years old. At age 18 he moved to Moscow, where he found work as a historian’s assistant. A year later he moved to St. Petersburg, passed a teaching exam and started to work at a school. He became acquainted with the Petrashevsky Circle and Mikhail Bakunin, with whom he would later develop what might have been the deepest and most important friendship of Nechayev’s life. In 1869 he fled to Switzerland, after spreading rumours of his arrest. That same year he wrote his Catechism of a Revolutionist, his most important work. In 1874 he was arrested in Switzerland and handed to Russian authorities, where he was sentenced to 20 years of hard labour. He won over the affections of his guards with his zeal and conviction, and was planning his escape through correspondence they allowed him to maintain with Narodnaya Volya; but he abandoned tha plans, as he though they would get in the way of the revolutionary organisation’s plans to assassinate Tsar Alexander II. He died in 1882 in his cell.

Friedrich Nietzsche became a professor of Classical Philology at the University of Basel at the age of 24. A decade later he had to retire on account of health issues and lived of a small stipend afforded to him by the university.

Edmund Husserl was a professor of philosophy.

Henri Bergson was a professor of philosophy.

Alfred North Whitehead was a professor of mathematics.

Emma Goldman was a nurse, who assisted young women with illegal abortions.

Rosa Luxemburg earned a Doctor of Law degree. She founded the newspaper Sprawa Robotnicza.

Martin Buber was a university professor.

Bertrand Russell was another professor.

Ernst Cassirer was a philosophy professor.

Ludwig Wittgenstein teacher, fellow at Cambridge, professor, gardener (during the summer of 1920).

Martin Heidegger professor of philosophy.

From here on the list of prominent philosophers becomes too extensive, especially considering the fact that the wast majority of these earn(ed) their living as university professors.

More than a decade later, at the age of 31, Augustine converted to Christianity and became a priest and later Bishop.\n\nRoger Bacon was a Franciscan friar.\n\nThomas Aquinas was a Dominican friar and priest of the Catholic church.\n\nWilliam of Ockham was a Franciscan friar.\n\nSir Thomas More was a lawyer and politician (Member of Parliament; undersheriff; secretary and adviser to king Henry VIII).\n\nRené Descartes spent some time as a mercenary, and ended his life as a kept man at the court of queen Christina of Sweden.\n\nThomas Hobbes was a tutor to children of nobility and royalty.\n\nBaruch Spinoza was an optical lens grinder.\n\nJohn Locke was a physician.\n\nIsaac Newton was a fellow at Trinity college, the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, and Master of the Royal Mint.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz started his career as a secretary to an alchemical society in Nuremberg. Then he got involved in politics (of France) and spent time being attached to people of lesser of greater nobility. In 1677, he became the Privy Counselor of Justice. He served three consecutive rulers of the House of Brunswick as advisor and whatnot.\n\nGeorge Berkeley was a priest and Bishop.\n\nDavid Hume was, strangely, of noble descent, but as broke as a church mouse. To deal with the fact of being an impoverished noble, he took a job as a merchant’s assistant. He became a writer and librarian at the University of Edinburgh; after his aspirations to become a professor were dashed by accusations of atheism. He also spent some time as a tutor and assistant to nobility.\n\nImmanuel Kant spent his entire career at the University of Königsberg (for that matter, it is said he spent his entire life never leaving his hometown).\n\nThomas Jefferson owned slaves and plantations.\n\nJeremy Bentham was born to wealthy Tory supporters. He was trained as a lawyer and called to the bar, but he never practiced.\n\nJohann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller joined the military and became the regimental doctor at Stuttgart. He didn’t like the job, so he effectively deserted.\n\nJohann Gottlieb Fichte got his first job as a tutor in the house of a noble in Warsaw. He didn’t like it and was quickly released. Later on he became a professor at the University of Jena, and eventually at the University of Berlin.\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a tutor to nobility and a university professor.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer was another university professor (he intentionally held lectures at the same time his archenemy Hegel held his lectures, and was then salty when no one showed up). He was also quite the playboy, so it is possible he got some sexgild that way. Or not.\n\nMax Stirner obtained a teaching certificate in Berlin, but couldn’t get a teaching job at first. Later he worked at a school for young girls, but resigned in October 1844 in anticipation of controversy following the publication of his magnum opus The Ego and Its Own.\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon the one time mentor of Karl Marx, was a printer (he taught himself Latin to become better at printing Latin texts). Later he became a member of the French parliament (after the revolution of 1848).\n\nMikhail Bakunin was born to a noble Russian family, that owned 500 serfs. He planned on becoming a professor of philosophy or history, but gave up that ambition as he became more and more involved in political activism. He was a member of the First International with Marx; who tried to get rid of Bakunin and only succeeded in 1872 when he called the Hague congress at such a time as to ensure that Bakunin would be unable to attend, and went to great lengths to prevent Bakunin’s fellow anarchists (mostly members of the Jura federation) from attending the congress.\n\nKarl Marx was the son of a lawyer, who lived in relative wealth, owning several vineyards. Karl went on to marry Jenny von Westphalen, a baroness of the Prussian ruling class. This caused some controversy, as Marx was middle class and should not be able to marry into aristocracy. In 1842 he became a journalist, writing for a newspaper. Later he became the co-editor of another newspaper. Later he was exiled for his political agitation and moved around, finally settling in London. There his family went through a period of extreme poverty, with their only source of income being Engels (whose source was his wealthy industrialist father), because Marx spent all his time engaged in activism. From 1852 to 1862 his principle earnings came from his contributions to New-York Daily Tribune.\n\nThe Anarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin was born into a wealthy family (he worked as a page for Tsar Alexander II, who reportedly considered him his favourite cousin), where he was raised mostly by serfs. As a result, Kropotkin was greatly pleased when the Tsar decided to emancipate the serfs in 1861. Nonetheless, the work at court disillusioned Kropotkin, and he gave up his title of Prince at age 16 and became an anarchist. In 1872 he became a member of the First International, but quickly decided he didn’t like their style of socialism and decided to study the more radical programme of the Jura federation. When he returned to Russia he joined the Circle of Tchaikovsky; renouncing the actions of Sergey Nechayev. As a result of his participation in the revolutionary activity, Kropotkin was arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress in 1872. Because of his aristocratic background he was allowed to continue his work in geography, delivering a report in 1876 on his findings that the Ice Age didn’t happen as distantly in the past as previously believed. In the same year he escaped, when he was moved to minimal security prison just before his trial. He celebrated the escape with his friends in one of the finest restaurants in St. Petersburg, assuming the police wouldn’t look for him there; before boarding a boat to England. From there he went to the Jura federation in Switzerland, moving to Paris in 1877, and returning to the Jura mountains in 1878. All the time he continued working in the fields of geography and biology (his greatest contribution to biology is the work Mutual Aid - A Factor of Evolution), as well as his political activism. Anarchists, socialists and communists have never doubted his status as a member of the working class, for even though his work was mostly intellectual, not physical, he worked as hard as anyone.\n\nSergey Nechayev was born to a waiter. His mother died when he was 8 years old. At age 18 he moved to Moscow, where he found work as a historian’s assistant. A year later he moved to St. Petersburg, passed a teaching exam and started to work at a school. He became acquainted with the Petrashevsky Circle and Mikhail Bakunin, with whom he would later develop what might have been the deepest and most important friendship of Nechayev’s life. In 1869 he fled to Switzerland, after spreading rumours of his arrest. That same year he wrote his Catechism of a Revolutionist, his most important work. In 1874 he was arrested in Switzerland and handed to Russian authorities, where he was sentenced to 20 years of hard labour. He won over the affections of his guards with his zeal and conviction, and was planning his escape through correspondence they allowed him to maintain with Narodnaya Volya; but he abandoned tha plans, as he though they would get in the way of the revolutionary organisation’s plans to assassinate Tsar Alexander II. He died in 1882 in his cell.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche became a professor of Classical Philology at the University of Basel at the age of 24. A decade later he had to retire on account of health issues and lived of a small stipend afforded to him by the university.\n\nEdmund Husserl was a professor of philosophy.\n\nHenri Bergson was a professor of philosophy.\n\nAlfred North Whitehead was a professor of mathematics.\n\nEmma Goldman was a nurse, who assisted young women with illegal abortions.\n\nRosa Luxemburg earned a Doctor of Law degree. She founded the newspaper Sprawa Robotnicza.\n\nMartin Buber was a university professor.\n\nBertrand Russell was another professor.\n\nErnst Cassirer was a philosophy professor.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein teacher, fellow at Cambridge, professor, gardener (during the summer of 1920).\n\nMartin Heidegger professor of philosophy.\n\nFrom here on the list of prominent philosophers becomes too extensive, especially considering the fact that the wast majority of these earn(ed) their living as university professors.\n\nHope this helps.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.82445
Ravishankar Nagarajan,Updated 4y,"Are people on Quora really as good in real life as they portray themselves on Quora, because everyone seems to be a philosopher here?","I'll share two incidents here:

Incident 1:

Months ago, I wrote an answer on my depressing daily routine.

A girl messages me to take care of myself.

I thank her and go through her profile to find out her answers to be very very mature, but her boyfriend left her and she was depressed as well.

So, I replied back saying she can reach out to me if she needs any moral support. We exchanged numbers.

On call, she lamented on how unfair was her ex to her, for 5 hours straight. But it looked like she had a good understanding on life.

When she was getting okay, she shared all her pictures and selfies to me, which was weird.

She asked me to send my pictures as well and I sent a few. She suggested the possible beard styles for my face.

Then out of nowhere she asked “How tall are you”?

When I was about to say my height, I could hear her murmuring “ Please be tall, Ravi, Please be tall”.

However, I told her that I was 5′8″.

She, inspite of being a mere 5′3″ was clearly disappointed with my height and said “Okay, will call you tomorrow”.

Next day, when I woke up, she had pinged me “Hey, I'm blocking you”.

There we go. I'm blocked for no reason and it's been several months.

It clearly looked like, she wanted some tall guy to be her boyfriend and pull her out of her misery.

When I didn't fit her bill, I was just pushed away.

Mature Quoran! BULL CRAP!

Incident 2:

Again , a few months ago, I exchanged numbers with a really popular quoran who was considered an expert in relationship answers.

Though not a person with malicious intent like the first one, this girl had severe inferiority complex and low self esteem.

Once we were comfortable talking to each other, she pinged me:

Her:How many people do you follow on Quora?

Me:Around 300+

Her: Just Unfollow every one of them. No one is that perfect to be followed.

Me:But I like their content. So I follow them. What's wrong?

Her: Just unfollow them. I will check your account in sometime. Your “Followers” list should be “0”.

Obviously, I didn't follow her instructions and we stopped talking to each other as we got busier with our own lives.

There were several such incidents where she was quite passive-agressive and it drove me crazy.

She was nothing like her Million views answers.

Mature Quoran? More of an unstable Quoran!

Lesson:

Just remember only to “Digest”the good content from Quora. Don't bother about who writes it and most importantly, do not be impressed by them.

Frederick Dolan,Updated 2y,What does Nietzsche mean when he talks of decadence?,"The short answer is that decadence, for Nietzsche, is being drawn to what is bad for you. A longer answer follows.

Acting effectively requires self-confidence, great passion to achieve one’s aim, and unity of purpose. To be very successful, and certainly to achieve anything truly great, all of one’s abilities and all aspects of one’s personality must be devoted to achieving one’s aim.

This requires self-mastery, by which Nietzsche means the ability to cultivate one’s drives, desires, and abilities in ways that maximize their contribution to one’s project. Self-mastery is not achieved by conscious deliberation alone; it is an “instinctive” ability to do what is good for you. Faced with a choice, one with self-mastery will identify the best course of action without needing to deliberate.

He guesses what remedies avail against what is harmful; he exploits bad accidents to his advantage; what does not kill him makes him stronger. He collects instinctively from everything he sees, hears, lives through; in sum: he is a principle of selection, he leaves much behind. He is always in his own company, whether he associates with books, human beings, or landscapes: he honors by choosing, by admitting, by trusting. (Ecce Homo, “Why I Am So Wise” §2.)

The decadent, on the other hand, chooses what is bad for him, again in a largely non-deliberative way. A decadent or “corrupt” person instinctively seeks out that which harms him.

I call an animal, a species, an individual corrupt when it loses its instincts, when it chooses, when it prefers things that will harm it. (The Antichrist §6.)

Decadents are disordered, self-deceiving, and impulsive, and they are also dismayed by these defects. Their attempts to remedy them, however, only make them worse. A decadent is drawn to overly simple solutions, which he makes appear plausible by oversimplifying his problems.

Socrates, for example – on Nietzsche’s account – suffered from poor impulse control, ambivalence, self-doubt, and alienation, and he dealt with these disabilities by over-developing his reason and treating his appetites as the enemy. By appointing reason the ultimate master, he made it impossible to achieve true self-mastery.

It is a self-deception on the part of philosophers and moralists if they believe that they are extricating themselves from decadence when they merely wage war against it. Extrication lies beyond their strength: what they choose as a means, as salvation, is itself but another expression of decadence; they change its expression, but they do not get rid of the decadence itself.

Socrates was a misunderstanding; the whole improvement-morality, including the Christian, was a misunderstanding. The most blinding daylight; rationality at any price; life, bright, cold, cautious, conscious, without instinct, in opposition to the instincts – all this too was mere disease, another disease, and by no means a return to “virtue,” to “health,” to “happiness.” To have to fight the instincts – that is the formula of decadence: as long as life is ascending, happiness equals instinct. (Twilight of the Idols, “The Problem of Socrates” §2.)

Signs of decadence include guilt: watch out for people who constantly find themselves doing things they don’t approve of. Take care around those who suffer from suffering: who not only can’t get what they want, but want not to want what they want.

Now, has the culture become decadent?

Nietzsche sometimes talks about decadent cultures or peoples in the more or less ordinary sense of the term: they have lost the discipline required to achieve their values, or have lost interest in the values themselves. Laws are not enforced, standards are lowered, difficult things are not attempted.

But Nietzsche also contrasts “healthy” and “sick” cultures. Healthy cultures acknowledge the value of competition, risk-taking, and even aggression and violence. These are ineradicable features of human nature, they go along with a robust love of life, and outlets must be provided for them.

A sick culture, on the other hand, is devoted to sapping people’s vitality and rendering them weak and infirm. This applied, Nietzsche thought, to the Victorian culture of his own day: people were made to feel guilty of the desire to stand out, and either inhibited themselves or tried to stand out by virtue-signaling and denouncing the selfishness of others.

Is our culture healthy, sick, or decadent? It strikes me as a chaotic bundle of all three. There are plenty of competitive strivers, and no lack of aggression. There are many who enjoy naming and shaming. And there’s sufficient lawlessness and incompetence to suggest that some have lost the courage of their convictions. None of these practices fits well with the others. Since chaos and disunity are the essence of decadence, perhaps that’s the best overall characterization.

Decadence in the ordinary sense of decline, Nietzsche thought, isn’t necessarily all bad. When a culture loses enthusiasm for its ideals, the drives, dispositions, and desires repressed by the declining regime of value begin to express themselves. New values are discovered or created. Periods of decadence can be a breeding ground for “free spirits.”

Since chaos and disunity are the essence of decadence, perhaps that’s the best overall characterization.\n\nDecadence in the ordinary sense of decline, Nietzsche thought, isn’t necessarily all bad. When a culture loses enthusiasm for its ideals, the drives, dispositions, and desires repressed by the declining regime of value begin to express themselves. New values are discovered or created. Periods of decadence can be a breeding ground for “free spirits.”\n\nBelow, Casey Childs, Youthful Decadence (2018).', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9765
Alex Johnston,2y,Was Nietzsche a bitter old man? Why should we listen to him?,"Nietzsche died at the age of 55, but he’d had a complete mental collapse at the age of 44 and had written nothing thereafter.

He was hardly ‘old’.

As far as ‘bitter’ is concerned, Nietzsche’s best and profoundest work stems from a deep sense of the joy of life, and the pleasure of thinking clearly. This is a guy who suffered from chronic ill-health, and yet who could write this (this is not a very good translation, but never mind):

The heaviest burden: “What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life must return to you, all in the same succession and sequence — even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again—and you with it, speck of dust!’ Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: ‘You are a god, and never have I heard anything more divine!’

If he seems bitter to other people, it’s only because he’s full of scorn for their point of view, and they haven’t yet learned that their point of view isn’t necessarily the only valid one, and they’re projecting their own bitterness and narrowness onto him.

I don’t always agree with Nietzsche, and sometimes I find him very annoying, but… “bitter”?

Eleftherios Tserkezis,4y,Who is the coolest philosopher in world history and why?,"Diogenes of Sinope, also known as Diogenes the Dog or Diogenes the Cynic (Gr. kunikos ‘doglike’).

Diogenes was born ca. 412 BC and died in 323 BC. He was born in the Greek city of Sinope on the south coasts of the Black Sea, but spent most of his life in mainland Greece (Athens and Corinth). Diogenes is considered one of the first and major Cynic philosophers. His philosophy revolved around the values of simplicity, frugality, natural life, contempt of authority and criticism of organized societies and lofty idealism like that of Plato.

But what makes Diogenes really cool is his personal life and attitude, as recorded by Diogenes Laërtius and other writers (his own works have all been lost). Acting in accordance with his ideas, Diogenes lived in a jar(!) and in the stories about him he comes up as provocative, ironic, witty, glib and sharp-tongued, a real thorn in the side of the smug and the powerful. For that and his other character traits, Plato called Diogenes “Socrates gone mad.” Some of the most cool and funny anecdotes about him are the following; they’re taken verbatim from Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius.

Diogenes and Alexander the Great

And now a general assembly of the Greeks was held at the Isthmus, where a vote was passed to make an expedition against Persia with Alexander, and he was proclaimed their leader. Thereupon many statesmen and philosophers came to him with their congratulations, and he expected that Diogenes of Sinope also, who was tarrying in Corinth, would do likewise.

But since that philosopher took not the slightest notice of Alexander, and continued to enjoy his leisure in the suburb Craneion, Alexander went in person to see him; and he found him lying in the sun. Diogenes raised himself up a little when he saw so many persons coming towards him, and fixed his eyes upon Alexander. And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, “Yes,” said Diogenes, “stand a little out of my sun.”

It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, “But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.”

Diogenes and Plato

Plato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, “Here is Plato’s man.”

Diogenes and his lamp

He lit a lamp in broad daylight and said, as he went about, “I am looking for a man.”

Diogenes as a slave

Further, when he was sold as a slave, he endured it most nobly. For on a voyage to Aegina he was captured by pirates under the command of Scirpalus, conveyed to Crete and exposed for sale. When the auctioneer asked in what he was proficient, he replied, “In ruling men.” Thereupon he pointed to a certain Corinthian with a fine purple border to his robe, the man named Xeniades above-mentioned, and said, “Sell me to this man; he needs a master.” Thus Xeniades came to buy him, and took him to Corinth and set him over his own children and entrusted his whole household to him. And he administered it in all respects in such a manner that Xeniades used to go about saying, “A good genius has entered my house.”

[…]

To Xeniades, who purchased him, he said, “Come, see that you obey orders.”

Diogenes and Perdiccas

Perdiccas having threatened to put him to death unless he came to him, “That’s nothing wonderful,” quoth he, “for a beetle or a tarantula would do the same.”

Diogenes and his countrymen

When some one reproached him with his exile, his reply was, “Nay, it was through that, you miserable fellow, that I came to be a philosopher.” Again, when some one reminded him that the people of Sinope had sentenced him to exile, “And I them,” said he, “to home-staying.”

Diogenes and his “indecency”

Behaving indecently [i.e. masturbating] in public, he wished “it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing the belly.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kvx6ifetn20wozgq', 'title': 'Who is the coolest philosopher in world history and why?', 'score': {'original': 0.514, 'ai': 0.486}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Diogenes of Sinope, also known as Diogenes the Dog or Diogenes the Cynic (Gr. kunikos ‘doglike’).\n\nDiogenes was born ca. 412 BC and died in 323 BC.

Brian Overland,1y,How was Socrates executed?,"Socrates was, in effect, ORDERED to drink Hemlock by the jury of Athenians. Now, this raises an obvious question that no-one ever touches: Couldn’t Socrates simply refuse?

And the answer is, of course he could. However, Plato’s audience would’ve understood the situation, namely: If Socrates had refused to drink the hemlock, he would’ve shortly faced one of several alternatives, which would’ve been carried out by the guard, along with members of the Athenian army if necessary. The alternatives include: death by strangulation, death by being beaten to death, and death by being run through with a sword.

Therefore, being told to die through drinking hemlock was an act of mercy, because the obvious alternatives (strangulation, being bludgeoned, and being run through by.a sword) were generally more painful and humiliating — potentially a good deal more.

In actual fact, death by hemlock isn’t always the most pleasant death, either. Ideally, you would lose consciousness, lie down, and expire. In reality, hemlock — which is EXTREMELY poisonous — can involve vomiting and dizziness before death. All things considered, though, it was a more merciful execution than other methods the Athenians knew of.

So it would be wrong to conclude that Socrates committed suicide. He didn’t. He was told he had been condemned to death. Hemlock was chosen as a means of death, probably because he was an older man, not in great shape anyway (so he’d probably die quickly), and he’d already declared his intention not to struggle against the death penalty once it was imposed.

In fact, that question — Should Socrates have tried to evade the death penalty? — comes up in the Platonic dialogs dealing with Socrates’ final days. The students of Socrates, Plato among them, include rich young men, and they tell him they can bribe the guard and get Socrates out of town while the guard agrees to look the other way. I think the guard already indicated his willingness to do that deal.

But Socrates tells them he won’t go through with their plan… not because he’s suicidal (he’s not), but because of a Philosopher’s Reason that he gives. That is, only a Philosopher would give a reason like this.

Basically, he says that all his life he had benefitted from the laws of Athens, as do all citizens, and that it would be hypocritical to now simply disregard the laws (even though they had decreed his death), simply because it was convenient to break the law now.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8c2udf4zqbe97yhs', 'title': 'How was Socrates executed?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Socrates was, in effect, ORDERED to drink Hemlock by the jury of Athenians.

Alex Johnston,4y,Did Friedrich Nietzsche agree with Hitler?,"Nietzsche suffered his complete mental breakdown around about the year that Hitler was born, and died when Hitler was eleven years old. So Nietzsche never had a chance to see the rise of Hitler.

Nietzsche was violently opposed to Prussian nationalism.

His sister Elisabeth married a notorious anti-Semite and German colonialist, Bernhard Förster, who Nietzsche intensely disliked and disagreed with. Förster's scheme to establish a German colony in South America was regarded by Nietzsche as ridiculous. The plan failed, and Förster committed suicide a few months after Nietzsche's breakdown, which almost certainly had to do with why Elisabeth devoted the rest of her life to 'caring for' and falsifying the work of her invalid brother.

Frederick Dolan,Updated 2y,What is Dreyfus' argument about the limits of computers?,"Dreyfus’s target was artificial intelligence (AI), and especially the claim that general human intelligence can be realized in the form of a digital computer program. There are many converging lines of thought that led him to this conclusion, but the basic idea was that AI’s concept of intelligence contains flawed Cartesian or representationalist assumptions that prevent it from adequately modeling human intelligence.

To begin with, it’s important to know Dreyfus’s views on how we ought to conceive of human intelligence.

Dreyfus argued that human beings are “in-the-world” in the sense that we have a non-propositional background understanding of the world as a whole, and we rely on it to make sense of and cope with things, events, and people. More specifically, we rely on this understanding to grasp what is relevant, significant, and meaningful in any given situation. Importantly, this understanding of the world is embodied in our abilities, skills, and practical activities generally. Unless we encounter difficulties and self-consciously engage in problem-solving, we find ourselves absorbed in familiar everyday activities whose significance and meaning are transparently clear to us.

On this view, the world at its most basic is not something outside us that we represent to ourselves; rather, we are in and of the world, irreducibly. At this level, there is no distinction between inner and outer or us and our objects or roles. We and the world are one and we are one with the world.

Drawing on an illustration from Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time (1927), Dreyfus asks us to consider what is involved in understanding hammers and hammering. Such an understanding could be represented as a definition stating the necessary and sufficient features something must possess in order to count as a hammer (a handle, a head, and other parts), to which a function could then be assigned (hammering). But understanding a hammer in the most basic sense requires that we grasp its relationship to many other things and activities (such as nails, planks, carpentry, and carpenters), that we understand the activity and importance of making things, and that we are able to exercise the skills hammering requires. In real life, that is, we cope intelligently with hammers, nails, and planks themselves – not representations of them. As Dreyfus put it, “the meaningful objects … among which we live are not a model of the world stored in our mind or brain; they are the world itself.” (What Computers Still Can’t Do, 265–66.)

Human knowledge and intelligence, then, are not exclusively representational or propositional. Indeed, propositional knowledge depends for its intelligibility on a background network of skills, abilities, and dispositions that embody a more fundamental non-propositional understanding of the world. We must first be “in-the-world” in order to have things about which to form propositions. “Knowing that” – propositional knowledge – rests on “knowing how,” as in knowing how to ride a bike, drive to the office, send an email, and persuade a colleague. Know-how involves our bodies as much as our minds, and is crucially related to the fact that we begin as infants and engage in what Michael Polanyi called “tacit knowing” long before we begin to make what we know explicit.

The version of AI that Dreyfus first criticized – what he later (following John Haugeland) called Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI) – modeled intelligence as the sequential application of rules to data. One criticism was that sequential rule-following does not characterize being-in-the-world, which is holistic not sequential. But the main difficulty that arose is known as the “frame problem.” How, out of all the available data and all the available rules, can a program determine which data and which rules are important in any given circumstances? Human beings don’t have this problem, simply because we are already in the world and things just show up to us as more or less relevant depending on the context. But a computer program has no context.

A meta-rule could be written to determine what other rules apply, but then it would be necessary to write meta-meta-rules about how to apply the meta-rules – and so forth, in an infinite regress (or progress).

Even if we could solve the problem of infinite regress, rules by themselves are far too inflexible to model human intelligence. Consider something as elementary as standing the appropriate distance from someone on a social occasion. A set of IF/THEN rules could account for some gross discriminations: if [Mexico, stranger, acquaintance, friend] then [3′, 2′, 1′]. But an indefinite number of other factors are relevant, and rules like these would be useless in a novel situation.

Potentially, in fact, everything is relevant to everything. As Dreyfus wrote:

In placing a racing bet we can usually restrict ourselves to such relevant facts as the horse’s age, jockey, and past performance, but there are always other factors, such as whether the horse is allergic to goldenrod or whether the jockey has just had a fight with the owner, which in some cases can be decisive. Human handicappers are capable of noticing such anomalies when they come across them. But since anything in experience could be relevant to anything else, for representational/computation AI such an ability seems incomprehensible.[1]

This is the essence of Dreyfus’s earliest criticisms of AI: nothing can matter to a program of rules and data, so such a program could not properly orient itself in the world, and intelligence and learning could never get going.

The same kind of difficulty, Dreyfus argued, plagues later and more recent attempts to solve the frame problem, for example by programming “embodied cognition” into robots and other devices along behavioral, pragmatic, or neurodynamic lines.

Robots, for example, can use sensors to respond to the world itself rather than internal representations of it. To do this, however, they must be designed to respond in specified ways to specified parts of the environment, which fails to capture how changes in one aspect of the world bring about changes in the significance of the whole. Although such systems avoid the problem of representation, they still model human intelligence as the conversion of inputs into outputs. But that isn’t what human intelligence is like: it involves making sense of the world in terms of our needs, interests, and abilities, not just responding to stimuli.

Another approach is to represent the world not in terms of objects with properties but rather in terms of objects with a range of assigned roles. This makes it possible to model patterns of interaction between agents and their environment.

But at the basic level of being-in-the-world, agents do not assign roles to things. Instead, things “solicit” our behavior. A hammer suggests hammering by drawing us into that activity when hammering is important. The windows of a classroom may remain unobtrusively hidden in the background until the room becomes too warm, at which point they may solicit opening – a task the teacher might carry out while thinking only of the lecture she is in the middle of delivering. More generally, situations draw from us differential responses that are neither like reflexes (about which laws could be formulated) nor like deliberate action (which involves propositional knowledge). Our intuitive holistic understanding of significance and relevance is not objectifyable and hence not programmable.

The same goes for neural network simulations. To capture relevance, neural connections must be differentially weighted, but the weights are applied by the programmer from the outside. Human intelligence doesn’t work this way: we don’t confer significance on a world that is otherwise insignificant; the world we encounter is already significant. To be successful, the computer program must somehow exhibit our direct access to significance and meaning, not treat it as a mere add-on.

Dreyfus thought that the work of Walter Freeman
, which emphasized the intimate coupling of brain and environment as determined by significance rather than information, might be on the right track. Freeman imagined the brain as a whole engaged with the environment as a whole. It is embodied in a creature coping with an environment that matters, and does not “add” mattering to an otherwise neutral world. Dreyfus thought that Freeman’s model might be a step towards “Heideggerian” AI.

The world has significance, however, based in part on our personal self-understanding. Because we have a personal identity, and because we are characterized by specifically human bodies, needs, abilities, and dispositions, the significance of our environment shows up in specifically human and personal ways. It would be necessary, therefore, to outfit the program with a rich description of the human body and of our motives, values, pleasures, pains, fears, and hopes. Otherwise things would not be significant to the program in the way they are for us, and it could not act intelligently in our world.

As Dreyfus admitted, he couldn’t prove that it is impossible to design such a device. But it seems unlikely because, again, so much of what makes up our identity is and must remain unarticulated and non-propositional.

Dreyfus’s criticism of AI was that it is limited by the wordlessness of computer programs. To the extent that computational methods cannot model our intuitive, holistic, transparent orientation to a world of significance and meaning, those methods will not yield AI. Human beings can cope with the world because things assume more or less importance depending on circumstances that are familiar to us. We can rely on the mood of the room to indicate what distance to stand from a conversational partner, but a robot cannot.

Computer programs have no needs. Nothing matters to them. Because things do matter to human beings, we don’t need to search through lists of facts and consult rules about how to prioritize them. For us, affordances just show up as more or less relevant because their availability makes a difference as to whether or not we will cope with our circumstances.

No computer has ever played chess, much less won a chess game. To play chess requires that you understand yourself as a chess player and that winning or losing a chess game matters to you personally. Computers can generate output that is significant to human beings and that they can interpret as chess moves, but the computer isn’t involved qua chess player. Computers are meaningful things in our world; a computer has no world.

Because a computer program is not alive, its life is never at stake. A human being can have a “gestalt switch”: a single powerful experience may deliver the ability to see virtually every dimension of life in a new and significant way. Gestalt switches of this magnitude are often related to life-threatening events, something to which no program can have access.

Note: This is a revision, prompted by Jason Whyte and James Clarke, of an earlier and shorter answer. As they point out, much has changed in the field of artificial intelligence since Dreyfus’s criticisms were first formulated in 1965. The second edition of What Computers Can’t Do (1992) extended the argument to account for developments up to that point, and Dreyfus continued the debate in the 2007 article linked to in the footnote below. This answer draws on that article, What Computers Still Can’t Do, and the original Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence
 (1965).

Gestalt switches of this magnitude are often related to life-threatening events, something to which no program can have access.\n\nNote: This is a revision, prompted by Jason Whyte and James Clarke, of an earlier and shorter answer. As they point out, much has changed in the field of artificial intelligence since Dreyfus’s criticisms were first formulated in 1965. The second edition of What Computers Can’t Do (1992) extended the argument to account for developments up to that point, and Dreyfus continued the debate in the 2007 article linked to in the footnote below. This answer draws on that article, What Computers Still Can’t Do, and the original Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence\n (1965).\n\nBelow, IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Why Heideggerian AI failed and how fixing it would require making it more Heideggerian', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.764025

Frederick Dolan,2y,What are the best lessons from Nietzsche?,"Nietzsche’s single most important lesson is that morality isn’t everything. There’s more to the good life than being moral, and too much morality can be bad for you.

One philosopher who developed this idea is Bernard Williams. Morality, Williams points out in Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, strives for universality or at least great generality. It stresses abstract moral obligations, rights, and imperatives, and seeks to ground them in objective features of human nature as understood and reflected upon by reason.

The problem, Williams finds, is that this level of generality excludes virtually everything related to the question of how to live well. It floats high above questions about the best or happiest kind of life human beings can hope to live. These questions require us to take into account the concrete circumstances in which individuals and groups find themselves, and whatever guidance pursuing them can offer applies necessarily to life as it is experienced “on the inside,” not as it is understood by objective reason.

This is very much in the spirit of Nietzsche, as Williams acknowledged. So are his criticisms of moral motivation, practical reason, and the idea that moral considerations always trump prudential considerations.

Another philosopher who takes up this dimension of Nietzsche is Susan Wolf. In “Moral Saints,” she argues that trying to be as morally perfect as possible can be harmful, both to the moral agent and those he or she affects. Because a perfectly moral agent would have to devote himself solely to the welfare of others, he is likely to end up superficial, dull, and perpetually frustrated. It would be better if moral saints were more selfish and cultivated their own interests, not only because they’d be happier but also because it would make them far more likely to add something interesting to the world.

Toni Kannisto,6y,"Is there a particular reason why Immanuel Kant never left his hometown, Königsberg?","Yes, there is. But it should first be noted that Kant did leave Königsberg, but not far, and not often: the furthest we know that he got was about 100 kilometres.

Kant was concerned about his health, and to aid his deteriorating body he made his life extremely systematic: he followed the same daily routine, down to the minute. He followed rules such that he would have a dinner party every day where he would drink exactly half a bottle of red wine. He taught himself to breath through the nose, even during his sleep, because breathing through the mouth could cause, in his opinion, all sorts of health issues. The list of his habits and rules is massive and impressive.

He felt that traveling would make it impossible for him to hold on to his strict regime, so he avoided it.

Famously, he was invited to be a professor in Berlin, a great honour – but he declined. From his letters we see that he seriously contemplated it, but did not feel that his health would allow for it. So he declined – this had nothing to do with wealth (he was not a poor man; he had a servant and a professor position, and of course Berlin would have paid for his moving).

It should be noted that today we would diagnose Kant as a hypochondriac, a person who has a mental issue with health, manifesting itself with exaggerated concern about one’s health. He was not like that when he was young; he was quite carefree and outgoing.

It is likely that his condition was exacerbated by the fact that he worked frantically to write down all the ideas that ensued when he made the so-called Critical turn in his philosophy – he was 57 when the Critique of Pure Reason came out, and he used the following decade or so to publish more important works than probably any other philosopher ever in a single decade.

We do not know if his strict regimen helped him to achieve his goal or whether without it we would have been deprived of much of his wisdom, but eventually he lived to be 79 years old – a respectable age by any standards.

Anubhav Jain,4y,"Are people on Quora really as good in real life as they portray themselves on Quora, because everyone seems to be a philosopher here?","I shall talk about myself first, and no, I am definitely not as good as I portray myself.

The most important reason is that, I am the one writing about myself, and a human will never think of themselves as wrong, we all are heroes in our own eyes.

The truth is that, no human is perfect, we are all the grey shade of life, a combination of imperfections, and if somebody sounds perfect, it's safe to assume they are fake, and when many people comment that I appear perfect, I introspect and feel guilty that maybe I am subconsciously faking my life.

I have had anger issues since the day I have gained consciousness, I have trust issues, I have ignored advice from all the wise people in my life. On every step of my life, I have made mistakes, I have been a procrastinator, I have hints of narcissism, and most importantly, nobody in my house, the people who love me and know me, will call me perfect.

Do I write about my Imperfections? Very less.

And one more thing, even I am one of those people, who can't easily believe in too good stories by people, specially when they keep repeating themselves or publicly display a private conversation, thus I don't expect people to trust me either.

Whenever someone asks me 'Is this a true story?' 'Did that really happen?'

I don't swear, I ask them to judge on their own.

I want to convey something important through this answer-

Please don't idolize people or blindly trust them, or fall in love with them just because they write good, I assure you that I can write ten fake stories about myself right now, to make anyone believe how good I am.

Learn from people, appreciate what you find good, and move on.

I HEARD THE LORD SAY, ‘DAUGHTERS OF GOD, I AM BRINGING YOU INTO WHOLISTIC RESTORATION’

December 6, 2023

the Lord Says, ‘Daughters of God, I am bringing you into wholistic restoration.’

As I listened to His heart, I heard Him speaking:

‘My precious daughters, the time has arrived. The time has felt long, and for many of you it has felt like time has been stolen and wasted: but I say unto you, that I am REDEEMING TIME. For right now you are stepping into an accelerated alignment of My timeline that you have not stepped into before. For as you seek Me, and you stay surrendered to Me in the secret place, I am bringing things into rapid alignment. For I am the God that can restore in a moment.

Can you feel the RUMBLES OF RESTORATION? For they are not far off, THEY HAVE BEGUN. For I am not just restoring what has been stolen, lost and broken in THIS season now: My mighty hand is going back through your timelines and I am RESTORING ALL. Can you hear the thundering of My heart and the thundering of My voice over you “I AM RESTORING ALL! IT IS WHOLISTIC RESTORATION.”

‘It’s time to come up higher! It’s time to ascend and see AS I SEE! It’s time to see that I am bigger than your greatest expectations and desires. I am the ALMIGHTY God and I am bringing into rapid alignment ALL that has been broken, stolen and lost. This is a time for you to supernaturally step into a redemption of time.

This is the time for you to step into a place of seeing a mighty flow of My Spirit, from many directions, coming crashing into your life to bring forth the restoration that I HAVE PROMISED YOU! I am bringing you further into the wholeness that is already yours, in Me.

I am bringing you further into the freedom that is already yours, in Me. It is not far off, it is not out of reach, you are LIVING IN IT! Apprehend it by faith and KNOW that this is a new day.

‘I am not only restoring unto you what was stolen, lost and broken, I am bringing you into the divine convergence of My hand where you will receive harvest of seeds sown in previous seasons: spoils of war from previous seasons and INSIGHT that the enemy tried to steal and cloud from previous seasons into THIS SEASON NOW.

For I am speaking INCREASE. For I am speaking multiple streams. For I am speaking multiple harvests. I am leaving NO AREA of your life untouched. Lift up your eyes, lift up your high praise and ascend into SEEING as I AM SEEING. I am moving many of you from GROVELLING to GOVERNING. It’s time to arise and ascend. It’s time to arise and ascend into the wholistic restoration that I have for you.

‘The winds of My acceleration are blowing and I am expanding time on your behalf. I am supernaturally expanding time. Where you have been in seasons where you have felt like time has been stolen from you; where you have felt like much of what I have promised you or spoken to you to put your hands to, there has been theft and brokenness and it feels like time has been lost or wasted,

I am now REDEEMING that time and EXPANDING that time on your behalf. Watch what I will do in you, for you and through you in a moment. I will accomplish in you, for you and through you in a moment, what would take a week in the natural to accomplish. Watch the fruitfulness of MY HAND. Watch the FLOURISHING of MY HAND.

For where the enemy has come so strongly to try and derail you and mess with your times and seasons, I am not only now redeeming time, but I am expanding time on your behalf and you shall walk with Me into greater fruitfulness within you, and through you, to see Me come in as the King of Glory -- Psalm 24:7-9.

‘I am NOW raising up a company of women who KNOW THE TIMES AND THE SEASONS! I am raising up My daughters now into a place of KNOWING what I am saying, they KNOW what I am doing and they are carrying the wisdom to lead and guide MANY in this hour into partnering with Me in the greatest move of My Spirit that they have ever seen before.

No longer will time be stolen, no longer will many of My daughters feel like they are living under a continual attack of their time being stolen — their insight and revelation being clouded by fogginess, heaviness and confusion. I am now raising up My daughters that are living yielded and at My feet in deep intimacy: with revelatory insight of the times and seasons, that they have not walked in before. For I am lifting up the fogginess that has come over their mind and over their vision and I am lifting them up by My hand into a place of supernatural vision to govern and stand in a place of intercession to make room for My Glory.

It is time!!!! What many of My daughters thought they could never do in a day, in the place of rest and dependence upon Me, they will see ME DO in a MOMENT. Not by might, nor by power but by My Spirit.

‘I am bringing all things together and bringing you further into clarity. Now is the time for you to SEE what I have been doing, where I have been leading, what I have been speaking and how it ALL COMES TOGETHER. It’s the time of divine convergence and you shall see in the converging of all I have spoken over many years — coming together now into alignment — that you had not heard wrong, and that the battle over My Rhema Word to you was to hinder your insight, foresight and stepping into the manifestation of all I had been speaking and leading you into.

‘Regret is weighing heavy upon many of you and is stealing your strength, your vision and your life. Come to Me. Draw close to Me. Look at Me and bring the regret to Me, for no longer will it weigh you down like a rock — heaviness after heaviness, regret after regret. I am rapidly and ferociously removing regret from your heart and leading you up high on the Rock that is I, and restoring hope to you again.

‘I am restoring your strength. I am restoring strength into every part of your being. Do not align with brokenness. Do not align with weariness. Lift up your eyes, lift up your heads and look to Me: for the winds of My Spirit are blowing ferociously to lift off ALL that has taken your strength. I am breathing My breath of life into your lungs again, and you shall breathe again.

The dry and dead-feeling parts of your heart will beat and breathe again. You shall not feel like you are running on empty but, in ME, you will move from overflow to overflow. I am taking you deeper into REST in Me and further into flourishing in Me. No more dead dreams, no more dead bones. Lift up your eyes and open your mouths and PROPHESY LIFE!

‘This next year will be marked by the miraculous in your lives. For I will bring you into a realm of seeing the supernatural become even more natural. Many of you feel like your lives have been marked by mountains, marked by obstacles, marked by battle: but I say unto you, 2024, your lives will be MARKED by the MIRACULOUS!!!!!! For many of you have felt spent of hope, spent of strength, but now you shall be INFUSED with hope, INFUSED with life, INFUSED with strength as you see the supernatural and miraculous moves of My Spirit in your midst.

‘For there has been great battles over many of your voices. The attack over your voice has increased in the last year to silence you and stall your step, and hinder your sound. But I say unto you: ASCEND in worship, ASCEND in praise and I am bringing you into the heavenly dimensions to HEAR the sound and new sounds on My heart.

The new sounds of the heavenly dimension of My Word and My symphony.: and these sounds shall be released upon the earth through YOUR VOICE. MY sound through YOUR VOICES that will usher in My healing in the earth, into lives and nations.

Listen My daughters, the battle over your voice was so intense, that many of you feel like it almost killed you. The battle over your voice, many of you feel like it broke you, but I say unto you I AM RESTORING ALL and I am releasing MY HEAVENLY SOUNDS through your VOICES to bring HEALING in the earth.

I am restoring you WHOLISTICALLY, My daughters, and I am bringing forth an anointing for WHOLISTIC HEALING THROUGH YOU, to flow in power and force, in your homes and wherever I send you.

‘There has been a great attack against many mothers in this hour and the enemy has not only been after the mothers, but he has been after the families and disrupting the homes. But I say unto you, My precious mothers, I am RESTORING YOU!

I am coming in power and glory in the night hours as you rest with My angelic hosts and I am RESTORING YOU! ALL WILL BE RESTORED TO YOU! You AND your HOME shall be restored. For I am restoring the heart of the home in many homes.

I am bringing rapid restoration to homes and families where the enemy has come and plundered. I am now declaring a WHOLISTIC RESTORATION and healing over homes, and I am expanding the boundary lines of your home to receive MY RECOMPENSE and INCREASE that is yours in this season.

‘My precious daughters, I am bringing wholistic restoration. It’s time for you to arise, ascend and step further into your inheritance in Me. This is a significant moment in time. This is a significant time of encountering Me, and My accelerated alignment and wholistic restoration that is going to change the trajectory of your life. Arise!

December 19, 2023 / As I spent time with the Lord today in worship, I could feel His heart for the INTERCESSORS that have faithfully interceded for their families, for their churches, for cities, for nations, for government, for this next move of God in the earth, for the extension of the Kingdom, for the unification of the body of Christ, for HIM to be glorified. The atmosphere was filled around me with the sense of BREAKTHROUGH and HARVEST TIME for many intercessors, that have been SO faithful in interceding where the Lord has guided and directed them. I then heard the words, ‘Intercessors, it is YOUR HARVEST TIME!!! GET READY to be REFRESHED… Lana Vawser Ministries

Roland Bartetzko,2y,"What is the best philosophical conversation that you've had? Where, when, and with whom? What did you discuss?","This happened many years ago, in the town of Lourdes in southern France. As Lourdes is one of the biggest pilgrimage sites of the Catholic church, my conversation was more a theological one than purely philosophical. For me, this was fine.

The place: a bar called “London Pub” which was probably the only decent place to have a beer in the whole town.

My vis-à-vis was an older guy from England (unfortunately, I forgot his name). He sat there in a corner and was already a bit drunk when he saw me entering the pub. He raised his glass and said something like, “to all the believers of Jesus Christ who visit this wonderful town!”

All good things come to an end.

I thought that he was one of those staunch supporters of the church and then Pope John Paul II (who was very conservative, to say the least) that were everywhere around the city. I never really liked these people. However, I couldn't have been more wrong!

It turned out that this strange fellow was a former believer in Christ turned militant atheist (“the fastest-growing group of people on the planet”) and that the purpose of his visit was not only to mock the pilgrims but also to find someone (a “victim”), that he could convince of the superiority of his new belief. In other words, he tried to convert people to atheism.

I wasn't the biggest believer myself but to make the conversation more interesting, I decided that this time, I wanted to defend church and pope.

Fortunately, we were both in a good mood and not too serious about our convictions (at least in my case), otherwise, the whole evening could have ended rather unpleasantly. Never mix alcohol and religious talk!

It was a long talk and I have forgotten most of it, however, I remember the end of it. My new friend was depressed about his experiences. He said that there weren't really a lot of people he could convince of their “bloody mistake” because at this time of the year (it was January), there weren't an awful lot of pilgrims around.

The only people there were the shopkeepers who, according to him, only believed in “the money they can get from the pilgrims and nothing else” and an army of priests and other cleric personnel.

The latter would have been the ideal victims for him (“converting a priest is like converting a hundred believers”) but they were difficult to approach and there wasn't really anything he had to offer. He sounded rather depressed:

“How happy they all look! I’m afraid that once I have convinced them of their errors, I will turn their lives into misery! Being an enlightened human being isn't always a lot of fun. There isn't that much to gain from discovering the truth, especially for a more simple soul.”

I agreed with him, I thought he had made a good point. Today, we may call this a red pill/blue pill dilemma but my little philosophical talk happened a few years before the “Matrix”.

We drank another beer, said goodbye to each other, and stumbled into the night.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mlngi0z4xfbj572k', 'title': ""What is the best philosophical conversation that you've had?

S. Price,Updated 4y,Which ancient philosopher demonstrated a very acute understanding of human nature? How?,"Original question- “Which ancient philosopher demonstrated a very acute understanding of human nature?”

Socrates.

Socrates is reported as being the very first moral philosopher. Moral philosophy covers all matters related to ethics.

To understand ethics one must distinguish good from evil, right from wrong, and to establish that, you must dig deep into the crevices of the human mind.

It is to know what drives them. To establish what motivation is and also motivational factors. To know how we derive at our conclusions and on what basis. And so much more but to do all that one must dig deep into the human mind.

Socrates left behind no writing. He did however have two students, Xenophon and Plato. Plato later taught Aristotle. Aristotle later became a teacher to Alexander the Great.

So much history there, but moving back to Socrates and moral philosophy, the very nature of moral philosophy is to deeply understand the nature of human beings.

I believe that to have been a pioneer in moral philosophy, back in 470–399 BC, Socrates surely had a very keen insight into the working minds of human beings.

Some Socrates sayings:

-“By all means, marry, if you get a good wife, you will become happy, if you get a bad wife, you will become a philosopher”.

-“An un-examined life is not worth living”.

-“Beware the barrenness of a busy life”.

-”Bad men live that they may eat and drink, whereas good men eat and drink that they may live”.

Alex Johnston,4y,"Other than Friedrich Nietzsche, what other philosophers’ works did the Nazis use to support their ideologies?","The Nazis used Nietzsche’s philosophy as support for their ideology only at the cost of Nietzsche’s philosophy.

While there are undoubtedly elements in his work that were capable of being used by the Nazis for their own ends, such as the critique of Christian morality, Nietzsche himself loathed Prussian militarism and empire-building, and liked to claim that there was nothing ‘German’ about him, and indeed that he was ethnically Polish. He wasn’t, but Nietzsche liked to make big generalisations about national characteristics, and nobody can read very far in his work without noticing how negative he was about anything he regarded as characteristically German.

However, one thinker who was the recipient of an actual fan letter from Adolf Hitler was the American conservationist Madison Grant.

Madison Grant (1865–1937) did a lot of valuable work preserving wildlife. He helped to found the Bronx Zoo, helped create Glacier National Park and Denali National Park, and he got a caribou named after him.

He was also a flaming racist.

His 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race argued that the ‘Nordic race’ was the main social group responsible for all human development, and that eugenics were the only rational solution to social problems:

A rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or unfit—in other words social failures—would solve the whole question in one hundred years, as well as enable us to get rid of the undesirables who crowd our jails, hospitals, and insane asylums. The individual himself can be nourished, educated and protected by the community during his lifetime, but the state through sterilization must see to it that his line stops with him, or else future generations will be cursed with an ever increasing load of misguided sentimentalism. This is a practical, merciful, and inevitable solution of the whole problem, and can be applied to an ever widening circle of social discards, beginning always with the criminal, the diseased, and the insane, and extending gradually to types which may be called weaklings rather than defectives, and perhaps ultimately to worthless race types.

(Source: Madison Grant - Wikipedia
, checked against The passing of the great race; or, The racial basis of European history
)

‘Worthless race types’.

We’ll start with criminals and the sick, then we’ll get rid of the weak, and eventually we’ll commit mass sterilisation so that entire ethnicities will be wiped out.

Adolf Hitler wrote a warm letter to Grant in the early 30s and referred to The Passing of the Great Race as ‘my Bible’. It was reportedly the first non-German book that the Nazis ordered to be reprinted after they took power. One of Grant’s friends was the secretary of the American Eugenics Society, Leon Whitney, author of the 1934 book The Case for Sterilization.

Whitney argued that forced sterilization was necessary to prevent society from being overcome with ‘degeneracy’:

The case for sterilization rests on sound principles, it has the highest possible humanitarian aims and the support of countless scientific authorities, and it is growing more vitally important in our lives every day. No one can deny that our present trend is toward a planned society planned biologically as well as economically; and no planned social order is attainable without careful consideration of the kind of people we want to 'have forming the race of the future.

Inevitably the question arises, How are we to achieve the desired effect? And the answer is: Cut off the useless classes by preventing their reproduction, and increase the better that is, the useful and self-sustaining, not necessarily the more brilliant. For the sake of our children, if not for our own sake, we must reduce the terrific burden of degeneracy that we have loaded on our shoulders through our policy in the past.

(Source: Full text of ""The case for sterilization""
)

Hitler wrote a friendly letter to Whitney too: Hitler's debt to America

Then there was the Nazis’ own in-house philosopher, Alfred Rosenberg.

Rosenberg was head of the Reich Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories, and his book The Myth of the Twentieth Century was a central work of Nazi ideology.

Rosenberg was not widely esteemed in higher Nazi circles. Goebbels liked the book, but Hitler admitted that he himself had barely read it. It was, however, accepted as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials, and Rosenberg was executed as a war criminal.

It has been noted that most of Rosenberg’s ideas are plundered from the English writer Houston Stewart Chamberlain, whose 1899 book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century laid out the idea of the ‘Aryan race’ as the most superior kind of human.

Chamberlain rejected Darwin’s ideas and drew on a hodge-podge of notions from, among other people, Goethe and the French ‘scientific racist’ Arthur de Gobineau to support his entirely unsupportable notions about race and ethnicity.

Chamberlain, who suffered from lifelong poor health, disliked England so much that even when he was young he preferred speaking French rather than English. He eventually settled in Germany and married Wagner’s daughter, and when war broke out in 1914 he actually tried to enlist in the German army. (He was rejected for various reasons, among them that he was fifty-eight years old at the time.) Chamberlain was already violently pro-Germany in 1914, but the war turned him into a furious German jingoist and anti-Semite. Chamberlain was absolutely convinced that the Germans would win, and was shattered when they didn’t.

In the early 20s, Chamberlain got to know Hitler, and warmly admired him. Hitler in turn was delighted to have the endorsement of the famous racist nutjob. Chamberlain never stopped supporting Hitler and the Nazis.

Finally, a footnote: The philosopher Martin Heidegger joined the Nazi party in 1933, the day after he was elected rector of Freiburg University. His time as rector was brief and ineffectual; most Nazis couldn’t understand his work, and he was not an influence on Nazi policy. He resigned as rector in April 1934, but stayed in the party until 1945. Given that he was largely ignored by the Nazis, when not actually ridiculed by them, he is not a good example of a philosopher that actually inspired the Nazis. I suspect that if they valued him at all, it was simply as a prestigious intellectual who’d thrown in his lot with them.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b450pedsn7frgwvx', 'title': 'Other than Friedrich Nietzsche, what other philosophers’ works did the Nazis use to support their ideologies?', 'score': {'original': 0.37056666666667, 'ai': 0.62943333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The Nazis used Nietzsche’s philosophy as support for their ideology only at the cost of Nietzsche’s philosophy.\n\nWhile there are undoubtedly elements in his work that were capable of being used by the Nazis for their own ends, such as the critique of Christian morality, Nietzsche himself loathed Prussian militarism and empire-building, and liked to claim that there was nothing ‘German’ about him, and indeed that he was ethnically Polish.

Second, if this question is asked as part of a university course on feminist philosophy taught by a professor with an agenda to undermine the ideas of every single dead white male no matter how brilliant they were, then the correct answer is: No, absolutely not, these sexist fools could never measure up to the wisdom and genius of whatever random sophists… er, philosophers, my bad my bad… that the professor choose to include in the curriculum.

Nevertheless, the answer is probably no.

Ian Heckman,5y,What philosophical ideas have influenced your life?,"There’s a paper by Galen Strawson called, “Against Narrativity” where he argues against this widespread view:

Humans must conceive of their lives as consisting of narratives. Not only must they, but they should, otherwise they are not full persons and not full moral agents.

Now one of the interesting moves Strawson makes in the paper is to distinguish between a diachronic and a synchronic sense of identity.

Some people are diachronic, meaning that they conceive of themselves as extending through time. Diachronic people look at the person who they were 15 years ago as if their identity was tied with that person. They feel some kind of bond or closeness with that person, as if they were some old friend or something. The same goes for future selves, except maybe it’s not like an old friend, but some bright future that they’re constantly hoping for.

Other people are synchronic, meaning that they conceive of themselves as relatively existing in the present. They look back at their selves 15 years ago as if they were some stranger that they barely know. Similarly, they look forward, and feel alienated by a person they cannot even know.

Of course there’s going to be a big spectrum among these two, but it’s helpful to distinguish the two poles.

Now I am someone who is more synchronic. I don’t conceive of the entities of my past and future as if they were somehow close to me and attached to me. In fact, I find them more foreign and alien than I do my close friends, or even the people I meet regularly in life. They might as well be strangers that I can never meet or characters in some story that I read on occasion.

What this distinction has done for me, however, is made sense of a whole realm of discourse that was always confusing to me. For example, I have a friend who experienced a kind of existential crisis because he did not have a clear picture of where he was headed. And all of a sudden this made sense to me. If you care a lot about your future self, so much so that they are really a part of who you conceive of yourself as being, then you are of course going to feel in a crisis if you don’t know what the future brings.

And I have countless other examples like this. Suddenly other people made so much more sense to me. I spend a lot of my days confused or perplexed about why people do and say the things they do, and this brought in rays of light where there previously had been untouched darkness.

Matthew Bates,1y,What are your philosophical views in terms of the teaching profession?,"This is probably going to sound pretty jaded, especially to the non-teachers reading this. This wasn’t always my “philosophical view” on teaching. It took me a few years of actually teaching to form this view and, since forming it, it’s served me well in the other years that I’ve taught.

My philosophical view on the teaching profession is:

Stay in your lane if you want to spend your career as a teacher. People who stray from their lane tend to burn out the fastest, or do more harm than good.

My particular lane is “middle school English teacher.” This is what I get paid to do. This is what I am good at. This is what I was trained to do.

My lanes are not:

Counselor.
Role model.
Teacher of any other subject.
Parent.
Social worker.
Friend to any students.

Early in my career, I made the rookie mistake of trying to drive down too many lanes at the same time, because I thought that that’s what teachers were supposed to do. I was supposed to care about all aspects of my students’ lives, and it was up to me, and only me, to make sure they became successful adults, right? Right?

Wrong.

If a student needs a counselor, send them to the counselor.

If the student needs a role model, suggest some to them, some that aren’t you.

If a student comes to you to complain about another teacher or another subject, suggest that they take those complaints to the appropriate person, a person that isn’t you.

And so on.

It’s okay to have a friendly conversation with students, and ask them about things like sports or their hobbies or their siblings that you also taught. It is not okay–it’s straying way too far from your lane–to think of them as your friends.

Imagine that all of the different positions adults have at the school are different lanes, each protected by walls. Stay in your lane. Don’t break through those walls.

Frederick Dolan,2y,How can we start understanding Hegel in simple way?,"In The Problems of Philosophy (1912), Bertrand Russell presented a simple understanding of Hegel.

[Hegel’s] main thesis is that everything short of the Whole is obviously fragmentary, and obviously incapable of existing without the complement supplied by the rest of the world. Just as a comparative anatomist, from a single bone, sees what kind of animal the whole must have been, so the metaphysician, according to Hegel, sees, from any one piece of reality, what the whole of reality must be – at least in its large outlines. […] Thus Hegel reaches the conclusion that Absolute Reality forms one single harmonious system…. […] If we saw the universe whole … space and time and matter and evil and all striving and struggling would disappear, and we should see instead an eternal perfect unchanging spiritual unity. (P. 142–143.)

Another simple starting point is in William James’s A Pluralistic Universe (1909).

[Hegel] is easy if you can catch the center of his vision. […] The full truth about anything involves more than that thing. In the end nothing less than the whole of everything can be the truth of anything at all. (Library of America edition, pp. 669–70.)

When we go beyond the basic idea of holism, things do begin to get complicated. But the very next step would be to point out that if we truly understand things only as parts of wholes, then in order to understand mind-independent reality we must grasp it in terms of the requirements it places on the human minds that desire knowledge of it. Instead of taking reality as antithetical to us as knowers, we should understand reality as consisting of objects that are fit to be known by us, as we are fit to know them.

Armed with the understanding that the structure of reality and the structure of thought are complementary, we can go on to understand being on the basis of thought itself. As James goes on to say:

Hegel saw this undeniable characteristic of the world we live in in a non-empirical light. […] [R]eason is all-inclusive.

The most basic logical concepts we possess are features of both thought and being. In the bigger picture, reality itself is rational and rationality is real, and as human beings come to understand this they can create institutions that more or less successfully embody the rationality of reality.

Alex Johnston,Updated Sep 10,"Who, in your opinion, is the greatest philosopher of the last 200 years? Why?","The last 200 years, eh? Well, that at least rules out quite a lot of big names.

Kant died in 1804, so he’s out.

Hegel (d. 1831) barely scrapes in, but I don’t feel qualified to talk about him.

Marx wasn’t a philosopher, although that hasn’t stopped other people from nominating bizarre non-philosopher candidates like Einstein and Solzhenitsyn.

I kind of want to nominate Ludwig Wittgenstein, but I’m not a professional philosopher and didn’t formally study the subject, so my grasp of how influential he was and is, is a little shaky.

So, instead, I’m going to go for a rather obvious choice.

Friedrich Nietzsche.

Now, the reason I’ve chosen Nietzsche is precisely because Nietzsche is, for me, a certain kind of model for what philosophers, at least some of the time, ought to be.

I think that when a lot of non-philosophers such as myself read philosophy, we’re looking for ‘a philosophy’, a framework of ideas and concepts and even rules, that will make sense of a confusing world.

Kant’s idea of the ‘categorical imperative’ is such a thing in moral philosophy: Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. There is such a thing as Kantians, just as there are or were Hegelians (Marx started out as one).

Nietzsche’s most recent biographer in English, Sue Prideaux, has observed that there is no ‘Nietzscheanism’.

Yeah, there are a lot of tiresome fanboys who’ve read some Nietzsche and think he’s all about being edgy and dark, etc., or else that he’s all about nihilism.

I’m not interested in that. I’m pretty sure Nietzsche had a few well-turned phrases about such people.

What I admire about Nietzsche is not his opinions, which could at times be quite fatuous: for example, knowing nothing whatever about zoology, he was completely wrong about Darwin, who he took to be a symptom of 19th century English decadence.

But what’s great about him, when he’s on his home turf, is his gift for language and his diagnostic genius, his skill as a psychologist.

Nietzsche’s ability to sniff out the cracks and seams in an argument or a standpoint is extraordinary—as long as he really understands the argument in the first place. I’ve been reading him for over 30 years and I’m still astonished at how good he is at scenting bad faith, or questioning exactly why someone is taking the position that they’re taking. He is a connoisseur of the slips and evasions and self-flattery that people engage in when they think.

Nietzsche’s brilliance is at holding up a stance or an idea or a morality and letting the light shine through it, and saying Have you thought about it this way? Or that way? Did it ever occur to you that… ?

In his published work, at any rate, he practically never advances an idea without putting a spin on it which makes you have to think about it.

This, for me, is the greatest thing about Nietzsche: he prompts you to think, in a way that lesser philosophers and would-be philosophers have been trying to live up to ever since.

Nietzsche is like a weird martial arts master of philosophy: it’s not what he thinks that matters, so much as that you learn from him the ability to disagree with him.

This is regularly missed by people who quote him as if he is a source of wisdom, which he only sometimes is.

For example, the famous saying ‘What does not kill me, makes me stronger’ is almost always quoted as if it’s just a simple and rather macho maxim, but in its original form it’s a more nuanced aphorism:

Aus der Kriegsschule des Lebens. — Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stärker.

From the military school of life. — What does not kill me, makes me stronger.

That first clause is Nietzsche indicating that he is not handing down wisdom, here, so much as voicing an attitude, rather like those books by Kierkegaard which are written entirely from a point of view that wasn’t necessarily his own.

I’ve written a bunch of answers about Karl Marx, in which it’s fairly obvious that I admire Marx’s work and think that it still has some relevance to the modern world.

We don’t know if Nietzsche actually read Marx; he only began publishing books a few years before Marx died, and Marx was not very well-known in Nietzsche’s lifetime. But we know that Nietzsche had a rather low opinion of socialism.

However, that doesn’t matter to me.

I know why Nietzsche didn’t approve of socialism, but I also don’t feel the need to accept his opinion—because his opinions on socialism were mostly confined to his notebooks, seldom expressed outright in his published work, but also because, like I said above, Nietzsche doesn’t oblige me to blindly agree with everything he says.

The English philosopher Bernard Williams began his career thinking that Nietzsche was a waste of time, and ended up fascinated with Nietzsche, editing an edition of The Gay Science for Cambridge University Press (it’s the one that I have) and in particular admiring Nietzsche’s attitude to art.

Williams said that Nietzsche thought that art was what humans had devised to enable them to handle truth. Art gives truth a kind of shape that makes it manageable: as Williams put it, ‘we possess art so that we can possess the truth and not perish of it.’

Other philosophers’ basic missions in life are usually to ask questions, like What is true? or What is right? or Is this true?, or else to advise people about things, like You should do this or You should think this or We should all do this.

Williams said that the question Nietzsche asks at the end of The Gay Science was:

… a question which he wanted his readers to ask themselves not just at the end of this book, but throughout it and indeed through all his books — ‘Is that what you want?’

What I admire most about Nietzsche is not the questionable remarks about women, or even his peculiar attitudes towards Jewish people (he seems to have taken on board many of the stereotypes about Jews that were common in the period and inverted them, saying in effect You say that like it’s a bad thing.)

In any case, Sue Prideaux notes that Nietzsche gave his sister Elisabeth a reading list and urged her to educate herself as best she could, and that when he was on the faculty of Basel University and a vote was taken about whether or not they should admit women, Nietzsche was only one of four men who voted in favour. Later on, he befriended a German feminist, Malwida von Meysenburg, and when the university allowed women to audit lectures, he encouraged his sister and von Meysenburg to apply—the latter later became the first woman to get a PhD from a Swiss university.

What I really admire, apart from his wit and intelligence and the sheer pleasure of reading his prose, is how he constantly circles back to that insidious and difficult question:

Is that what you want?

Fareed Nasim,Oct 3,How can I stop thinking philosophically?,"Stop Philosophical Thinking

Stopping philosophical thinking can be challenging, as it's a natural inclination for some people. However, if you want to reduce philosophical thoughts, you can try the following:

Engage in practical activities: Focus on tasks that require your full attention, such as hobbies, sports, or work, to divert your mind from abstract thinking.
Meditation and mindfulness: Practice mindfulness techniques to stay grounded in the present moment and reduce rumination on philosophical questions.
Limit exposure: Avoid reading philosophical literature or engaging in discussions about deep philosophical topics if you want to reduce your philosophical thinking.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Consider therapy to address thought patterns and learn strategies to redirect your thinking towards more practical matters.
Set boundaries: Allocate specific times for philosophical reflection, allowing you to contain these thoughts within designated periods.
Seek balance: Striking a balance between practical and philosophical thinking can be healthier than trying to eliminate philosophical thinking altogether.

Remember that philosophical thinking can be valuable and enriching, so it's essential to find a balance that works for you rather than completely suppressing it if it's a source of intellectual fulfillment.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/usw4dk53gvnxab27', 'title': 'How can I stop thinking philosophically?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Stop Philosophical Thinking\n\nStopping philosophical thinking can be challenging, as it's a natural inclination for some people.

Cecili Chadwick,Updated 6y,"Who can describe the overarching philosophies of (some of) the major philosophers, in a few sentences per philosopher?","Thucydides: Studies the phenomena of human events — factional strife, commerce, war — with reference to two contending political psychologies. In Athens, the most capable people took refuge from war, becoming citizens immediately. In Sparta, after suffering the longest known period of faction, they established the most severe forms of both enslavement and military rule based on pederasty, amazingly gaining the reputation of law and order.

Socrates: By questioning conventional opinions about what is good and what is bad, he awakens some to the possibility of natural right. His method involves the subtle interrogation of life through questioning things we think we know with an aim towards the development of wisdom in matters of morality.

Plato: Seeks to preserve the socratic question into the future in order to realize the possibility of natural right. His writing is a mix of poetry and dialogue – a kind of drama different from Homer or Herodotus in which the characters are much less fantastical. These become similar to scripted plays (about science, morals, and habits) as he tries to make an improvement upon nature.

Aristotle: He offers no plays or dialogues, but systemized notes and treatises. His work is a deliberate and systematic investigation of the phenomena of all things (the same things we now have separate sciences for – biology, zoology, rhetoric, etc.). Aristotle establishes both practical and theoretical scientific methods (politics, ethics) by which to expand the capacities of reason, leadership, and virtuous action.

Cicero: He attempts to preserve and maintain Greek thought in the absence of its original source in a republican empire. In other words, there is no Athens anymore, but he wants to continue the Greek political and philosophic thought with new foundations (cosmopolitan and imperial, rather than based on the city-state).

Tacitus: Documents the rise of world weariness and resent in the loss of the Greek world. He looks at relativism and censorship, but still sees in people a forlorn hope for a return to Platonic philosophy. He describes the collapse of the political class/culture with the rise of cults and tries to capture the best moral sentiments to strengthen the health of the regime. He examines the phenomena of human action in relation to political development of a Roman republican empire.

Machiavelli: Revives political action (with reference to republican Rome) and teaches about the nature of evil (with reference to the personalistic and monetary corruption of the Catholic Church).

Bacon: Attempts to realize Plato through science and technology. The New Atlantis is the ideal city of the Republic.

Hobbes: Human baseness is the foundation for all things which necessitates the founding of a powerful government. (This is what Rousseau will rebel against to say human nature is blameless — and is in fact superior to government and civilization — an even more totalitarian vision than the one Hobbes imagines).

Descartes: Radically uninteresting, but ought to be included. Cogito ergo sum means something more like, “to think of myself thinking” which does not make one into a being — being requires some kind of plurality. Thinking oneself thinking takes the idea of there existing an abstract intelligence in the universe, presupposing the modern evangelical belief in a private God.

Locke: Comfort as salvation; property as the means.

Rousseau: He expresses resent toward the expectations of reason and moral virtue. His solution to handling this resent is some kind of retreat to (and exaltation of) primitive and blameless animal nature.

Kant: Insists on the importance and unknowability of moral things.

Hegel: Culmination of the Platonic hope of improving nature (or realizing the millennial development of the possibility of human nature) and the political science of improving modern institutions for the betterment of human action. His is a mix of Plato and Aristotle in modernity.

Marx: Extends the concerns of Adam Smith about the ruinous and world-destroying effects of the commercialization of all life.

Nietzsche: Herald of the spiritual and political crisis of slave morality.

Heidegger: Embodies the abyss of Christian nihilism combined with modern technology.

Arendt: She works on rescuing virtue in the threat of nuclear annihilation.

Beauvoir: In defining woman exclusively as the proverbial Other, man effectively denies her humanity. Men fundamentally oppress women by characterizing and defining them exclusively in opposition to men.

Awdhesh Singh,4y,"Are people on Quora really as good in real life as they portray themselves on Quora, because everyone seems to be a philosopher here?","There is a beautiful saying in Hindi attributed to Saint Tulsidas, “Ram se bada Ram ka Nam” (Greater than Lord Ram is the name of Ram).

This saying is difficult to comprehend.

‘How can the name of God can be greater than God Himself?’

Let us try to understand this.

No person in this world is perfect.

Even God (Lord Ram) shows imperfection when He takes incarnation as a human being.

If you so desire, you can find numerous faults in Lord Ram also.

However, the wise people are those who don’t find fault in others, but respect their qualities so that they can inspire themselves to become like them by following their wisdom.

It is human to talk about our good things.

The people on Quora are no exceptions.

I am sure that they too are human beings and they would have all the weaknesses which any ordinary human beings may have.

The important thing is not to find weaknesses in any person, but to learn if they are writing something that is useful to you.

Alex Johnston,2y,What books should I read while reading Nietzsche? I really don't want to misunderstand him while he comments on other philosophers. What books would he consider worth reading?,"I can thoroughly recommend two books that Nietzsche really liked.

One was J.P. Eckermann’s Conversations with Goethe (published in 1836 and then again in a revised edition in 1848.) It’s sometimes published as Goethe’s Conversations with Eckermann, but it’s the same book, just a different title.

J.P. Eckermann, apparently played by David Tennant.

Eckermann was a young German guy who J.W. Goethe, Germany’s most eminent writer ever, engaged as his personal secretary in 1823, when Goethe himself had only nine years left to live. Eckermann kept a record of Goethe’s conversations with him, in which he (Eckermann) took care to ask Goethe about stuff that he thought Goethe might have interesting things to say about.

It’s kinda sorta the German equivalent of Boswell’s Life of Johnson, except that Eckermann didn’t bother to turn it into a biography. Goethe was already in his early 70s when he met Eckermann, but he was highly alert and spirited, and he comes across as, well, wise, is the best word I can think of.

Goethe had a remarkable ability to notice how people and things changed and developed over time, and an equal ability to figure out what would and wouldn’t be good for their development. This comes out a lot in the Conversations, in which Goethe e.g. advises Eckermann not to try to read his Faust Part Two, on the grounds that he probably won’t understand it at this point in his life.

I think Nietzsche liked the book because it showed how good Goethe was at preserving his own intellectual and spiritual vitality. (Even if Donald Barthelme wrote in the 1970s a wicked but very funny parody of it.) Nietzsche had a bit of an obsession with health and development and that kind of thing, although it comes out in a more oblique way in his works.

One of the best compliments I can pay to Conversations with Goethe is that, even in the 1906 translation by John Oxenford that I read it, it still reads like a classic book. Any work that can survive Edwardian translation can’t be bad.

The other book is the notebooks of George Christoph Lichtenberg (1742–1799), a German physicist and writer who was the first professor in Germany of experimental physics, but who’s now remembered for his notebooks, in which he wrote down random aphorisms that occurred to him.

I like a good aphorism, and Lichtenberg’s are some of the best ever. A selection was published by Penguin in 1990, translated by Nietzsche’s earlier Penguin translator R.J. Hollingdale, and opening it at random, I found the following:

The soup tasted so foul that to believe it had been deliberately poisoned you would have needed only to be a king or a great general.
We read so much about genius nowadays everyone believes he is one. The man who early on regards himself as a genius is lost.
Never before had a mind come to a more majestic halt.
A golden rule: We must judge men, not by their opinions, but by what these opinions make of them…
What leaning on your right elbow means after you have been leaning on your left for an hour.
The sure conviction that we could if we wanted to is the reason so many good minds are idle.

Lichtenberg’s wit is profound, and his profundity is witty. He’s the strongest antidote I know to heavy, serious, weighty philosophy that oppresses you with its sheer relentlessness. He had many eminent fans besides Nietzsche, including Schopenhauer, Tolstoy and Freud.

He never formulated a system, or wrote a serious philosophical treatise. He’s remembered in physics for his discovery of Lichtenberg figures
, a type of electrical discharge, but his notebooks are worth dipping into for refreshment at any time. The Penguin selection has been reprinted by NYRB as The Waste Books, but we really need a more generous selection.

Toni Kannisto,6y,What do modern philosophers talk about?,"Philosophers today talk about a wide variety of topics, purely philosophical as well as applied to contemporary issues of science and society. The hallmark of philosophy today is its highly fragmented nature: philosophers tend to focus their whole careers on very small issues, in which they become very competent and knowledgeable, but do not necessarily discuss with other traditions that much. This is, I think, a result of the rise of article publishing: instead of publishing books, philosophers like other researchers publish shorter articles, and even books tend to be collections of essays in a more cohesive form.

What philosophers generally do

That said, philosophers generally divide into three groups:

those that focus only on contemporary issues, often referring to a sliver of, say, 10 recent years of publications (here trends come and go),
those that focus on history of philosophy: reanalysing classics and rediscovering less famous characters (the latter is very popular now and we rediscover interesting thinkers all the time), and
those that try to bridge the two by reinterpreting historical figures using contemporary ideas and tools and those that take ideas from historical figures to reimagine contemporary discussions.
One could, for instance, use modern logic to analyse the validity of Spinoza’s argumentation, or employ Medieval ideas about God’s preknowledge to contemporary debates about free will, or compare Leibnizian idea of possible worlds to contemporary possible worlds semantics.

What I do

I belong to the last group. What I do, then, is that I read a lot of Kant’s philosophy and his contemporaries, and I follow contemporary discussions about topics that Kant wrote about. I then write articles, usually something around 10000 words, with one of the following aims:

arguing for a new interpretation of some of Kant’s claims to increase our historical understanding of him, usually inspired by some contemporary discussions (e.g. I have worked on Kant’s theory of modality, which is very neglected, using the tools developed in this field in the last 50 years), or
comparing Kant to his predecessors or followers to gain better insight into their respective strengths and weaknesses (e.g. I have written on Kant’s theory of existence compared to his predecessor Baumgarten and to the later philosopher Frege), or
applying a Kantian idea or method to a contemporary issue (e.g. I have criticised Kripke’s a posteriori necessity, as well as contributed to contemporary discussions on transcendental argumentation and possible worlds semantics).

The latter is very hard, given the fragmentation I mentioned: I need to use both Kant’s and contemporary terminology correctly and convince both Kant scholars that I interpret him correctly and contemporary philosophers that there is something of value in Kant. And I have to do all of this in 10000 words.

In some sense philosophers of old had it easier, with less pressure to publish every year or even many times a year, and therefore more time to put together a convincing and comprehensive theory. It is a common joke today to imagine philosophers like Kant submitting 20 pages of the Critique of Pure Reason to peer-reviewed journals (and getting horribly rejected, of course). Or simply the scandal and scorn of the financers due to his “sitting around” for 10 years (which he did while he was working on the said tome).

Some resources

To see on which topics philosophers today work, you can look at the tables of content of some prominent philosophy journals. Here are some examples:

Noûs, commonly thought as the top journal of philosophy: Noûs - Wiley Online Library

Toni Kannisto,Updated 6y,What makes one a genuine philosopher (not the academic credentials)? Does he live like Socrates wandering the streets pestering people?,"A genuine philosopher is anyone who is a genuine lover of wisdom — neither a jealous keeper nor an abusive spouse of truth. A philosopher is anyone who puts truth and understanding, knowledge and wisdom, in the centre of their lives, and pursues each with honesty, integrity, and humility. Anyone who in the face of evidence reconsiders their core beliefs, no matter how dear they may have become. Philosophers need not wander on the streets but they can never stop wandering in their thoughts, in their eternal quest for new insight to overthrow the old.

A philosopher loves wisdom not for their own sake but for the sake of everyone. A philosopher is never too vain to guide others, to the best of their abilities, towards wisdom and truth. And a philosopher is never too proud to welcome the guidance of others. A philosopher does not engage in an argument for the sake of an argument, nor does a philosopher do so for glory or out of anger, but for the sake of education — be that of the interlocutor or their own.

Philosophers sow and water questions so that they could one day reap answers, and philosophers treat every truth as fertile soil to grow new questions. A philosopher never loses sight of this dialectic: never resting complacent with answers and never littering the world with questions without a place or purpose. A philosopher embraces confusion yet seeks always to dispel it — a traveller taking a step only to leave it behind with the next.

A philosopher seeks mastery over the paralysis of confusion through patient wisdom and relentless logic, and a philosopher seeks mastery over the pretensions of knowledge through humble inquiry and courageous deconstruction. Philosophy is, in short, disciplined bewilderment.

Frederick Dolan,Updated 2y,What qualifies a philosophical question as being solved?,"This is, of course, an eminently philosophical question. It should immediately be said that what counts as a plausible solution is heavily dependent on the nature of the problem.

So there’s no one answer. But there’s one kind of philosophical solution that is especially elegant. It has two components:

The problem dissolves. It just goes away and ceases to be. What had seemed to be a problem no longer is one. The solution is the absence of the problem.

This is how Wittgenstein conceived of philosophical solutions: the question you are struggling to answer turns out to be nonsense, and the discovery that it’s nonsense relieves you of the responsibility of answering it. Alternatively, the problem depends on a particular “picture” you have of how things are. If you can abandon that picture, or improve it, you can dispense with the problem.

The problem dissolves for the right reasons. You can’t just declare something to be nonsense, and you can’t treat it as nonsense just because it’s hard to understand. For the problem to really disappear, you’ve got to understand pretty thoroughly why it ought to disappear.

This kind of solution applies to the kind of problem Ludwig Wittgenstein called “intellectual cramp,” which Saul Kripke characterized as a situation “in which all the facts seem to be before us, there does not seem to be any new information to be gained, and yet we don’t quite know what is going wrong with our picture of the problem.”*

My favorite illustration, at the moment, is Galen Strawson’s solution to the mind-body problem.[1]

The key is to grasp that materialism entails that conscious lived experience is itself material. That is, if materialism is the doctrine that everything that exists is physical, and if conscious experience exists, as it must, then conscious experience is physical.

Since, on this account, conscious experience is not mental but physical, the mind-body problem does not and cannot arise.

Strawson points out that although the key is easy to understand, it’s hard to remember. It’s important to keep in mind that although physics has revealed many basic physical laws, and although they tell us important things about the nature of physical matter (and energy), our knowledge of the intrinsic nature of physical matter is incomplete.

Our knowledge of the nature of the physical concerns its causal and spatiotemporal structure. The structure of the physical is therefore expressible in the logical and mathematical terms of physics, but not with respect to its intrinsic character, i.e. with respect to that of which the structure is made. Strawson quotes Bertrand Russell:

We know nothing of the intrinsic quality of physical phenomena except when they happen to be sensations [i.e., conscious experience] … therefore there is no reason to be surprised that some are sensations, or to suppose that the others are totally unlike sensations. The gap between mind and matter has been filled in, partly by new views on mind, but much more by the realisation that physics tells us nothing as to the intrinsic character of matter. [An Outline of Philosophy, p. 154.]

In order for the mind-body problem to disappear, we must keep our ignorance of the intrinsic nature of the physical firmly in mind, even as we adopt the materialist doctrine that everything is physical.

* See Saul Kripke, “On Two Paradoxes of Knowledge,” Philosophical Troubles (2011). Kripke’s example of a problem that causes intellectual cramp is this:

A teacher announces that he will give an examination within the month. Examinations are always given at noon. He also announces that the exam will be a surprise exam: no student will know on the day before the exam is given that it will be given the next day. A student can then reason as follows:

The teacher, if he intends to fulfill his announced promise, cannot give the exam on the very last day. If he did, after noon had passed on the previous day, we (the students) would know that only the last day was left and that it had to be the day of the examination. This would be a plain contradiction of the announcement that it was to be a surprise exam, so that day can be crossed off the calendar. But then it cannot be given on the second-to-last day either because, after noon of the day before had passed and the exam still has not been given, we will realize that only two days are left, and that since the last days is ruled out, the exam must be given on the second-to-last day. But then we would know in advance that that was the day of the exam, which is again a contradiction.

The student can continue the same reasoning backward: as soon as she crosses out one day from the calendar, the last remaining day is as if it were the last day, and so it can be ruled out by the same type of reasoning. There will, finally, be no days left. The student is left to conclude that either the exam will not be given or that it will not be a surprise.

[Yet teachers] do announce surprise examinations and no such contradictions seem to arise: it does not seem impossible for a teacher to fulfill his or her promise to give a surprise examination.

That is, if materialism is the doctrine that everything that exists is physical, and if conscious experience exists, as it must, then conscious experience is physical.\n\nSince, on this account, conscious experience is not mental but physical, the mind-body problem does not and cannot arise.\n\nStrawson points out that although the key is easy to understand, it’s hard to remember. It’s important to keep in mind that although physics has revealed many basic physical laws, and although they tell us important things about the nature of physical matter (and energy), our knowledge of the intrinsic nature of physical matter is incomplete.\n\nOur knowledge of the nature of the physical concerns its causal and spatiotemporal structure. The structure of the physical is therefore expressible in the logical and mathematical terms of physics, but not with respect to its intrinsic character, i.e. with respect to that of which the structure is made. Strawson quotes Bertrand Russell:\n\nWe know nothing of the intrinsic quality of physical phenomena except when they happen to be sensations [i.e., conscious experience] … therefore there is no reason to be surprised that some are sensations, or to suppose that the others are totally unlike sensations. The gap between mind and matter has been filled in, partly by new views on mind, but much more by the realisation that physics tells us nothing as to the intrinsic character of matter. [An Outline of Philosophy, p. 154.]\n\nIn order for the mind-body problem to disappear, we must keep our ignorance of the intrinsic nature of the physical firmly in mind, even as we adopt the materialist doctrine that everything is physical.\n\n* See Saul Kripke, “On Two Paradoxes of Knowledge,” Philosophical Troubles (2011). Kripke’s example of a problem that causes intellectual cramp is this:\n\nA teacher announces that he will give an examination within the month. Examinations are always given at noon. He also announces that the exam will be a surprise exam: no student will know on the day before the exam is given that it will be given the next day. A student can then reason as follows:\n\nThe teacher, if he intends to fulfill his announced promise, cannot give the exam on the very last day. If he did, after noon had passed on the previous day, we (the students) would know that only the last day was left and that it had to be the day of the examination. This would be a plain contradiction of the announcement that it was to be a surprise exam, so that day can be crossed off the calendar. But then it cannot be given on the second-to-last day either because, after noon of the day before had passed and the exam still has not been given, we will realize that only two days are left, and that since the last days is ruled out, the exam must be given on the second-to-last day. But then we would know in advance that that was the day of the exam, which is again a contradiction.\n\nThe student can continue the same reasoning backward: as soon as she crosses out one day from the calendar, the last remaining day is as if it were the last day, and so it can be ruled out by the same type of reasoning. There will, finally, be no days left. The student is left to conclude that either the exam will not be given or that it will not be a surprise.\n\n[Yet teachers] do announce surprise examinations and no such contradictions seem to arise: it does not seem impossible for a teacher to fulfill his or her promise to give a surprise examination.\n\nBelow, Galen Strawson, panpsychisist.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] ""Oh you materialist"" [Darwin]', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.99585

Paul Mainwood,Updated 5y,"Should physicists ask ""how"", ""why"", or ""what is physical reality"", or should they ""shut up and calculate"", and leave questions to the philosophers?","In general, I rather think people should do what they like.

There’s a certain irony in “Shut up and calculate” being taken as a prescription or rule to obey in order to be a “proper” physicist. This comes when you consider where the phrase originated. In this original formulation — due to a very good physicist indeed — it was immediately followed by dissent: “But I won’t shut up.”

The phrase is often attributed to Richard Feynman, even though he never said it. I suspect this is because we’ve reached the stage in the Feynman legend-building where he’s assumed to have said everything provocative that was said about physics in the late 20th Century. This happens for much the same reasons that anything witty said in the late 19th Century was subsequently attributed to Oscar Wilde.

No, it came from David Mermin, a condensed matter physicist, probably best known for the Mermin-Wagner theorem in quantum field theory (the insight that, via several twists and turns, shows the necessity for the Higgs field).

In 1989 Mermin published an article

 entitled “What’s wrong with this pillow?” which surveyed attitudes towards quantum mechanics in his generation:

Note how Mermin is presenting the message of “shut up and calculate” as a provoking one. He sees the Copenhagen interpretation as ordering him to act in a certain way, and — as an intellectually curious person — he immediately and violently reacts against it.

Mermin gives a bit more detail on his reasons a few lines further on (NB: the “second generation” he is referring to are those who were the students of Bohr, Heisenberg and the other founders of QM):

(Mermin, 1989
)

So, having presented “shut up and calculate” in terms that made it for him such an obvious doctrine to rebel against, Mermin must have been shocked to find it adopted unironically by the “proper” physics community as a slogan to rally around.

So, back to the question. Should physicists shut up and calculate?

If they like. Historically, it has proven a helpful heuristic, in that it has allowed good progress to be made without getting bogged down in deep, possibly intractable questions (quantum foundations is nothing if not boggy). So, from a practical point of view, go ahead: the prescription works, and this should not be ignored.

But I’d also urge attention to Mermin’s warning against this “ironfistedly soothing attitude” and wonder what one might be missing by taking his saying as a firm prescription. So I guess I’d say: of course physicists should feel free to just go ahead and calculate. But I can’t see why they must feel constrained to shut up about everything else, nor take it upon themselves to order their colleagues to do so too.

 This tendency to misattribute pithy sayings to people known for their pithy sayings has been dubbed the “Matthew effect”, apparently by the sociologist Robert Merton (but for consistency with the effect, it was probably someone less famous).

Elena Gold,Jan 16,What is Russian philosophy about?,"“Russian philosophy is in danger,” proclaimed the widow of philosopher Alexander Zinoviev — and demanded to test employees of Russia’s Institute of Philosophy “for patriotism” with a lie detector.

“In the second year of the special military operation, a terrible abscess opened up — the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The last refuge of scoundrels, traitors, foreign agents, defectors, Russophobes and extremists,” Olga Zinovieva announced at a specially organized press-conference broadcast by the state news agency TASS.

(Well, I don’t know about “the last refuge”. I’m pretty sure there are still a few places in Russia, quietly harboring “traitors, foreign agents and defectors” — despite unwavering Putunists’ efforts. But the state isn’t going to tolerate it, that’s for sure – not for long, by the looks of it. Everyone who thinks they can survive the madness by keeping quiet — they are so naive… Putin’s enforcers will come for everyone. One by one.)

“They are crooks who are fooling our people and the leadership of our country,” read Zinovieva from the paper in front of her, helpfully composed by diligent FSB copywriters.

“The Russophobes of the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences should be subjected to real denazification,” concluded Zinovieva.

“Real denazification”? Are they going to hit the Institute of Philosophy with a rocket? Or just arrest them, torture them — and then send them to GULAG labor camps?

48 years ago, TASS was reporting on Zinovieva’s husband, after putting philosopher Zinoviev through the KGB grinder.

Who is Olga Zinovieva?

Olga Zinovieva is the president of the institute named after her husband, who was a prominent figure of the modern Russian philosophy — as well as an anti-Stalinist and a dissident, who was expelled from the USSR and deprived of the Soviet citizenship for anti-Sovietism.

Alexander Zinoviev with his third wife Olga, a former stenographer, 23 years younger than him.

In 1976, Alexander Zinoviev was fired from the Russian Institute of Philosophy, where he worked, for “anti-patriotic actions incompatible with the title of the Soviet scientist”.

According to the good old Soviet tradition, his children and his brother were fired from their jobs as well. The brother was also expelled from Moscow. Friends stopped communicating with Zinoviev, only dissidents helped him financially — the family had nothing to live on.

Zinoviev was expelled from the Communist party and Moscow’s Institute of Philosophy for his novel “The Yawning Heights”, a satire deeply critical of the Soviet Union system. The book was translated to 26 languages.

His wife Olga was the editor and proofreader of “The Yawning Heights”.

After being kicked out from his job, Zinoviev continued to write. In 1978, 3 of his novels were published in Switzerland. One of them was named “The Radiant Future”.

This is where the patience of the USSR leaders ended: Zinoviev was forced to emigrate; his wife stayed by his side. Zinovievs emigrated to Germany.

They returned in 1999.
The year when Putin came to power.

Alexander Dugin, who is a professor of philosophy in the Moscow State University, enthusiastically supported Zinovieva’s proposal to test philosophers for patriotism on lie detector, and called the Institute of Philosophy a “backwater of Russophobes” that doesn’t have a single real specialist.

I wonder how would Vladimir Putin do when tested for patriotism on a lie detector? I suppose, fail miserably.

Alexander Dugin’s Neo-Eurasianism is centred on the idea of building a totalitarian, Russia-dominated Eurasian Empire.

Eurasianism has been officially endorsed in Russia's 2023 Foreign Policy Concept approved by Vladimir Putin, which defines Russia as a ""Eurasian and Euro-Pacific"" civilization-state.

Dugin’s philosophy insists on unification of Europe and Asia into a Russia-led state that must crash the Western hegemony in the world. All former Warsaw-block countries must be part of that new state.

Meanwhile, another professor of philosophy at the university under the Russian government called to stop teaching students critical thinking and fact-checking.

“Courses of so-called critical thinking and fact-checking were imposed from abroad, they have nothing to do with philosophical skepticism or logic. In fact, it’s a course in applied Russophobia,” says professor Dmitry Vinnik.

Obviously, critical thinking and fact-checking are major barriers to the greatness of Russia.

Vinnik also called for a ban on all educational programs that do not match “traditional” values, namely “gender, feminist, postmodernist and pacifist topics and courses.”

Leonid Polyakov, a professor at the National Research University of the Higher School of Economics, a member of the Zinoviev Club and the Presidential Human Rights Council, agrees with Vinnik.

He thinks there is an acute need to check the quality of teaching philosophy in Russia, because in his opinion, philosophy in Russia has largely succumbed to the influence of Western ideology.

Polyakov wants a specially developed official course in “Russian Philosophy” to be taught to students — instead of the courses with “no ideological significance”, that are “taught haphazardly, depending on who is teaching it”.

In other words, Polyakov wants propaganda to be taught — instead of philosophy.

It looks like a lot of Russians have been pretending to be normal people for 30 years, and were just waiting to finally crawl into the light and spew out some old Soviet feces.

They wanted to bring back the late USSR, but it turned out to be the early Soviet Union of Stalin’s times that they are reenacting.

When people say things like, “Russia is following in the footsteps of Nazi Germany”, it’s not some kind of idiom.

The language of hatred sounds louder and louder. Step by step, little by little. To ""the radiant future"".

The next step after the revision of philosophy, would be probably the revision of classical physics — after all, Newton was a Brit, so he definitely can’t be trusted.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mbwa9u34ptz6lfev', 'title': 'What is Russian philosophy about?', 'score': {'original': 0.99565, 'ai': 0.00435}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“Russian philosophy is in danger,” proclaimed the widow of philosopher Alexander Zinoviev — and demanded to test employees of Russia’s Institute of Philosophy “for patriotism” with a lie detector.\n\n“In the second year of the special military operation, a terrible abscess opened up — the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The last refuge of scoundrels, traitors, foreign agents, defectors, Russophobes and extremists,” Olga Zinovieva announced at a specially organized press-conference broadcast by the state news agency TASS.\n\n(Well, I don’t know about “the last refuge”. I’m pretty sure there are still a few places in Russia, quietly harboring “traitors, foreign agents and defectors” — despite unwavering Putunists’ efforts. But the state isn’t going to tolerate it, that’s for sure – not for long, by the looks of it. Everyone who thinks they can survive the madness by keeping quiet — they are so naive… Putin’s enforcers will come for everyone. One by one.)\n\n“They are crooks who are fooling our people and the leadership of our country,” read Zinovieva from the paper in front of her, helpfully composed by diligent FSB copywriters.\n\n“The Russophobes of the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences should be subjected to real denazification,” concluded Zinovieva.\n\n“Real denazification”? Are they going to hit the Institute of Philosophy with a rocket? Or just arrest them, torture them — and then send them to GULAG labor camps?\n\n48 years ago, TASS was reporting on Zinovieva’s husband, after putting philosopher Zinoviev through the KGB grinder.\n\nWho is Olga Zinovieva?\n\nOlga Zinovieva is the president of the institute named after her husband, who was a prominent figure of the modern Russian philosophy — as well as an anti-Stalinist and a dissident, who was expelled from the USSR and deprived of the Soviet citizenship for anti-Sovietism.\n\nAlexander Zinoviev with his third wife Olga, a former stenographer, 23 years younger than him.\n\nIn 1976, Alexander Zinoviev was fired from the Russian Institute of Philosophy, where he worked, for “anti-patriotic actions incompatible with the title of the Soviet scientist”.\n\nAccording to the good old Soviet tradition, his children and his brother were fired from their jobs as well. The brother was also expelled from Moscow. Friends stopped communicating with Zinoviev, only dissidents helped him financially — the family had nothing to live on.\n\nZinoviev was expelled from the Communist party and Moscow’s Institute of Philosophy for his novel “The Yawning Heights”, a satire deeply critical of the Soviet Union system. The book was translated to 26 languages.\n\nHis wife Olga was the editor and proofreader of “The Yawning Heights”.\n\nAfter being kicked out from his job, Zinoviev continued to write. In 1978, 3 of his novels were published in Switzerland. One of them was named “The Radiant Future”.\n\nThis is where the patience of the USSR leaders ended: Zinoviev was forced to emigrate; his wife stayed by his side. Zinovievs emigrated to Germany.\n\nThey returned in 1999.\nThe year when Putin came to power.\n\nAlexander Dugin, who is a professor of philosophy in the Moscow State University, enthusiastically supported Zinovieva’s proposal to test philosophers for patriotism on lie detector, and called the Institute of Philosophy a “backwater of Russophobes” that doesn’t have a single real specialist.\n\nI wonder how would Vladimir Putin do when tested for patriotism on a lie detector? I suppose, fail miserably.\n\nAlexander Dugin’s Neo-Eurasianism is centred on the idea of building a totalitarian, Russia-dominated Eurasian Empire.\n\nEurasianism has been officially endorsed in Russia\'s 2023 Foreign Policy Concept approved by Vladimir Putin, which defines Russia as a ""Eurasian and Euro-Pacific"" civilization-state.\n\nDugin’s philosophy insists on unification of Europe and Asia into a Russia-led state that must crash the Western hegemony in the world. All former Warsaw-block countries must be part of that new state.\n\nMeanwhile, another professor of philosophy at the university under the Russian government called to stop teaching students critical thinking and fact-checking.\n\n“Courses of so-called critical thinking and fact-checking were imposed from abroad, they have nothing to do with philosophical skepticism or logic. In fact, it’s a course in applied Russophobia,” says professor Dmitry Vinnik.\n\nObviously, critical thinking and fact-checking are major barriers to the greatness of Russia.\n\nVinnik also called for a ban on all educational programs that do not match “traditional” values, namely “gender, feminist, postmodernist and pacifist topics and courses.”\n\nLeonid Polyakov, a professor at the National Research University of the Higher School of Economics, a member of the Zinoviev Club and the Presidential Human Rights Council, agrees with Vinnik.\n\nHe thinks there is an acute need to check the quality of teaching philosophy in Russia, because in his opinion, philosophy in Russia has largely succumbed to the influence of Western ideology.\n\nPolyakov wants a specially developed official course in “Russian Philosophy” to be taught to students — instead of the courses with “no ideological significance”, that are “taught haphazardly, depending on who is teaching it”.\n\nIn other words, Polyakov wants propaganda to be taught — instead of philosophy.\n\nIt looks like a lot of Russians have been pretending to be normal people for 30 years, and were just waiting to finally crawl into the light and spew out some old Soviet feces.\n\nThey wanted to bring back the late USSR, but it turned out to be the early Soviet Union of Stalin’s times that they are reenacting.\n\nWhen people say things like, “Russia is following in the footsteps of Nazi Germany”, it’s not some kind of idiom.\n\nThe language of hatred sounds louder and louder.

David Moore,Updated 3y,"Did Nietzsche actually think that nothing matters? If so, why did he even bother to write all those books?","Oh, quite the opposite I’d say. I find Nietzsche very passionate. If you look at Ecce Homo (where he summarises his life and work), I think you’ll see that he considered himself something of a Messiah. His intent (so he says) was actually to lead mankind out of the Christian ‘nihilism’ that he found had poisoned and paralysed his European society. Nietzsche considered Christianity to be the worship of weakness - a deliberate self-humiliation that he found fatally harmful to human potential. Nietzsche wanted his fellows to cast aside the soporific drug of devotion that dulled men’s eyes to this world and fixed them on a ‘heaven’ that he thought to be a damaging delusion. Nietzsche wanted people to start concentrating on the here and now, and start building an ever greater future for themselves in this material world in which they have their whole being.

For all the hell that I give the guy, you can’t say he didn’t care. He cared a lot. He wanted to save people from the ‘salvation’ that he thought was killing them, ironically, and drag them out of the pseudoplatonic cave of Christianity into the light of material naturalism. Down with communion, up with a nutritious diet. Death to Jesus, up with Dionysus - that’s Nietzsche. In a way, his ‘gospel’ is almost summarised by an old piece of graffiti - he is trying to correct an error that he believes ruins everything.

Zarathustra, as the first psychologist of the good man, is perforce the friend of the evil man. When a degenerate kind of man has succeeded to the highest rank among the human species, his position must have been gained at the cost of the reverse type—at the cost of the strong man who is certain of life. When the gregarious animal stands in the glorious rays of the purest virtue, the exceptional man must be degraded to the rank of the evil. If falsehood insists at all costs on claiming the word ""truth"" for its own particular standpoint, the really truthful man must be sought out among the despised. Zarathustra allows of no doubt here; he says that it was precisely the knowledge of the good, of the ""best,"" which inspired his absolute horror of men. And it was out of this feeling of repulsion that he grew the wings which allowed him to soar into remote futures. He does not conceal the fact that his type of man is one which is relatively superhuman—especially as opposed to the ""good"" man, and that the good and the just would regard his superman as the devil.

""Ye higher men, on whom my gaze now falls, this is the doubt that ye wake in my breast, and this is my secret laughter: methinks ye would call my Superman—the devil! So strange are ye in your souls to all that is great, that the Superman would be terrible in your eyes for his goodness.""

It is from this passage, and from no other, that you must set out to understand the goal to which Zarathustra aspires—the kind of man that he conceives sees reality as it is; he is strong enough for this—he is not estranged or far removed from it, he is that reality himself, in his own nature can be found all the terrible and questionable character of reality: only thus can man have greatness.

Frederick Dolan,2y,What are the pros and cons of the political philosophy of John Locke?,"Pro: The principle of consent provides a universal standard for evaluating the legitimacy of political regimes.

Contra: The theory of property doesn't make much sense.

The idea that government should be based on the consent of the governed stems from the idea that human beings are free. Because freedom is foundational, freely given consent is the only thing that could legitimize political rule. That we are free, and have rights, are natural facts about human beings, not statuses conferred by governments or societies. Even governments that do not acknowledge human rights, therefore, can be criticized for their refusal to do so.

The principle of consent says that someone may do something to you only if they have your permission to do so. Express consent is freely, knowingly, openly, and explicitly given. But most people have not expressly consented to their government, from which it would appear to follow that no government is legitimate. Locke’s solution to this problem is his doctrine of tacit consent: merely by living in a society, he says, people are implicitly or tacitly consenting to its laws.

This might be taken to imply that “consent” means something like “not unwilling.” Is that robust enough for something as important as political legitimacy? If I visit Cuba, I am presumably not unwilling to obey its laws. Does that mean I regard Communism as a legitimate form of government?

Depending on how you interpret Locke, it’s possible that the legitimacy of a government doesn’t depend on consent, despite what he seems to say. On one interpretation, Locke is really saying that a government is legitimate just in case it conforms to what natural law requires, namely that it protects the lives, liberties, and estates of its citizens.

On this view, it’s not the mere giving of consent that confers legitimacy on a government, it’s the justified giving of consent. Without this proviso, a government that violated the natural rights of its citizens would be legitimate, provided a majority of its citizens approved of its violations. The idea is that a free people will, if competent, give their consent only to governments that deserve it. If they consent to a government that doesn't deserve it, that’s prima facie evidence they are not competent to give consent. People who are ignorant, misinformed, deluded, or otherwise incapacitated are unable to meaningfully give consent, even if they appear to do so.

In modern constitutional democracies, the people give or withdraw consent by means of elections. But the mere form of an election, one might argue, doesn’t indicate consent. Free and informed consent requires certain conditions, for example access to reliable information about candidates and parties. How well-informed is the electorate? To what extent is the electorate’s judgment distorted by misinformation, propaganda, ignorance, lack of education, lack of opportunity to participate in political deliberation and debate, or lack of a disposition to do so? These questions indicate that consent and legitimacy might not be an either/or phenomenon: there might be degrees of consent such that a government can be “more or less” legitimate.

This is a slippery line of thought, however. Who but the people are qualified to determine whether the people are competent? Can a democracy tolerate an authority “above” the people that evaluates the quality of the people’s judgment?

According to Locke, the world initially belonged to everyone in common. Under these circumstances, it might seem that if an individual desired to appropriate some of the fruits of the earth for private use, the principle of consent would require him or her to get everyone else’s permission to do so. But if that were the case, then the fruits of the earth couldn’t be used by any individual, since it’s impossible to get everyone’s consent. To preserve life, however, it is necessary to appropriate the fruits of the earth for private use, and making that impossible would violate the law of nature, which gives everyone the right to preserve their lives. So there must be some legitimate way to appropriate the fruits of the earth without getting everyone’s consent.

This is done, Locke says, by laboring to acquire the fruits of nature. Each individual owns his or her body and, therefore, the labor of his or her body. An individual acquires property in things with which he “mixes” something he owns. Therefore, a person acquires property in things with which he has mixed his labor, namely the products of his labor.

As many have pointed out, this is less an argument than a metaphor, and an odd one. Isn’t it just as plausible to say that when you mix something you own with something you don’t own, you lose the former?

What Locke seems to have in mind is the idea that if most of the value of a given product is the result of the labor that produced it, then the product loses its status as common property and acquires the status of private property. Even so, it seems like a peculiar way to think about property and value. Isn’t value determined by supply and demand, and isn’t ownership a legal or contractual relationship?

Things get more complicated when Locke introduces money, which, according to him, requires consent, namely the consent to treat certain pieces of paper and metal as if they had a value in addition to their purely physical characteristics. For reasons I won’t go into, the introduction of money makes possible unlimited acquisition, which leads to inequality because the productive and industrious minority eventually owns all there is to own. Because we consented to money, and because money leads to inequality, we consented to inequality – tacitly if not expressly.

The idea seems to be that if you consent to something, you consent to all its entailments and consequences, including the unpredicted and unpredictable ones. But this seems to violate the principle of informed consent. If we didn't know we were committing ourselves to inequality when we consented to money, how can we be said to have consented to inequality? And can it possibly be right to think that a current generation is bound by consent given thousands of years ago by its ancestors?

That we are free, and have rights, are natural facts about human beings, not statuses conferred by governments or societies. Even governments that do not acknowledge human rights, therefore, can be criticized for their refusal to do so.\n\nThe principle of consent says that someone may do something to you only if they have your permission to do so. Express consent is freely, knowingly, openly, and explicitly given. But most people have not expressly consented to their government, from which it would appear to follow that no government is legitimate. Locke’s solution to this problem is his doctrine of tacit consent: merely by living in a society, he says, people are implicitly or tacitly consenting to its laws.\n\nThis might be taken to imply that “consent” means something like “not unwilling.” Is that robust enough for something as important as political legitimacy? If I visit Cuba, I am presumably not unwilling to obey its laws. Does that mean I regard Communism as a legitimate form of government?\n\nDepending on how you interpret Locke, it’s possible that the legitimacy of a government doesn’t depend on consent, despite what he seems to say. On one interpretation, Locke is really saying that a government is legitimate just in case it conforms to what natural law requires, namely that it protects the lives, liberties, and estates of its citizens.\n\nOn this view, it’s not the mere giving of consent that confers legitimacy on a government, it’s the justified giving of consent. Without this proviso, a government that violated the natural rights of its citizens would be legitimate, provided a majority of its citizens approved of its violations. The idea is that a free people will, if competent, give their consent only to governments that deserve it. If they consent to a government that doesn't deserve it, that’s prima facie evidence they are not competent to give consent. People who are ignorant, misinformed, deluded, or otherwise incapacitated are unable to meaningfully give consent, even if they appear to do so.\n\nIn modern constitutional democracies, the people give or withdraw consent by means of elections. But the mere form of an election, one might argue, doesn’t indicate consent. Free and informed consent requires certain conditions, for example access to reliable information about candidates and parties. How well-informed is the electorate? To what extent is the electorate’s judgment distorted by misinformation, propaganda, ignorance, lack of education, lack of opportunity to participate in political deliberation and debate, or lack of a disposition to do so? These questions indicate that consent and legitimacy might not be an either/or phenomenon: there might be degrees of consent such that a government can be “more or less” legitimate.\n\nThis is a slippery line of thought, however. Who but the people are qualified to determine whether the people are competent? Can a democracy tolerate an authority “above” the people that evaluates the quality of the people’s judgment?\n\nAccording to Locke, the world initially belonged to everyone in common. Under these circumstances, it might seem that if an individual desired to appropriate some of the fruits of the earth for private use, the principle of consent would require him or her to get everyone else’s permission to do so. But if that were the case, then the fruits of the earth couldn’t be used by any individual, since it’s impossible to get everyone’s consent. To preserve life, however, it is necessary to appropriate the fruits of the earth for private use, and making that impossible would violate the law of nature, which gives everyone the right to preserve their lives. So there must be some legitimate way to appropriate the fruits of the earth without getting everyone’s consent.\n\nThis is done, Locke says, by laboring to acquire the fruits of nature. Each individual owns his or her body and, therefore, the labor of his or her body. An individual acquires property in things with which he “mixes” something he owns. Therefore, a person acquires property in things with which he has mixed his labor, namely the products of his labor.\n\nAs many have pointed out, this is less an argument than a metaphor, and an odd one. Isn’t it just as plausible to say that when you mix something you own with something you don’t own, you lose the former?\n\nWhat Locke seems to have in mind is the idea that if most of the value of a given product is the result of the labor that produced it, then the product loses its status as common property and acquires the status of private property. Even so, it seems like a peculiar way to think about property and value. Isn’t value determined by supply and demand, and isn’t ownership a legal or contractual relationship?\n\nThings get more complicated when Locke introduces money, which, according to him, requires consent, namely the consent to treat certain pieces of paper and metal as if they had a value in addition to their purely physical characteristics. For reasons I won’t go into, the introduction of money makes possible unlimited acquisition, which leads to inequality because the productive and industrious minority eventually owns all there is to own. Because we consented to money, and because money leads to inequality, we consented to inequality – tacitly if not expressly.\n\nThe idea seems to be that if you consent to something, you consent to all its entailments and consequences, including the unpredicted and unpredictable ones. But this seems to violate the principle of informed consent. If we didn't know we were committing ourselves to inequality when we consented to money, how can we be said to have consented to inequality? And can it possibly be right to think that a current generation is bound by consent given thousands of years ago by its ancestors?\n\nBelow, John Locke, by Richard Westmacott, University College, London, 1808."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.33366666666667
Frederick Dolan,3y,The limits of my language means the limits of my world. – Ludwig Wittgenstein. What do you make of this statement?,"A key to understanding the statement is to keep in mind that “my world” (5.62) is not identical to the world – or so it seems at first, anyway. The world includes everything that is the case, that is, all the states of affairs. A state of affairs is “a combination of objects” (2.01). But there are more possible states of affairs than there are states of affairs that obtain. These logical possibilities are part of reality.

For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case. (1.12)

The existence and non-existence of states of affairs is reality. (2.06)

Thus, “the sum-total of reality is the world” (2.063) – the world, again, not my world.

Language consists of propositions about, or “pictures” of, the world. Since the world is the states of affairs that exist together with the states of affairs that don’t exist, language is limited to picturing actual and possible states of affairs. This means that we can only talk about how objects are or could be combined with one another, i.e. states of affairs that either do or do not obtain.

All this being so, the limits of my language must coincide with the limits of my world. My world – the world that concerns me, the things I may deal with – consists of what I’m able to picture to myself, which is confined to the actual and possible states of affairs that my knowledge of language permits me to represent.

From this reasoning, Wittgenstein makes a remarkable inference: the distinction between the world and my world cannot be maintained.

The world is my world: this is manifest in the fact that the limits of … that language which I alone understand … mean the limits of my world. (5.62)

Reality – the world – is exhausted by actual and possible states of affairs. It would therefore be incoherent to say that there are some things that are not in the world; it would be like saying that there are possibilities that are impossible.

And if the world is nothing but actual and possible states of affairs, and language – including my language – is nothing but pictures of actual and possible states of affairs, then there is nothing that language – including my language – cannot represent, and there can be nothing in the world that is not in my world.

Frederick Dolan,1y,What is the sad part of philosophy?,"Christine Korsgaard spoke not too long ago about a sad part of philosophy, in her 2022 Dewey Lecture:

Young people are expected to produce an absurdly large number of papers, preferably published in refereed journals, in order to get tenure, or even in order to get jobs. Some people even try to publish papers in order to get into graduate school. The papers are supposed to be blind reviewed, and these days many referees for journals require that papers should respond to the extant literature on the topic, whether responding to the extant literature enhances the author’s argument in some way or not. Because the sheer mass of the literature is growing exponentially, people draw the boundaries of their specializations more and more narrowly, both in terms of subject matter and in terms of time. The extant literature necessarily becomes the recent literature, which is a philosophically arbitrary category.

She added:

Peer review can be used as a way to enforce a kind of conformity that is not appropriate to our subject. I take it seriously that philosophy is a subject in the humanities, or as one might say on the “Arts” side of “Arts and Sciences.” Like artists, we go for expressing universal truths, but in an individual voice. I think that many young people in philosophy right now feel that they are not being allowed to find and express their individual voices.

Among other sad things, this leads to bad writing as one comes to think of one’s audience as one’s peer reviewers and co-specialists. But there’s a way to buck this trend:

Philosophy is very hard, but it is not inevitable that philosophy should be esoteric; we just need to keep in view a certain conception of our reader. Our reader, our proper audience when we write philosophy, is not a journal referee, looking for a reason to reject our paper. Our reader is not a harsh philosophical critic, eager to catch us out in contradiction. Our reader is not someone who is unwilling to entertain a surprising hypothesis long enough to see where it goes. Our proper audience in philosophy is a reflective human being who is puzzled and confounded by her own condition, and who seeks understanding, meaning, and moral clarity. Philosophy is so difficult that we are afraid to try to address ourselves to readers conceived simply as human beings prone to philosophical perplexity. But if you think about it, you’ll realize that you understand the needs of that reader, because that reader is you.

Frederick Dolan,Updated 2y,"I've been looking into some classic Greek philosophers, but I still can't understand the differences between Socrates, Platos, and Aristotle’s philosophies. Can someone help me?","Take a look at Raphael’s The School of Athens (1511).

In the center, walking side-by side, are Plato (left) and Aristotle (right).

To Plato’s right, we find Socrates.

I don’t know what the experts say, but this looks to me like a scene from the Meno in which Socrates leads a servant through the steps required to double the area of a square. Or perhaps it represents one of the arguments for the “forms” in the Republic, where Socrates asks Glaucon to consider three of his fingers, one of which is larger, one of which is smaller, and one of which is in between.

Either way, these moments occur in the context of a conversation about the nature of virtue (Meno) or justice (Republic), which are Socrates’ basic concerns. What is the essence of goodness? Socrates spent his time in the marketplace questioning people in order to undermine their confidence in the truth of their beliefs about goodness, which he thought were unlikely to survive scrutiny. He characterized himself as a “gadfly” who aimed to sting his fellow-citizens with his questions and disturb their complacency.

Going back to Plato, we see that he is looking at Aristotle and pointing upward.

He’s saying that reality consists of timeless, eternal, unchanging “forms” or ideas, and that the world our senses reveal to us is made up of imperfect reflections of the forms.

Plato carries a copy of his Timeaus, which presents the cosmos as having been modeled on the forms. The purpose of Platonic philosophy is to acquire knowledge of the basic constituents of reality, and this is best accomplished by withdrawing from society and devoting oneself to the contemplative life.

Aristotle is returning Plato’s gaze and gesturing towards the world around and in front of the two philosophers.

For him, the pursuit of knowledge consists of observing the great variety of things in the world, which are as real as can be, and classifying them in terms of common and distinguishing features. A philosopher employs observation as well as logic, and the standards of validity for an inquiry should accommodate the nature of its subject. We shouldn’t expect deductive truths in a treatise on politics.

Aristotle carries a copy of his Ethics, which argues that a virtuous life requires participation in society and politics. Knowledge of how to live well takes the form of “practical wisdom” or know-how, not that of a theory or scientific explanation.

Frederick Dolan,Updated 2y,"How would Nietzsche's claims like ""no facts, only interpretations"" be applicable to the conspiracy theories, alternative facts, or other false narratives floating on social media or other parts of society today?","When he wrote there are no facts, only interpretations, Nietzsche didn’t mean that there are literally no facts. He meant that there are no facts whose significance and value is self-evident – no facts that, as it were, speak for themselves. When we talk about the meaning of events or states of affairs, and when we assess what about them is good or bad, we are interpreting them. To say that there are only interpretations is a hyperbolic way of saying that facts are of interest to us only in so far as they mean something to us and affect us in ways that benefit or harm us. Nietzsche’s term for this doctrine is “perspectivism.”

Perspectivism helps explain the appeal of conspiracy theory insofar as it suggests that to some people, an engrossing or otherwise satisfying interpretation is more important than a factually accurate one.

Nietzsche’s question would be why believing in a conspiracy theory makes its believers feel powerful. According
 to the American Psychological Association, “[p]eople believe in conspiracy theories for a variety of reasons – to explain random events, to feel special or unique, or for a sense of social belonging, to name a few.” Some psychologists speculate that people who are attracted to conspiracy theories suffer from status anxiety, and that believing in such theories enables them to feel more sophisticated than the rest of us and hence superior to us.

Frederick Dolan,3y,What did Adam Smith outline about the dangers of capitalism?,"There are some good answers here, but so far as I can see only Cecili Chadwick’s touches on what strikes me as an important issue, albeit one that’s not much discussed today. She says what needs to be said, but I’ll add some context.

The issue is the effects of specialization and the division of labor. One effect, of course, is increased productivity. Smith famously uses
 the example of pin manufacturing.

One man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations…. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and … they could … make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day.

But increased productivity is not the only effect of specialization. As Smith goes on to say
:

The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.

To the extent that manufacturing is done by robots, perhaps the mental stultification caused by the division of labor is not a problem. Ideally, all work that no human beings want to do, either because it’s too boring or too dangerous, would be performed by robots, and I suppose there’s no reason in principle why this couldn't be achieved. Until then, however, the trade-off between increasing productivity and preserving skilled and satisfying work will (or should) be an issue.

On there other hand, Smith may have been exaggerating and over-generalizing. Here are some photographs of the assembly line at the 1960s Ford Mustang plant in Milpitas, California.

These men don’t look stupid and ignorant to me.

The sort of thing below, however, does seem tedious.

Feifei Wang,Updated 2y,"What is the best philosophical conversation that you've had? Where, when, and with whom? What did you discuss?","I once had an interesting conversation with a friend and colleague of mine about the humanity of an AI. So at which point an AI is developed enough to be considered human.

It started as a fun chat about EDI from the Mass Effect franchise.

EDI started out as the onboard computer for Commander Shapard’s ship Normandy in Mass Effect 2.

And by Mass Effect 3, she got a killer body and can accompany Shapdard on their missions.

And if Shapard decides to help Joker, Normandy's pilot, and EDI, they will eventually become a couple.

So obviously by the end of Mass Effect, EDI is sentient, intelligent, has consciousness and compassion, capable of love and human emotions, capable of making independent complicated moral decisions. So all in all, EDI has humanity and should be treated as a human.

But did EDI start out with humanity? Or did she develop humanity during her travels with Shapard and crew, through her relationship with Joker the pilot?

If she developed humanity, at which point did she stop being a calculating machine, and start to be a human?

Compare to another Mass Effect AI character, Legion, one could argue that, while Legion has emotion, compassion, capable of making complicated moral decisions, Legion was never human. That doesn’t mean he should be treated less, but Geth being a hivemind “species”, Legion’s entire consensus-building decision-making process, his connection with the rest of his species, means he’ll never be human. He doesn’t seem to have the individualism that comes with every human.

So we started to talk about this in the office, and we kept talking about it on our way to lunch, and drag the entire elevator of people into the conversation, and people seemed very engaged, even some of them didn’t know what Mass Effect was. One guy we didn’t know from another office actually thanked us for the conversation when he get off the elevator.

We continue to talk about it over lunch.

It went way over to AI’s humanity to “how do we define humanity”? Which is a much larger issue. We talked about the Ship of Theseus, that if we were able to create a human body for EDI and somehow put her consciousness into that human body, she would be a human, but does that meat suit matter? That’s the ship of Theseus, right? How much of you can be replaced before it changes your core identity before you’re no longer “YOU”?

So how much could you maintain your humanity if you were stripped down to the bare minimum of a “human”, and beyond that point, you’re no longer a human?

How much of you can be replaced before it changes your core identity before you’re no longer “YOU”?\n\nSo how much could you maintain your humanity if you were stripped down to the bare minimum of a “human”, and beyond that point, you’re no longer a human?\n\nIt was a fun time… I miss that friend and our conversations."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9996
Franklin Veaux,1y,"Are there philosophers who think that God, whether He really exists or not, is evil? E.g. God is no different than a dictator since you'll die if you don't comply with what He says/the negative effects of the sense of guilty and shame for sinning/…","Yes. This isn’t even an uncommon idea.

Greek philosopher Epicurus first outlined the “Problem of Evil” (or at least, his formulation is the earliest we have):

Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then from whence comes evil?

William Rowe put it this way:

There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.

An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.

Ergo, there does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.

Many other philosophers, including Hume, John Hick, and Paul Draper, have made similar arguments.

Calvinists were totally fine with accepting an evil God, a God who would condemn people to Hell before they were even born, regardless of the life choices they made, simply to prove his sovereignty. Calvinists believed that Satan is merely God’s puppet, doing exactly what God wants, and the Fall of Man was engineered by God.

In On the Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche wrote:

because of this, my curiosity as well as my suspicions had to pause early on at the question about where our good and evil really originated. In fact, already as a thirteen-year-old lad, my mind was occupying itself with the problem of the origin of evil. At an age when one has “half childish play, half God in one’s heart,” I devoted my first childish literary trifle, my first written philosophical exercise, to this problem—and so far as my “solution” to it at that time is concerned, well, I gave that honour to God, as is reasonable, and made him the father of evil.

Stephen Fry has said:

Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac. Totally selfish. We have to spend our life on our knees thanking him?! What kind of god would do that?

The early Gnostic Christians, faced with the stark contrast of the Old Testament God (a genocidal, bloodthirsty, petty, vicious, vindictive monster) and the message of Christ’s love, solved the problem by believing the Old Testament God was not the true God of Christ, but a petty, evil God trying to usurp the real God’s place. Jesus was sent by the true God, the God of Love, to show us that the Old Testament God was an evil imposter. (That’s an oversimplification, but it gets the basic idea across.)

The idea that God is evil is so common in philosophy it has a name: it’s called maltheism, from mal bad, evil + theos god.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hcodawkbtr20gms6', 'title': ""Are there philosophers who think that God, whether He really exists or not, is evil?
