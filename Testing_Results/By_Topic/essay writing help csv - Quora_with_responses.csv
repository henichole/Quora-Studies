Sean Kernan,2y,Does writing improve your thinking?,"It teaches you to consider more variables.

Everything about writing is achieving balance. I often think about sentences and ideas as sandwiched between two poles:

Confidence vs arrogance

Specific detail vs excess information

Logical flow vs being too predictable

Being original vs trying too hard to be original

Balancing complexity with simplicity

It’s a very analytical craft. This is what editing is all about. Catching typos is only 10% of the editing process.

And as you go out into the world, you catch yourself being more analytical and thoughtful about your conversations, ideas, and reflections on your own life. This is a very beneficial hobby.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/oys1bgeavtlurzqn', 'title': 'Does writing improve your thinking?', 'score': {'original': 0.9971, 'ai': 0.0029}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It teaches you to consider more variables.\n\nEverything about writing is achieving balance.

Brandon Ross,Updated 1y,I have a 15-page essay due in 5 hours. What should I do?,"Fire off an email asking for an extension of time. (You should’ve asked for an advance days/weeks ago.)
Assess the penalty for being a day late.
Is it 10% off per day? You might want to give yourself a day.
Is it a zero? Well. You need to get moving…
If you know enough to write the essay…
15 pages. 250 words per page. 3750 words.
If you type 30 wpm, that’s 2 hours of work.
So, spend 10–20 minutes making your crap outline.
Spend 2–3 hours writing your crap essay. Braindump. Take a 10 minute break in the middle.
Proofread/edit your crap for an hour to make it slightly less crap.
See if you got a reply back on your extension request.
Giving yourself at least 30 minutes to solve technical issues encountered while submitting your crap.
Kick yourself in the ass repeatedly for waiting until the last day to begin work.

Alice Baker,1y,A professor friend of mine said that he can tell what grade he will give an essay from just the first paragraph alone. Is this common among professors? My friend makes it sound like professors don't really read the essays fully.,"Before I address your question directly, let me ask you a few questions.

When you walk into a new restaurant, how long does it take you to form an opinion about how good the food will be?
How much of a movie do you have to see before you get a pretty good idea about how good the entire movie is?

Not long. Right?

Now, this doesn’t mean your predictions will be 100% accurate. But they’re probably accurate most of the time. And if you’re like most people, you’re confident enough about the predictive value of your initial impressions to have walked out of at least one restaurant without even bothering to order, and to have stopped watching at least one movie within the first five minutes. Right?

Your professor isn’t saying that he doesn’t read the essays fully. The only thing he’s saying is that it doesn’t take him long to predict what the final grade will be.

Aanchal Sharma,7mo,How do you start an introduction essay about yourself?,"When it comes to MBA admissions essays, the ""self-description” essay is very likely to be one of the shortest you encounter. This essay is set apart from the others due to its lack of professional orientation and its relatively informal nature, but it is still to be taken with the utmost seriousness. Your application in its entirety will be closely examined by the admissions committee and so you must make sure that every part of it, including the ""self-description” essay, stands up to scrutiny.

In most cases, the word limit for this essay will be in the 300 to 500 words range and its prompt will require you to introduce yourself to your MBA classmates-to-be. Do not be led astray by the seemingly informal nature of the prompt; the essay is not meant to be a reproduction of the kind of informal conversation you would have with a classmate. Instead, this essay should adopt a semi-formal tone, and present a selection of your profile USPs in a compelling manner.

You can simplify your approach to the essay by regarding it in the same way you would an introduction you have been asked to give in class at the behest of an instructor. In such a hypothetical situation, you would likely touch upon your professional history and your motivation to pursue an MBA, but also present a more personal view of your life journey. Thus, you should use this essay to give the reader a more natural overview of your personality and beliefs, and use it as an opportunity to reveal the in-and-outs of your thought process.

Your essay should commence on a striking note, such as an unusual factoid about your experiences that carries some entertainment value as well. This will grip the reader from the outset and place them in a more favourable state of mind as you proceed to, in the next part of your essay, give them context for your formative background and your individual ideology. Thereafter, provide information about your academic and professional history, while also being careful to not make the essay seem like a rehash of the other application materials. The point of this essay is to communicate a perspective that is semi-formal yet deeply personal. The ""self-description"" essay is where you can go into detail about the different points of inspiration in your life and put forth the different facets of your personality. Treat this essay as a chance to delve into parts of yourself that you have not been able to touch upon in the rest of the MBA application.

This essay also gives you the chance to state outright that you desire to accelerate your self-actualization in the MBA classroom by making the most of your peers' insights and by adding to their maturation as well. After using the essay to explain all that you wish to about the different experiences and beliefs that constitute your personhood, end on an inviting note.

Anthony Zarrella,3y,"How can I learn to write in my own words e.g when I watch a lecture and write down the summary, I use the teacher's words even if I try not to, but MAINLY because the idea is already in the best articulated form possible so I will only make it bad?","You’re missing the point of “using your own words”—though it’s probably not your fault, since most teachers don’t bother to explain it.

The point of learning to “use your own words” is not because it’s bad to use someone else’s (assuming you’re not passing them off as your own original work, i.e., plagiarism).

In fact, your instinct—to use the “best” words even if they aren’t your own—is entirely correct in legal or technical writing. If I’m writing a brief on permissible types of speech regulations, and I see that all the case law and treatises use the phrase, “time, place, and manner”, then I’m not going to get cute and write something like, “temporality, location, and methodology” because I don’t know if a court will agree with me that the two phrases mean the same thing or have all the same, exact nuances. No, I’m going to shamelessly copy out, “time, place, and manner” because I know that’s correct.

However… the ability to “paraphrase”—to rephrase a concept in your own words even if they’re not the best words—is a good indicator of whether you properly understand the concept.

A lecture summary that says, “The elements of negligence are duty, breach, cause, and harm,” is entirely accurate. But it’s not very useful, because all it demonstrates is your ability to accurately record what the teacher said.

On the other hand, a summary that says, “To sue for negligence, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant had some obligation towards him, that the defendant violated that obligation in some way, that the violation was the cause of some event that affected the plaintiff, and that the event caused the plaintiff some real injury or disadvantage,” is slightly less accurate—it necessarily leaves out some of the complex nuances of the legal concepts involved, for instance, not every “disadvantage” will be “harm” in a legal sense. But it is far more useful, because it demonstrates that you understand how “negligence” actually works and you’ll be able to apply that analysis to a problem on an exam (or in real legal practice).

Now, I assume you’re not in law school (the use of “teacher” rather than “professor” is a giveaway)—but the same idea applies to other subjects. Your teacher’s words may be the best words (maybe, not always), but if you can’t convert them to “your” words, then you probably don’t understand the concept well enough and should ask for help after class.

And that is why teachers insist that you “use your own words”, particularly on tests and essays—because you’re not in class to learn how to memorize and repeat phrases, you’re there to learn to understand the concepts.

So… for the actual question you asked…

How do you learn to do that?

Well, imagine you’re talking to a parent or friend about what you learned in school today, and you repeat the teacher’s words… and the other person says, “I don’t understand, can you explain that another way?”

How do you respond?

You say the teacher’s words are the “best articulated form possible”—so how do you know? You must have some conceptual idea that you’re comparing to.

If you can think of another way to say it (even if it’s not quite as perfectly articulated), then you know how to say it in your own words.

If you can’t think of another way to say it, then maybe you don’t understand it as well as you think.

Taru,25-Aug,How can I write a comparison essay introduction?,"If you know how to critically assess two subjects and weigh their similarities and differences simultaneously, writing a comparison essay is simple.

This prevalent kind of essay writing is frequently assigned to students while they are enrolled in high school or even college courses. They must maintain their attention on the factors they are weighing while comparing the subjects in this. However, the initial step entails creating an outline and then writing an attention-grabbing introduction. However, a lot of students struggle with writing the introduction because they feel under pressure because it is this section of the essay that influences the reader's first impression.

You need to be sure to capture the readers' interest before you begin writing your essay's introduction. If you keep this in mind, I promise it will help you avoid mistakes and give you a plan to follow as you write.
An excellent yet simple technique to start a comparison essay is by providing a brief history of the subject. You can discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the subject here. The reader will gain a better understanding of the topics you will discuss later in the body paragraphs thanks to it.
You must include a phrase or two that summarizes the essential details and offers insight into the key idea or central theme of your essay.
Make sure to include some supporting information on the subject after stating the main argument. For the same, you can use pertinent instances. You'll be able to deliver authenticity using it. You can discuss the personalities in both of the subjects you are comparing in addition to the instances. It will serve as supporting proof that demonstrates your point all at once.
Finally, at the conclusion of the introduction, you should include some compelling yet concise arguments for the significance of the subject. You can achieve this by merely mentioning an issue and offering a workable solution that immediately conveys the significance of it.

Ben Waggoner,1y,Can you write a 200 word essay on how good communication in the workplace plays a vital role in an organization/a company?,"Everyone else is just being mean. I'd be happy to write you this essay. Here goes!

Few things are more vital in any organization, whether a for-profit business or a non-profit association, than clear communication. Managers must comminicate orders and directives to their supervisees as an integral part of leadership. A manager who fails to keep subordinates informed as to what they should be doing, how they should be doing it, and what resources they have risks a complete collapsation of morale. Indeed, we see that employees cannot organisize projects, or collaborate effectively, if they are unable to communitate their shared objectives and startegies.

Karume Olang,22-Sep,How can I write a comparison essay introduction?,"The introduction to your comparison essay is important because it sets the stage for the rest of your paper. It needs to grab the reader's attention, introduce the topic, and state your thesis statement.

Here are some tips on how to write a comparison essay introduction:

· Start with a hook. This is a catchy sentence or phrase that will grab the reader's attention and make them want to read more. You could use a question, a surprising statistic, or a relevant anecdote.

· Introduce the topic. Briefly explain the two subjects that you will be comparing and contrasting.

· State your thesis statement. This is the main argument of your essay, and it should clearly state what you will be comparing and contrasting and how they differ or are similar.

Here is an example of a comparison essay introduction:

Hook: Shakespeare's Hamlet and Macbeth are two of the most famous tragedies ever written, but they are also very different plays.

Introduce the topic: Hamlet is a brooding prince who is torn between his desire for revenge and his fear of taking action. Macbeth is a brave general who is ambitious and power-hungry.

State the thesis statement: In this essay, I will compare and contrast the two characters, focusing on their different motivations, their tragic flaws, and their ultimate downfalls.

This introduction is effective because it starts with a hook that grabs the reader's attention. It then introduces the topic of the essay and states the thesis statement clearly and concisely.

Here are some additional tips for writing a comparison essay introduction:

· Be specific. Don't just say that you are going to compare and contrast two things. Say what specific aspects of those things you will be comparing and contrasting.

· Avoid clichés. Avoid using clichés like ""as different as night and day"" or ""two sides of the same coin."" These phrases are overused and unoriginal.

· Be interesting. Try to write an introduction that is both informative and engaging. Make the reader want to read more to find out what you have to say.

How To Write an Introduction Paragraph About Yourself?

To write good about yourself, following steps should be followed:

Introducing yourself
Stating your interest
Funneling the topic
Write good details
Keep the tone good

Let’s discuss these in details now so you get a good idea of writing perfect introducing yourself paragraph.

Introducing Yourself

As stated earlier, ask yourself those questions and continue to write. With so much of clutter faced in life, the skills, expertise and experiences etc. it might be difficult at times to introduce yourself. But one needs to write brief, starting from 3-4 sentences long self-introduction as to who am I and what have I done. Etc. How to introduce yourself in a paragraph? Here is a simple yet effective intro

Examples:

“My name is XYZ. I grew up as the youngest child in my family. I am the most cuddled child from both sides of my family”.

Stating your interest

After introducing yourself briefly, now is the time to state interests and talents that the writer has gotten. One might be limited at this stage thinking as what to state and what to not. Hence, it is advisable to state those talents and skills that’s considered to be more relevant and accurate however, generic. It is also advised to brainstorm ideas and rough draft what to write in it, transforming it into shape and neat draft later on.

Example:

“Always involved in humorous activities, I am an extrovert with jolly nature and always wants to be surrounded by people that wants to be entertained. I also know the talent of being quiet at places where I need to be. Not always supported by many, but some of the closest people helped me excel in whatever my goals are”.

Funneling the topic

By funneling the topic, we mean that after stating the interest generically, now is the time to narrow down to the specific topic. Choose the most informative and interesting topic about yourself to write more about it. it is a better idea to choose single topic with good information on it, rather than choosing generic topics with no relevant information.

Example:

Back to the time at my college, I participated in almost every drama, stage shows, comedy scenes etc. arranged by the college. But because of the constant request and unhappy nature of my family about my non-seriousness in curricular activities, I quit the non-curricular ones and guess what happened was that I proved to be the top scorer of my entire college….

Write good details

After funneling the topic, now is the time to hold the audience to the introductory paragraph about yourself. Hence, it is advisable to write good details of whatever the specific interests of the writer are. Do not state simple and direct sentences, rather than make an engaging sentence referring to the specific topic. Here is how.

Example:

“While growing up, I watched most of the funny shows on TV with my family every weekend. Everyone enjoyed it ever since but I was adapting it. ever since, I became a fan of comedy and start applying it on myself; making people laugh”.

Do not tell this way: “I love comedy as I grew up watching it”.

Keep the tone good

Keeping the tone good should be another art of the writer. Even if the writer is most talented person in the world, the tone should not be such that it represents boosting of something and a non-humble tone. Always use a good tone to represent yourself. Remember! The audience is not there to listen to the braggy sentences.

Example:

“I am honored to be awarded with gold medals in non-curricular activities almost every time I participate. I was happiest person when I found it to be a record.”

How to introduce yourself professionally

To introduce yourself professionally, do the followings:

Keeping relevancy
Deviate from the title
State your contributions
Be authentic and yourself
Prepare good

Now let’s discuss these in detail:

Keeping relevancy

While introducing professionally, it is good to keep relevancy in that introduction as to who are you, what do you do etc.

Deviate from the title

Titles always make the introduction short and non-precise. To ensure the introduction include about what the writer do, he should deviate from the actual title and write about what he actually does.

State your contributions

The contribution one state should be such that it answers what the writer helps to do? what’s his contribution while doing the job? This is how one state his contributions. This also works in body paragraphs.

Be authentic and yourself

While writing, it does not mean to decorate the writing through information which doesn’t relate to the writer, be authentic, this is what the audience search for. Being yourself will help to introduce only yourself and not fascinate others through colorful writing. Utilizing a thesis statement generator can further enhance the authenticity and focus of your writing.

Prepare good

To prepare good for professional introduction, it is advisable to brainstorm some ideas and roughly write it. After going through the above steps, one might be able to transform the rough draft into a neat piece of writing.

How To End an Introduction Paragraph About Yourself?

An introductory paragraph usually ends with a sentence identifying the event that will be happening next. In short, it will be a summary of the next paragraph you will be discussing. For a self-introductory paragraph, it is usually ended just like the intro of some essay, with a thesis statement. This thesis statement will represent the entire discussion. It can also be a call to action statement.

Matthew Bates,4y,What are the top ten mistakes students make when writing an essay?,"I was just going over this with my students today. They had an assignment to read an article and answer these questions about the article in an essay:

The first question in that writing prompt should be answered with a single word: “yes” or “no.” I told them that before they began their essays. I tell them that on a regular basis: if there’s a yes-or-no question for a writing prompt, your first word should be “yes” or “no.” Then go into the second question… the “why do you think that” part of the essay.

Like C.S. Friedman said in her answer: the biggest mistake students make in writing an essay is simply not answering the question they were asked. More than half of my students failed to put a simple “yes” or “no” in their essays. By omitting a single word, they didn’t answer half of the questions in the writing prompt.

Students tend to think that a good essay has to be long. It doesn’t. I routinely give very long essays very bad grades because, for all of the words they keyed out, they failed to actually answer the question that was being asked.

Today, I stand before you to emphasize the pressing need for women empowerment in our society. Women make up half of our population, yet they often face significant challenges and disparities. It's imperative that we address these issues and empower women for a more equitable and prosperous future.

Women empowerment is not about favoring one gender over another; it's about creating a level playing field. When women are empowered, our society benefits in countless ways. Women's education and economic independence lead to improved family well-being and overall economic growth.

Furthermore, empowering women ensures that their voices are heard in decision-making processes, bringing diverse perspectives and ideas to the table. This diversity is essential for our progress as a society. It's about giving women the opportunities, rights, and respect they deserve.

Let us all commit to promoting women empowerment, breaking down stereotypes, and advocating for gender equality. By doing so, we can build a society where everyone, regardless of their gender, can thrive and contribute to a better future for all.

Janie Roberts,21h,What are 7 steps to write a rhetorical analysis essay?,"Briefly, it is a paper where you take one or more texts and discuss them from a rhetorical perspective — what their arguments and evidence are, how they attempt to persuade, how successful you think it might be.

If you’re unfamiliar with rhetorical analysis, it’s best to take one text and do what’s called a “close reading.” Examples of ways to do this are numerous — anywhere texts were written down, or reported (supposedly) verbatim, can be analyzed.

Here are some of the basic stepping stones of rhetoric: claims, evidence, and examples; motives, appeals to audience, and arguments designed to prove facts, to determine what values should exist, and to promote and defend policy.

An approach would be to take an historical period you are familiar with, or texts you’re fond of — say, classical Greek speeches, or speeches by political figures, or even a letter to the editor of a newspaper — and do what’s called a “close” reading. Who is the audience for this document? If there’s more than one, how are each dealt with? What are the words most designed to draw emotional responses? What did the speaker/writer do particularly well? How could they have made a better argument, or a more persuasive one?

I hope this helps. Unless I know exactly what you’re trying to do, my answer has to be fairly general.

The Importance of Choosing the Right Topic

The choice of topic in an argumentative essay is crucial. It can be the difference between an engaging, thought-provoking paper and one that falls flat. A good topic should not only interest the writer but also provide ample scope for research and argumentation. It should be relevant, contemporary, and, most importantly, debatable, meaning that it has clear arguments for and against it. The topic sets the tone and direction of the essay; therefore, selecting a suitable one is paramount for the success of the essay.

What Makes a Good Argumentative Essay Topic?

Key Characteristics of an Ideal Topic

Debatable: The hallmark of an effective argumentative essay topic is its debatability. It should present an issue with at least two opposing perspectives, thereby allowing the writer to argue for one side while acknowledging the counterarguments. Topics that are universally agreed upon or based on indisputable facts offer little room for argumentation and should generally be avoided.
Researchable: An ideal topic should be one that you can research thoroughly. It means there should be enough available information from credible sources like scholarly articles, books, and reputable websites. This depth of research material enables the writer to build a strong case with evidence and examples.
Interesting and Relevant: The topic should not only be of interest to the writer but also relevant to the current times. Writing about something you are passionate about can be more engaging and convincing. Additionally, choosing a topic with contemporary significance can resonate more with readers and provide a platform for discussing current issues.

Importance of Personal Connection and Knowledge

While it is important to choose a topic that meets the above criteria, it is equally important to select something that the writer has a personal connection to or knowledge about. Writing about a familiar topic can provide the following benefits:

Ease of Argumentation: Familiarity with the topic allows the writer to argue more effectively, as they are likely to have a better understanding of the nuances and complexities involved.
Authenticity and Depth: Writing on a topic that you are knowledgeable about or have a personal stake in can bring authenticity and depth to the essay. It enables the writer to provide unique insights and personal examples, which can make the argument more compelling.
Engagement: A writer's enthusiasm for their topic often translates into their writing. A topic that excites or challenges the writer can lead to a more engaging and dynamic essay, as it can capture the reader's interest more effectively.

It can be the difference between an engaging, thought-provoking paper and one that falls flat. A good topic should not only interest the writer but also provide ample scope for research and argumentation. It should be relevant, contemporary, and, most importantly, debatable, meaning that it has clear arguments for and against it. The topic sets the tone and direction of the essay; therefore, selecting a suitable one is paramount for the success of the essay.\n\nWhat Makes a Good Argumentative Essay Topic?\n\nKey Characteristics of an Ideal Topic\n\nDebatable: The hallmark of an effective argumentative essay topic is its debatability. It should present an issue with at least two opposing perspectives, thereby allowing the writer to argue for one side while acknowledging the counterarguments. Topics that are universally agreed upon or based on indisputable facts offer little room for argumentation and should generally be avoided.\nResearchable: An ideal topic should be one that you can research thoroughly. It means there should be enough available information from credible sources like scholarly articles, books, and reputable websites. This depth of research material enables the writer to build a strong case with evidence and examples.\nInteresting and Relevant: The topic should not only be of interest to the writer but also relevant to the current times. Writing about something you are passionate about can be more engaging and convincing. Additionally, choosing a topic with contemporary significance can resonate more with readers and provide a platform for discussing current issues.\n\nImportance of Personal Connection and Knowledge\n\nWhile it is important to choose a topic that meets the above criteria, it is equally important to select something that the writer has a personal connection to or knowledge about. Writing about a familiar topic can provide the following benefits:\n\nEase of Argumentation: Familiarity with the topic allows the writer to argue more effectively, as they are likely to have a better understanding of the nuances and complexities involved.\nAuthenticity and Depth: Writing on a topic that you are knowledgeable about or have a personal stake in can bring authenticity and depth to the essay. It enables the writer to provide unique insights and personal examples, which can make the argument more compelling.\nEngagement: A writer\'s enthusiasm for their topic often translates into their writing. A topic that excites or challenges the writer can lead to a more engaging and dynamic essay, as it can capture the reader\'s interest more effectively.\n\nGeneral Topics\n\nThis section presents a list of general argumentative essay topics that are versatile and applicable across various contexts.

Because,in order to write any essay,some degree of subject knowledge is needed…

Now , coming to the question.. I won't be writing a long answer on how to write anecdotes in introduction, or what dimensions to cover etc…

What I will do, is Take you through my own essay, that I have written just before this mains…

I'll be mentioning the thinking process and logic for each step…

Let's start…

Here's the list of topics… I chose the 3rd one… “ Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, it became a butterfly “.
The first thing that we can do is to break the topic and brainstorm about whatever you can remember… I personally prefer to ask a few questions to myself,and try to gather incidents or stories that revolve around such themes… here's a page where I did my brainstorming… I don't know how much sense it would make to you, but have a look.

After doing this exercise for around 15–25 minutes, now it's time to write the essay…. Here you can utilise all your knowledge and creativity….

I'm not saying that any beginner or those who are writing the essay for the first time can write a good essay, but writing bad answers is the first step towards getting good…

Let's start the essay now…

Now, you can ask your questions in the comments section, but there's a precondition to it… ask anything you want to ask, but read the essay very very carefully before that…

Hope it helps..

Thank you…

Shilpa Bhatti,Updated 3y,What is the best framework to write an essay?,"Thanks for A2A

IT IS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU WRITE BUT HOW YOU WRITE

Essay paper is the most interesting as well scoring paper in UPSC examination. If the framework / structure of your essay is organised , it will automatically lead to a good score. I scored just 90 marks in my first mains but after that I formed a framework to write an essay and I was able to score 151 in UPSC 2016 and 154 in UPSC 2017.

STRUCTURE OF AN ESSAY

1.INTRODUCTION

Try to give an interesting start to your essay which interests the examiner and forces him read with excitement.

In 2016 , I wrote a mock essay test on topic : “EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN IN INDIA - MYTH OR REALITY”. I wrote a real story to start my essay :

( For complete essay check the description box of video link given below)

So , a small story in the beginning makes the essay interesting. You can also start your essay this way.

2.BODY :

Divide body of essay on two lines : Temporal scale and Spatial scale.

TEMPORAL SCALE

Basically you have to provide a timeline with resoect to the topic. Brainstorm on examples which you can relate with the given essay topic . For example I wrote a mock essay paper on topic : SPORTING CULTURE IN INDIA. I wrote along temporal lines in the following way :

Keep this part limited to 1 or 1.5 page.

SPATIAL SCALE

This is the most important part of body of the essay. Here you directly refer to the topic. The simplest way is to apply the PESTLE ( political , economic , social , technological ,legal and environmental)APPROACH.

For the given topic cover PESTL related aspects of essay. This gives a holistic view to the essay. As a civil servant you are expected to have a holistic view on various issues so this is a test of that️ .Apart from covering various aspects, include examples. I would say that your each paragraph should have atleast two examples from real life, news, any related government scheme or any good practices.

3.CONCLUSION

Divide conclusion into two parts : Way forward / Solutions and a basic summary with a positive stance.

Solutions should be novel and innovative. Remember that essay should be solution oriented. Dont leave it open ended as a future civil servant you are expected to give solutions to problems.

Basic summary should give a very positive view about the topic. You can end here with some quote also.

Now and then you gonna get a bit of shit but as long as it gets out of you, it is fine. So, with songs, you gonna write shit songs in the beginning. You are.

My songs were terrible. But I got them out of me.

R J Holland,2y,How old were you when you realized you love writing an essay?,"I was ten. Our teacher asked us to write an essay. I can’t remember what we were supposed to write about but I remember what I wrote about and I loved writing every minute of it.

Dad was a World War II combat vet, infantryman and like most boys, I was interested in the war my Dad fought in. I read about it and watched war movies.

My essay was about a penny. Now it wasn’t an ordinary penny because this one could think and talk to itself. I wrote about all the different people whose pockets this penny was kept in and how often it changed hands when items are being purchased.

He ended up in the pocket of a US Marine and this particular Marine was one of the men who climbed Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima. The Marine returned home safely after the war keeping his ‘lucky penny.’ The penny was put in plastic and proudly displayed on the Marine’s dresser. The penny was very happy to have been treasured by the Marine.

I got a very good mark in it even though there was a few spelling mistakes and I had a few dates wrong. Mom and Dad thought it was great and encouraged me in my writing.

I found this story a little while ago in a box of my old papers and odds and ends. I was amazed that my ten year old mind thought of something like this. Writing was a little hard for me because sometimes I would write a word but put some letters backwards like for write I may have put wrtie. I still do sometimes. So I had to concentrate.

Alex Johnston,12-Sep,How do you write a creative essay entry (not more than 300 words) about your own perspective of love using your knowledge about imagery to denotation and connotation?,"Like this:

Love is like the whiplash you get in a minor car accident, just when you feel like nothing was happening in your life. It is the toffee that clings to the underside of your dental plate when you’ve got braces on your teeth. Love has all the thrill of a +3 speed boost after a really skilful jump drift in Mario Kart. It is the pleasure of knowing that you’re using the cleanest toilet in the stalls.

Love is the answer to the question ‘Who put the boop on my best brown boots?’ It is the solution to the riddle wrapped in a mystery garbed as an enigma served as a burrito. Love does not alter when it doth not alteration finds, it alters things and then forgets to turn on Track Changes, so you lose the earlier version.

Love romances the stone, finds Nemo and deconstructs Harry. Love is running up that hill and runnin’ down a dream. Love has all the crystalline intensity of a new Bic.

Love fills you with memories. Then you get stack overflow.

Love triangles are non-Euclidean. That’s what makes them excruciating.

Love is a finch that has plans to become an engineer. Love twists in the storm, like a troubled Airbus. What we talk about when we talk about love is love, you moron. Love is both the Force and the Dark Side of the Force. Love kinda doesn’t really do politics, y’know?

Love is the opposite of a vending machine sandwich. Love and hate are the two cookies in the Oreo, we being the fondant smushed between. What is love? Baby, don’t hurt me, don’t hurt me no more, exceeeeeept that way, oh yeah, that’s the stuff.

Love means never having to do your own homework.

ElinaWatson,8mo,What are some tips for writing essays for college homework?,"When it comes to writing essays for college homework, there are several tips that can help you excel in your academic writing. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Understand the prompt: Take the time to carefully read and analyze the essay prompt. Make sure you fully comprehend what is being asked of you before starting your writing process.

2. Develop a clear thesis statement: Your thesis statement is a concise summary of the main point or argument of your essay. It should be specific, arguable, and guide the overall structure of your paper.

3. Plan your essay: Create an outline or a roadmap for your essay. Organize your thoughts and ideas, and establish a logical flow of information. This will help you maintain coherence and ensure that your essay is well-structured.

4. Conduct thorough research: Use reliable sources such as academic journals, books, and scholarly websites to gather supporting evidence for your arguments. Websites like BetterGrader, Homework Minutes, Course Hero, and Study Pool offer useful resources for research purposes.

5. Use proper citation and referencing: When incorporating information from external sources, cite them accurately. Follow the appropriate citation style specified by your professor, such as APA, MLA, or Chicago style.

6. Write a captivating introduction: Your introduction should engage the reader, provide necessary background information, and present your thesis statement. A strong introduction sets the tone for the rest of your essay.

7. Develop well-structured paragraphs: Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence, supporting evidence, and analysis. Ensure that your paragraphs flow smoothly and are connected through transitional phrases.

8. Maintain a formal tone: Academic writing typically requires a formal tone. Avoid slang, colloquial language, and personal anecdotes unless specifically requested.

9. Edit and proofread your essay: Before submitting, carefully review your essay for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors. Tools like Grammarly can be helpful in catching mistakes, but do not rely solely on them. Take the time to thoroughly proofread your work.

10. Seek feedback: Consider sharing your essay with classmates, professors, or online platforms like BetterGrader, Homework Minutes, Course Hero, and Study Pool to receive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

Samantha Josh,25-Aug,Do we need to use active voice in writing an essay?,"As an expert in voice imitation and all things related to communication, let me tell you that using active voice in writing an essay is not just important, it's crucial!

Your essay will thank you, your readers will thank you, and the world will be a better place.

Sarah Madden,Updated Jan 14,"Is it preferred if you go above the word minimums for an essay (like if you had to write a 1500 word essay, would it be better if you did exactly 1500 or should you go higher than that and let's say they're the same quality)?","Each professor will have possibly an unwritten way of dealing with papers. You must find out the policy if it is not spelled out. You will be graded on the quality of your paper, as well as your ability to follow instructions.

A requirement might say the minimum and maximum number of words, or the requirement could be stated as a minimum and maximum number of pages.

MY EXPERIENCE WRITING PAPERS FOR MY MASTER’S DEGREE:

I finished my master’s degree in biblical studies in 2011, and one of my favorite professors, Dr. Beall, told us he had to set strict standards for his students’ research papers. Instead of word limits, he sets page limits, but with specific formatting: Times New Roman, 12 points, one-inch margins, double spaced.

He said he was forced to do that, because he saw some students game the system: Students who didn't have enough to write would use huge fonts and massive margins, some students would just tweak the margins and font sizes a little bit to fit their writing into the page limit, whereas students who were too time strapped to edit out the fluff would turn in verbose papers that were basically an eye chart, with tiny fonts, miniscule margins, and squished spacing, but they fit the page limit.

Now, if a student turns in a paper with all of the right formatting, but it is over the page limit, Dr. Beall just stops reading at the end of, say, the fifth page, if the assignment was for a five-page research paper. The student’s grade will reflect the fact that the paper is missing some key points, because usually a summary would tie things up nicely, except Dr Beall never reads the summary if the paper is too long. Word has gotten around that he is serious, and this approach has worked for him for many years. (We still stay in touch, and he and his family are friends of mine.)

For him, the page limit works instead of having a word count limit.

TL:DR — Ask your teacher or professor for details.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3pjuz9mftsw0qyxh', 'title': ""Is it preferred if you go above the word minimums for an essay (like if you had to write a 1500 word essay, would it be better if you did exactly 1500 or should you go higher than that and let's say they're the same quality)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.994, 'ai': 0.006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Each professor will have possibly an unwritten way of dealing with papers.

John Evans,19-Oct,Can you write a neutral argumentative essay?,"Writing a neutral argumentative essay means presenting a balanced view of a topic without taking a specific stance. The goal is to provide a fair and objective assessment of the arguments for and against the issue. Here's an example of a neutral argumentative essay on the topic of climate change:

Title: The Debate Over Climate Change: An Objective Analysis

Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time. While the scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the idea that human activities are contributing to climate change, the debate over its causes, consequences, and potential solutions remains complex and contentious. This essay aims to provide a neutral and objective analysis of the key arguments in the climate change debate.

Body

1. The Human Role in Climate Change

The central point of contention in the climate change debate revolves around the extent to which human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, contribute to global warming. Proponents argue that the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, is the primary driver of rising temperatures. Skeptics, on the other hand, contend that natural factors play a more significant role.

2. Consequences of Climate Change

Climate change is associated with a range of potential consequences, including more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and ecosystem disruptions. Advocates for action assert that these consequences pose a grave threat to the environment and human well-being. Skeptics, while acknowledging climate change, question the severity of these consequences and argue that adaptation is a more practical response.

3. Mitigation and Adaptation

The debate also extends to the strategies for addressing climate change. Proponents of mitigation argue for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through policies like carbon pricing and the transition to renewable energy sources. Those in favor of adaptation focus on preparing for the inevitable effects of climate change, such as building resilient infrastructure and communities.

4. Economic Implications

Another dimension of the debate is the economic impact of climate change policies. Advocates for action contend that investing in clean energy and sustainability will create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Skeptics express concerns about the cost of transitioning to renewable energy and its impact on industries like fossil fuels.

Conclusion

The climate change debate is a complex and multifaceted issue, characterized by a spectrum of perspectives. A neutral and objective analysis reveals that there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate. While the scientific consensus supports the human role in climate change, ongoing discussions about the severity of its consequences and the best strategies for mitigation and adaptation are essential.

In addressing climate change, it is crucial to engage in informed and respectful dialogue, consider all perspectives, and base decisions on the best available evidence. Finding common ground and pursuing evidence-based policies will be essential in addressing this critical global challenge effectively.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wiqavm41f6ne0uho', 'title': 'Can you write a neutral argumentative essay?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Writing a neutral argumentative essay means presenting a balanced view of a topic without taking a specific stance.

While the scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the idea that human activities are contributing to climate change, the debate over its causes, consequences, and potential solutions remains complex and contentious. This essay aims to provide a neutral and objective analysis of the key arguments in the climate change debate.\n\nBody\n\n1. The Human Role in Climate Change\n\nThe central point of contention in the climate change debate revolves around the extent to which human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, contribute to global warming. Proponents argue that the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, is the primary driver of rising temperatures. Skeptics, on the other hand, contend that natural factors play a more significant role.\n\n2. Consequences of Climate Change\n\nClimate change is associated with a range of potential consequences, including more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and ecosystem disruptions. Advocates for action assert that these consequences pose a grave threat to the environment and human well-being. Skeptics, while acknowledging climate change, question the severity of these consequences and argue that adaptation is a more practical response.\n\n3. Mitigation and Adaptation\n\nThe debate also extends to the strategies for addressing climate change. Proponents of mitigation argue for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through policies like carbon pricing and the transition to renewable energy sources. Those in favor of adaptation focus on preparing for the inevitable effects of climate change, such as building resilient infrastructure and communities.\n\n4. Economic Implications\n\nAnother dimension of the debate is the economic impact of climate change policies. Advocates for action contend that investing in clean energy and sustainability will create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

Katherine Sanders,22-Nov,What is a good way to conclude the paragraph of a persuasive essay?,"Method 1 of 3:Giving an Overview
1. Re-read your paper or paper outline.

Organize your thoughts before writing your concluding paragraph by re-reading the rest of the paper, or the outline you made before writing it (if you made one). Isolate the key arguments made within the body of your writing, as well as the hypothesis proposed in the introductory paragraph.

If it helps, print out a copy of the body of the paper and highlight the main points to be summarized.

2. Summarize your main arguments.

Your concluding paragraph should repeat the main points that you made within your paper in different words. Briefly summarize the key arguments that make up the body of your essay in a clear and concise manner. Make sure to include important keywords from each point in your conclusion.

For instance, ""Gun laws should be changed to reflect the evolving needs of today's generations.""

3. Avoid introducing any new ideas.

When concluding any kind of essay, avoid introducing an idea that isn't already in the body of the paper. If you feel the need to add something new to the conclusion, consider editing the body of your paper to include that information. For example, avoid adding a point about how fashion magazines provide unrealistic portrayals of the male body if your paper has focused solely on how these magazines affect women.

You can, however, create a call to action or end with a creative and engaging hook statement.

4. Keep it brief.

In an academic paper, your concluding paragraph should only be about 3-5 sentences long. Be efficient in your writing and communicate what you need to say as briefly as possible. To stay within this sentence range, try:

Using the first sentence to restate the hypothesis in your introduction, in different wording

Writing the next 2-3 sentence to summarize the key arguments made in your paper

Having the last 1-2 sentences be a grand statement of conclusion, saying what your final findings are

Method 2 of 3:Using Convincing Wording
1. Try parallel sentences.

When summarizing parts of your research or arguments, use parallel sentences. This writing technique uses patterns of similar words to organize thoughts or ideas and show the reader that they are similar, or equal in value. In a concluding paragraph, parallel sentences can help organize information in a way that allows you to avoid writing too much.

For instance, ""Regular exercise reduces stress, improves your sleep, and promotes weight loss.""

2. Use strong, simple language.

Your concluding paragraph should drive your point home in a straightforward, assertive way. Avoid too much detail in your writing (such as lengthy adjectives or descriptions), as it can be distracting. Choose the simplest manner to say what you want to communicate.

For instance, instead of writing, ""The traditional American Dream is not dead and gone,"" write, ""The American Dream is not dead.""

However, keep in mind that in some cases, more elaborate wording may be necessary to drive home your point.

3. Avoid being obvious.

A well-written paper does not need to use phrases like ""to conclude"" or ""to summarize"" in its conclusion. Restate your ideas in a different way, in a paragraph that can stand alone as a summary of your research. Your reader, having read the rest of your paper, will understand on their own that you are summing up the contents of your essay and presenting your conclusion.

Method 3 of 3:Establishing the Relevance of Your Conclusion
1. Use the ""Panning to the Horizon"" technique to assert the importance of your research.

In addition to summarizing the main points of your paper, your conclusion should point towards how your findings will be relevant in the future. You can achieve this by refocusing the topic within a larger context, and inviting the reader to reflect on how it will play out within a bigger picture. Use a thought-provoking question to communicate that the issue deserves further thought.

For example,""What will happen to small businesses as different industries continue to go digital?""

2. Put out a call to action to engage your reader in a memorable way.

Establish the importance of your essay's conclusion by challenging your reader to do something about it. Turning your final findings into a real life challenge will emphasize the relevance of the topic and your hypothesis.

For example, ""Being environmentally responsible is a necessary step for all people, in order to save the parts of nature that we have left.""

3. Present an ideal picture to improve your reader's relation to the text.

If your essay has presented a hypothesis about how something is bad, create a picture of how things could be better. The optimistic focus will re-frame your arguments in a more positive way. The possible solutions to the issue your have arguments have established gives merit to your thesis without undermining the structure of your paper or altering the arguments you made.

For example, ""If this competitive nature of school work were replaced with a more community-based learning approach, we might see happier, healthier children.""","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rip7xf3t4hu6besn', 'title': 'What is a good way to conclude the paragraph of a persuasive essay?', 'score': {'original': 0.5013, 'ai': 0.4987}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Method 1 of 3:Giving an Overview\n1.

Jessica Roy,31-Oct,What are the worst essay writing tips?,"While there are numerous helpful essay writing tips available, it's equally important to be aware of some of the worst advice or practices that can hinder your essay-writing process. Here are some of the worst essay writing tips to avoid:

Procrastination: Putting off your essay until the last minute is a recipe for disaster. It leads to rushed and poorly thought-out work. Instead, create a schedule and start early to allow time for research, drafting, and editing.
Plagiarism: Copying someone else's work and presenting it as your own is not only unethical but also a serious academic offense. Always give proper credit to your sources and use citations correctly.
Ignoring the Assignment Instructions: Failing to follow the assignment guidelines provided by your instructor can result in a lower grade. Ensure you understand and adhere to the requirements regarding length, format, and content.
Overly Complex Language: Using overly complex vocabulary and sentence structures with the intent of appearing more intelligent can often lead to confusion. Effective communication is about clarity, so opt for clear and concise writing.
Neglecting Proofreading: Neglecting to proofread your essay can lead to errors in grammar, spelling, and structure. Always take the time to edit and revise your work for clarity and correctness.
Excessive Wordiness: Overloading your essay with unnecessary words or filler content to meet a word count can lead to a lack of clarity and a diminished quality of writing. Aim for concise and relevant content.
Ignoring Feedback: If you receive feedback on your essays from instructors, peers, or writing centers, do not dismiss it. Ignoring constructive criticism can prevent you from improving your writing skills.
Relying Solely on Spell Checkers: Spell checkers are valuable tools, but they are not foolproof. They may miss context-related errors, so do not solely rely on them for proofreading.
Lack of Research: A well-researched essay provides a strong foundation for your arguments. Avoid basing your content solely on personal opinions and assumptions. Proper research is key.
Copy-Pasting from Online Sources: Copy-pasting content directly from websites or online sources is plagiarism. Use external sources for research and knowledge but ensure you paraphrase and cite appropriately.
Skipping the Introduction and Conclusion: The introduction and conclusion are essential parts of your essay. Skipping them or not giving them proper attention can leave your essay without a clear beginning or end.
Writing Without a Clear Thesis: Failing to establish a clear thesis or main argument can result in a disorganized and unfocused essay. Ensure that your essay has a strong, central point.
Neglecting Transition Sentences: Neglecting to include transition sentences between paragraphs can make your essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow. Use transition words and phrases to guide your reader.

In conclusion, these are some of the worst essay writing practices to avoid. Effective essay writing involves careful planning, research, adherence to guidelines, and a commitment to clear and ethical communication. By steering clear of these pitfalls, you can improve your writing skills and produce higher-quality essays.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2tdsqfxnra4ojwgv', 'title': 'What are the worst essay writing tips?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""While there are numerous helpful essay writing tips available, it's equally important to be aware of some of the worst advice or practices that can hinder your essay-writing process.

In simple terms, it stands for a type of paper where your purpose is to tell your target audience about something. It can be an object, some personality, an event, or a phenomenon like northern lights.\n\nYou have to collect as much information\n\ndealing with your topic as you can. Therefore, finding informative topics to write about often becomes challenging as things must be narrowed down. You have to explain how something works or why it happens. The younger students may have to discuss something with a teacher first while college students will have to start with independent research and provide good sources to support their findings.\n\nThis part can easily seem difficult, especially if you have never dealt with choosing a subject for your informative essay. You should not let it frighten you as there are several things to follow:\n\nKeep your topic narrowed down to address only one issue.\n\nYour tone must be explanatory as you have to explain how something works.\n\nFocus on processes or the cause-and-effect aspect if it is applicable.\n\nKeep things inspiring and provide interesting information.\n\nTopics for informative writing must have a good structure with an introduction, thesis, and conclusion that sums things up.\n\nProvide sources to support information.\n\nInformative essays must have zero bias as your task is to provide information.\n\nRemember to double-check your grading rubric to ensure that every minor rule is followed!\n\nGood Informative Essay Topics\n\nWhen you are starting with informative essay ideas, it is important to narrow things down and provide all the necessary sources for ideas that are not originally yours. Even if you talk about baking bread or discuss yoga practices in Thailand, you may still require an essay plagiarism fixer to get things right as you must include your sources in the final paper bibliography.

Eric Stevens,17-Jan,Are all essay writing service reviews genuine?,"As someone who works with domyessay.com, I can tell you that not all essay writing service reviews are genuine. In the vast online landscape, it's common to come across reviews that are not entirely authentic. Some companies might use fake reviews to boost their image, which can be misleading for potential customers. Here are some tips to ensure you're getting real feedback:

Check Multiple Sources. Don't rely on reviews from just one website. Look at different platforms to get a broader perspective.
Look for Detailed Reviews. Genuine reviews often contain specific details about the customer's experience, not just general praise.
Beware of Overly Positive or Negative Reviews. Both extremes can be red flags. Real feedback usually falls somewhere in the middle, highlighting both pros and cons.
Consider the Language Used. Sometimes, fake reviews might use overly promotional or unnatural language.

Shravani Madane,6mo,How can I write essays in exams well and quickly?,"So before starting my answer, in language exam I had scored 97 marks….so now I think I am eligible for answering this🙂

Most important things don't write the essays line by line from the digest or any other references books.( I have seen many of the students who just mug up all the things and write those points🤦🏻‍♀️)
For quickness you should have clear picture that what each paragraph will consist of. 😌
Try to make major 4–5 points and write down the paragraph of that👀
Most important: the secret of getting marks is writing something creative poetries.( In my case I always write poetry related to that subject to gain that extra edge over other students)🤫

Littyanna,Updated Nov 22,"How would you write an argumentative essay about this topic, “tuition fees free policy is good for Papua New Guinea”?","Title: The Benefits of Tuition Fees-Free Policy for Papua New Guinea

Introduction:

Education is a fundamental right and a catalyst for national development. In recent years, the concept of tuition fees-free policy has gained momentum globally, aiming to increase access to education and alleviate barriers to learning. This essay will argue that implementing a tuition fees-free policy in Papua New Guinea (PNG) would bring significant benefits to the country's education system and contribute to its overall socio-economic development.

Body:

1. Increased Access to Education:

One of the primary advantages of a tuition fees-free policy is the removal of financial barriers that hinder access to education. In PNG, where a significant portion of the population lives below the poverty line, many students are unable to afford school fees. Implementing a tuition fees-free policy would ensure that all children, regardless of their economic background, have the opportunity to receive a quality education. This inclusivity would promote social equity and empower disadvantaged students, leading to a more educated and skilled workforce.

2. Improved Enrollment and Retention Rates:

High tuition fees often lead to low enrollment rates and high dropout rates, especially among marginalized populations. By eliminating tuition fees, the government can encourage greater enrollment and improve student retention rates. This, in turn, reduces educational disparities and creates a more educated citizenry, which is essential for PNG's long-term development goals.

3. Quality Education and Teacher Development:

A tuition fees-free policy can also facilitate investments in improving the quality of education and professional development for teachers. With increased enrollment and funding, schools can allocate resources towards hiring qualified teachers, enhancing teaching materials, and implementing innovative teaching methodologies. Consequently, this would raise the overall standard of education in PNG, equipping students with the knowledge and skills needed for future success.

4. Economic Growth and Development:

Education plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and development. By investing in a tuition fees-free policy, PNG can develop a well-educated workforce capable of driving innovation, entrepreneurship, and productivity. Accessible education would expand opportunities for individuals to acquire specialized skills, leading to increased employment prospects and higher income levels. Moreover, an educated population is more likely to make informed decisions, engage in civic participation, and contribute to the overall development of the nation.

5. Social Stability and Sustainable Development:

Education is closely linked to social stability and sustainable development. By providing equal access to education, a tuition fees-free policy promotes social cohesion and reduces inequality, thereby fostering a more harmonious society. Furthermore, an educated populace is better equipped to understand and address pressing social and environmental challenges, leading to sustainable development practices and responsible stewardship of natural resources.

Conclusion:

Implementing a tuition fees-free policy in Papua New Guinea would be a significant step towards fostering inclusive education, promoting social equity, and driving long-term socio-economic development. By removing financial barriers, increasing access to education, and improving the quality of learning, PNG can create a more prosperous future for its citizens. It is essential for the government and relevant stakeholders to prioritize education as a key investment, recognizing its transformative power and its potential to shape a brighter future for the nation and its people.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ls0tdo3yr86qx4bw', 'title': 'How would you write an argumentative essay about this topic, “tuition fees free policy is good for Papua New Guinea”?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Title: The Benefits of Tuition Fees-Free Policy for Papua New Guinea\n\nIntroduction:\n\nEducation is a fundamental right and a catalyst for national development.
