Anonymous,Updated 7y,What is the biggest scam that every Indian must be aware of?,"Ebiz

They claim Ebiz, a Network marketing business. And every Ebizer considers himself as an entrepreneur.

They create hype by telling success stories and showing some pictures likelike this:

They take you to a seminar (Life changing….really) whose entry pass is Rs. 100–200. Some motivational speaker will come and he will motivate you to do something. Something what? Ebiz. You will come to know that seminar was just a lie but they wanted to present their business plan (You are getting fooled from the start). If you aren’t convinced at the seminar,they will call you frequently.

You have to buy a product to be associate in Ebiz.

All the products are useless.

There are some online computer courses like MS-Office, C, web designing courses etc. All the web material is not updated since 2007 (No production cost for them) and you can get far better material for free on the internet.
A watch (MMR 3,999) but not worth Rs. 200.
FREE Hotel Room booking to some selected tourist places and again on the condition that hotel should have vacancy. Booking in peak season is not allowed. To book the hotel room you have have to pay 4000 rupees (non-refundable). Sorry, I think I said FREE earlier.
A suit. (My friend paid money for this, but he never got one.)

You have to buy

A)1 & 2 & 3 or (from above)

B)1 & 2 & 4

for nearly Rs. 10,830 (Valid for one year and every year you must renew it for another Rs. 5000) and you will become associate of Ebiz. Now they sell their products and can earn through profit distributed to associates on their performance.

As soon as you became associate they will encourage you to sell those products to your close friends and relatives, who will blindly believe you.

Then they will teach you to lie and sell products to strangers.

Earlier they will claim that, you can earn while studying. But afterwards they encourage you to focus on Ebiz and say “There is no scope in studying”.

They will forcefully take you to their business meetings and national conventions.

The ebiz associates who get even moderately successful are forced by the seniors to buy assets like bike(Karizma) or a car to show off their success and to lure more people in. The truth is that most of them didn't make enough money to buy off a car or bike.

After 2–3 months you came to know that it was all lies and fraud but you won’t tell anybody as you are also a part of it. Those who get successful continue and the others tend to leave.

When I was in my first year of engineering, I had financial problems at home. And I believed everyone. So it was easy for them. I was an Ebiz Associate for 4 months and now I'm feeling guilty for the loss of money of my father and some friends. And feeling angry towards these fellows:

Pawan Malhan (Founder of Ebiz) and his son.

We can’t sue them as we have signed all kinds of legal documents while becoming associates.

Actually these type of money rotation business plan are illegal in India. Ebiz claims that, it is not a money rotation plan but network marketing by taking support of useless products.

Edit 1: This is not just about Rs. 11,000. Many youngsters failed in their studies. Many left their good job to be a part of this scam. Every year nearly 50,000–1,00,000 Indian youth actively takes part in this and waste months and years of their valuable young age of doing something.

One man's scam is another man's business opportunity. These companies engages in business practices that, while legal, are socially reprehensible.

There are many “companies” like this:

Pancard Clubs Ltd.
Hope World
QNet
Dewsoft
Naswiz
Aspire world imaginations
Scoopmaniac
Oasis Tymk
SunMark
SARSO
TECHNOBIZ

Waiting for some more negative names to come up, please do comment.

We have toastmasters club,AIESEC etc. They are far better than Ebiz. You don’t see what you are paying in hope of improving skills.

Subham Mahapatra,Updated 3y,What are common scams in India?,"Last month I was travelling from Bangalore to Bhubaneswar. As it’s around 30 hrs journey, l couldn't take all the food for the whole journey.

Somehow I managed lunch and dinner on day 1, because I had taken food from home. The next morning, I managed my breakfast with bread and jam and ordered lunch from the pantry.

I ordered one veg meal from pantry. The pantry boy noted my seat number as I ordered my meal. After some time I got a meal that looked like this.

But water packet was not available with my meal. I didn't even ask.

After 1 hour the pantry boy came to collect the money.

Me: Bhaiya kitna hua??

(how much brother??)

Pantry boy: Sir, apka 120 hua?

(sir, your bill is 120 rupees.)

Me : Mene to veg meal order kiya tha, bhaiya

(I have ordered just veg meal, brother)

Pantry boy : Han sir. Ye veg meal ka price.

(yes sir. This is the price of veg meal)

I was shocked!!!! How can a veg meal cost this much? Then I said get me the bill then I'll pay you.

Then that guy got me a raw bill, nothing is written on that only train number and amount, even catering name was not mentioned. Unfortunately I have lost the bill. Otherwise I would have posted here.

Then I paid the money. Without saying anything.

After that I thought to check on IRCTC site about the actual cost of the meal.

Then I got this

Let me zoom it.

This is the veg meal cost . These are the items you are supposed to get in a veg meal.

Let's have a look at the price.

That’s 50 rupees. I'm not even considering food quality, quantity, and the food they had given.

How can they take more than double price of each meal?

Just suppose in one coach 60 passengers ordered a meal. They are earning

70(the extra cost) * 60=4200 rupees

4200 rupees they are earning illegally from each coach .

Then I told to that pantry boy “you shouldn't charge more than double cost”. Immediately that pantry boy started arguing with me that sir please have a look at our food quality.

I just asked one question, “Are you right at your position?”

Pantry boy had no answer.I asked him to get out.

Then I thought to complain in the railways about the exorbitant price in this pantry.

You might not have observed there is a toll free number for complaining about pantry service.

This is the number : 1800-111–321

I just called on this number and put a complaint about this.

I would never have thought that they would take some action because this is India. When they took action about it.I realized India is changing.

After putting a complaint, within 2 minutes that pantry boy came with a sad face and said, “Sir, have you complained?” in a low voice.

I said, “Yes I have complained. So what?”

His face became red with fear. Then he started convincing me to take back that complaint.

Pantry boy : Sir, even if you are not taking back the complaint, nothing will happen. Our owner has contacts up to the ministry level, but I’ll definitely loose my job if you are not taking back the complaint. Then after seeing tears in his eyes I took back the complaint.

Pantry boy : Thank you Sir. I'll return your extra money.

Me : Can you return everyone's extra money which you have taken?

Pantry boy : No sir it’s not possible. I can return the money of the passengers who are sitting near you.

Then he returned 350 rupees of 5 passengers extra money who were sitting arround me.

This is India’s biggest day light scam.

I appreciated that government is changing but corruption can't leave India’s hand.

Whenever you are facing this type of problem while travelling please put a complaint on that.

NOTE: This answer I had written on 2018. the above information was valid till that time, now the price of IRCTC has changed. The standard veg meal price has change to Rs.80 by IRCTC. please do consider while ordering and putting complaint.

I know with one complaint our nation is not going to change.

But every single drop of water helps to make a ocean.

Vivek Aundhakar,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"“Loot under the name of GST”

I recently visited Vishal Mart in Guwahati. It is quite big shop with huge crowd on weekends.

I bought ‘Britannia-Bourbon’ biscuits. I was expecting some discount offer but there wasn't any. I just bought it to MRP Rs. 27/-

After payment, I checked the bill casually and I found this-

I went back to the counter and asked the guy, why they charged me Rs. 30 when MRP is clearly written Rs. 27?

He said that, it is the GST applied over the MRP. I told him that MRP includes all taxes and no one can charge above that price, still he kept repeating same thing. Then I went to the manager and told her about the issue, then she started apologizing me and told that counter guy to return Rs. 3

Then I said to her, it is not about just my 3 rupees but it’s about the all customers they are fooling under the name of GST and charging extra. Imagine how many packets they must be selling everyday. That would surely make a huge amount earned and it’s clearly a scam.

Before leaving the store I asked her to make the change in their system so that no other customers get fooled. Other customers present there also started asking her to do it immediately.

It is my request to all that we must always check the bill details in shops, hotels and everywhere. I am sure there are many such examples of looting under the name of GST. Beware!

Edit 1-

Many people suggested in the comments that I must complain about it to the govt. So I have registered a complaint at online portal of consumer court. Let's see what action they take!

Kathiravan RS,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"There are already lots of scams by major fast-food chains, this one is by Domino’s Pizza.

Image source: www.asklaila.com

Last week I went to a Domino’s restaurant with my friends in Chennai. Usually, when we go there, we order Pizza Mania since it is the cheapest. This time we decided to buy around 20 pizzas and when proceeded to give the order at the counter.

Now, at the counter, the guy told me that they don’t have the normal crust and asked to order for Fresh pan pizzas. Now the additional cost is ₹25 per pizza and the total cost will be ₹500 extra for 20 pizzas. We had no choice rather than to buy those.

After 20 - 25 minutes we received the pizzas, the pizzas tasted just like the regular ones and I don’t know how these are different. I was regretting that I have wasted ₹500.

Now comes the actual scam part. I had a suspicion because they never told me that regular pizzas are not there. To check, I opened their Android app and ordered few pizza mania with REGULAR base as takeaway and the order was confirmed.

BOOM!!

I got the pizzas which they told it was out of stock in ten mins. The guy handed the pizzas to me with a shocked face. He said that he didn’t check the stocks properly.

Then I had to eat the pizza with regret of wasting ₹500.

So, whenever they tell you that normal base is not available, just order online with their app and save money instead of spending on other bases.

I don’t know whether this has been already posted by others, Sorry if it is repeated.

Don’t tell that they reserve stocks for online orders separately, how can they give preference to another customer somewhere over a customer who is right at their shop.

Update: After seeing this answer, a representative from Domino's called me and apologized over the incident, assured me to give coupons as a refund for the extra money spent and assured it won't happen again.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/965csrmud82tzygb', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""There are already lots of scams by major fast-food chains, this one is by Domino’s Pizza.\n\nImage source: www.asklaila.com\n\nLast week I went to a Domino’s restaurant with my friends in Chennai.

Adam Singh,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Delhi Police, Not only scam, Delhi Police runs an extortion racket.

Till 4th June, I would have argued, there are few bad guys in Delhi Police, but majority are good guys.

But, as of 5th June, I argue, there are few good guys in Delhi Police, but majority are bad guys.

Let me share my experience.

My wife arrived from OS trip, and I drove to Delhi on 4th June 2019, to pick her up. After receiving her from IGI (approx 1am 5th June), we went straight to hotel.
On 5th June, approx 9am, we left hotel within 30 seconds, we were pulled aside by Delhi Police officers, with masks and hand-held equipment.
I was asked to produce License, RC, Insurance, which I provided.
Police Officer then extended his hand into the cabin, and pressed horn, his immediate reaction was ""Pressure Horn, come out"".
For next 15 minutes, I tried explaining, that it is a DISC HORN with measured 90db rating. Including showing manufacturer’s website, and SC judgements.
After multiple threats ranging from impounding RC to impounding my car, 2 police officers asked me to come aside, which I refused. This is common tactic by Police Officers to ask bribes.
Eventually, I was told, Delhi Police won't be unjust, and will cooperate with me.
Delhi Police, showing pity on me, and in spirit of cooperation, gave me, on the spot fine, Rs.100 for pressure horn and Rs.1000 for dangerous driving.
Delhi Police had latest technology available, to issue, on the spot fines, but did not even have an app (on their phones), to check approximate loudness of horns.
When I asked, why was I fined for dangerous driving? a pile of abuses were hurled towards me and my wife (who never left the car and never said a single word to anyone). Here is list of on the spot fines, Delhi Police is suppose to issue. DEPARTMENT OF POLICE, Delhi, India
When I asked, what kind of dangerous driving, I was doing, on an empty road, with a 1600 kg car with 70bhp, with 4 suitcases (approx 110kg) in boot, I was informed, ""Pressure horn tau dangerous driving hi hai"".
I shook my head, said thank you, and walked towards my car. On reaching front of my car, I stopped to take pictures of supposed pressure horn, and a dam of abuses burst at me and at my wife.
One police officer went ahead and opened door to the car and started threatening my wife, while second Police officer opened drivers door and started honking the horn, while third police officer started filming the supposed pressure horn firing video.
I made worst mistake of my life and asked “what did I do wrong?”,
Multiple options was offered as replies to my and wife.
""Bhenchod, tujse co-operate kiya, tujhe aur teri randi ko impound karte hain""
""Haramjade ko arrest karo""
“Harami ko court bhejo”
I jumped into my car, and drove off.
Since, I reside approx 400 kms from Delhi, and my car’s number plate displayed that. Police Officers knew, arguing Rs.1100 in court, would cost me, well over Rs.5000 and 2 days at bare minimum.
So Delhi Police pushes for ""side pe aa"" tactics, to take bribes and those who refuse, get Rs.1100 fine and abuses.

At this point, you must be wondering, why didn’t I made a complaint to PCA?

Sorry, PCA (Police Complaints Authority) does not consider this extortion (or serious abuse of authority) and as such, will not accept complaints on this matter.

It might sound like a one-off, but every taxi driver, I spoke to, confirms, this is a daily occurance in Delhi, anyone with outside Delhi number plates face this cooperation by Delhi Police.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8ahxe469f2spdqrc', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.84475, 'ai': 0.15525}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Delhi Police, Not only scam, Delhi Police runs an extortion racket.\n\nTill 4th June, I would have argued, there are few bad guys in Delhi Police, but majority are good guys.\n\nBut, as of 5th June, I argue, there are few good guys in Delhi Police, but majority are bad guys.\n\nLet me share my experience.\n\nMy wife arrived from OS trip, and I drove to Delhi on 4th June 2019, to pick her up.

Sumit De,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Titan

I bought a Titan edge in Jan 2015 worth RS 16,000/-. It had a warranty for 2 years. In September 2017 the watch stopped. I thought may be the battery has drained out.

Went to Titan world, Park Street, Kolkata. They took it, they said they will check but since it's beyond warranty so I have to pay. I was ok with it.

After a week received a SMS saying please collect your watch at your convenience. I went again . To my surprise, I was told that the watch is irreparable. I was shocked. Just within two years without any physical damage how can a award winning technology of edge just become irreparable?

The service centre informed that company can take the watch back since it is just out of warranty but would provide me a Titan coupon of 50% of the buy value.

I insisted I want to repair. Now the service centre told me if I don't take the offer now they won't even provide me any coupon in future. So it's now or never.

I asked them to write in the bill that the watch is not repairable. But they denied to do so. I asked them to show me the company policy of 50 % , that also they couldn't provide.

I requested to talk to the manager. After listening to the situation he took back the watch and asked the service person to check once again and didn't hand it back to me, nor he gave to me anything in writing.

The scam here is the service centre will take back the watch and provide a 50% coupon with which you have to buy another titan watch within 3 months.

Your watch may have only got a battery to replace, so that will be replaced and put up for a sale on full value. They won't give you in writing that the watch is not repairable since they very well know it is not true.

It's the latest scam trending in Titan to improve the sale at the cost of customers.

Is this the Tata value and code of ethics?

Edit on 07.10.2017 (after almost 1 and half month of putting the watch for servicing)

Today after many a calls to customer care and threatening to approach the consumer forum got back my watch after a month.

It has been repaired and working fine. The cost for repair is INR 1650. Now you can understand pretty well why they refused to provide a documentary evidence that the watch is irreparable.

Infact if I would have taken the offer of 50% coupon I would have lost straight away 8K.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vlezq1amin8jxr26', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Titan\n\nI bought a Titan edge in Jan 2015 worth RS 16,000/-.

They won't give you in writing that the watch is not repairable since they very well know it is not true.\n\nIt's the latest scam trending in Titan to improve the sale at the cost of customers.\n\nIs this the Tata value and code of ethics?\n\nEdit on 07.10.2017 (after almost 1 and half month of putting the watch for servicing)\n\nToday after many a calls to customer care and threatening to approach the consumer forum got back my watch after a month.\n\nIt has been repaired and working fine. The cost for repair is INR 1650. Now you can understand pretty well why they refused to provide a documentary evidence that the watch is irreparable.\n\nInfact if I would have taken the offer of 50% coupon I would have lost straight away 8K."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9998
Vimal Soni,Updated 6y,Have you ever scammed a scammer?,"Yes I did and its an amazing feeling that when you keep a scammer busy, his time is wasted and he could scam less people!!!

This is what happened:

I received a call from +91 120 3037862 saying they are calling from India Shopping Mart and I have won an LED TV for which I have to pay just INR 3000 as a processing fees.

(suspecting a scam here, I thought of scamming him and keep him busy as long as I can)

Me: Alright, how can I pay the money?

He (In excitement): Sir, you have to pay the amount via PayTM wallet. Once you complete the payment, share the transaction details with us so that we can send you your gift.

Me: Ok but currently I do not have PayTM wallet balance. I need to reload my wallet.

He: I will wait sir, you take your time and load the money.

(I wasted 5 more minutes)

Me: I am unable to add money, I think my net is slow. Please wait I am trying.

(Wasted 5 more minutes)

He: Sir, did you load the money successfully?

Me: I guess you called me on the same number from which I use the Internet. You have to drop off so that I can load the money

He: Alright sir I will call you after 10 minutes.

(He Called back after 15 minutes)

Me: Yes so now I have loaded INR 3000 in my PayTM wallet. Tell me the number on which I have to send it.

He: Send it on 8512845946

Me: Ok I will send it on 851285946

He (in little frustration): Its 8512845946 sir. Please note it down somewhere.

Me: Ok I have noted 8512845946. Sending you the money.

(Wasted 5 more minutes)

Me: I am unable to send. It says “Failed, please try again!” (LOL)

He: I guess your Internet will not work while on call. I am dropping off and will callback after 10 mins.

(He called back after 15 mins)

Me: I have sent the money successfully.

He (more excited): Let me check sir. (He checked the transactions but did not find anything) LMAO…

He: Sir I have not received the money yet. Have you sent it correctly?

Me: Yes I have sent it to your number. I have the transaction number also.

He: Give me the transaction number sir.

Me: 904006302743 (Bar-code number of my deo)

He: Sir I cannot find any such transaction.

Me: I have taken the screenshot as well.

He: Sir please send that screenshot to my number 7065614090

(After wasting 2–3 mins)

Me : Please drop the call I cant send.

He dropped off the call. Here is what I sent to him.

If you see, everything is photoshopped (LMAO)..

He saw the pic and called me excitedly.

He: Sir I see you have successfully sent the money but as there is a network issue in PayTM server, the money is on the way and yet to reach us.

LMFAO, he said “Money is on the way”!!!

(I controlled my laughter somehow and asked)

Me: How much time it will take to reach you? Will it reach to you or someone else? I have sent you the money now I want my gift.

He: Don’t worry sir your money will not go anywhere. Once I will receive it in my Passbook, I will call you and take your address.

Now the wait has begun… He keeps on waiting and waiting and waiting…!!!

I am glad I wasted almost an hour of him so that he could scam less people.

Edit 1: They came to know that I fooled them big time, so now they are calling me up and threatening me!!

Numbers: +91 120303 7862 & 8512845946

Edit 2: They stopped calling me after I said to file a complaint if they don’t. :)

Srikanth,Updated 5y,What are common scams in India?,"Let me share my experience with Swiggy

You can clearly see that they are showing two parathas in the above image, but here comes the twist.

To my suprise I was delivered only one partha, when I called the Swiggy team they told me that this restaurant sells one paratha for 70RS.

I ate one plate paratha (2 pieces) at the same restaurant a week ago for 70RS.

I again called the customer support but they denied, so i placed their call on hold and made a conference call with the restaurant, and I asked him to deliver a plate paratha to my room, and made an enquiry about the quantity he said they provide 2 parathas for 70RS.

Voila! they were caught red-handed, and swiggy team accepted to return my 35rs, but I asked them to make a full refund (of 70rs) for which they agreed.

EDIT1 : Swiggy people are fraudsters, they are not willing to talk to me about this. See what I found. PLEASE DON’T FALL FOR THEIR DISCOUNTS.

THEY LURE YOU WITH FREE DELIVERY OFFERS AND TRAP YOU

Now let’s check with the restaurant itself…..

Here’s the full menu from the restaurant

It’s better to call the restaurant itself.

Edit 2:

So many people are pointing out that it is not the fault of Swiggy. Alright, I've provided them with numerous proofs, I've sent them n number of mails, why aren't they responding?

On the other hand Zomato is clean, the prices shown on Zomato matches with the menu of the restaurant.

Praveen SV,6y,What are common scams in India?,"Few days before, I went to Apollo Pharmacy like this to buy some medicines.

Piyush Singhal,Updated 5y,Have you ever scammed a scammer?,"I once encountered a scam via a phone call and I, kind of wasted a lot of money and energy of the scammer.

On a lazy sunday morning, I got a call from +91 70789 51593, a female voice was talking. I was informed that I have won a free Samsung J2 Mobile Phone and an Adidas kit containing goggles, jeans, shoes and what not. The market value of the combo was 30k but I need to pay winning charges 6.5k for handling.

WTF is winning charges?

The deal was kind of appealing but I had a smell of scam due to the winning charges. I used a little wit and accpeted the offer. Meanwhile I went on google and checked for adidas scam. Everyting was confirmed. I was being fooled.

She informed that I did not have to pay anything now but I have to pay cash on delivery. Anyone will fall for this kind of offer. Something worth 30k at the price of 6.5k that too at COD. But the actual thing was, I had to go to local post office to collect the shipment and pre-pay before opening it. (India Post holds no guarranty on the product in the shipment. They just take the money.)

She took approx 15 minuites in taking the order. She asked sizes and colour of each product. Even the Adidas belt’s size and colour was asked. She was very detailed on every product to make me sure of buying it. She even suggested that the lower of white colour wont be a very good option.

She then took my address. I gave my address in complete details and landline/ mobile number was provided. She informed me that I have to go to the IndiaPost office and collect the shipment. Their (both IndiaPost and Adidas) team will inform me when the parcel has arrived and I have to go with 6.5k in hand. I said okay.

Later I got a confirmation of my order. :D

Just to con the scammers, I acted like I'm intrested and ordered two :D

Scammers also sent order confirmations now. You are properly ready to be fooled.

Same evening, I got a verification call from +91 90581 12808 m. They confirmed if I was informed as they asked and not offered anything else. They made sure I accept to go to the local post office and pay money to receive the parcel. I accepted everything and my scam order was placed. I enjoyed talking to them as I answered very interestingly and it made them happy.

Now a week later, I got call from local post office that a parcel has arrived on my name. I informed them I am not coming and this is a scam parcel. They can send it back. I thought this must be over but not yet. Next morning I got a call from the Adidas customer suppourt team from +91 90849 97459 and a guy named Krishna informed me that my parcel has arrived and I have to pay 13k to get it.

I thought to roast him a little and told him I will go that evening. He insisted that I must go on the same day. He also told me to go by car as the parcel was huge.

I called him later that evening and told him that IndiaPost's lazy employees have returned the parcel without my permission. I went there with money but the parcel was returned already. I almost fake cried that I lost such a great offer. He told, he will confirm by checking in his system. He affirmed that the parcel was returned. I requested to send back the parcel. :D

Yes, he said. He can return the same when they get it. But I have to pay INR 500/- extra for the courier and handling charges. I denied. I said I don't want to pay extra and he could talk to his seniors as it was not my fault. He agreed :D

Now, next week, I got a call from Nodia Post office. The guy talked in fake tone of a UP guy. I understood he is a conman too. The said post office guy informed me that there was a big parcel in my name. The parcel weighed 10kgs or something and they are scanning it on a x-ray scanner for security reasons. He told me he could see some mobile phones and key ring etc in the parcel. I confirmed that I had won this one and its all okay.

Now the parcel reached to local post office again. Krishna called me again. He informed me I can get my parcel and pay the money to IndiaPost. I told him I will go tomorrow. He agreed.

Now, he called me like every hour from next day. I didn't take any. He called from other numbers. I heard him and hanged up. He called me for 5–6 days and then he got tired of it.

These folks think the people are fools. Dude, I wasted your 2–3k bucks and numerous calls. :D

I felt like a boss.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/aedb6fpr1klq0gn7', 'title': 'Have you ever scammed a scammer?', 'score': {'original': 0.89535, 'ai': 0.10465}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I once encountered a scam via a phone call and I, kind of wasted a lot of money and energy of the scammer.\n\nOn a lazy sunday morning, I got a call from +91 70789 51593, a female voice was talking.

Abhishek Kumar,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Very common and rarely noticed because of the small amounts involved. But when you consider the cumulative impact across the customer base, the figures could be mind boggling.

I usually order groceries from BigBasket.com and never noticed this until recently.

Just note the weight printed on the sticker (111 gms) and compare it to the actual weight on the weigh scale (97gms)

Same here - 250 gms print, but actual weight is 227 gms.

Let's check another product.

Same issue again - 258 gms vs 230 gms

Let's give them another chance!

676 gms vs 642 gms.

Are you doubting the weigh scale to be faulty? Let's check that too.

Printed weight 905 gms, actual weight 913 gms (obviously the wrapper weight is also included)

Just to be sure the weigh scale is fine, let's check another product

100 gms printed, actual weight similar. This proves the weigh scale is working fine!

So now we know where the problem is.

When I first raised the issue with bigbasket, all they did was refund some Rs. 8 to my wallet. Just like most of us here, I thought this issue was an exception, and not the norm. But then, it happened again with my next order and then again with my latest order yesterday.

I guess I am done with Bigbasket for good!

EDIT: To those suggesting there could be loss of moisture, I find it difficult to digest that the weight would drop over 10% in a matter of just 90 minutes. Two of orders were placed under express delivery, which was delivered in less than 90 minutes.

Even if the fruits and vegetables are packed a day or two in advance—which goes against their brand positioning of supplying fresh produce—the company should at least weigh them correctly before shipping out from the warehouse.

And to those doubting the weigh scale, please see the post again. I have shared pics of Amul ghee and Parle biscuits as well. If the same weigh scale can show their weight correctly, why would anyone doubt the scale when it comes to other products.

A few readers suggested complaining to bigbasket or other government authorities. I have raised a complaint with the Legal metrology department. Will update the post once I hear back from them.

Edit 2: The mail I sent to Karnataka Legal metrology department bounced back as the email address that I got from their website seems to be incorrect. I then sent the email to 2 other email addresses mentioned on the website of Karnataka legal metrology department, but haven't heard back from them yet!

Meanwhile, a friend in my society borrowed my weigh scale after I informed him about the issue. And guess what he found?

Among other items that I am not even discussing about, the watermelon he ordered was some 1.5kg. This item should have been at least 2.8kg, if not 4kg. Check the images below!

And what's worse? Bigbasket just refunded the extra amount and brushed off the matter!

Another suggestion to readers doubting / writing off the weigh scale as cheap and inaccurate: Please keep your wisdom to yourself! I have obviously tested the scale before coming to a conclusion.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/e9m0wq43pxkjhsyr', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.199, 'ai': 0.801}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Very common and rarely noticed because of the small amounts involved.

On 18 August, I went to see Batla House there.

On the counter i asked for 2 tickets for the show on Bookmyshow the tickets price was ₹150 there on booking 2 tickets the total price came ₹450. After seeing the bill I came to know he had added 2 snacks for ₹100 without asking. Here is how the conversation went next:-

Me-Sorry, I have not ordered the snacks please cancel that.

Fun Cinemas Guy-Sorry sir, it's compulsory you cannot have tickets without it.

Me- I don't want to eat snacks remove that now.

Me-Call your manager. I want to speak to him.

Fun Cinemas Guy- Here is your new ticket sir.

Rana Ashish,5y,What are common scams in India?,"Few days back while coming back from office, I realized that I needed to refuel my bike’s tank, since it had already touched reserve. When I reached the petrol pump, there was a huge crowd. I queued up and started waiting for my turn.

Usually I prefer full tank, so when it was my turn, I told him to fill my tank full. The guy who was filling asked me to check “Zero”, in the meter and then he started filling.

And when he was done, he filled 13.7 litres of petrol. But my tank capacity is 12 liters. How did he manage to fill 13.7 liter? Where 1 litre (approx) of petrol was already there before filling my tank.

I said, “My tank capacity is 12 litre, how did you fill 13.7 litre?”

He said (arrogantly), “You drive your bike and you don’t know the capacity of your fuel tank? It is of 15 litres.”

The kind of confidence he showed in his reply, I started doubting myself. I am riding this bike since 4 years and I am not aware of the capacity of the tank.

I knew he was telling a white lie, but I was not in the mood to engage in a quarrel.

I asked him, do one thing,

Remove all the petrol from this tank and measure whether it crosses 12 litre or not. I already had 1 litre of petrol, plus you added 13.7 litres, so the cumulative sum will be 14.7 litres.

Forget about my 1 litre, show me that you filled 13.5 litres in my bike.

Now there were other customers too, they started supporting my claim and forced him to do that.

He knew, he was caught red handed.

He said, “Okay! You don’t believe me. Let me bring the pipe to empty your tank and I will measure the petrol from your bike.”

The kind of confidence he showed in his reply, again I started doubting myself. And that’s where I made a mistake, I allowed him to go inside alone, where he never came back.

He ran away from the back door.

There was too much hue and cry about illegal way of filling petrol, but no action was taken. I paid the money for 11 litres of petrol and went away.

I am not blaming or saying that this practice happens in every petrol pump, but wherever it happens, just try to calculate the illegal profit made by them.

Anonymous,4y,What are common scams in India?,"In Bangalore, near Brookfield mall, there is one restaurant (that starts with ‘Mo’ and ends with 'Z'). So one day I went there with my friend to have some light snacks. We had ordered 2 dishes and the waiter presented us bill as we finished. Now a days after reading about how restaurants dupe customers I have started to check the bill meticulously. So in the bill there were three items. The two were correct as per our order and the third one was some random item. They had calculated taxes including that random item. After that by pen they had subtracted the item number 3 from bill. So I called up the waiter and asked why they have done it like this. He was like by mistake it was put but after that they have reduced as well.

I said that was fine but why they have calculated GST on the entire amount and not the reduced amount and asked for fresh bill. He said he can not give fresh bill as it is already registered in the computer (I don't understand this excuse.) I told him it's not my mistake that you put wrong item in the bill. I took out my mobile phone calculator and explained him how there will be difference in the bill in the two cases. The difference was about 5 rupees. He was giving me looks as why I making fuss over just 5 rupees. I could tell from friend's face that she was also thinking why I am doing this. But no! I strictly asked that waiter to call his manager if he is not able to figure out. He went back to bill desk. They had some conversation for some times. After that he returned with the correct bill. We paid and left.

So the takeaways from this incident are:

Restaurants take advantage of our ignorance.
We must check the bills no matter how small or big the order is.
There is no need to feel embarrassed. It's your hard earned money afterall. You have right to know and take action if it is being misused.
Don't succumb to social pressure. It is not a question if 5 rupees. They might be using the same tactis for 10 more customers. We must let them know that we are no fools. We don't know how much money they are making by doing this. When we go to buy vegetables from market we haggle for even one rupee. Why suddenly in restaurant we feel obligated ignore such things.

Manikanta Shetty,7mo,How does the FedEx scam happen these days?,"Last week My friend became victim of cyber fraud.

One call came 1st July at 3.28 PM from FedEx courier company, they said that his parcel has some illegal items in it...my friend asked what parcel..they said parcel booked from Mumbai to Australia in his name ...i.e. he is the sender and mr Hardeep Singh in Australia is recipient...they gave me Transport Control Number and address of Mumbai and Australia along with number of Hardeep Singh of Australia.

My friend said he didn't send any such parcel. they said that someone may have used his name and mobile number to send parcel. they said there are 4 passport, 4 Atm cards, 4 sim cards and 2 books in the parcel...someone is doing terrorist activity and misusing his name.

FedEx person told to immediately report to Mumbai crime branch or go to your nearest police station...My friend said he is at native place so he can’t go to nearest station... and fraudster said first report FIR at your nearet police station and then at your Mumbai address...they will help in filing compliant in Mumbai.. My friend said said ok...they said they will transfer call to crime branch helpline ...they transfer the the call...

The person asked details about the compliant and gave landline number of his police station..he said please search this number in Google and my friend searched and it showed Sion police station...he said he will do video call for face verification and told my friend to be ready with Aadhar and pan card original...also told my friend to be at slient place where no other background should be there...and told after video call they will record my compliant in voice recorder...

After video call they call my friend from Sion police station landline number 02224031376 and told they will take my complaint and will secure my friend IDs so that no miss use of IDs will happen in again.

They later said they are calling to headoffice and complaint will be register there...and told me to be online because they are taking my statement and then on call they show me that someone call them from headoffice and said arrest my friend immediately because my friend have done some big fraud and started yelling on me and started asking to tell the truth and who all others gang member with my friend.

My friend told that he didn’t do anything and dont known anything related to the fraud so he said i will talk to my senior and he will tell what to do next.

So he then took the call to his senior Police officer where he introduce himself as ACP Nitin Jadhav and he ask me if you are really not done anything so i can help you to stop your arrest warrant and to stop all the order relate to freeze the account from RBI.

He first told my friend to transfer 16800.00 as charge to stop arrest and 13800.00 as charge to stop RBI order to freeze account and also told your money will be refunded once you found innocent in this case.

And said they will issue me innocent certificate so that no other police will call you again.

on 4 july, 2023 they again call my friend saying that the advocate who is looking at my case wants to talk to my friend and then when he was on call told my friend for innocent certificate court charges is 45000.00 and pay immediately to start the process.

He shared to my friend the union bank of india account number and told to transfer the amount which is in name of Sagar Sunil Ramoshi.

My friend lost hard earned money in this fraud which is in total 75600.00 Rupee.

PNW,Oct 2,What is the most shameless scam you've seen?,"Years ago, there was a couple who sat in the parking lot with signs that read “Unemployed, four hungry children, please help. God bless you.” They had been doing this for over a year when our local newspaper interviewed them an published their story. This couple stated that they lost their good jobs due to the recession and just wanted jobs so they could feed their kids and, maybe buy a house some day - to be back on their feed again. After the story came out, they were flooded with job offers from all over the county.

Yeah, they turned them all down because panhandling was much more lucrative.

I worked in the city and there were quite a few off ramp and street corner panhandlers - the same ones every day. One day, I saw a young woman who left her corner, walked to the convenience store parking lot and got in to her brand new Honda Accord and drove home. Shift was over, I guess.

Now for a good story: There were two men who stood at the end of exit ramp I took on my way to work for about seven years. One was older, missing teeth and looked like he had led a hard life. The other was young, maybe early-mid 20s and he wore a funky top hat and played guitar and sang - he was really talented and all songs were his own originals. No sign, he just played his music. I am a go-with-my-gut person and never once did they ever made me feel uneasy.

After having enough experiences in horrendous traffic jams and snow stoms, I always keep protein or granola bars and a few bottles of water in my car. I would give them these when the light was red and, very occasionally, enough cash to buy a meal and they were always so kind.

I hadn’t seen the young man for a couple of months until, one night, I stopped at the mini mart on my way home from work for a diet soda and there he was. Working behind the counter. He looked healthy and happy and was so glad to be working. We spoke for a few minutes then he came around and gave me a big hug - man, did I get a lot of dust in my eyes.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o1quakhgz267pnec', 'title': ""What is the most shameless scam you've seen?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Years ago, there was a couple who sat in the parking lot with signs that read “Unemployed, four hungry children, please help.

Dev Soni,Updated Sep 27,What is the biggest scam that every Indian must be aware of?,"You want to know the real scams in india? It's this👇

The story goes like this:

I booked a room with Oyo through Agoda for 3 days and got it with really great discount- more than 65%

The actual price was around 4000 but I paid only 1200 and got the confirmation from the company that my hotel reservation is confirmed.

I reached at the hotel around 8 in the evening thinking that the reservation is confirmed and will go, sleep in the room peacefully.

The scam starts from here:

As soon as I went to the check-in counter, the receptionist asked for my booking id and name. After he checked the amount in the system, he said that there is no water in the hotel and he can't give me a room. I asked him to show me one room as i wanted to check if this was genuine, which he refused to show me in any room.

After suspecting something wrong with the hotel, i contacted the Oyo team and they booked another room in a nearby hotel. Once I went there, the receptionist asked me to pay extra 3000 rupees if I want to check-in the hotel. I told him that I have the booking confirmation email from oyo but he said without the extra amount, he won't allow me to check-in the hotel.

After all the drama and arguments with the new hotel, it was already 10:30 in the night and I was completely tired. I contacted the Oyo team again and asked me to provide the solution.

The Oyo team contacted the hotel manager and the manager informed them that there is problem with the electricity and again he won't be able to give any room. I was standing right in front of him as he was talking to the Oyo team and was completely shocked with that answer.

Now i asked Oyo team to shift my booking to another hotel but all the hotel managers were giving the similar replies. After not getting any room at 11 in the night, Oyo team told that they have raised a complaint and asked me to wait for some time.

I was on my own now and was looking for other hotels on the internet. Since it was very late in the night, i was not getting a single room with price less than 1500 per night. I finally booked one hotel and paid 4500 for 3 nights with the hope that atleast some refund or compensation will be provided by Oyo. But there was no call or update from oyo side after that.

After hearing nothing from oyo side for more than a month, i raised a complaint with consumer forum and Oyo team informed them that they have provided the refund to me. I

I was again completely shocked after seeing that how big companies like Oyo are looting the public and can also lie to the government organisations.

The Oyo trick I understood from here:

Give huge discount to the customer just to attract them and once they reach the hotel, ask for extra money. If they give extra money then fine else don't even refund the booking amount also. This is how they are making money and no wonder why they are running in loss.

Edit1:

After reading all the comments, it looks like so many people have faced the similar issues with Oyo. They have listed the hotels on the platform just to impress the investors but the ground reality is completely different. I have now decided that no matter what, I'll never book an Oyo in my life and will also suggest people to not prefer that platform.

Just imagine you are a girl and going to the Oyo hotel at 11PM in the night and the hotel is not allowing you to check-in or asking for 3–4x extra amount. You will have no option but to pay the extra amount and get a dirty room (because that's how the Oyo rooms are these days)

Edit2: woww!! 8k+ upvotes, it's completely unexpected. Thanks quora family for all the support. Hope people will be more careful next time while booking the Oyo rooms.

Edit3: after writing the answer here, I got the call from oyo- they told that they are relooking into the old complaints and without any questions, they said that we are going to initiate the full refund from our side. This is the power of social media.

They ignored the govt. Bodies like consumer forum, personal complaints but they had to take this one seriously. I would still never book Oyo in my life even after getting full refund because you can't change the culture of the company. There are so many victims of this scam. Not a single person in the comment section, mentioned some good things about the company.

Email from the company:

OYO (company), OYO Hotels and Homes

It's this👇\n\nThe story goes like this:\n\nI booked a room with Oyo through Agoda for 3 days and got it with really great discount- more than 65%\n\nThe actual price was around 4000 but I paid only 1200 and got the confirmation from the company that my hotel reservation is confirmed.\n\nI reached at the hotel around 8 in the evening thinking that the reservation is confirmed and will go, sleep in the room peacefully.\n\nThe scam starts from here:\n\nAs soon as I went to the check-in counter, the receptionist asked for my booking id and name. After he checked the amount in the system, he said that there is no water in the hotel and he can't give me a room. I asked him to show me one room as i wanted to check if this was genuine, which he refused to show me in any room.\n\nAfter suspecting something wrong with the hotel, i contacted the Oyo team and they booked another room in a nearby hotel. Once I went there, the receptionist asked me to pay extra 3000 rupees if I want to check-in the hotel. I told him that I have the booking confirmation email from oyo but he said without the extra amount, he won't allow me to check-in the hotel.\n\nAfter all the drama and arguments with the new hotel, it was already 10:30 in the night and I was completely tired. I contacted the Oyo team again and asked me to provide the solution.\n\nThe Oyo team contacted the hotel manager and the manager informed them that there is problem with the electricity and again he won't be able to give any room. I was standing right in front of him as he was talking to the Oyo team and was completely shocked with that answer.\n\nNow i asked Oyo team to shift my booking to another hotel but all the hotel managers were giving the similar replies. After not getting any room at 11 in the night, Oyo team told that they have raised a complaint and asked me to wait for some time.\n\nI was on my own now and was looking for other hotels on the internet. Since it was very late in the night, i was not getting a single room with price less than 1500 per night.

Pallab Roy Chowdhury,2y,What are the cleverest scams you have come across?,"Do you watch naaptol?

Or homeshop 18?

Or other advertisements which claim that they have the remedy of weight loss in the form of tablets.

Well, let me tell you a story.

Anita (name changed), was a moderately obese girl. Although she didn't have any life threatening or disabling obesity, she was still concious about her weight. As she was an aspiring model, so all she wanted to do was lose those extra kilos.

Day and night, she prayed to God to make her lose weight.

Although in matters of diet, she knew no bounds. Samosa, gol gappa, moglai, egg roll, biriani.. You name it. None of them survived when anita was there.

She became depressed and started to have sleepless nights.

One night, she couldn't sleep, so she turned on the TV at 3 in the morning (3 Am).

Naaptol was showing a remedy of obesity.

“ Ye tablet 30 din lijiye aur paiye mere jaisi patli kamar “

(take these tablets for 30 days and get a slim waist like me)

A model with very sharp features and extremely slim waist announced.

Anita's happiness knew no bounds. She watched it and was convinced that she finally got the solution .

Without giving any second thoughts, she ordered 3 of them ( for 3 Months) and started taking it.

And wow!!

She started to lose weight, FOR REAL!!

She was so happy, that she can finally audition for modelling.

After 3 Months, she lost around 20 kgs. She started getting dressed up for the modelling audition which was scheduled within an hour. She was about to wear her gold necklace when she realised, she had a lump on her throat.

Like this.

Confused and scared that she might lose the audition, she started having palpitations. Her hands started to shake violently on its own (tremors) She thought it might be due to anxiety, or because she was having heavy menstrual bleeding for the past 2 months.

She calmed herself down, drank water and sat down. But of no use.

Few minutes later, she started feeling dizzy and boom!

She fainted.

She was immediately rushed to the hospital.

Basic tests were done which was normal.

However she was having staggering BLOOD PRESSURE and a very high heart rate.

He thyroid hormones were checked, and it was sky rocketing.

The doctors asked if she took any thyroid medications or not to her parents.

They denied.

Then they asked if she took any supplements.

She informed them about the naaptol thing.

The doctors realised it, admitted her for a few days, then discharged her with appropriate medications with a statutory warning “ DO NOT TOUCH THE SUPPLEMENTS EVER IN YOUR LIFE, YOU ARE ALREADY BEAUTIFUL “

So, what actually happened?

WELL, she was suffering from, what we call FACTITIOUS HYPERTHYROIDISM.

Our body produces thyroid hormones on its own. One of the major functions of thyroid hormone is to increased BASAL METABOLIC RATE. That means, the more the thyroid hormones, the more the calories are burnt and faster the weight is lost.

The naaptol frauds took advantage of this.

What they gave in their medicine, was additional thyroid supplements, which will thus increase the thyroid hormones in the body which will lead to more calories burnt and faster weight loss and hence anita lost weight so fast.

The innocent people who don't know about this is are surprised and extremely happy by this miracle and take them on a prolonged basis, leading to HYPERTHYROIDISM, which can lead to symptoms as occurred to ANITA.

BOTH HYPERTHYROIDISM AND HYPOTHYROIDISM can cause goitre(the swelling in the neck) , as shown in the image above.

Sometimes, people can die too.

So, guys, beware of these fraud products.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1d8x05zownthqjyb', 'title': 'What are the cleverest scams you have come across?', 'score': {'original': 0.72505, 'ai': 0.27495}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Do you watch naaptol?\n\nOr homeshop 18?\n\nOr other advertisements which claim that they have the remedy of weight loss in the form of tablets.\n\nWell, let me tell you a story.\n\nAnita (name changed), was a moderately obese girl.

Madan,6y,What are common scams in India?,"Yesterday, my wife and I had gone to Elliot's beach in Chennai. An old lady very close to the shore was selling roasted corn.

PC Google

We tried one and loved it! We ended up buying 2 more. Each roasted corn is sold for 30 rupees. We didn't bargain and gave her 100 rupees and got 10 back.

As soon as the transaction was over, we started walking towards the beach. My wife was holding corn in one hand and the 10 rupees note firmly on the other. I kind of saw partially/sensed some kind of hand gesture from the old lady behind our back and in no time a young woman holding a tiny baby approached us and started asking us for the 10 rupees in my wife's hand to feed her baby.

It was a real awkward situation and after a couple of minutes we caved in. My wife handed her the 10 rupee note. The young woman turned quickly, walked towards the corn lady and dropped the 10 rupees note in a box next to her. I JUST COULDN’T BELIEVE I SAW THAT!

Rahul Sharma,2y,What are common scams in India?,"This scam isn't common but surprising.

This is the entry point of Jaipur Railway Station. As soon as you enter the station and you walk towards the platform, some people in red uniform ask you to put your bag in a machine which looks exactly same as a machine that is used at security gate to scan the luggage. You would feel that it's a security check point and keep your bag in that machine. As soon as your bag crosses the machine and you pick it up, the staff asks you to pay 10 rupees per bag. They have sanitized your bags, without you even asking for it.

If you say that you didn't want your bag to be sanitized and you thought it was a part of a security check, they show you a poster which you missed to read :

9 out of 10 people who travel to this particular station for the first time, miss this poster and end up being trapped. The staff at that machine only sanitize your bag and not your hands or clothes, so you hold your bag again with unsanitized hands and move on. What's the purpose of this sanitization excercise, who approved it and how could these people stop passengers and ask them to keep their bags on their machines. I couldn't believe this open scam when I saw it first at a railway station.

There are some poor people who carry more than 10 small size bags and they are being forced to pay over 100 rupees. Some of them cannot even read those instructions. They don't hire a coolie to save money and then they are forced to pay here, for a service which they never wanted.

This UV sanitization cabin is made to look exactly like a security desk and kept at the entrance and it is almost impossible to not get trapped. I was trapped once too. I didn't pay the amount because I thought it was unethical business and they allowed me to go without much trouble.

I have reported them to the Indian Railways and PMO. I hope this fraud is stopped or Railway at least makes sure that these people don't stand on the way to direct people to use their services. They should take payment before they process the bags. That way people won't be trapped.

Anish Kumar,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"So, This happened with me today, I posted an ad of a digital camera on OLX, which I have been trying to sell for quite a time but was unsuccessful to do so. Today one customer called me and this is how the conversation went :

HIM: Hello, You posted an ad and I want to purchase it.

ME: Okay, for how much you will take it?

HIM: 2550 (3000 was the price I posted on the site).

ME: okay.

HIM: Give me your Gpay QR code on my WhatsApp and I will send you the amount and my boy will pick it up.

So, as you can see here he didn't even ask anything about the camera defect or how old it was, any person who has even a minute interest would ask a question about the product they are about to buy. (First red Flag)

Being an avid reader on Quora I read some scam related posts, so I was a little suspicious.

After I gave him my Gpay details this is how the conversation went:

HIM: open your Gpay app, I am sending you the money.

ME: I was like what? why do I need to open the app? if you send me the money it will show on the notification.

HIM: See I am sending you from Military payment, And do you have balance in your account? (Second red flag)

ME: Why the heck do you care if I have money in my account or not (At this point, I knew something isn't right).

HIM: Okay, okay !! I am sending you the money.

**And something like this popped in my Gpay app**

ME( infuriated): WHAT IS THIS? YOU DIDNT SEND ANY MONEY IN FACT, YOU HAVE REQUESTED MONEY FROM ME AND HAVE WRITTEN” Received 2550 ” in the message box.

HIM: Just press on pay option and the money will be deducted from my account and will be transferred to you.

ME: THIS IS NOT HOW Gpay WORKS, What do you think I am a fool or what? (I lost all my patience and at this point, I cursed him so much that it's not appropriate to write here. )

He hung up the phone.

I mean just imagine if someone who doesn't know to use these apps would have really lost a lot of money.

Even if I was naive enough to pay him the money I would have had the last laugh, because you see I didn't have that much money in my account, I am a student also broke :)

All thanks to QUORA and its amazing users, I read something similar and was very suspicious.

Fraud at the cost of PATRIOTISM

I encountered this scam before too!

I was returning from Hazarat Nizamuddin Railway Station, Delhi towards ITO Metro Station. I was in an auto rickshaw. As soon as I reached the ITO Metro Station entry stairs, I was stopped by a group of three women. Without saying anything, they just pinned a small paper on my right shoulder on which our own country’s National Flag, that is, our Tiranga(Tricolor) was printed. I smiled in gratitude thinking that maybe they were just doing it for increasing patriotism among us Indians and then I just started going towards the entry premises. But no, that was not the end of course. They stopped me by holding my hand and said, “We are collecting money for ORPHAN CHILDREN, we are from an NGO”.

Without wasting my time, I took out some changes and gave a ₹20 note to them. But their greediness show had just started. She again asked for more money, “Your wallet has more money and you are just giving me 20₹, give me some more money”.

I finally gave her ₹30 more, in total I gave her 20+30=₹50 and finally I was on my way. But later when I thought about this incident, I realized that something is wrong and an NGO never ask for money like this, never. They can request you, they can have relevant documents but in this case, nothing was there, no documents, no uniform of that NGO, nothing, nothing and nothing. So guys finally my case was completed.

But! But! But!

Last month, I mean in May,

I was near AKSHARDHAM MANDIR, Metro Station, and I saw that SCAM again. I went near them & I stood near those “Unethical and greedy” women for about one hour. And I observed each and everything keenly, I even made a footage and circulated that video on social media too for public awareness for all these fraud peoples & their extra-fraud techniques.

So, here are some of the screenshots, from the recorded video.

STEP - 1 :- STOPPING PEOPLE AND PINNING FLAG ON THEIR SHOULDER.

STEP 2 : - ASKING FOR THE MONEY AND INTRODUCING THEMSELVES AS THE MEMBERS OF SOME NGOs.

STEP 3 : - FINALLY ASKING FOR MONEY! -_-

Guys, when I was observing them, one of those women, was continuously observing me too but none of them came to me for pinning the flag and the money.

They have experience of this “Scam” and they stop only the innocent people and the ones who are new in Delhi because the outsiders don't know much about these scams and frauds in Delhi.

So, dear readers please be careful around such fraud people and don't spend your money on these things. This group plays with our feelings for our Nation. This group is very common on the roads of Delhi. So please be careful.

Thanks,

Swapnil Nimbalkar,5y,What are common scams in India?,"ICICI PRUDENTIAL (Insurance Scam)

I have taken home loan of Rs.53,00,000/- from ICICI Bank for the period of 20 years. While filling up the loan application form sales person told me about the iShield 360° insurance policy, its benefits etc and gave me estimate of Rs.1,85,432/- (one time payment) which will be added to my loan amount. (refer image) Along with loan application form I signed the insurance form too.

The policy includes critical illness cover, all type of death cover/loss of limb, in case of my death Rs.48,96,875/- will be credited to the loan account. The policy I opted for is of 10 years, as I feel that I will be in a position to repay the amount within this period.

I did not receive the policy even after 15 days of making payment. Contacted the bank sales manager, he promised me that it will be resolved soon. 10 days passed, he got frustrated (due to my repeated calls) and gave me contact no. of Mr.’X’ who belongs to the insurance company. He also made false promises for 15–20 days without any concrete solution (It was very frustrating)

I contacted the customer care, they said that there is no policy linked to my loan a/c no or phone no. I was advised to visit nearest branch, did same with no luck.

Filed a complaint with the nodal officer, who took matter seriously and emailed me the policies after 7 days (total one and half month after making payment)

I contacted the customer care to cancel the policies, they told me to drop an email, the request can not be taken over a phone call. I did email them and received a reply saying “your ID is not registered with us”. The sales guy had deliberately put wrong email ID.

Went to the branch, changed email ID, emailed them to cancel the policies.

Now here’s the scam (see image)

I visited the branch to see the scanned copies of my application form. I came to know that the sales guy had made my false signature and I was issued a policy of Rs.1,13,60,840/- (why would I go for this amount if my loan amount is Rs.53L) for a period is 5 years (I had applied for 10 years)

I had to visit the branch office 3 times for different reasons.

I had to fight to get my money back.

I paid interest on the above amount.

Today (after 2 months and 15 days of making payment) I received SMS that money will be deposited shortly.

I consider that insurance companies in India are scammers. The sales team will always make false promises and later they will tell you to contact customer care for any queries.

I still don’t know why did Insurance guy do this (to achieve his monthly target?)

Let me know if I should move to IRDA/Consumer court to get the interest back or I should file a complaint for compensation.

Thank you for reading.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xbqvozkj62hgr34i', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'ICICI PRUDENTIAL (Insurance Scam)\n\nI have taken home loan of Rs.53,00,000/- from ICICI Bank for the period of 20 years.

Nistha Tripathi,Updated 5y,"What exactly is the ""Vyapam"" scam? Why have so many died because of it?","I am from Indore, MP. I did my Bachelor's in Engineering from here and then Master's from USA. After living for 7 years in USA, I got back here due to personal reasons and current run my own business from Indore. When I had finished my XII, I cleared both Medical and Engineering entrance exams. I know the kind of effort it needed. Living in Indore for last 3 years, I have seen the origin and growth of Vyapam scam and know some people indirectly who have been talking or associated with this scam. So, I hope I can give a closer understanding of this topic.

I admire Balaji but on this topic, I think his take might be a bit more trivial. The scandal and deaths are pretty real, not just a statistical play of numbers. And Dr Banga's comment that CM Chauhan aided the inquiry and helped bring the justice brings a cynical smile to my face.

As per Medical admission in India
 4.7% of the candidates appearing from MBBS entrance exams in India got a seat in 2013. Removing the not so good colleges and branches, one can say that it is fairly hard to get a good Medical seat in India. I also know many people who have not taken one but even 2-3 years of drop to keep trying qualifying in these exams to fulfill their dream of becoming a Doctor (thanks to the peer and parental pressure). In fact, in India, all coveted professional streams have scary acceptance rates such as 0.5% for IIMs and <2% for IITs. It just shows how much preparation and mental toughness a student needs to pursue his dream career.

The entrance exams in MP are conducted by Vyapam which is an autonomous body. The scam spread to many professional exams but Medical is the biggest one since Medical seats are paid for at the highest prices, so lets just focus on that. While I am focusing on mugging all those Biology terms, some parents found another way to ensure their children get a Medical seat. A group of insiders to Vyapam began to collude in a sophisticated way to help their 'clients' get good marks in these exams. How? The method varied from using impersonators, swapping answer sheets to seating a group of people together to enable cheating etc. Such a thing requires an organized effort at multiple levels in the system - the people who set the paper, invigilator, exam organizer, people involved in scoring etc etc.

What is DMAT scam?
Akin to Vyapam scam, it came to light that the real money exchanged hands under the DMAT scam. Dental and Medical Admission Test (DMAT) is an examination held for admission into the private medical colleges of Madhya Pradesh, India. Here, the seats to private colleges were sold by fixing these tests. The candidates who paid the amount were directed to leave the OMR sheet blank and were filled later (Dental and Medical Admission Test: Scamsters operated in cyber cafes, colleges - The Times of India
).

Who benefitted from it?
The rich families whose kids could not have otherwise cracked the exam and Medical college owners who could sell their seats and who actually acted as the middlemen between these parents and insider officials who conducted the exams. It has been alleged that MBBS seats were sold for 50L and PG seats for about 1cr.

Why is it so worrisome?

It could have been just another scandal but lets examine the repercussion and something the normal middle class parents are not yet understanding. When such seats are rigged in a professional exam, it is their kid who was preparing hard but could not make the cut who is the eventual victim. Some even committed suicide and some had to settle for other non-rewarding careers.
Secondly, when a person who has paid 1cr for his education enters the profession, his first goal is to recuperate his investment. After all, why would one be willing to pay such hefty sums for a career if he did not think he could get it all back? This leads to further scams in Medical industry.
The society suffers when people who may not be qualified or motivated are allowed to enter a profession that deals with human lives. And what moral value am I passing on to next generation by telling it that go and do whatever, I can buy a career for you.

What is the political involvement behind this scam?
The scam goes way back but things only started unearthing around 2009. The scale of the operation suggested the involvement of influential and powerful people from Medical fraternity, political parties, police and judicial teams. A lot of children of these people are studying/have studied MBBS from some of the controversial colleges known to have been involved in DMAT scam. This is the reason that the powerful layer of the society did not want this scam to be unearthed.
It remains a question why did ruling BJP govt in MP decide to form a STF (special task force) locally instead of handing the matter over to CBI. It is also interesting that as soon as CBI came on board, it registered 5 FIRs regarding the deaths that were claimed to be natural earlier.
State govt tried to keep things under local control as long as they could, only giving it to outside scrutiny when things have caught national and international interest. At this point, it seems everyone is trying to save his own a**. I am sure the non-ruling party members are not clean either and it is a deep level collusion but those who are in power seem to have abused it a lot.

I hope the truth comes out soon and the involved are justly punished. Because if they are not, these powerful people will continue to exploit the system and the hard working student who missed out on a seat by 1 mark will keep having his dream squashed and a patient will be billed 25L for a trivial problem by a Doctor who graduated by paying 1cr in donation. This scam is a cancer to our society, do not take it lightly.

Richard Muller,Updated 6y,Have you ever scammed a scammer?,"I got a phone call from a person claiming to represent the US Government. He wanted to speak to my (adult) daughter, but I was suspicious, and asked him for details. He said that she had missed jury duty, and was about to be arrested, but if we acted quickly, we could avert the damage.

I told him that I wanted to protect her, and that, if possible, it would be best if she never even learned about the problem. What could I do? He said that for a $500 fee, they could expedite a document that would avoid all prosecution. I said I would do that; how do we proceed? He said we could meet at a local CVS Pharmacy; he would bring the forms, I could sign them, and he would file them. But he had to get the funds in cash, not cheque or credit card.

I agreed to do this, but (I said) I needed to have his cell phone number so I could find him. He was reluctant, but I insisted. He handed his phone over to his boss. I was so sincere, and so compliant, that he met my request, and gave me the cell phone number.

I then told the man that I was reporting the scam, and that his cell phone number would soon be inoperative. If it is possible for them to trace who had bought it, then he would be in even deeper trouble.

He got very upset with me. He asked me if I was a psychologist. (That’s because my counter-scam had seemed professional to him.) We chatted for about ten minutes. I told him that his scam was unfair and harmful. He responded by saying that he only took money from people who had cheated the government. I suggested that he get a better job. He said he had tried, but six months ago he had been released from prison, and all prospective employers had turned him down.

He finished with some chilling words: “You realize, of course, that I know where you live.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j751ui4oegxlzadc', 'title': 'Have you ever scammed a scammer?', 'score': {'original': 0.9925, 'ai': 0.0075}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I got a phone call from a person claiming to represent the US Government.

Tavit Nisanyan,6y,What are the cleverest scams you have come across?,"Turkish salesmen are the most natural scam artists I have ever had the chance to get ripped off by.

The masterful psychological games they play with you are absolutely undefeatable unless you have a heart of steel.

In this picture you see a Turkish salesman in his natural habitat, his shop.

His prey, unaware foreign tourists. He carefully inspects his surroundings and before you know it, he picks his target.

From this point on, you really stand no chance of keeping your money in your pocket.

Because the moment you make eye contact with this man, he will sell you his ice cream.

First, he will lure you in with jokes and compliments. At this point it is easy to infer that he is sweet talking you to sell you his product. This is your first mistake. What he is really doing is much cleverer than this. He expertly breaks the fourth wall by firstly pretending to be a cliché salesman, but then pretending to show you his true self, by changing his voice, his tone and the way he acts. In an instant he turns from a charlatan into a real “friend” to you.

This makes you feel special. He makes you think that you, yes YOU out of all these people are his real friend, and everyone else is a client.

He now has your attention. So he goes on to step two.

He offers you free stuff. Once he goes through the trouble of giving you a taster of whatever he is selling, you feel responsible to buy his product. However he makes sure of this in step three.

Once you ask for the price, he gives you a long, meaningful look, and says:

“For you only, I’ll do 15 Liras”

And you buy his product.

Later you find out that what he sold you actually costs 3 Liras.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mqd6ghwjonu39718', 'title': 'What are the cleverest scams you have come across?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Turkish salesmen are the most natural scam artists I have ever had the chance to get ripped off by.\n\nThe masterful psychological games they play with you are absolutely undefeatable unless you have a heart of steel.\n\nIn this picture you see a Turkish salesman in his natural habitat, his shop.\n\nHis prey, unaware foreign tourists.

Waited for nearly 45 minutes, checked on app to see status, found delivery person as already left the shop, but can be seen on tracker half way through and standing in same location 15–20 minutes for some unknown reason(part of scam keep reading).

Finally received my order, delivery agent asked for mobile number (found bit suspicious)

I paid the total amount in CASH, so far so good. Wait scam just not started yet.

Interestingly after receiving my order and fully paying it, I got an SMS stating your order is cancelled and cancellation fee of 75 is charged.

I was surprised and furious, felt that there must be honest mistake from swiggy.

But this was no mistake. It's a scam by delivery agents - they collect COD amount and check the order as undeliverable (remember he purposely wasted around 15–20 mins midway through in the same location without moving an inch). This way they pocket the COD money and the great swiggy punishses honest customer. And why not they have hired only gem of a person, critically acclaimed for their honesty, no reason to doubt them.

Contacted swiggy customer care for resolution. Instead of correcting their mistake, they replied back rejecting my claim, which literally means I lied. After being a long time customer of swiggy I feel betrayed and it's definitely not about 75 rs , it being cheated that get to my nerves.

I have made resolution to not to order anymore from a company which breeds cheaters and treats it's customer with no respect, at least I would have expected them to give a second thought before coming to conclusion.

I request my fellow quorans to avoid payment in COD.

Edit 1:

Received a call from resolution department of swiggy. Appreciate that they acknowledged the issue and agreed to refund the cancellation charges.

Sarthak Bhatt,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"The ola drivers' scam

A few days ago my family attended a marriage ceremony. When the ceremony was over, I booked an Ola. It arrived in 5 minutes. I confirmed the OTP with the driver.

But just when he was about to start the ride, he turned to me and said :

Sir, I have pressed the ‘Ride Completed’ button by mistake.

I checked my phone and yeah it was showing that the ride was over.

Now generally the fare from the banquet hall to my home is Rs.140–160. But since the ride ended after travelling a few meters the total was Rs.96.

He then told me that he will drop us home and asked me to pay Rs250.

He claimed that he had dropped many people to this location and the ola app showed around Rs250 as a total fare.

Luckily on that day, I had taken a screenshot of the bill that the app displayed before checking in for the ride.

Image source: my phone’s gallery.

I showed him the screenshot and gave him Rs141.

Now yesterday I faced the same situation again but this time I didn't have the screenshot. So, I ended up giving the money that driver asked (that was toooo high than the general price).

This is a common scam ola drivers are using to earn more money. So do take a screenshot before riding an ola.

Dharmik Tejasvi,Updated 6y,What are common scams in India?,"Not sure if this is common but definitely worth highlighting.

Our 4 year old LEDTV suddenly didn't work.

When I called the customer care, they agreed to send an engineer. But he's to be paid a “conveyance n consultance” fees of 400/- irrespective of the issue and subsequent charges to repair it.

I reluctantly agreed.

An engineer visited the home and inspected the device jus by tapping on the TV screen at random places ; didn't even unmount the TV from wall stand.

He then asked me to sign a form regarding inspection details and asked for the “fees”

When I asked him what the issue was, he attributed it to a fault in motherboard panel and it had to be replaced wholly at a whopping cost of 16k INR since the TV is past its guarantee period !

He also dismissed any alternate less-expensive solutions.

As he left, I wondered if I had to buy a new basic model LED TV or a second hand feature rich model .

Hours spent on Google, Flipkart, Amazon, Quikr were of no use.

After a colleague's suggestion, finally, it struck me to search for a local electronics service center.

And lo ! A guy arrived at an agreed time, unmounted the device and inspected. Then he requested the device to be taken to his shop to check for further issues. Only upon his confirmation of possibility to repair along with cost details he said he'd proceed .

Next day he said he could repair the TV by changing few ICs at a cost of 2500 INR. I struggled to agree to the cost without sounding surprised.

Few days later, he came back with the TV, connected the DTH himself and demonstrated it worked normally again.

I finally gave in to my temptation and narrated my ordeal before reaching out to him.

When asked why there's so much cost difference, he smiled signing off “If companies attend to repair works at IC level, then they can hardly thrive”

Beware of Samsung !

A few days later when I got a call from Samesong seeking my feedback they received an earful.

It's been few months then since my TV was repaired and I almost forgot it till I saw this question.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9n5qro4xsublt12d', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Not sure if this is common but definitely worth highlighting.\n\nOur 4 year old LEDTV suddenly didn't work.\n\nWhen I called the customer care, they agreed to send an engineer.

Krizhna Chandran,Updated 4y,What is the biggest scam that every Indian must be aware of?,"THIS ☝..

Its an epic scam practiced by one of the leading telecom operators in the country : IDEA

So this is how the whole story goes…

Around 3 weeks ago , a customer care call from idea came and informed me about upgrading to the 4G sim card from the existing one i am using.( its been 3 years since i am using this sim card)

Couple of days later i upgraded the sim card (☝) free of cost..though i didn’t felt any changes in upgradation, i was happy to have replaced the much older sim with that of a new one..

Suddenly

Yesterday morning when i woke up the sim card was displaying “ NO SERVICE”

I tried so many ways and it was all in vain..i then decided to visit the IDEA store near my place..they examined the sim card and told me everything is fine( 0% physical damage)..

They then contacted the customer care..the customer care representative informed the store manager the sim card is active and there is no technical fault..no one knows the reason, but my sim card is not working..the store manager suggested me to wait some time..

In the mean time 3–4 people arrived with the same problem..NO SERVICE!!!

He was calling the customer care and it was the same response..i then assumed it could be a temporary network problem with everyone as many more people are arriving at the store..but there are people coming to the store for recharge purpose with active sim cards and the store manager calling customer care with an active IDEA sim..i was confused, as its not a problem with every sim card..

I then called the customer care from the store manager’s phone and some other executive picked up the phone..he asked my number..and without any hesitation he informed me that my sim card is PHYSICALLY DAMAGED and i need to take a duplicate sim card..i was wondering how he knows my sim’s physical damage!!! In fact it was just a 3 weeks old sim card and i never used it on any other phones too..the conversation was over after a heated debate over the issue..i took a duplicate sim card for ₹200/-…

Today ,i shared this incident with my friend and he told me he duplicated his idea sim for the very reason 2 weeks ago..i was not expecting that..so i posted this issue in my whats app group and i was really really shocked to see the response from my friends..

Every single member( 17 idea sim card holders i know ) with an IDEA connection had to duplicate their sim card over the last 4 months..reason :PHYSICAL DAMAGE!!!!

Cutting the sim connection intentionally and blaming physical damage for a duplicate sim for ₹200 is the new IDEA..","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/giupl0eamy6ck3z4', 'title': 'What is the biggest scam that every Indian must be aware of?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'THIS ☝..\n\nIts an epic scam practiced by one of the leading telecom operators in the country : IDEA\n\nSo this is how the whole story goes…\n\nAround 3 weeks ago , a customer care call from idea came and informed me about upgrading to the 4G sim card from the existing one i am using.( its been 3 years since i am using this sim card)\n\nCouple of days later i upgraded the sim card (☝) free of cost..though i didn’t felt any changes in upgradation, i was happy to have replaced the much older sim with that of a new one..\n\nSuddenly\n\nYesterday morning when i woke up the sim card was displaying “ NO SERVICE”\n\nI tried so many ways and it was all in vain..i then decided to visit the IDEA store near my place..they examined the sim card and told me everything is fine( 0% physical damage)..\n\nThey then contacted the customer care..the customer care representative informed the store manager the sim card is active and there is no technical fault..no one knows the reason, but my sim card is not working..the store manager suggested me to wait some time..\n\nIn the mean time 3–4 people arrived with the same problem..NO SERVICE!!!\n\nHe was calling the customer care and it was the same response..i then assumed it could be a temporary network problem with everyone as many more people are arriving at the store..but there are people coming to the store for recharge purpose with active sim cards and the store manager calling customer care with an active IDEA sim..i was confused, as its not a problem with every sim card..\n\nI then called the customer care from the store manager’s phone and some other executive picked up the phone..he asked my number..and without any hesitation he informed me that my sim card is PHYSICALLY DAMAGED and i need to take a duplicate sim card..i was wondering how he knows my sim’s physical damage!!!

Raman Khandelwal,4y,What are common scams in India?,"India's water purifier scam.If you have a RO you should definitely read this.

These big companies loot us indians Because of our lack of knowledge and fool us.

*Edit 1 and 2 are important*

While selling a purifier many sales man use two tactics to dupe us into believing that we need purified water from their RO.

They use TDS meter.

This tool is used to check the impurities in the purifier

And according to those deceiving salesman the lower the number the better it is.The bigger the number the more impurities it has.

So what they will do is ,they will use this in your Normal water.The TDS will be around 60–150.

And then they will use their purifier's water/PACKAGED WATER and show that TDS is only 15.

And will tell us that “See ,that's why you should buy water purifier”

But what they won't tell is that this water is not “pure” it is highly “Demineralised” which means the important mineral contents are not there in the water.

According to WHO we can drink water upto 500TDS.

Now to prove this we use this meter in a mineral bottle water .

See the TDS is 246 in mineral bottled water .

That's why a mineral water bottle is better than a packaged water bottle cause it has essential minerals in it.

The second trick they will use it through this Device

“Electrolyte”.

So basically what they will do is ,they will place one end in your Normal water which is purified mineral water in this case and their “purifier's water “ in other.

After some time our normal water will turn yellow and they will tell us that we were drinking all these impurities.

Truth- These are not impurities but dissociated minerals because of the electrolysis process.

Just think for a second.Everyone knows this.

Distilled water is a very bad conductor of electricity coz it doesn't have any minerals in it.

Now using the same principle we now know that since the RO water has close to no minerals at all ,then electricity hardly passes through it and hence nothing happens.

So beware of those salesman who use these methods to scam you . who make you believe that your normal water is bad.There are other ways to find this out but not these two.They just there to scam you.

“Jaago Grahak Jaago!”

Credit to YouTube/Innovative Technocare .

Edit : I am not suggesting that ROs are bad .My motive was to spread awareness regarding the malpractices used by sellers.

Edit 2: TDS is not a right measure to check if a water is drinkable or not.Water which has 300TDS is drinkable if it doesn't have harmful minerals.

Also water with TDS 200 can be harmful to drink if it has harmful minerals.

Chirag Garg,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"**Beware of Rental Cars Scam**

So I took a rental car from Zoomcar for a trip from Pune to Mahabaleshwar. The car they have provided is all dirty and have an almost empty fuel tank(I had booked with fuel).

Remember whenever you choose for the with fuel option they provide you a car with an almost empty tank so that you will ask for a refund and they can play their trick.

After filling petrol we started our journey after some time, car breakdown happens. We were in the middle of Pune and Mahabaleshwar. We tried their customer support number many times but it was not working. After wasting an hour like this we decided to repair the car ourselves from a local mechanic(It costs us too).

After completing trip we park the car and lock it safely. We paid 2313 for the car + 3000 security deposit + 1000 fuel refund. So we should get 4000 as a refund(3000+1000).

After 2 days we found out that they have charged 4000 on the name of damage charges. The exact amount that should be refunded to us. Here is the receipt they have provided.

Yes, they charged twice for the same damage(1000+3000). I have no idea why? We should ask them to refund our money, to provide faulty car instead they are asking for damage charges from us. Can you believe that?

I was trying their customer support number but still, it is unreachable. After 2 weeks got a call from them, please clear the due charges in your zoomcar account. I asked them about the charges, they told me it is for car tyre damage(I returned it in perfect condition). I asked them did they have any proof, they told me yes we can link damaged car pics in your account, I said do it. After holding the call for about 15 mins they told me they are not able to find the pictures now, they will do it in two working days. Two months passed neither I got pics from them nor I got a call again. But the amount is still due in my account.

Jean-Marie Valheur,Feb 15,What are some of the best hoaxes of all time?,"This is a hoax I, myself, fell for. Everyone did, at the time. See there’s this lady, Sacheen Littlefeather. She died in 2022. Her biggest claim to fame was being a Native American rights activist. In 1974, she refused an Oscar for Best Actor, on behalf of Marlon Brando.

She did this to “raise awareness for the plight of Native Americans”. It caused a huge uproar, and it was enormously controversial at the time. Incredibly effective activism, too. Anyway the lady died and her sisters — last name Cruz — came out and said she had been lying, misrepresenting her heritage.[1] Born Maria Louise Cruz, “Littlefeather” was the daughter of a Mexican immigrant and a white mother of French, German and Dutch heritage.

Sacheen Littlefeather has ZERO association with any Native American tribes. Her whole identity was as fake as the name she adopted for herself. She was, for all intents and purposes, the Rachel Dolezal of Native American activism. And for over fifty years… most bought it. Hell, in 2022 the Oscars even came out with an “official apology”.

Rohan Jain,2y,What are real life scams that people fall for all the time?,"I had visited a salon to get a simple haircut yesterday.

As soon as the hair stylist saw my hair, he made a face and asked, “Your hair is of such bad quality.”

I could sense where he was going, but I did not comment. Over the next few minutes while cutting my hair, he had made comments like:

“Such dry hair. When was the last time you did any treatment?”
“Do you have hairfall issues?”
“Do you face dandruff issues?”

And when I did not reply, he also started targeting my face. “Your face has a bad quality skin. You should get treatments done.”

And then finally, as if he had never thought of that, he arrived at a perfect solution.
“You know what, we have the perfect hair and face treatments for you. They usually cost INR 5400/- but with Diwali discount, you can get it done for INR 4400/-.”

“Maybe next time,” I politely refused.

It is crazy how the beauty industry first tries to create insecurities and then leverages those insecurities to milk their business.

Unfortunately, people fall into the trap of this beauty industry day in and day out. Even after knowing that most of it is probably a scam.

Anonymous,5y,What are common scams in India?,"I am going anonymous as I had not shared this incident with someone and don't want them to know about it.

My personal experience of Urban clap. Booked for a plumbing service. The guy just had to change 3 leaking pipes of the overhead tank.Plumber arrives and inspects. Normally it would take maximum of 1–2 hours. . The guy asks an amount of 3500 for the service and but the amount shown on the app for service was nearly less than 500 or 1000. After a lot of discussion he asked 100 for this service and not actual work. Amount given the plumber walks away. I receive an email from urban clap: “ payment of 100rs received as per your request the service has been cancelled ”. I was literally in shock the plumber just acted over smart.

2nd time: same issue next day.

Booked for plumbing service. Guy arrives, inspects and says the work is a bit more and cannot be done by a single person. Tomorrow I'll apply for a holiday at office and complete your work and bring another person with me. Here amount remaines same 3500. Again I had to pay 100 but this time he said truth and asked the amount. Next day early morning he arrives with his co-worker(his 10 year old son) and starts working. I had bought all the pipes and stuff already. Within 3 hours he completed the work. Amount 3500 paid.

Now comes the real part the guy had not understood the connection properly and gave a cross connection. The tank had water but the taps were dry. I called him and said the issue. He replied it might be due to an airlock and suggested me some tricks to try. Nothing worked a Nd asked him to sort it out . After that he blocked my number.

After that I went to local plumbing stores to ask help of a plumber. Nearly after 4–5 plumbing stores found a plumber. He now checks for nearly 30min and then understands that a cross connection has been given and it is not an airlock. The plumber earlier has messed up all the connections. The whole work had to be done again and I had to spend an amount of 4500 this time.

Total amount I spent to change 3 pipes:100(cancellation) +125+3500+material cost + 4500+ material cost again. .. Nearly 8500.

I complained to urban clap but what action was taken I am unaware but that moment I uninstalled the app and shared the incident with max number of person I could.

I guess I learned the hard way.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j47h5stkunv08yfg', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am going anonymous as I had not shared this incident with someone and don't want them to know about it.\n\nMy personal experience of Urban clap.

The guy asks an amount of 3500 for the service and but the amount shown on the app for service was nearly less than 500 or 1000. After a lot of discussion he asked 100 for this service and not actual work. Amount given the plumber walks away.

I had bought all the pipes and stuff already. Within 3 hours he completed the work. Amount 3500 paid.\n\nNow comes the real part the guy had not understood the connection properly and gave a cross connection. The tank had water but the taps were dry. I called him and said the issue. He replied it might be due to an airlock and suggested me some tricks to try. Nothing worked a Nd asked him to sort it out . After that he blocked my number.\n\nAfter that I went to local plumbing stores to ask help of a plumber. Nearly after 4–5 plumbing stores found a plumber.

Anonymous,5y,What are some common frauds experienced in India?,"Quikr/OLX add Scam,

Reason I am writing it annonymous is many of my friends are on qoura and I don't want to look stupid to them. I lost 5000 today and don't want others to be victim of such fraud. Kindly read this answer carefully and it might help you to save your hard earned money.

I wanted to buy a second hand scooter and searched on Quikr to Check if any available. I came across this add.

I called the person and he introduced himself as a airport security personnel(Army) working at Ahmedabad airport. He asked me to meet at Ahmedabad airport terminal-2 for further check on scooter. I reached at airport morning 11:00am and called him. He recieved my call and asked me to send him my ID proof. When I asked him why he needs my Id he said as he is on duty, if he wants to go out he has to get written permission from office and as a proof that he is meeting me he needs my Id. I didn't thought much and send him my ID on whatsup. In few minutes He called me and asked me that as scooter is parked in airport cargo yard, I need to submit security amount 3020 rupees to get it out. If I don't like the scooter they will return 3000 rupees. When I asked him how can I trust him he send me photo ID proof of army personnel named Sreekant. Also another person called me introducing himself working in airport cargo office. I trusted him and transferred 3020 using Paytm on provided number by him

Immediately he called me to thank and said he is sending office boy along with scooter as written permission is under process and it may take 10–15 minutes. In few minutes I got call from so called office boy and confirmed that he is in cargo parking and coming with scooter. In next 5 minutes I got call from the same person whom I was dealing with and asked me to submit another 2000 rupees. By now I sensed something fishy but he convinced me by stating himself as an army officer and can't make fraud. I transferred another 2000 rupees

Again in 3–4 minutes I got call from the so called office boy asking me to submit remaining amount to scooter price as it's airport cargo policy. Now I realised that I am being hoaxed. I called the first person and he assured me that he is really working in airport and coming with scooter. He didn't came and again I called him about when he is coming. He tried to convince me that as a airport procedure I need to submit full amount of scooter price and he is submitting 15000 on my behalf and I have to submit 10000. By now I was sure about scam and asked him to return my 5000. He tried to convince me to send him 10000 more and said just check the scooter and refuse to buy it so that cargo office will return full amount. When I refused to transfer that amount and asked him detailed questions about his exact location in airport, he became furious and started abusing me and cut the call. Airport police station was there only so I decided to fill a complaint about this fraud. On speaking with police officer I came to know this is common Scam and so many people lost their hard earned money on such scam. Modus operandi of this gang is citing address of airport in the city. They will introduce themselves as a army personnel and speak very professionally. I request all off them whoever is coming across such adds, please don't transfer a single penny. Report immediately if you come across any such adds.

Chukwuebuka Sunday,3y,Who is history's greatest fraud?,"This is Sergei Mavrodi

He was the man behind the popular pyramid scheme called MMM. He founded MMM in 1989.

In 1997 he declared bankruptcy and fled with people’s money. There was no trace of him until his arrest in 2003.
In 2011 he resurfaced with another version of the scheme he had called MMM Global

The scheme spread across countries. It was launched in China, India, South Africa, Zimbabwe.

In November 2015, the ‘plague” hit Nigeria.

It promised a 30% return on investments, everyone became an entrepreneur. People invested their life savings.

Funds reserved for building houses were invested in MMM, marriages were postponed as the saved money had to be invested. Students used their school fees to invest. People took loans from the bank, sold their lands just to invest. Just like gambling, it was an addiction.

MMM- Nigeria became a strong community

Then came the apocalypse.

In December 2016, one year after its operation in Nigeria with more than three million active investors, the account of all investors were frozen.

It was very close to Christmas and people had invested so much with the hope of using the return to enjoy their Christmas. He perfectly targeted this period. Sergei Mavrodi froze all the accounts.

5 to 40 million people have lost about $10 billion to MMM one study reported.

He passed away in 2018.

Will Warnuu,9mo,Have you ever caught on to someone trying to scam you before it was too late?,"Yes.

About a month ago when my telephone rang the number displayed was my bank.

Upon answering, I was told that I was speaking with the Fraud Department of my bank, and asked if I had spent over $2,000 on American Airlines tickets and over $800.00 at Walmart in the last few hours. I indicated that I had not.

The person with whom I was speaking read out the first 8 numbers of my debit card, and then paused, as if they expected me to finish the last few numbers. I did not.

The person then asked if I still lived at, and gave the address. This was an address I had lived at 2 years previously. However, within a day of moving from that address, I had called my bank and informed them of my move and my new address. I thought something wasn’t right, but I was thrown by the actual bank telephone number on my caller ID.

I would not say whether the address they provided was my current address, or not. I told the caller that the bank had my present address, as I provided it to them.

The caller went on to say that he was with the Fraud Department, and that I had given my address to Customer Service, and they did not share the same information, and I merely needed to provide the address so that the Fraud Department could stop the fraudulent purchases.

I refused.

We went back and forth like this for awhile. Several times, they tried to get my present address as well as the rest of my account number. In all cases, I refused, reminding them that they have this information on record. Each time, they indicated the Fraud Department did not have this information. I found this highly doubtful, hung up, and called my bank.

The whole thing was a scam. To be safe, I asked for a new debit card to be issued. It was a bit of a hassle, but I felt better about it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/25zfsj7iarm8cnvl', 'title': 'Have you ever caught on to someone trying to scam you before it was too late?', 'score': {'original': 0.9956, 'ai': 0.0044}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes.\n\nAbout a month ago when my telephone rang the number displayed was my bank.\n\nUpon answering, I was told that I was speaking with the Fraud Department of my bank, and asked if I had spent over $2,000 on American Airlines tickets and over $800.00 at Walmart in the last few hours.

Rajendra Mhatre,Updated 6mo,What are common scams in India?,"TATA, we all know, is one of the biggest industrial houses in India, known - not only for its products but also transparency, honesty, attachment towards nation and above all, it's customer-friendly service!

However, I had a bit of different experience with them. We often see in most offices, the bosses are helpful but people down the line are not so! When the boss comes to know about the irregularity on the part of his subordinates, he regularises everything.

The same thing happened to me.

Here the boss was TITAN EYE Plus and the subordinate was one of its franchisee.

It all started in June 2014.

I bought two specs from the famous TITAN EYE Plus franchise in Chembur, Mumbai at an approximate cost of about ₹.15,000.

In fact the number of this new spec and of the one I was already using was same. I had bought this new rimless frame only for restrictive use. So in the beginning, I used it only for office and parties!

Eight and a half months passed.

One night when I came home from the office, while keeping this new frame into the box, one of its arm got detached.

Nothing could be done that day but the next day, I came home early from the office and took the glasses to the nearest spec shop. He said, ""Sir, a single arm can't be replaced. The whole frame has to be replaced.""

""Okay, but still I will visit Titan once.”

He laughed and said, ""Sir, it's been eight months since you got these glasses, the guarantee is over. Now no one will entertain you there.""

Still, I took an auto and reached Titan.

The shopkeeper heard me, looked at the glasses and said, ""Sir, nothing can be done about this. We provide six months' guarantee, nothing more than that. Why not get a new frame, this one will cost you ₹.1,650, and the one here is only for ₹.1,900….”

Reached home and searched for the TITAN EYE website. Somehow, I couldn't find one but found a Titan's page on Facebook. I reported the matter to them. However, I ended my content with this..

IF ONE SPENDS ALMOST RS.10000/=(BILL NO.000000 DT.20.06.14) FOR A BRANDED PRODUCT (IN FACT THAT DAY I BOUGHT TWO PAIRS COSTING AROUND RS.15000/=), CAN'T HE RELY ON THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT?
IF THIS IS THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE, HOW CAN I VISIT TITAN EYE+ SHOWROOM AGAIN?

This was on March 3, 2015.

Next morning, I received a reply from Titan.

‘You have lodged a complaint on the wrong page. But don't worry, we have forwarded it to the right place. You will soon hear from them.’

(March 4, 2015)

The company's mail arrived before noon.

‘Your complaint has been received. Please send a photo of the bill and spectacles for verification.’

(March 4, 2015)

I immediately forwarded both.

Within half an hour or so, there was a feedback.

'We have sent a photo of your spectacles to our laboratory in Ranchi. It will take at least eight days for the report to arrive. Until then, please cooperate with us.’

(March 4, 2015)

Next mail was in another eight days ..

'With reference to the below complaint, please be informed that the replacement of frame is possible for free of cost. Request you to visit the store….’

(March 12, 2015)

In the afternoon, received a phonecall from the showroom,

‘Sir, you will get replacement of the frame from the company at 80 percent discount. Do come in the evening. '

Not agreeing with the requirement to pay, I once again wrote to Titan about the phonecall.

The reply was instantaneous :

‘You don't have to pay anything, please visit the showroom.'

(March 12, 2015)

Visited the showroom in the evening. As soon as I introduced myself, the owner stood up and politely started showing the frames.

There was a big surprise for me.

The company had offered to change not only the frame but also the glasses!

And, finally, on March 28, 2015, I got my new glasses.

While I was looking at the glasses, the owner said,

“Sir, the price of this frame has gone up by ₹.110 since you bought it. ""

""What?""

I asked without looking up.

""No no, no problem Sir, we will adjust. Thanks Sir!""

I saw the bill, it was ₹.9,481/-, but I didn't have to pay anything!

On the way home, mailed Titan Eye Plus once again and thanked the company and its employees.

Some notable things emerge out of this story.

Reputed companies like Titan value its customers and it's image more than money! They make no compromises for that. I have deliberately given dates in the reply just to know how fast the action was taken!

On the other side are the shopkeepers (they were Titan's franchisees), who give damn to ordinary customers (there could be respectable exceptions to this!).Their only purpose is to sell goods.

And finally, there are customers like you and me, who do not stand for their right, sometimes out of boredom and often out of ignorance!

Had I not followed up with the Titan, even I would have ended in paying ₹.9,481/=, like a fool!

For one thing, they don't know the power of consumer power!

Thanks

Arvind Singh,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Recently I was travelling from Ahmedabad to Jaipur via bus. So the bus Stopped at around 11 PM somewhere 100 km after Ahmedabad at the hotel/dhaba for dinner.

On the right you can see a general store, so I decided to buy some chips and Chocolate for the journey.

I asked for the 2- 5star(10 Rs) chocolate and a lays chips(20 Rs) packet, So total =40.

He asked for 55 Rs from me. I was like, when did the rate increased. I checked the packet it was 10 and 20 ₹ respectively.

I showed it to the shopkeeper and he strated arguing. He just said, if you want to buy it pay 55₹ or else leave. As a passenger we are pretty much bound to such dhaba and shops when bus stops at such places in night. Finally I took it for 55₹ and started to observe the shopkeeper standing there. I found out that the shopkeeper was charging 5₹ extra to every product on the MRP.

Rough calculation.

Let say on an average 20 buses stops in a day at that particular shop. From which 10 passenger from each bus buys a single product.

Total product=> 20*10= 200

Total benefit=> 200*5= 1000 + margin on every product depending upon its MRP.

This is just an average figure.

Similar type of incident took place with me, when I was travelling from ISBT kashmiri gate to Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh.

This is type of scam which goes on every day at almost every such dhabas and shops .","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/sjpth0ul94rqdcg8', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Recently I was travelling from Ahmedabad to Jaipur via bus.

Naveen KR,Updated 1y,What are common scams in India?,"This is a very common scam that I've seen many big brands use to sell their products…

Same brand, same flavor.. . Correct?

Same manufacturing month/year - 04/22.. correct?

Now check the price & quantity.. Buy 1 get 1 (free) is ₹190/- for 700ml so you'll get one extra, that is 700ml + 700ml = 1400ml. Now the other (regular pack with no offer) is priced at ₹110/- for 900ml. Let's do the math ; ₹190/- divided by 14 (1400ml) = ₹13.57 for 100ml and ₹110/- divided by 9 (900ml) = ₹12.22 for 100ml!! So basically you are paying more for buying a product with discount offer!!!

I've seen the same scam with other brands & products, like biscuits, dosa batter, yogurt, chips & other snacks.

* EDIT *

Thank you all for your upvotes & thanks 🙏

I did not expect so many views & responses 😃

There are many people commenting that this is not a scam but a marketing technique,... I agree that this is not a direct scam but an unethical marketing strategy not less to a scam.

I also agree that nobody is being forced to buy it, but let me tell you... Generally both packs, with offer pack & without offer pack are not made available in the same store at the same time for the reason that if a customer by chance notices both packs & does a comparison (like I did) they will realise that they are being hoodwinked. Here the manufacturer is trying to make the customer believe that they are buying a product at a discounted rate & getting extra while in reality they are paying more for the same product which is available for a lesser price.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yjhp1c9qwdegrnz5', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9542, 'ai': 0.0458}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This is a very common scam that I've seen many big brands use to sell their products…\n\nSame brand, same flavor.. .

Ishtiaq,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"Ola cab drivers cancelling the ride after passenger boards the cab, after confirming that he will be paid by cash for the ride.

Sallie Hammock,3y,Have you ever caught on to someone trying to scam you before it was too late?,"A few months ago, my phone rang and it said scam likely. I answered the phone, and they asked for my husband. I said, he is not here.

Apparently, they weren’t really listening. Again, they asked to speak to him.

I finally told him, “he really pissed me off and I killed him. I buried him under the chicken coop.”

Bless his heart, I don’t think the man that called me was too bright. Again, he asked to speak to my husband.

I said to him, “sweetie, I killed him. I buried him under the chicken coop a couple of weeks ago. If you want to hold on, I will go and dig him up. I don’t think he will be able to talk to you, but we can still try it.”

Apparently, the poor man finally understood this and hung up on me. I was a little offended.

Jonathan Trueman,Sat,"Must Trump pay $354.9M because he’s guilty of fraud or because he is the subject of a political witch hunt, and why?","He's definitely liable for fraud. The documentary evidence is irrefutable. (And he absolutely could have had a jury but neither he nor his lawyers ticked the box requesting one).

So that's why he's having to pay financial penalties.

As to why the gigantic sum specified, though… that's a moron tax.

Seriously, imagine yourself in Trump's shoes. You face overwhelming evidence of liability, you and your lawyers have screwed up on procedure, and now your fate rests in the hands of a court system and a judge. You know for a fact that you are going to have to pay something.

So what do you do?

Well, you're not a moron. So you show deep contrition, vow transparent cooperation with the court, write personal letters of apology to those you have deceived, and make personal restitution before the court can hit you with mandatory penalties. And you enter all this into the record in mitigation of your offence. Other than that, you keep your mouth shut. If you're planning to appeal, you let your lawyers say so and outline the grounds for that appeal.

The result of that is likely to be a penalty that falls short of what prosecutors request, because it's the kind of behaviour that courts want to encourage: it saves time, it avoids controversy, and it promotes a better standard of conduct among similar offenders.

What you don't do, because you're not a complete bonehead, is stand on the court steps and accuse the judge of corruption, the prosecutor of racism, the court system of being rigged, and the President of the United States of giving secret orders to a state institution. You don't continue to deny the facts in evidence from the documents. You don't rant, rage, try to claim simultaneously that it was a victimless crime and that it never happened anyway, and generally deny reality in such a way as to convince the judge that your

complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological.

Because you're not a moron. So you still have to pay a hefty sum, but not the moron tax on top of it.

Donald Trump, however, does have to pay the moron tax.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/152k80oxey4l6c9r', 'title': 'Must Trump pay $354.9M because he’s guilty of fraud or because he is the subject of a political witch hunt, and why?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""He's definitely liable for fraud.

Anindita Bhatta,Updated 4y,What are common scams in India?,"ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY

I noticed that I’ve become a regular customer of online food delivery companies ,be it Zomato or Swiggy lately and I believe there would be so many people like me who feel the ease of getting readymade foods delivered home. For a person who works and cooks , its a boon sometimes.But what we need to understand carefully is that these companies are making fools out of people’s need. I normally order food from trusted restaurant specially where I have been to. But what I realised that there’s a huge difference in taste and quality between dining in the restaurant and getting food delivered from the same restaurant. These companies, most of the times come up with attractive offers and deals and in return serves stale food from its partner restaurants. People get trapped with such deals without even realising . Let me share my experience today.

I received fungus(mold) filled gujia from the trusted brand Bikanerwala through Zomato,upon complaining they offered an apology and the refund.just look at the pictures,

I unknowingly consumed one gujia and eventually threw up and had an upset stomach. Is their apology going to assure such things won’t be repeated? And the damages will be fixed? Practically the shop should get sealed for such practices but again this is India and It’s just a small bad experience.

Edit: Those who are sympathisers of delivery companies, I once ordered biryani at 99 for lunch in office, from Bikkgane biryani which serves delicious biryani in noida, from uber eats . I was not satisfied with the taste as I regularly visit them in weekends. Then my friend ordered biryani from Bikkgane which wasn’t having any offer from swiggy. A person with proper sense could identify the quality of taste instantly. Even by looking at both one can tell which one was fresh.Now if anyone has proper explanation to this please shed some light on it.Thank you.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3homt6qbwpv9aid7', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY\n\nI noticed that I’ve become a regular customer of online food delivery companies ,be it Zomato or Swiggy lately and I believe there would be so many people like me who feel the ease of getting readymade foods delivered home.

Zelda Rudd,Updated 4y,Have you ever scammed a scammer?,"As a sex worker, I almost always got paid in cash.

But once in a while, clients would ask me for different options, since they didn’t have cash with them.

One time, I got booked in a nearby town. Usually, when I traveled, I required a 50% deposit, which clients paid by sending me the money through PayPal.

The client that I was meeting with sent me the deposit, booked a hotel, and everything was set.

I went to where I was supposed to, checked in, and waited for him. He arrived and wanted to send the remaining money through PayPal as well. I didn’t think that it was going to be a problem, so I agreed.

After I received the money, I provided the service and he left. A few hours later, I receive an e-mail that he complained to PayPal that it wasn’t him who initiated the payment, but somebody (me) had hacked into his PayPal and did it. PayPal blocked the amount and opened an investigation.

I was really, really pissed. What kind of person would do that? Why would he take advantage of me being flexible so that he could pay more easily?

So, this is what happened. I remembered that he had booked the hotel under my name. I figured that the hotel might have some paperwork that would somehow link him to me.

I went there and, yes, they had the receipt. It clearly included his name, his credit card number (first six and last four digits), and my name as the hotel guest. I was just about to leave when the lady at the reception desk asked me if I want to spend a few more days at the hotel at a special rate or something. She said that I didn’t need to check in as usual because they already had everything they needed, including “my credit card.” A devious smile appeared on my face. I took the room for three days and paid it with the sucker’s credit card on file. It cost $170 per night. Breakfast included.

When I got to the room, I took a picture of the receipt and sent it to PayPal, clearly explaining that during the same day, this person booked a hotel for me. I also sent email screenshots of us arranging to meet. Luckily for me, the e-mail he used for PayPal matched the one my client had used when he was communicating with me. In one of the emails, he even had attached a screenshot of the first payment he made to me, clearly demonstrating his intent (and his satisfaction) that he paid.

Twelve days later, PayPal unblocked the money and I withdrew it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pcqhk83bumidfgwy', 'title': 'Have you ever scammed a scammer?', 'score': {'original': 0.9969, 'ai': 0.0031}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'As a sex worker, I almost always got paid in cash.\n\nBut once in a while, clients would ask me for different options, since they didn’t have cash with them.\n\nOne time, I got booked in a nearby town.

Today you will notice a different type of fraud which we people generally (who often go for food in restaurants, stores ..) Don’t notice.

Conversation was like this between me, my wife and Gianis counter boy -

Me - what is the price for Belgian chocolate ice cream?

Counter Boy- Sir, ₹80 per scoop

Me - Give me 2 scoops in Cone.

My wife- I want one scoop of punjabi delight in cone.

Me - How much to pay?

Counter boy-₹310

Me - Bit confused ( I know Gianis ice cream are costly)but then I paid ₹310.

We were enjoying our ice cream, our house is on 10min walking distance from Gianis, so, I asked her to let’s eat while walking, she declined and said it’s too hot outside so let’s finish it here. I said .. ok and after 5min she asked me how much did your ice cream cost? I said ₹160.

She was like how come the bill be of ₹310 then. (Her scoop was ₹70–75) .Then she saw the bill (understood that they cheated us) and asked counter boy, conversations were like-

My wife- How did it cost ₹310?

Counter boy- mam, ₹160 double scoop and ₹75 your single scoop and ₹10 per cone.

My wife- Total is still ₹255. How did you charge ₹310?

Counter boy- (scared, thinking what to say) .. Mam there is some confusion . Sorry mam. It happened by mistake.

It all happened when there was no other customer in the store. He knowingly added a higher price item to increase the bill.Otherwise how could he add banana shake when we both were just standing next to him having icecream . + he asked his staff about our food items in front of us and they simply told him. Still he added something else that costed us somewhat double. However, he gave me back ₹55 after this
.
.

So , like a aware person check not only the price but the Food Item that they added in your bill.

Niharika Mishra,Updated 3y,What are the cleverest scams you have come across?,"Happened to me today!!

The scam of discounted MakeMyTrip holiday packages.

Short gist: Its a scam where MMT makes you book a package 3–4 months in advance at a lesser rate and then cancels it last minute and refunds you the entire amount, which has been with them for about a quarter of the year acting as good investment.

Long story:

This is my personal experience which is why I am adding proofs of all the interactions and not something Y****a or T****s C**k has paid me to write.

I am writing this in about MakeMyTrip who offer so called lucrative and discounted holiday packages to be booked months in advance of the holiday season only to dupe you last minute to leach out more money.

So here has been my experience,

I was contacted by a very polite “Holiday Expert” from MakeMyTrip in October, offering me too-good-to-be-true holiday packages in Christmas season which is a peak season and those rates are practically impossible.

Oh how sweet, she gave me free chocolates too…

My naive self, was foolish enough to get duped. I booked the same paying the full amount after which, they gave me a “Holiday Voucher” which had my flight details and a non-existent PNR.

I was also contacted by a so-called “Relationship Officer” who sent me an auto generated copy-paste of promising to help me, but never did.

My suspicions had already arisen when I checked the PNR and it was found not available on SpiceJet website.

I repeatedly sent messages to this “Relationship Officer” who chose not to respond (see above).

On exactly 5 days before my trip, I get this

So I either have the option to pay extra to still be able to avail my discount package, or let go of my holiday.

The excuses given by them were,

SpiceJet cancelled flight last minute but had no response to my question of why my “Relationship Officer” had not responded to my complaint weeks before this happened.
When asked why my holiday voucher had an invalid PNR, they gave a stupid excuse that the valid PNR is given only three days before the trip, when in reality it is generated immediately.

Note the dates of my booking acknowledgement with them last year where the tickets landed in my mailbox with valid PNR, minutes after I paid.

Ofcourse it was a pre-covid time when they were faring well and did not have to rely on such cheap scams for funding.

After many threats of complaints to consumer court on a call, I got a promise of a full refund, they haven’t refunded the money yet

After the refund is credited, I no longer have any agency to file a case against them. But here is what I lost and they gained,

My amount of about 78000 was with them which could have gotten me bank interest but they procured it for interest-free investment money in bad times of COVID
My holiday booking which was done at a discount in “uncertain times” is now freed up to be given to someone else at higher rates now that things are more stable.

I will be abstaining from MakeMyTrip now at all costs and my earnest request to you guys is to not rely on offers from such “Holiday Experts” who offer you lucrative holiday packages many months in advance. It is a very easy way for them to get interest-free investment and they will show kind gestures of refunding you the full amount last minute citing reasons beyond their control, but you should avoid falling into such traps

Note I have ensured that phone numbers of people involved are not completely visible but showing some digits so that you can recognize in case these same people are out to dupe you. I request anyone who reads this to share it as much as possible before MakeMyTrip gets Quora to remove this as all of the info I have shared is very authentic and I have used no profane or obscene words with no personal details revealed except mine and MMT’s brand name.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gqxadkzo6r92ewyb', 'title': 'What are the cleverest scams you have come across?', 'score': {'original': 0.41965, 'ai': 0.58035}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Happened to me today!!\n\nThe scam of discounted MakeMyTrip holiday packages.\n\nShort gist: Its a scam where MMT makes you book a package 3–4 months in advance at a lesser rate and then cancels it last minute and refunds you the entire amount, which has been with them for about a quarter of the year acting as good investment.\n\nLong story:\n\nThis is my personal experience which is why I am adding proofs of all the interactions and not something Y****a or T****s C**k has paid me to write.\n\nI am writing this in about MakeMyTrip who offer so called lucrative and discounted holiday packages to be booked months in advance of the holiday season only to dupe you last minute to leach out more money.\n\nSo here has been my experience,\n\nI was contacted by a very polite “Holiday Expert” from MakeMyTrip in October, offering me too-good-to-be-true holiday packages in Christmas season which is a peak season and those rates are practically impossible.\n\nOh how sweet, she gave me free chocolates too…\n\nMy naive self, was foolish enough to get duped.

Guy D. McCardle,3y,"What are the odds of being scammed if the soldier often Skype with me? He’s E6, retiring at the end of March and asked me to be at LAX for his homecoming with his colleagues from Syria. Can this be true?","I hate to be the bearer of bad news. It could be true, but I’d bet one of my kidneys that it isn’t.

** This guy’s identity has been stolen and used in hundreds of online romance scams.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve worked with hundreds of women who have been scammed by people pretending to be servicemembers. This even happened to someone in my immediate family.

Not once has any of it been legitimate. For some reason, several of them say they are serving in Syria. Not sure why they do this, we have very few troops serving in that country now. The ones that are there are almost certainly not online looking for dates.

I guess that some excuse will come up for this person to ask you for money or say he is doing to deposit money into your bank account. He is never going to deposit any money. It is only stolen from you after you provide account numbers.

To find out if he is maybe real, ask him to send you pics of him doing some strange stuff that you think up. Like holding up his toothbrush or standing on one leg. Sounds silly, right? My point is that he won’t be able to send these specifically requested pics because he isn’t the person he says he is. Ask him to send you a pic of him in front of something uniquely specific to where he is. Something you might only find in Syria.

You’ll get every excuse under the sun, but no pictures. If you haven’t been taken yet, it is getting very close for the time for him to close the deal. If this has been going on for a while, it is known as a “long con.”

Grant Davis,Updated 4y,What was the most blatant scam a customer has ever failed to get away with?,"Not mine but a friend’s story.

He was called in to varnish the ceiling of an Indian restaurant. The bill came to about £360 (about 25 years ago). Each time he called, the client didn’t have his cheque book or enough cash in the till, etc., etc.

After several months he enrolled the help of a large friend to accompany him and entered the restaurant when it was packed with diners. He was carrying dust sheets, a tin of varnish solvent and a step ladder. He clapped his hands and caught everyone’s attention.

“If you could all cover your meals. I’m here to get my varnish back and the stuff I’m using is toxic.”

He set up the ladder and the owner came running down to my mate asking what he was doing.

“Taking my varnish back - you’ve not paid for it. I’m taking it off.”

He told my mate to come back another time as he didn’t have his cheque book and didn’t have enough cash in the register. Wordlessly, my mate opened the tin of solvent and started to lay out the dust sheets.

Sean Kernan,4y,What scams commonly target children?,"Any time I see one of those giant vending machines that is full of Teddy Bears with a claw hanging over it . . .

I always hear that collective, alien-voiced monotone chant “The clawwww”

(Toy Story is super brilliant.)

As you have hopefully quickly learned: those machines are frustrating money pits.

They even operate under a false premise that gets kids excited to the point of screaming and begging to try buying an attempt for a bear:

You think that if you aim your claw correctly, it is going to grab the teddy bear.

But as most of you quickly find out, the claw has the grip strength of a greased-up cucumber.

And—that is by design.

Most teddy bear machines claws are programmed to have two gears.

The first gear: no matter how well you aim—it will not be bringing you a bear back. It’s limp wrist mode.

The second gear: uses just enough strength to grab a teddy bear— but it only activates that strength once every 15–20 attempts.

Charles Edward,Updated 3y,"Walmart employees or people that shop there, what is the biggest item scam you've seen or done from Walmart?","I wanted a bread maker. I had settled on a nice quality brand and model. Later I was casually ‘shopping’ for it - and so knew the general price range - and saw the same item at Walmart for substantially lower price. Could have been a black-Friday thing - I am not sure now.

Pushed and shoved and waited in massive lines - bought the unit at walmart.

At home followed all the instructions exactly - result was a small walnut-lump of bread-like substance. Blaming myself; I threw it in the trash and started again - with fresh yeast this time. Result: a hard-walnut of non-bread.

After several attempts I called the maker's customer service line and after a few questions was told to call Walmart. Walmart service knew nothing but told me to come back and exchange it for a new unit.

I did that and a few loaves of yummy bread resulted - maybe 3–4–5. Then it was back to the non-bread result no matter which recipe was tried.

Made all the same calls and ended up exchanging it for a new one at Walmart.

That was repeated a few more times before I said: Wait a minute! There has to be Another Answer! <g>

By careful observation I found that the stirring paddle was breaking off. And of course each time it did it was embedded in the non-bread lump and was unknowingly thrown away. OK: once? Maybe. Twice? Unlikely. But 3–4–5 times??? Not a goddamned chance!

So I called the maker, eventually got through to engineering, asked for the R&D guys and explained why I was asking. Response: What? Impossible; our paddle design was tested beyond any possible failure point. We use a grade aluminum alloy which is . . .

“My paddle is plastic.”

“Plastic? Then it’s not our unit - we do not make any critical part from plastic and certainly not The Paddle!”

“Want me to send you a picture? Why would I lie about it? And look; I design things - I’m not really complaining here - I am just insanely curious how such an obviously poor component ever made it to production.”

So he and I chit-chatted about manufacturing and so forth - and then he said:

“Oh; wait a minute - I just thought of something. Hold on; I’ll be right back . . . ”

When he came back he asked: “Where did you buy the unit?”

“Walmart.”

“Oh; well that has nothing to do with us then - they warranty all their own products.”

“OK; but my interest is not in helping myself - it is really my interest in helping you.”

Some other back and forth and he said: “Hold on again - I want to check something.”

He came to the phone: “What is your address? I went over to the test lab - I thought I had seen some spare paddles over there - I’ll send them to you.”

He sent me three paddles, made of aluminum, and many hundreds of loaves later - the first one I installed was still in there, apparently ready for another million loaves.

A part of our wandering discussion covered the rest of the unit - I gave him the model and serial number - and from the engineering specs he could tell me that many of the internal parts were also different: gears of plastic rather than metal, bushings instead of bearings; all kinds of things. I asked why and was told that large companies (Walmart, Home Depot, et. al;) are able to demand a certain price point from a manufacturer - as they are willing to purchase millions of items - so the manufacturer makes a production run of items cheap enough that they are still profitable.

I think of that episode every time I see the slogan: Always the low price. Always!

It sounds good - until you translate it: Frequently a piece of garbage.

BTW: I have even worse stories about Home Depot. <g>

And WE are to blame. It’s difficult to find a true high quality item - because most Americans were willing to settle for owning dogshit-grade products - Because the initial cost was lower. With the result that that is just about all that is available anymore - just rubbish.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/t0p5zg4wc3sa1xkn', 'title': ""Walmart employees or people that shop there, what is the biggest item scam you've seen or done from Walmart?"", 'score': {'original': 0.8358, 'ai': 0.1642}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I wanted a bread maker.

James Klatsky,Oct 25,How does Judge Engoron's decision to have a law clerk on the bench with him impact courtroom proceedings in Trump's civil fraud trial?,"Let me explain how this works.

Kyle Walker,Updated 4y,What is the biggest scam an auto mechanic ever tried on you?,"One time I held a weekend job once a month in a different part of the state about 3 hours from my home. My personal car at the time was having some issues so I borrowed a family member’s diesel pick up truck (model and make intentionally left out). I drove to the small town where my weekend job was located and parked the truck in the hotel parking lot. Unfortunately, an unexpected freeze (to about 10 degrees F) came in overnight and the car was parked in an uncovered lot.

This is the part where I tell you that no winterizing prep had been done on the vehicle and many of you can probably already guess where this is going. So Sunday morning I went out to start the truck and it stalled after about 60 seconds. Second and third attempts, the truck tried to roll over but didn’t start. At this point I realized my mistake: the diesel was gelled, but there was little chance of the weather warming up enough to (hopefully) solve my issue. Fortunately, I still had half a day of work and free road side assistance. I called them and they transported the truck to the nearest dealership. At this point I’m imagining most of my engine looks like this:

Source: Google Images

I figured a few hours in a warm garage would solve the issue, but then I got “The Call”. The dealership mechanic called to tell me the fuel is indeed gelled and that a couple of my fuel injectors are also toast because of it and will need replacement. The total cost will be about $100-200 bucks. Now, I won’t try to masquerade that I know a TON about cars but at this point 1) I’m pretty sure that my diesel is gelled because of the weather and 2) it makes sense to me that the fuel injectors clogging could be a downstream effect of this, especially after my multiple attempts to start the truck.

At this point I approved the repairs and was expecting to pick up the truck later that day and be on my way back home by the early evening. Then the kicker came: “Mr. Walker. Your y-pipe is also damaged. It will need to be replaced and the total cost including parts and labor is about $2,800 bucks”. Now I’m suspicious because just 36 hours prior I drove the truck 200 miles without an issue and I highly doubt three attempts to cold start a truck would suddenly damage the y-pipe. “Thanks for letting me know, I don’t believe that needs to be replaced at this moment and I have people that can do it for cheaper. Please only fix what we previously discussed”.

The mechanic then responded “I don’t think you understand. The car would not be safe to drive in this condition. Because of that, I am not comfortable NOT replacing the y-pipe. It’s either all or nothing on the repairs.”

It felt like he’s trying to corner me and I was still busy at work so I told him not to touch anything and I’d call him back. I called the family member who loaned me the truck just to make sure there were no other pre-existing issues with the vehicle, y-pipe or otherwise. They informed me there were no issues but they know a few people who work for the same company at dealerships in other states and will make some calls to see if they can confirm, as we suspect, that this specific dealership is trying to pull one over on me. About an hour later I got a call back from my family member, “My friend Mike works at a dealership in Virginia and was able to check in the system. He said the only issue logged is gelled fuel and that he believes the fuel injectors probably don’t even need to be replaced”.

I will spare you some of the details about what happened next but, long story short, I extended my trip by a day and went to the dealership the next day when it’s warmed up considerably. I added some additive to the tank and was able to start the truck with almost no issue. The old gal ran a little rough for a few minutes but once I got a full tank and out on the open interstate there were zero problems for the 200 miles back home (and no issues to this day).

The dealership did try to charge me a diagnostic fee and for an extra day on the car rental. I told them I’d pay for the one day I actually needed the car before their mechanic lied to me and I would not be paying a diagnostic since 2/3 of the problems were made up. They didn’t fight back at all.

Edit: Wow! Lots of traffic on this overnight. First, thanks to Robert Taylor for the grammatical edits. For those commenting about reporting the place, I did contact the BBB but I don’t recall they ever did anything. I also left that specific dealership a bad review on a few sites. I found out after the fact that they are notorious locally for shady practices and no one that lives within 30 minutes of the place will go there willingly. I learned that I should’ve done my research ahead of time even though I was on a tight schedule and in a pinch but I thought a dealership would be a safer bet with more accountability than a random local shop and more likely to have any necessary parts on hand. I have no problems with the brand to this day, just had issues with that specific establishment. I have a lot of friends/family that work in the automotive industry and always find it unfortunate that a few bad eggs like this can create such distrust.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9s2i8dptuywlacko', 'title': 'What is the biggest scam an auto mechanic ever tried on you?', 'score': {'original': 0.96545, 'ai': 0.03455}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'One time I held a weekend job once a month in a different part of the state about 3 hours from my home.

My personal car at the time was having some issues so I borrowed a family member’s diesel pick up truck (model and make intentionally left out). I drove to the small town where my weekend job was located and parked the truck in the hotel parking lot. Unfortunately, an unexpected freeze (to about 10 degrees F) came in overnight and the car was parked in an uncovered lot.\n\nThis is the part where I tell you that no winterizing prep had been done on the vehicle and many of you can probably already guess where this is going. So Sunday morning I went out to start the truck and it stalled after about 60 seconds. Second and third attempts, the truck tried to roll over but didn’t start. At this point I realized my mistake: the diesel was gelled, but there was little chance of the weather warming up enough to (hopefully) solve my issue. Fortunately, I still had half a day of work and free road side assistance. I called them and they transported the truck to the nearest dealership. At this point I’m imagining most of my engine looks like this:\n\nSource: Google Images\n\nI figured a few hours in a warm garage would solve the issue, but then I got “The Call”. The dealership mechanic called to tell me the fuel is indeed gelled and that a couple of my fuel injectors are also toast because of it and will need replacement. The total cost will be about $100-200 bucks. Now, I won’t try to masquerade that I know a TON about cars but at this point 1) I’m pretty sure that my diesel is gelled because of the weather and 2) it makes sense to me that the fuel injectors clogging could be a downstream effect of this, especially after my multiple attempts to start the truck.\n\nAt this point I approved the repairs and was expecting to pick up the truck later that day and be on my way back home by the early evening. Then the kicker came: “Mr. Walker. Your y-pipe is also damaged. It will need to be replaced and the total cost including parts and labor is about $2,800 bucks”. Now I’m suspicious because just 36 hours prior I drove the truck 200 miles without an issue and I highly doubt three attempts to cold start a truck would suddenly damage the y-pipe. “Thanks for letting me know, I don’t believe that needs to be replaced at this moment and I have people that can do it for cheaper. Please only fix what we previously discussed”.\n\nThe mechanic then responded “I don’t think you understand. The car would not be safe to drive in this condition. Because of that, I am not comfortable NOT replacing the y-pipe. It’s either all or nothing on the repairs.”\n\nIt felt like he’s trying to corner me and I was still busy at work so I told him not to touch anything and I’d call him back. I called the family member who loaned me the truck just to make sure there were no other pre-existing issues with the vehicle, y-pipe or otherwise. They informed me there were no issues but they know a few people who work for the same company at dealerships in other states and will make some calls to see if they can confirm, as we suspect, that this specific dealership is trying to pull one over on me. About an hour later I got a call back from my family member, “My friend Mike works at a dealership in Virginia and was able to check in the system. He said the only issue logged is gelled fuel and that he believes the fuel injectors probably don’t even need to be replaced”.\n\nI will spare you some of the details about what happened next but, long story short, I extended my trip by a day and went to the dealership the next day when it’s warmed up considerably. I added some additive to the tank and was able to start the truck with almost no issue. The old gal ran a little rough for a few minutes but once I got a full tank and out on the open interstate there were zero problems for the 200 miles back home (and no issues to this day).\n\nThe dealership did try to charge me a diagnostic fee and for an extra day on the car rental. I told them I’d pay for the one day I actually needed the car before their mechanic lied to me and I would not be paying a diagnostic since 2/3 of the problems were made up. They didn’t fight back at all.\n\nEdit: Wow! Lots of traffic on this overnight. First, thanks to Robert Taylor for the grammatical edits. For those commenting about reporting the place, I did contact the BBB but I don’t recall they ever did anything. I also left that specific dealership a bad review on a few sites. I found out after the fact that they are notorious locally for shady practices and no one that lives within 30 minutes of the place will go there willingly. I learned that I should’ve done my research ahead of time even though I was on a tight schedule and in a pinch but I thought a dealership would be a safer bet with more accountability than a random local shop and more likely to have any necessary parts on hand.

Margerie Taylor,Jan 21,How can you differentiate between a romance scam and genuine feelings when someone is trying to send you money?,"Romance scammers are experts in social manipulation and can sound very convincing. Many of the signs of a romance scammer are subtle because the scammer is trying to build trust before they exploit you. some of these scammers are in for the long con and build a relationship with the victim for months and even years. Again, the goal is to gain the victim’s trust and then ask for money, gifts, or personal information in this case.

On the other hand, someone with genuine feelings is sincere and authentic in their emotions and intentions. They are not looking to deceive or take advantage of others. They genuinely care for the person they're involved with and want to build a real, honest relationship.

It can be difficult to differentiate between the two, as scammers often use tactics to appear genuine. However, some red flags to watch out for include inconsistencies in their stories, unwillingness to meet in person, excessive requests for money or personal information, and avoiding video calls or other forms of real-time communication.

If you believe you have been the victim of a romance or relationship scam, contact your local law enforcement agency. You should also report the scam through the scamreveal .net community where you can get help with filing a complaint and getting information on how to protect yourself from scams. Also, if one of your parents or relatives has been the unfortunate victim of one of these scams, remind yourself to show empathy. Even if they lost considerable money.

Anurag Sharma,6y,What are common scams in India?,"Neeta Travel Hinjewadi Pune.

A few days after that when I checked for my refund, I was shocked to see that bus was not cancelled and rebus was showing my journey as completed. When I called them and asked about this they said they don’t have any information about bus cancellation and as per Neeta travels, I boarded the bus and traveled to Mumbai so there was no question of refunding my money.

Luckily I had ticket from other travels too, so I showed them both the tickets and asked how is it possible for me to travel in two different buses on same day at almost same time. They checked and accepted their mistake and returned my money.

Govinda Agrawal,Updated 3y,What are common scams in India?,"Last year I was traveling in Shatabdi express for the first time from Puri to Kolkata.

(pic credit:Google)

I was little bit excited too, as I don't travel by train much.

We were served with breakfast as it was included in the ticket cost. Then at the time of lunch, the same was served. While the quality of the food was far below the average, the scam wasn't this.

Now after we finished the lunch, one of the Pantry guy came with a tray in which he had a box with saunf (fennel seeds) which we Indians generally consume after lunch / dinner.

And apart from the saunf part, the tray had few Rs. 2000/- and many Rs. 500/- Rs. And very few Rs. 200/- notes.

I was observing that, pantry guy was going each and every seat to offer saunf, but seeing money in the tray, all the passengers also started to put money in the tray as a tip.

Now since the tray only had high denomination notes and normally a person traveling In Shatabdi is well to do, mostly everyone was putting at least Rs. 500/- and a few people put Rs. 200/- notes.

These pantry guys themselves put these high denomination notes so that other passengers would think that it's a tip that everybody is giving.

Anonymous,6y,What is the biggest scam that every Indian must be aware of?,"Fake Dowry harassment lawsuits.

I'm going anonymous to protect my privacy.

I'm a 28 year old Indian engineer who works in the US. I earn upwards on $130k per year. I have always been one of those geeks who had high levels of social awkwardness. Consequently, I never had a girlfriend (although some of my few good friends are women).

When I turned 26, my parents decided I was well settled and it was time to arrange a marriage for me. I wasn't sure whether I wanted it, but I usually didn't go against the will of my parents. They were really simple people who worked harder than most. They sacrificed so much for educating me, and I attribute much of my success in my career to their hard work.

So, they found a girl for me. She was a 24 year old final year medical student at an Indian medical college. I talked to her once in person, and another handful of times on phone, and she seemed nice enough. She seemed like someone who was smart, ambitious, and kind. That were the qualities that I valued the most.

Our family as a whole despised the idea of dowry. We didn't want any money from the bride's family. I was earning more than enough. My parents had always taught me to be as good a person as possible, and they usually spent a decent amount of money that I sent home for charity (mostly for nursing homes for the elderly). Therefore, we told the girl's family that we do not want any dowry. Since they insisted on her wearing all her family ornaments for the wedding, we nodded with the condition that those stuff will be taken back once the marriage is over.

Our marriage was over in the blink of an eye. It was nothing extravagant. Just a simple function with a lot of relatives and friends (around 800 people because it's India). I had three weeks before going back to my job in the States. My wife and I went for our planned ten day vacation across Europe. She went crazy with her shopping, especially at Paris. I didn't care then because it was our first trip.

After my time was up in India, I went back to my normal life in the US. I spent only three weeks with her, and therefore there was bond between us. We texted and did video chat frequently. I started falling in love with her soon enough. I thought she would have felt the same.

She used to ask me for money quite frequently. I used to send her around $1500 (around 1 lakh rupees) per month. I didn't ask her why she wanted this much money, because I just wanted to please her in every way. I'm also a very bad man in terms of managing finances. This continued for around six months.

At around this time, I started to feel something was off between both of us. She used to contact me mostly when she wanted money. Video chats stopped (she said she was busy with exams). I let it go for three more months to see how it panned out. Even after that, things only deteriorated. We started having minor fights, which evolved into ignoring each other, further exacerbating into major shouting competitions.

Around our anniversary, it was clear that this was not going to work out. But, I had this notion that it could be solved just by a face to face meeting. But, I had exhausted my leaves because of a medical condition, and delayed the trip. One day, she directly said to me that she never liked me, and she agreed to the marriage only because her parents pressurized her, and that I will never be a man whom she'll be attracted to. This hit me hard.

Things got only worse from then on. Around 14 months into our marriage, my parents got to know that a dowry harassment case has been charged against them. My parents barely saw her after our marriage since she was away at her college. They had to go to the police station, how a lawyer and start their legal battle. My mother got into a state of depression. Her health was deteriorating.

This was all a big shock to all of us. This was the last thing we expected. A divorce was the worst that we could think of. But a dowry harassment charges? Hell no! The police were treating us like we were criminals. From everyone whom we knew, we could feel the burn of their judgemental eyes. My parents just couldn't handle it.

Then came the biggest shock of our life. The girls father contacted us through phone. He was telling that we could do an off court settlement. He demanded 1.5 crore rupees (around $150k). If we gave them the money, all charges will be dropped. We were being blackmailed. We had the money. But, will I give it to them? Hell no. I worked really hard to earn that money.

My parents who were petrified before became invigorated because they felt they were being deeply wronged. They also decided we aren't going down without a fight. We have been gathering evidence, and even recorded one of the exchanges between her father and I. We don't know whether that is enough, but we gave gathered as much as we can.

We found that her father's business was failing. He owned a stationary store and is a franchisee of major brand's footwear store. They were going bankrupt, and his lease for the store was apparently going to end soon. They were trying to use us as a cash cow.

I don't know whether she was forced to do this, or whether she willingly agreed to this. I don't really care. It doesn't make a difference. Our lawsuit is still going on. We are fairly optimistic about our chances, but you never know.

The thing that I noticed during this whole episode is that every law in India with regards to dowry harassment is deeply pitted against the men and their family. You'll need to have incredible resolve to fight against them. I'm sure many people in my position would have given the money and give away. Since I'm innocent of everything that is charged against me, I thought I should give it a fight.

I hope that once everything is over, and we win our case, the people who lodged the fake complaint is given a fair punishment. I do not have my hopes up for that, because Indian judiciary is deeply flawed in this regard.

I apologise if the post is too long or even if this doesn't necessarily come under a 'scam'. Once I saw this question, I just had to answer it.

Archana Singh,4y,What are some common hotel scams in India?,"As far as an answer is concerned here, then I think that I would be the most eligible person to answer it because just few days back, I myself was the victim of this scam.

Everyone must have heard about the “reputed” hotel booking site OYO, where they claim good hotels in reasonable price, and I was also under this impression, until recently when we had planned a short vacation to Hampi and I chose OYO as I got an sms of 47% discount for the same hotel which I was looking for.

As you can see from the picture above, that I had already booked the rooms for 28th Dec and I was supposed to checkin at 7 O’ clock in the morning, but just few mins before I was about to reach Hospet (I had decided to stay at Hospet as Hampi was only 10km away from Hospet), I got a message that my hotel was upgraded because of some unavoidable circumstances, but the hotel which was given to me after upgradation was really pathetic and not matching to the standards of hotel which I had booked. I had paid a decent amount for the hotel which I booked from OYO.

Still I decided to go to the hotel to see if really there were no rooms available or OYO was trying to fool me. When I reached there and enquired about the same, I got really surprised, as the manager told us that they didn’t even had tie-up with OYO and we were not the first case for this scam, but many couples, families were already a victim of this scam.

OYO confirms the booking, and once you are about to reach the destination, you get these kind of messages, but the fact is that they don’t even have tie-up with hotels, they are just waiting for us to cancel so that they would make money from it, and if you don’t cancel then they would send the message at the last moment for unavailability of hotels where you will end up having no choice but to accept it as you wouldn’t find a decent hotel available at the last moment.

After getting a high voltage shock, I decided to call OYO Customer care and talked for at least 1.5hrs, which was of no use. They were constantly asking me to either cancel the booking or they can provide us only 2 options. The first hotel was 14 kms away from Hospet and the second one was 34 kms away(whose prices where much lesser than the amount that I had paid for).

I mean, travelling overnight, being on the customer service queue for such long time, you have confirmed the booking of the hotel which you don’t even have tie-up with, and then asking me to either cancel or select hotel which are 34kms away and that too of not your choice of hotels.

This was the worst thing that can happen in a vacation for which you planned quite long ago. You can just imagine how much money OYO is making by doing these kind of scams. They keep our money for long days in banks for which they get interests on.

Lesson Learnt:

Call the hotel authority directly to confirm about the companies they are in tie-up with.
Check charges of direct booking, sometimes it is much lesser than what is shown in most of the booking apps.
After you get confirmation from app/site, please do confirm the same with the hotels before leaving for your vacation.

I had paid a decent amount for the hotel which I booked from OYO.\n\nStill I decided to go to the hotel to see if really there were no rooms available or OYO was trying to fool me. When I reached there and enquired about the same, I got really surprised, as the manager told us that they didn’t even had tie-up with OYO and we were not the first case for this scam, but many couples, families were already a victim of this scam.\n\nOYO confirms the booking, and once you are about to reach the destination, you get these kind of messages, but the fact is that they don’t even have tie-up with hotels, they are just waiting for us to cancel so that they would make money from it, and if you don’t cancel then they would send the message at the last moment for unavailability of hotels where you will end up having no choice but to accept it as you wouldn’t find a decent hotel available at the last moment.\n\nAfter getting a high voltage shock, I decided to call OYO Customer care and talked for at least 1.5hrs, which was of no use. They were constantly asking me to either cancel the booking or they can provide us only 2 options. The first hotel was 14 kms away from Hospet and the second one was 34 kms away(whose prices where much lesser than the amount that I had paid for).\n\nI mean, travelling overnight, being on the customer service queue for such long time, you have confirmed the booking of the hotel which you don’t even have tie-up with, and then asking me to either cancel or select hotel which are 34kms away and that too of not your choice of hotels.\n\nThis was the worst thing that can happen in a vacation for which you planned quite long ago.

Akash Kumar,4y,What are common scams in India?,"This happened around a year ago when I tried to change my broadband to Hathway. I filled the form on their website and the very next day got a call from their service team that it is not feasible in my locality.

But after 2–3 hrs I got another call that the visit is scheduled at my location when I informed about non-feasibility in my locality he convinced me that it is feasible and called few names in my area to which he recently provided connection. So, I asked him to visit on the weekend for my availability.

On Saturday, 2 Hathway professionally dressed guys visited my home and informed me of the plan and convinced me for a 3-month advance payment plan of 2400 with an additional month discount and free router.

Me: Do you have any pamphlet or any brochure?

Him: No, you can verify the plan online we do not have paper works.

Me: (With a bit doubt)Okay, How Can I make the payment?

Him: Cash will be faster i.e. by today we’ll be able to process router request and other things. If by cheque it may take 4–5 working days.

Me: Okay there is no hurry, I’ll go with the cheque.

Him: Sir why going the old way, in case if clearance delays offer may get expired I always prefer cash and quick work.

Me: But giving cash in advance without any proof doesn't make me confident.

Him: Sir its a company work, you’ll get the receipt and by evening we’ll get router connected.

Me: I agree. Paid cash and got the receipt.

Him: Sir do you have any other reference in the nearby area so that we can make some extra and you’ll get a month rewarded.

Me: Yes have two friends looking to change broadband and given the contact info to them.

and they left…

I confirmed my friends but they didn't got call. I tried calling them in the evening but it was switched off. Tried calling on Monday, Tuesday for few continuous day but I finally got to know that I was being cheated.

After a month and after thinking I thought to repeat the process, again filled the Hathway form with a different name, mobile, address in the locality. after a few hours got the call that not feasible in my area.

But Interestingly to my surprise I again got call visit to be scheduled as its feasible in my area. Now here I was one step forward than the cheaters :)

After the same scheme info and everything, I asked them to come near a shop and got 4–5 my friends ready to raid them. And finally, it happened they cam we raided, beaten when they tried to dominate, took their mobile phones and after they understood no way out they accepted.

Now the real game begins, We called the police and for calling 20+ time the Delhi police didn’t come even after waiting 3 hours and calling again and again.

We loosen the cheater to check what they do and they ran, we let them run. Never get call from police and cheaters left their mobile with us. We went to police station to file a complaint to which police guy was very happy to see 2 mobiles coming in his pocket. He asked us to write on piece of paper the incident and submit the phones. We did and even after asking for acknowledgment he didn’t gave and started threatening us for looting phone seriously.

Divya Sharma,3y,What are the scams happening in India now?,"I saw this ad on Instagram. They were selling this suit:

Being a fan of this colour, I decided to order it.

The price was unbelievable. ₹699. I thought even if the quality doesn’t turn out to be not that great, I can use it for daily wear if not for parties. I kept my order as COD to be sure.

I would also like to mention here that I had purchased a lehenga from an Instagram store back in 2017 and it turned it to be amazing. That was also just for ₹2000. It is good for a fully stitched piece in tafetta silk.

I was very satisfied with that purchase and hence decided to go forward with this one too.

I received a mail of order confirmation. No communication thereafter. We generally get a lot of mails while buying things online. This made me feel a little suspicious.

I let it be thinking they are a new homegrown brand and they won’t be having systems like that of amazon and Myntra in place.

The product I received was this:

This is such a poor quality fabric. I won’t buy it for a ₹100 and I ended up paying ₹699 for this.

I mailed them. No response.

I have talked to the consumer redressal forum. I won’t let them get away with this.

I feel hurt at such practices.

There’s so much more to this.

A brand created trust. Another one broke it.

Now I will probably not trust even a genuine homegrown business. I will not get amazing deals like the lehenga. They will not get business from me.

This is the problem with such scams.

Satyajeet Kadam,6y,What are common scams in India?,"*'NEW HOTEL SCAM!!*

This is one of the smartest scams I have heard about.

You arrive at your hotel and check in at the front desk. Typically when checking in, you give the front desk your credit card (for any charges to your room) and they don't retain the card.

You go to your room and settle in. All is good.

The hotel receives a call and the caller asks for (as an example) *room 620* - which happens to be your room.

The phone rings in your room. You answer and the person on the other end says the following:

*'This is the front desk. When checking in, we came across a problem with your charge card information.*

*Please re-read me your credit card numbers and verify the last 3 digits numbers at the reverse side of your charge card.'*

Not thinking anything wrong, since the call seems to come from the front desk you oblige. But actually, *it is a scam by someone calling from outside the hotel*. They have asked for a *random room number*, then *ask you for your credit card and address information.*

*They sound so professional, that you think you are talking to the front desk.*

If you ever encounter this scenario on your travels, *tell the caller that you will be down to the front desk to clear up any problems.*

Then, *go to the front desk or call directly and ask if there was a problem.*

If there was none, *inform the manager of the hotel that someone tried to scam you of your credit card information, acting like a front desk employee.*

This was sent by someone who has been duped........

and is still cleaning up the mess.

*P.S.*

Please, consider spreading the word by forwarding this msg.

Who knows, you might just help someone avoid a nasty experience.

*Whoever are traveling often should be aware of this one!*","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/658ek1cq34do0r27', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""*'NEW HOTEL SCAM!!*\n\nThis is one of the smartest scams I have heard about.\n\nYou arrive at your hotel and check in at the front desk.

David Green,Updated 4y,What is the cleverest scam you've ever seen an employee use to steal from their employer?,"In the mid ’90s I opened a high-end restaurant in Atlanta, and one of my best hires was a bartender… let’s call him Bob.

In addition to the cocktail menu he would run a unique cocktail every night: once again a huge hit with our guests.

In Georgia at the time retail and wholesale had two different tax rates and the bottles had a different tax stamp if they were for sale in a restaurant or a store.

One night I noticed that there was a bottle in the trash with the wrong stamp. Thinking our distributor had made an error I pulled it out of the trash and took it to show Bob so he could let them know their error and correct it before I got fined. Bob took one look at the bottle and his face dropped and he said “Oh, I guess you got me”. Turns out he was buying a bottle at the store on his way to work every day and his nightly feature was his own bottle! For six months he was selling 20+ drinks a night and pocketing the money. I never caught on because it didn’t affect my inventory and he started from day 1 so I didn’t see the sales drop!

About a week after Bob and I terminated the employer-employee relationship I stopped by a competitor and there was Bob behind the bar. He looked up saw me, waved and said “Dave! Sit down have a drink, it’s on me!”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/exdk75infgq18r3j', 'title': ""What is the cleverest scam you've ever seen an employee use to steal from their employer?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In the mid ’90s I opened a high-end restaurant in Atlanta, and one of my best hires was a bartender… let’s call him Bob.

“Grandpa?” asks the young woman.

“Is this Beth?” he asks.

The young woman quickly admits that she is Beth, and then she starts crying,

“I am in Florida with my friends. We get in trouble and I am in jail. Can you send me money for bail?”

My uncle is alarmed. Why is Beth in Florida? What has she done? Before he can ask her a question, the young woman says, “Please don’t tell my parents. They will kill me.” She cries even harder now.

My aunt enters the room to find her husband frantically scrambling for his credit card. She gets suspicious and asks him what is going on.

“Beth is in jail in Florida. We need to send her money,” he explains to her.

My aunt rolls her eyes and grabs the phone from him,

“This is grandma. We are not sending money. Please rot in jail. Bye.”

The Scams by Hotels in India (The image is of actual hotel)!

This happened with me during my recent visit to kanpur for some office work. It's a well known semi luxury hotel situated in city. Now the scam part:

Incident goes like this, During check in, one of the guys at counter informed me about an additional charges which I have to paid for, considering this booking was done by my company & whole amount was already paid (like in general for any stay), I had a little doubt over these additional unpaid charges. At that day as I was in a hurry due to the work, I left this to resolve during my check out. Here is my stay receipt:

Now here comes my communication with one of their staff at reception during checkout:

Staff: Started with the cliche hospitality gestures & asked to rate on OYO.

Me: Thank you, will do. Any amount due here to pay (I know I have not ordered anything in hotel, still asked just for clarification)

Staff: Sir, wait for the bill. Now here comes the bill which mention Rs 168 as unpaid for the stay!

I had tried to convince him that the whole amount of stay which was mentioned in OYO was paid already & have re confirmed with my office for the same. Now here comes the trick part:

Staff: Sir, actually the booking amount mentioned in oyo was 13×× while our minimum booking starts at 14××. This is why as we have tried to generate the bill, it is taking the minimum booking amount & due to this you have to pay the extra amount.

Me: Surprised! I know that they have just consumed my 10-15 minutes as I know how to resolve this, thanks to my frequent travellings. I first just try to put him down logically.

Me: See, it doesn't matter to me whatever your minimum booking amount is as I had booked it through oyo & have already paid what they have asked. I will not pay this amount in any case. I have asked him to re check.

Staff: Sir but this is the unpaid amount to be cleared before check out.

Me: See you can change your minimum booking amount to a hundred thousand rupees, but I will only pay for what I have booked for (with a little anger, which I rarely show in my real life).

Staff: Sir, we will provide you a bill copy for the same. And he was with a printed bill!

Me: I will get the bill copy on mail from oyo, this bill is not a necessary (I am sure they have printed the bill by tampering the original bill).

No assistance from staff, still they continously trying to request me to pay. I have told them that if amount was genuine I was ready to pay even 2K, but it was just a fraud amount which they have presented.

Now in the last, I have called to OYO helpline & after confirming my booking ID, the customer care representative requested me to give the line to the reception staff. The moment I told them that this is consumer care of oyo, they have accepted the mistake & requested me to cut the line.

Staff: Now some well suited man (most probably the manager) came there & tell me that it was a printing mistake from one of their staff & upon re checking they have found that no unpaid amount is there to pay!

So what I have learned here is:

They were fraud charging this additional amount which was not in the bill.
As the amount was nominal, even half of the public will pay to avoid any delay (as in case one have to catch bus/train he couldn't resist them due to time constraint & would simply pay)
I am not sure whether this amount is shared by their staff in between, or this is actually a cheap sale trick by the hotel itself.

A big thanks to OYO for their support system, otherwise I was left with only one option to pay.

So, the industry which is called hospitality is showing hospitality in a different manner. Although I had not mentioned the hotel name, the image shown above is of the actual one. Unfortunately was not able to take image of their tampered bill as I have not paid the amount.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pl97bwdnia34vf5z', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.79875, 'ai': 0.20125}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""This!\n\nThe Scams by Hotels in India (The image is of actual hotel)!\n\nThis happened with me during my recent visit to kanpur for some office work.

Jack Neil,7mo,What are common scams in India?,"Food Bill Scam at Movie Threatre

Recently I went to watch Adipurush with my family for a night show at a reputed movie theatre. During the interval, I decided to have some snacks though I completed my dinner at home as it was a night show.

I went to the food counter and waited in the queue for around 5 mins as there was a huge crowd on that day. I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and 2 medium Pepsi and 1 bucket of caramel popcorn. They told me that it will take 10 mins to make the food so I provided them with my seat number and they would provide me with the food there.

Till now it was all ok, then they gave me the bill which I didn’t check due to hurry, the interval would end within 1-2 minutes. So, I paid them online and went back to my seat. Then after 15 minutes they came to my seat and gave me my food. It was 11 PM and then I found something suspicious, my sandwich was grilled.

I checked my bill and I saw they charged me an extra 100 rupees by adding the grill and extra cheese option in my sandwich which I didn’t order. At first, I thought to let it go because it was night and they might have done some mistake. But then my mom told me that I must report it at least, so I went there immediately leaving the legendary movie-Adipurush.

I went to the person and told him:

Me- Hey! This is Bill and I ordered two normal chicken sandwiches but you gave me grilled sandwiches with extra cheese

The person at Food Counter- Sorry Sir but we don’t have chicken sandwiches so we gave you grilled sandwiches with extra cheese.

Me- So you could have told me, I wouldn't order it.

The person at Food Counter: Sir we serve it like that only, it is our signature item.

Me: You are charging me extra for that without even asking me? How does that work? Did I order your signature item?

The person at Food Counter: No Sir, but we want our customers to try our signature item.

Me: You can charge me extra without taking my permission. Call your manager!

The person at Food Counter: Sir, I am not keeping the money with myself I am giving you the item you have paid for.

Me: I got furious and shouted at him, how can you charge me extra without even asking me and after that, you are arguing with me?

Manager Enters

Manager: What happened, sir?

I explained the full problem

Manager: Sorry sir, we really apologize for the inconvenience and he refunded me the full amount for the sandwich.

Total refund of Rs.400 cash.

The manager didn’t tell anything to the person serving at the counter, maybe they were trained to do that. Most people don’t check their bills in the movie theatre as they rush to watch the movie and also can’t see in the dark hall. So they might take advantage of that. I always recommend everyone to check the bills before paying, else you might end up paying more.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yhd7ota2mpje1gkb', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.41755, 'ai': 0.58245}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Food Bill Scam at Movie Threatre\n\nRecently I went to watch Adipurush with my family for a night show at a reputed movie theatre.

Alok Choudhary,4y,What is the biggest scam that every Indian must be aware of?,"The scam in the name of Airlines job.

Recently, one of my friend got tricked under the trap of fake job assurance in airlines. Since long he was looking for a job and then one day he suddenly received a mail from an ID named “HR Airlines”.

After receiving the mail, he came in contact with one of the people who claimed to be from Indigo airlines. The person assured him the job of ground staff in indigo airlines and the procedure to get this job was so standard that the chances of falling into the trap were high.

He was asked to fill up an application form which was followed by a telephonic interview where a person claiming to be HR congratulated him for clearing the interview.

After then, he was asked to deposit INR 10,000 as security money which will be refunded to him once he joins the airline service. He deposited the amount to the specified account number and later he received this offer letter from them.

But the very same day when he received the offer letter, he was again asked to deposit INR 10,000 to get him the airlines uniform. They even said that this uniform will be exported from Singapore.

This time he became little doubtful and contacted me for help. I tweeted this offer letter to Indigo airlines and look at what I got.

Hence, it is a request to all that please be aware of such fraud gang who make people fools.

Samir,2y,What started as a good thing for real but ended up being a scam?,"In 1919, A building contractor named J.D. McMahon raised money from investors to build a skyscraper in Texas.

On the planning project papers he stated that the skyscraper would be 480"" tall.

The investors assumed that 480"" would be a printing mistake and thought it must be 480 ft tall, and without any further enquiries or cross questioning, they invested the $200,000 which was the asking amount. The value of that investment is around $3 million today, inflation adjusted.

The same year he completed the skyscraper that ended up being 480"" tall, with only 4-storey.

The construction cost was merely a few thousand dollars and the remaining money was his profit to keep.

This people, is the height of deceit. 🤦

When the investors saw the end project, they were horrified and angry, so they sued him. However the judge decided that McMahon's wasn't at fault at all. He exactly gave the investors what they signed for and McMahon got to enjoy the enormous profit from it.

Shobhit Gupta,4y,What are common scams in India?,"Roadside Dhabas on GT Karnal Road

This is a very common scam in North India and I was caught off guard the first time I faced it.

In April, 2015, I, with four friends, was travelling to Mcleodganj from Delhi in a private deluxe bus. Most people prefer travelling at night to Himachal to avoid traffic and save time. The bus started from Delhi at 7 pm and was supposed to reach the destination early morning the next day.

At around 11 pm, the bus stopped for dinner at a roadside Dhaba on the GT Karnal Road. It was surprising to note that a lot of other buses too had stopped at the same Dhaba.

The Dhaba was busy and packed. Only two waiters could be seen running around, serving people. I, being hungry and reckless, hurriedly grabbed a seat with my friends and glanced at the menu. The price of the dishes was unexpectedly higher than usual. We being hungry, did not want to waste time pondering on the same so quickly ordered Shahi Paneer, Dal and Rotis for ourselves.

After about 5 minutes, the waiter kept five compartment plates on our tables. To our surprise, two sections of the plates already had Curd and Salad in them, while the food ordered was separately served to us. Considering those items as complimentary, we quickly had our food and walked to the counter to pay the bill.

To our surprise, we were charged twice as much the expected amount. Seeking clarification, we realised we were charged Rs. 600 extra for the curd and salad. (These items were not listed in the menu either so one could never know if they actually were for Rs. 600.)

Me: “Bhaiya, humne dahi aur salad order nahi kia tha .” (Brother, we did not order for the curd and salad)

Owner: “Toh fir khaya kyu?” (Then why did you eat it)

Me: “Humein laga complimentary hai’ (We thought it’s complimentary)

Owner: “Ab toh paise dene padenge” (You will have to pay for it)

I paid the complete amount because i did not want to have any argument with them. Upon observing for a few minutes, I found that almost all the people at the counter had the same issue with the bill. Whenever someone refused to pay the bill, the owner would call bouncers standing at the back and make people pay.

It was shocking to see such malpractice on a large scale. if he makes 600 Rs extra from each table, imagine the kind of profit he makes in a day.

Bus operators and drivers are paid commission and free food for bringing in customers. They deliberately stop buses at late hours so that people are starving for food by the time they stop, are left with no other option to eat at and thus, dont pay much heed to to this exploitation.

This is common practise across most dhabas in North India and thus one needs to be cautious about this scam. I, for instance, give clear instructions to get only the food that I have ordered and not get anything extra. If they still get you an extra item(which they would), make sure you return it that very moment.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qjv8k6ylpcwribme', 'title': 'What are common scams in India?', 'score': {'original': 0.91135, 'ai': 0.08865}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Roadside Dhabas on GT Karnal Road\n\nThis is a very common scam in North India and I was caught off guard the first time I faced it.\n\nIn April, 2015, I, with four friends, was travelling to Mcleodganj from Delhi in a private deluxe bus.

Rahul Sharma,3y,What is the biggest scam that every Indian must be aware of?,"A private engineering college, is the biggest scam in India.

They make a building, hire faculties only to realize that it wasn’t worth it because they do not get admissions. Then starts the fight of bringing admissions through marketing team which makes Super Nirma look like Surf Excel. Some of them surprisingly make their college look better than IITs.

Then they somehow get students and the next challenge is placements, because that's how the success of a college is defined. Or expected to be defined to be the least.

They manage bribing a few HR managers to at least come to college for taking interviews and then they forge the data and show wrong hiring data. The path of lie continues till students realize that they have lost the most valuable part of their life and stand no where. They have to restart from the scratch if they do not want to work with Amazon as a ware house staff who would segregate goods to be shipped to different parts of the country or work as a data operator with hope of being a team leader soon, which doesnt happen for years.

This is the true reality of most of the private engineering colleges, if not all.

Source : I had received multiple such requests as an HR manager at early stage of my carrier which I politely denied because I had known reality through my friends in the same profession.

You would end up crying if you go for hiring in these colleges, I am bound to say that you would return empty handed and it feels so bad on the part of those students who looked at you as a god who came there to their rescue.

Karan Kanwal,6y,What are common scams in India?,"Arun graduated from engineering college with no job in hand.

Arun’s branch is Mechanical Engineering.

Arun is depressed as he knows his family needs support from him financially.

Arun needs a job so he submitted his resume in various job portal.

After a week, he got a call from a xyz job portal and they told him that his resume has got shortlisted for tata motors, they fixed a telephonic interview.

Arun is happy, finally he has a chance to support his poor family.

He was asked some really easy question in a telephonic interview which he answered correctly and interviewer congratulated him as he was selected for HR round on next day.

Arun prepares for the interview whole night, he mugged up all the possible answers as he did not want to miss this chance.

Arun got a call next day, again some obsolete question was asked which Arun answered perfectly. He was sure that he will get a job but he did not tell anybody as he wanted to surprise everyone.

He got the call next day, a lady congratulated him for the job. Arun was on a cloud nine, he knew the importance of the job, somehow he controlled his emotion and thanked the lady on the phone.

She asked him for all the documents for verification and 5000 rs security money (which is refundable if he join the company).

Arun knew he could not ask for money to his parents so he gave all his savings to that lady.

She called him again and said his documents are fine and he can join his company from xyz date. But he got a job in another state, so he has to give another 10,000 rs for dress, room etc etc.

Now, Arun has already given him his savings and he was left with no money, so he contacted all his placed friends and asked for money, somehow he collected 10000 rs and submitted it to them.

Now, he was waiting for a call.

2 Weeks passed he was still waiting. Now, he called on lady’s no. which is either switched off or not reachable. He tried all the no. from which he got the call, all were switched off.
