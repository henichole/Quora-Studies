John Cate,1y,Can Sears recover?,"If you mean Sears as the department store retailer, no. According to Wikipedia, there are just 23 Sears stores left standing in the USA, not including their small specialty stores. There is very little left, and the only reason those stores exist is so its corporate (mis)management can squeeze every last dime of value before filing Chapter 7 to liquidate anything that is left.

Sears’ department store model is dead and it will never return. People don’t like shopping at malls anymore and they don’t enjoy shopping in stores full of overpriced merchandise which they try to sell at a premium based on convenience. I watched Sears slowly decline from the mid-1980s onward, until they just disappeared from view altogether. The quality of the merchandise declined and so did their customer service. I still remember my father going into Sears around 1987 when a Craftsman tool broke and he went there to get them to honor the “lifetime warranty.” They tried to argue with him for half an hour before the manager honored it. Dad never bought another tool at Sears again.

(A funny side note: In the early 1980s, Sears had a computer section and I had learned just enough BASIC on the computer at school to write a program on Sears’ display model. Dad once got mischievous and told me to make their computer display “Shop at JCPenney’s” on an endless loop. After that, I did it every time I went into that Sears! One time I got caught and even the sales clerk laughed.)

I don’t think I have set foot in a Sears for like 10 years. There is a “Sears Hometown” just a few miles away, selling appliances, but I don’t need any, so there’s no reason for me to go there. There are only two remaining full-size Sears stores in the entire state of North Carolina. They are entirely gone from Charlotte, the state’s largest city.

I think the Sears brand will survive the death of the company, though. There is still value in the brand itself, and it will be one of the last things sold off in liquidation. This happened when Montgomery Ward died in 2001 for a lot of the same reasons Sears will. The brand was sold off, and since 2004, it lives again as an online retailer
, selling the same sorts of goods as the original.

The same, I suspect, will happen to Sears. And it will be sort of ironic, since Sears became a popular, successful brand at the turn of the last century because of its catalog sales. Sears called itself “The Cheapest Supply House on Earth,” and would sell you just about anything, even a prefabricated house! Sears was literally to 1905 what Amazon was to 2005.

Very impressive design work for 1909. Sears was a first-class operation then and continued to be all the way into my childhood, but the last time I was in one, I felt like I was in an overpriced Ollie’s or Big Lots. (Nothing against those stores, but Sears claimed to be in a different tier.)

Sears itself made moves to revive its old business model in the early years of the Internet, but never fully embraced it and instead chose to ride its 1960s business model right into the commode. There was still time. They were the largest retailer in the US until 1990, were profitable until 2010, and were still acquiring smaller retailers as late as 1997.

If they had someone with the vision of Jeff Bezos in the late 1990s, they could have transitioned to that model, while leaving their appliance specialty stores open. The problem is that it’s hard for a company so old and set in its ways to re-configure in such a way. A company like Sears is what it is, it’s not going to be agile. They never would have foreseen consumers using the Internet to bring into being a modern-day version of catalog shopping.

Bezos himself has said that someday, a new business model will put Amazon under. And he’s probably right. Every business has its moment in the sun, and when that sun sets, it’s over. Sears has been dying for almost 40 years. They should be grateful for the long twilight.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tzf9chid0r48sw3x', 'title': 'Can Sears recover?', 'score': {'original': 0.4903, 'ai': 0.5097}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'If you mean Sears as the department store retailer, no.

Ian O'Grady,10-Oct,What is the greatest product ever pitched on Shark Tank?,"The first product to blow mind was the sandless sandbag. If I had the money, there would be no hesitation investing in it.

The Stormberg was invented by Maurice Huffman and his son. The sandless sandbag weighs less than a pound when dry. It can be used by anyone, no matter their physical ability. When you add water to the sack, it transforms into a 30-pound sandbag. Sounds like magic right? So how does it work?

The bag is made from a highly absorbent polymer, and just a small handful of polymer represents 50 pounds of sand when wet.

Here’s the amazing bit. They’re reusable, and when they dries out, it goes back to being a one-pound bag.

One of the Sharks pulled out from making a deal because sandbags are free, and you can’t compete with free. The problem with that is where I come from a bag of sound would cost me 8 Euros. Even if you did get them free from the council, the sand still comes with a price.

Randall Reade,Updated 5y,"While listening to a start up pitch, did you ever hear something that made you say, “you can’t be serious…”?","Oh yes. Many times. One was a guy who came up with the bright idea of competing with Airbnb. He had no money, no product, no management team, just an idea. And the idea was that Airbnb is a mediocre experience for users, and so he was going to do the same thing but provide a “five star” experience. The website would be better, the hosts would be better prepared, and that was about it. He wanted money to build this out, but had no clue how he was going to get customers or compete against Airbnb.

Another guy had a coding team that had worked for two years and blew through $200K of his own money to develop a software program that would take a picture of you and then you could try on glasses, jewelry and other things and see how they would look on you from a variety of angles. I didn’t have the heart to tell him his technology is already out there, and so he wasted all his time and money.

Another guy had a small box that you wear around your neck, almost like jewelry. This device was a medical device, though, that could tell you instantly your heart rate, temperature and other things. I asked him about competition, and he said there was no competition — nothing else like it on the market. So I took out my phone and did a search on Amazon, and found a dozen devices just like his for sale already. I showed him them and said, “you mean these things are different from yours?” He got rather angry, turned away and walked away from me.

Another guy wanted $300M to build an office building with tv studios so he could launch a tv network that would compete against Fox. He was sure it would be a huge success despite having zero experience in the tv industry.

My associate met someone at a pitch competition who just needed about $80K to finish his app. He asked him how long has he been developing this app, and he said five years. Then he asked him how much money has he spent so far, and he said $500K. But if he just had another $80K, he could finish the app within a few months, it’s just that his family won’t give him any more money.

I just had a company tell me that they have a valuation of $233 million, despite being pre-revenue. I was shocked, and I asked what that was based on. They had paid a big consulting firm and they based it on the fact that some company that had a product similar to theirs, but not as many features, recently sold for close to $200M, but since they “plan” to include many more features, it would surely be worth much more. I pretty much laughed in his face and warned him to never, ever tell anyone this or they will be laughed off the stage.

Lesson: Big consulting firms exist to tell you what you want to hear and then take a huge fee for it. If you really need that, I will happily tell you what you want to hear and charge you half what they do. Promise!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7m01ekgpq5nvh6zx', 'title': 'While listening to a start up pitch, did you ever hear something that made you say, “you can’t be serious…”?', 'score': {'original': 0.5388, 'ai': 0.4612}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Oh yes.

Stan Hanks,2y,Why is Reddit still relying on venture capital?,"Have a look at Jason M. Lemkin's answer to Why is Reddit still relying on venture capital? and let’s talk a bit about what’s under that.

Investors in any company are looking for a way not just to get their money back but to make really big returns on the money that they invested. The longer their investment “cooks”, the more that they need to get back in order to make it worth the risk.

Reddit has been around for a long time - 15 years. That’s… approximately forever in VC terms. Their Series A1 was in 2013, after the great reversion in limited partner hold time terms, and here 8 years later, those guys are dying - they wanted to have cashed out a couple years ago. So it’s time.

The question is… how. And how to make that at as big as possible a valuation.

Enter the art of the “mezzanine finance round”.

Back in the day, a mezzanine round did two things - first, it was a market signal, to set the floor value for an IPO; in this case, given that they raised $250M at a $6B valuation… you can expect that an IPO done reasonably rapidly, the next year, would be at a serious premium to that pricing. Second, it’s a way for the lead investment banks to bring in customers from their private bank business so that they can “get into the company” directly before the IPO. A lot of time when you see a venture capital group that you’ve never seen before showing up in a late-stage deal, that’s actually a syndicate of high net worth individuals and family office customers of the major investment banks jockeying for just such opportunity. Sure, can use some pull to buy at the open of the IPO… but if you play your cards right, you can be last money in before the IPO, at a steep, steep discount to the open.

So when you see a raise in a late stage company that doesn’t make sense? That’s likely what it is. You sometimes see that in early stage companies that are being prepped for acquisition - I saw a lot of those when I was working in PE..

There’s a decent chance that some variation on this is what’s going on with Reddit.

On the other hand… these guys are still spending money ahead of revenue. My guess is that they really needed the cash, for at least another year maybe two. Why? Well, while Reddit Is on Pace to More Than Double Its Ad Revenues By 2021
 that’s still not a lot of money. Currently they’re running about $100M-$150M in ad revenue. And I’m guessing that their infra and staff costs are over $220M a year.

Second, they’re swamped. Growth takes people to make it happen and based on this raise, Reddit to double employees after raising $250 million
. That’s like 700 people. If those are engineer-class people… that’s taking on an additional $250M per year in burn all by itself.

Rajnish Prajapat,3y,Is it possible to build a billion dollar company without funding from a VC?,"Yes!

This guy sold his company to Pepsi for $4 Billion and He owned 100% of the company.

Russ Weiner is the founder of Rockstar Energy which he started with $50k. After testing 700 flavour varieties, Weiner drove around San Francisco in an old car painted with the Rockstar logo to promote his new energy drink.

Rockstar, founded in 2001, makes 30 variations of 16-ounce drinks that are sold in convenience stores and grocers in more than 30 countries.

The beverages are popular among athletes and performers.

Rockstar has had a distribution agreement with PepsiCo in North America since 2009, is currently sold in 30 countries around the world.

and the best thing is Russ owned 85% of the company and his mother, who was the CFO owned 15% of the company.

Before finding Rockstar Energy, Russ worked in a Vodka making company where he presented his idea to make an energy drink to the founder. But Founder of the vodka company rejected the idea, unimpressed with the name “Rockstar”.

Totally true and it completely depends on your shares (equity) of the company at the time of sale. Dilution will happen as you grow the company and by 100 Million even though you may only own a percentage of the original share amount, it could be valued much higher.

There’s also the terms of the deal, like how long you get paid out, how you get paid out (Stock or Cash), and if you have to stay on with the company.

Marin Licina,Updated 8y,Why is Peter Thiel not a big fan of the lean startup/MVP movement?,"I've been taught by both Steve Blank and Peter Thiel at Stanford. Peter has been critical of ""Lean"" dogma where process becomes more important than a big vision. However, I believe the actual philosophies of Thiel and Blank (Lean Startup) aren't as far apart as most people think: they cover different ""zoom levels"" of building a company.

1. Thiel believes in determinate optimisim: the future is made by exceptional people who have a definite plan and execute on it. That meaningful, big-leap innovations are often not obvious from the start: If you're creating something that will be a great company 10 years from now, most people will probably not get it at first. Just see the Airbnb's 7 Rejections
 from investors as evidence.

In other words: Founders who want to create radical innovation should have a big, audacious plan and ignore mundane thinking.

2. The (misunderstood) Lean Startup dogma is to have no definite plan, work in incremental iterations to find out what's most valuable to customers today. This approach will probably lead you to very incremental solutions, or even make you run around in circles achieving nothing. It lowers the cost of failure, but also the potential impact of success. Process becomes more important than the end goal. It's literally the opposite of what Peter propagates. He has indeed expressed his dislike for this approach.


3. Steve Blank doesn't advertise this type of lean though, as he repeatedly said that ""entrepreneurship is part art, part science"" - that founders should have a goal on the horizon, a vision, and then validate parts of that vision along the way. Note that Thiel advises starting small with an offering that can monopolize a small market, then grow the eventual company out of that. Sounds a bit like a business model MVP, doesn't it?


4. My opinion is that Thiel's logic works well in long-term view: finding a frontier of value which will be a great company years from now. A frontier that only a few people believe exists (but you have strong proof and conviction that it does). Blank's Logic (actually rooted in Design Thinking and IDEO) is a ground-level method to improve your evolving value proposition and business model. They are not opposites - just slightly different views on different ""zoom levels"" of the same thing.

Hector Quintanilla,3y,Is self discipline the key to success?,"In 1991, General Norman Schwarzkopf led the international coalition of more than 750,000 troops to force the Iraqi army out of Kuwait.

General Schwarzkopf was recognized for his strict attention to detail, regardless of how insignificant it was. “Shined shoes save lives,” he said.

It was Schwarzkopf’s belief that if his soldiers were not disciplined enough about small things, they would not be able to respond appropriately under pressure.

“Under pressure, the undisciplined die.”
— General Norman Schwarzkopf

By performing even the smallest tasks with precision, day-in and day-out, (such as shining their shoes,) soldiers develop the discipline needed to perform under pressure.

To answer your question, is self discipline the key to success?

Your level of success is determined by your level of discipline.
We either suffer the pains of discipline or we’ll suffer the pains of regret.

Jason M. Lemkin,4y,How did Masayoshi Son trust WeWork at its founder so quickly? He has met Adam Neumann for only 4 minutes and decided to invest $4.4 billion.,"Pattern-matching.

It what almost all investors do. At least the heads of investing firms. FBOW.

First, even if Masayoshi Son only met for Neumann for 4 minutes, the Softbank team had spent tons of time pouring over financials, doing diligence, visiting customers, etc. Tons of time. That’s what the investing team is for.

Second, the heads of most huge PE/VC firms often have to quickly assess CEO candidates proposed by their teams. The boss / the head of the firm often only meets once with a CEO before a large check goes in. Not the same as Softbank, but I intro’d 2 CEOs to a $10b+ fund who funded both companies (both winners) within weeks. Both were $60m+ checks. Not Softbank big, but big. And the head of the firm made a decision 15 minutes into meeting with each CEO. He had to. They probably do 50 of these investments per fund, and he has to meet probably 100+ CEOs as part of that. But that was after his team had done lots of work to have conviction on the investments.

So the folks at the top of PE/VC firms end up doing a lot of pattern-matching to make 15–20 minute confirmatory decisions after person-months of work their teams have already done.

And for better or worse, they pattern match. Masayoshi Son apparently was pattern-matching with Alibaba, his top investment. Everyone does it. It allows a lot of bias to creep in. And it risks not evolving with the times.

Jason M. Lemkin,Updated 1y,How do I reject a VC without spoiling the relationship?,"Be (1) clear (2) and respectful.

Let me use myself as a case-study. I have one spoiled VC relationship -- all the rest I consider pretty strong.

Here's what happened to me:

I told this Top Tier VC what the valuation was, my Ask. I was 100% clear on this in every way, shape and form.
The First VC nevertheless wrote me a term sheet at a lower valuation.
The First VC also wrote in this term sheet granting his firm 3/5 of the Board seats at Series A.
I didn't respond in any way, at all. The First VC then left to go vacation on Some Expensive Island.
The Second VC then gave me the term sheet I asked for, the asked-for valuation, and 1 Board seat.
Before accepting from the Second VC, I called the First VC, who was still vacationing on Some Expensive Island. I told him.
The First VC became outraged, and said at his Top Tier VC Firm, no one had ever not closed a signed term sheet. Ever.
I told him I'd never signed it (I hadn't), we'd never even discussed it -- and that it wasn't what I'd asked for, and that we'd never agreed.
The First VC got so mad, he went to the Second VC, and insisted they not fund me.
Which created huge drama.

Ok so what happened? Did I do anything wrong? Was I less than transparent, ever?

No. Of course not. Not only did I sign absolutely nothing, but my ask wasn't met. And I was completely, 100% transparent in the process. To my detriment, in fact, such that the First VC went and tried to force the Second VC not to do the deal.

But what did happen is the First VC was convinced in his mind he had a done deal. Even though we clearly did not.

The learning: just make sure VCs know exactly where they stand. Be 100% crystal clear, in writing, in email.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,3y,How do I raise money from venture capitalists and business angels for my startup? What are some things they must look for in startups for investments?,"I have raised money a couple of times from angels and VCs for my present company. I have raised small amounts of capital for a previous startup. I have worked in a VC firm too a long time ago. Here is my quick suggestion:

Build something useful and get paid by real customers. It is after then you should look to raise venture capital. VC money is like rocket fuel. You need to build the rocket yourself and figure out a way to move it to the launch area apart from building the launchpad.

In the most successful companies, the founders never required external capital to build the first versions of the product.

Apple I was on sale in the retail market before the company secured angel funding from Mike Markkula.

Facebook had the Facemash and TheFacebook before securing the angel investment.

Microsoft was selling Altair Basic and a bunch of other products before securing venture funding.

Google had a search engine (Backrub) before the company was even incorporated.

Amazon got to a sales of $20,000/week within a month of founding and only a year later they took their first funding.

By the time Sequoia invested in Oracle in 1983, the company was already 6 years old and bringing in huge amounts of money.

The idea that you need to secure funding to start a company or build your first product is one of the biggest misconceptions of new entrepreneurs. Great companies had their first products before securing any kind of funding and needed funding only to scale fast.

Here is a typical algorithm to building a startup.

Create a team of makers and sellers in the founding team. The maker is the one going to create the product/service — code, art, delivery mechanism or any other related invention core to the startup. The seller is the one taking it to the customer. Anyone else should not be in the founding team.
Talk to a lot of potential customers and find something they want to buy. It need not be very profitable nor very scalable at first. Something in the direction of what you want to build and something paid. That’s all.
Build the first product, deliver to the customer. If it is a consumer product it need be paid at first, but a lot of people in your target should immediately “get” it.
After selling the first couple of orders [in a B2B] or to a few thousand customers [in a B2C], figure out a way to scale the business that could one day be a billion dollar business [these days VCs don’t entertain anything that doesn’t have the potential to be a billion dollar business someday]. A quick rule of thumb to be a billion dollar valuation is to either do $50m+ in annual sales with good margins [in B2B] or have 10 million+ active users in case of B2C. What is the path to attain that?

Now, you can start looking at VCs. Do research on recent deals in your market and ask for introductions to those VCs from your own network. For some of them you can reach out by cold mail, but be very specific in what you want.

Expect 90 out of 100 VCs to reject outright, about 5 not very happy with the valuation or other details, 4 not being able to make their mind and wait for someone else to lead, and if you are lucky 1 — the one — who would take the plunge.

Jason M. Lemkin,Updated 9mo,What are some rookie mistakes founders make during VC meetings?,"A few mistakes pitching to VCs that are common and easy to fix:

Being cagey with answers. Just answer the question. How much are you raising? Where are you in the process? Being direct (and honest) builds trust. With VCs, you want to build trust quickly, if you can.
Bringing the wrong people with you. Do not bring “consultants”. Do not bring anyone with you that isn’t part of the senior team. As soon as you bring a “consultant” with you — I’m out. 100% of the time.
Not sending the deck ahead of time. Just send it. You are wasting both a lot of time, and an opportunity, by not letting VCs do basic homework ahead of time. Make it easy on them.
Not doing at least basic homework on the VC firm. You should know their other investments in the space. VCs may be fungible, but no one wants to feel that way.
Spending more than 2 slides on “the industry”. Do not do this, unless asked. Assume VCs understand what is “happening in the cloud”. This not only is a waste of precious time … I’ll fade away.
Going in too strong. If you have 2 signed term sheets, for sure, go in strong. It saves everyone time. But being too aggressive, too take-it-or-leave-it, if you don’t have options — is a big mistake. BATNA, folks.
Going in too weak. Telling me you could succeed “if only you could raise $____” is just the wrong message. Winners always find a way to win. No matter how hard it is.
Asking for coffee to “share notes”. Some VCs may want to do this, but I sure don’t. My job is to invest. Show me a team and product I want to invest in — I’m in. I already drink 4 cups a day. I don’t need a 5th.
Hearing about how the founders met in elementary school. Even if this is true, I don’t want to hear it, at least not as a part of the core pitch. That’s not a positive for me. Meeting at Google or Salesforce is a positive. Meeting at Thomas Jefferson Elementary is not. I want to hear why the founders are amazing.
Not answering the questions. If I ask a question, there’s a good reason. Some VCs like to hear themselves talk. I don’t. Just answer it. If you don’t know the answer, tell me. Don’t tell me “you’ll get to that later”. Because if you do, that may well be too late.
Not speaking with data. Always speak with data, if data is there. Even if it isn’t great. I don’t want some qualitative answer, once you have even just 10 customers.
Claiming pilots, unpaid users, and anything similar are “customers”. They aren’t. And don’t claim they are MRR/ARR. They aren’t. Be clear what is a pilot, what is paid, and what isn’t. Otherwise, this blows up on you in diligence.
Hiding anything. It will come back to bite you. Some things may be more appropriate for a second meeting, but make sure whatever top level issues there are, come up in the beginning.
Poor understanding of competitive landscape. You have to get this right. You have to. First, always have a competition slide. Second, know it cold. Third, be respectful of any competitor larger than you. If you don’t understand the competitive landscape cold, you don’t really understand the market — or what you are going after.
Not having the >first< slide sell the company. If the first slide is the only slide you need. If it sells the whole deal. Your odds go up. Elevator pitches are important. So is a “1-slide” pitch. Make that first slide count, folks. Metrics, team, product, financial goals. Put it all on Slide 1. Position the company, and answer all my questions right then and there.

>> Your job is to pass the 20 minute test. <<

To get a VC to want to invest no later than 20 minutes into the first meeting. Anything you do that handicaps a VC getting to a decision in less than 20 minutes dramatically harms your odds of getting funded.

Andreas Kitzing,Updated 4y,What is the worst thing you can do or say in your first meeting with a venture capital firm?,"You could intentionally show up late and wear pajamas. You think that would never happen? Well, it did, and the incident is well documented. You can probably guess from the picture - if not, you’ll find out by the end of the answer who pulled this off…

In 2004, Sequoia Capital - arguably one of the world’s most prestigious venture capital firms - invited the founder of one of the hottest startups at the time to a meeting. This founder was working on two startups at that time, one of which would eventually become a multi-billion dollar company. Anyway, the meeting was scheduled to discuss funding for the other startup.

A friend and employee of this founder was Napster’s co-founder Sean Parker. Sequoia had previously invested into Parker’s startup Plaxo, but things didn’t end well. As a result, our founder had no intention of accepting funding from Sequoia and decided to prank them. The prank had three core elements:

First, the founder intentionally showed up late for the 8 AM meeting.

Second, he was wearing pajamas (yes, seriously).

Third, he presented a PowerPoint presentation titled “The Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Not Invest”. The deck included very convincing arguments, such as:

“We have no revenue.”
“We’re only here because [name of Sequoia partner] told us to come.”
“Because Sean Parker is involved.”
“We will probably get sued by the music industry.”
“We showed up at your office late in our pajamas.”

Not surprisingly, Sequoia politely declined to make an offer. They never invested in his other, later-on super-successful startup, either. Considering that Sequoia did invest in Apple, Atari, Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, Instagram, PayPal, WhatsApp, YouTube, and many others, this is one of the few successful Silicon Valley tech companies where Sequoia wasn’t involved.

So, what’s the name of this founder?

Do you recognize him? Yes, Mark Zuckerberg played this prank on Sequoia when raising money for Wirehog (his side project when founding Facebook). Zuckerberg later told David Kirkpatrick, author of “The Facebook Effect”, that he “assumed we really offended them and now I feel really bad about that.”

Anyway, this wouldn’t be a Silicon Valley story if the VC firm wouldn’t have the last laugh. Do you remember the list of Sequoia’s investments two paragraphs above this one? Did you notice it included “WhatsApp”? In 2011, Sequoia Capital had led WhatsApp’s $8 million Series A (and in 2013, the Series B as well).

Guess who bought WhatsApp in 2014? Yeah, Facebook did, and they paid $19 billion - about $3 billion of which went directly into Sequoia’s pockets. I guess this repayment kind of let Sequoia forgive Zuckerberg for his prank 10 years earlier. :)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qcfe07lxn6miut9v', 'title': 'What is the worst thing you can do or say in your first meeting with a venture capital firm?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'You could intentionally show up late and wear pajamas.

Anyway, the meeting was scheduled to discuss funding for the other startup.\n\nA friend and employee of this founder was Napster’s co-founder Sean Parker. Sequoia had previously invested into Parker’s startup Plaxo, but things didn’t end well. As a result, our founder had no intention of accepting funding from Sequoia and decided to prank them. The prank had three core elements:\n\nFirst, the founder intentionally showed up late for the 8 AM meeting.\n\nSecond, he was wearing pajamas (yes, seriously).\n\nThird, he presented a PowerPoint presentation titled “The Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Not Invest”. The deck included very convincing arguments, such as:\n\n“We have no revenue.”\n“We’re only here because [name of Sequoia partner] told us to come.”\n“Because Sean Parker is involved.”\n“We will probably get sued by the music industry.”\n“We showed up at your office late in our pajamas.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Sequoia politely declined to make an offer. They never invested in his other, later-on super-successful startup, either. Considering that Sequoia did invest in Apple, Atari, Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, Instagram, PayPal, WhatsApp, YouTube, and many others, this is one of the few successful Silicon Valley tech companies where Sequoia wasn’t involved.\n\nSo, what’s the name of this founder?\n\nDo you recognize him? Yes, Mark Zuckerberg played this prank on Sequoia when raising money for Wirehog (his side project when founding Facebook). Zuckerberg later told David Kirkpatrick, author of “The Facebook Effect”, that he “assumed we really offended them and now I feel really bad about that.”\n\nAnyway, this wouldn’t be a Silicon Valley story if the VC firm wouldn’t have the last laugh. Do you remember the list of Sequoia’s investments two paragraphs above this one? Did you notice it included “WhatsApp”? In 2011, Sequoia Capital had led WhatsApp’s $8 million Series A (and in 2013, the Series B as well).\n\nGuess who bought WhatsApp in 2014? Yeah, Facebook did, and they paid $19 billion - about $3 billion of which went directly into Sequoia’s pockets. I guess this repayment kind of let Sequoia forgive Zuckerberg for his prank 10 years earlier. :)', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9996
Urooj Kazi,Updated 9y,How is it to work with JustUnfollow considering they haven't received funding?,"I turned one-JustUnfollow-year-old a few weeks back. I was hired for content, but in true startup style I do a bit of this and a bit of that and have a whale of a time doing what I do.

I write this answer not because I've been asked to, but because I want to, because I am surprised by the number of applicants we get whenever we post a new job (a lot, but not a lot lot), because there are others out there who echo your question but ask it not, and because working at JustUnfollow is so awesome you cannot not talk about it when asked.

To answer your question:

We work out of a proper office, like with chairs and desks and stuff...


...and pet plants...

...a conference room with bar stools...





We do crazy things

Like this (Don't ask me, I don't know what's happening either)...


and this...



and this...





We work hard, just like at any other startup, funded or otherwise.

This was during Diwali. Some of us love office so much, we turned up to work.



Candid shot (trust me)



With our desks customized the way we want...





We have fun. A little too much.









And, we have food...



more food...



Some more nomnom...


Bonus: We get our salaries on time, every time.

Personally, I have never felt the lack of funding has had any impact on my experience at JustUnfollow so far. It has been the best workplaces I've worked at so far and the last one year has been one of the most memorable of my life.

If anything, I am proud that we are as awesome as we are despite being bootstrapped.

If you were planning to apply to one of our openings and the ""non-funded"" tag was holding you back, I hope you'd reconsider. If you are as cool a person as everyone else at JustUnfollow is, you'd have made one of the best decisions of your life.

Aman Goel,2y,What are the most common mistakes that startups make?,"We went from an almost bankruptcy to $1M in revenue in 2.5 years

I started Cogno AI
 right out of college, back in April 2017. At that time, we were an Enterprise Artificial Intelligence startup that developed custom AI/ML-driven solutions for large enterprises.

Services businesses are almost always unscalable. They are great cash-cows for people who are just starting up. However, scaling them is really difficult. We were one such services business — no wonder, my Co-founder left 1.5 years after we started.

This Co-founder's exit happened in August 2018. It was one of the hardest phases of my life — intense pressure, no team, lack of money, lack of support, and lack of business. I had to swallow the reality and find a way to move ahead. When my Co-founder left, I even had to pay some amount to buy out his stake in the company. I was left with Rs. 1.0 Lakhs ($1,400 approximately) in the company’s bank account.

It was a terrible situation to be in. When you are in such a phase of life, everyone walks away. No one wants to help you when you are going through a bad phase of your life.

I invested a small amount of money from my personal savings. Rs. 5.0 Lakhs (about $7,000) that I had saved in the college days by doing freelancing. Coming from a small, middle-class family, it was a difficult choice for me. But I was out of options — take this plunge or shut the shop. What else could I do?

I decided that we already have 4 paying clients, so why not take the plunge. I explained the situation to my parents. They were totally freaked out. I literally had to calm down my parents because they were worried about my career.

Fast forward 2.5 years later in March 2021, we closed Rs. 7.25 crores of revenue (~$1Million), staying completely bootstrapped. Not just that, we built a team of ~80 team members, all of them working remotely in this pandemic.

How did this sudden change happen?

We focused.

It obviously wasn’t that simple. However, if you ask me what took us from $1,400 in the Bank to $1M in revenue in 2.5 years, I’d say that the biggest contributing factor was “focus”.

Before my Co-founder’s exit, we were trying to dirty our hands on so many things:

An AI-driven ChatBot platform.
A chat-driven cognitive data analysis platform.
A document search and data aggregation platform.
An email complaint automation system.
An e-learning platform for competitive exam preparation.
A platform for enterprises to build reports collaboratively.
A face recognition platform to personalize the shopping experience.
A generic AI/ML platform for large enterprises.
A lending platform for farmers based on their produce.
An algorithmic trading platform for crypto-based assets.

And whatnot.

We were trying hands in all 100 different directions, not focusing on anything. No wonder nothing worked out. It was a mistake that me and my previous Co-founder jointly made. And everything went wrong.

When in August 2018 he left, I sat down with a sheet of paper and noted down the mistakes we made — every single mistake. I wanted to reflect upon what went wrong and how can such mistakes be avoided in the future.

I realized that the biggest mistake we were making is that we were not focused at all. We had a limited amount of time and bandwidth and we had to focus on depth rather than breadth. 10 different ideas won’t take us anywhere. It is easier to build 1 product and take it to 100 customers than to build 10 different products and take them to 10 different customers.

When I write this article, I feel stupid that we didn’t realize this horribly silly mistake back then. It indeed was quite stupid of us to focus on so many things.

I decided to cut off all the random ideas and focus on just 1 thing that was working — the ChatBot solution.

At that time, we had an intern and a full-time Software Engineer along with my new Co-founder. So, including me, there were 4 people. I discussed this idea with the 3 of them and we all aligned ourselves in 1 single direction — build a fantastic ChatBot platform for large enterprises.

We spent about 3 months working on this platform and it shaped really well. We knew what was to be built based on the 1.5 years of services business experience. One of our existing clients called us for a meeting with their Recruitment Head, who was exploring collaboration with startups for their problem statements around Recruitment.

I showed him our platform and he really loved it. He was quite impressed and immediately asked his team to onboard us. We spent time building and perfecting the product with his feedback.

(Honoured by one of our Clients)

We showed our platform to a couple of other prospects also, and they liked the platform. Things seem to be going in the right direction now. We realized that focusing on 1 thing was really working well for us and we spent time really building the best ChatBot development platform.

With the reference of our existing clients came more clients. With the help of one of our mentors, we built a subscription-based pricing model which was suited to large enterprise clients. We realized that charging a bomb on day 1 makes no sense and that the land and expand strategy would work the best.

We priced the product in such a way that a VP-level person can approve it within her budget. Once she gets sold, she can share references for other people within her organization for other use-cases.

(Honoured by the Ministry of Information Technology)

ChatBots have a bunch of use-cases in Financial Services — the sector we operate in.

Customer Support Bot
Employee Support Bot
Recruitment Bot
Field Agent Support Bot
Lead Generation Bot
WhatsApp Bot
Voice Bot on Alexa and Google Assistant
Bot for Privilege Banking Agents
Bot for Relationship Managers
Bot for Call center agents

These are just a few. A typical Financial Institution has at least 50 business teams and you can sell a Bot to each of them. This means that 1 large enterprise client is essentially equivalent to 50 customers.

We further realized that for selling 1 implementation, we need to get buy-in from 6 people — Business, IT, Information Security, Legal, Compliance, and Procurement.

This obviously is a tedious process. However, we figured that if we have the clearance from the last 5, we don’t need it again and again for selling to the other business teams within the organization.

For instance, if you have the SLA signed (Legal), you don’t need a separate SLA for your other implementations. A short 1-page addendum can be added to the existing SLA. Similarly, once the price has been agreed with the procurement team, it can be used for all the implementations.

This works not only across the business teams within a Financial Institution, but also it works across the group companies. For instance, ICICI Securities would easily accept the Service Level Agreement for ICICI Bank. The same holds for an Information Security clearance and procurement clearance. Obviously, some extra formalities would be required. But you can save time from the negotiation of terms and that helps you move deals faster.

We realized this early in the journey and it worked like a charm. Customers came flowing in like crazy. People absolutely loved our product. I spent my full-day meeting customers and understanding their challenges and adding features to our product.

(Select clientele)

We focused heavily on building things that our customers love. References and revenue came as a by-product. Our ChatBot platform has some fantastic features:

Extremely easy to customize and build, even for Business teams.
Can be integrated with almost all types of backend systems.
Built for enterprise scale.
Strong NLP which can interpret and understand a wide variety of customer queries.
A deep analytics layer that shows actionable reports

On top of that, we provided fantastic support and SLA. I personally took customer calls when needed to have a full assurance that we are always by their side, be it a Saturday or a Sunday.

(We help enterprises manage customer experience at scale)

Later when COVID-19 happened, we added 2 new modules to our Product:

Live Agent Chat: so that Bot can transfer the chat to Live Agents.
Cobrowsing: so that Sales agents can help the customers make a purchase easily.

Both these solutions got a wide acceptance among our customers. In fact, these solutions came from our customer’s problem statements. We co-created our products with our customers.

At the time of COVID, our products turned out to be a boon for our customers. The usage shot up significantly. We helped our clients digitize their contact centers in a smooth manner to Bots and Live Chat.

Today, as of May 2021, we are ~85 members in the team and growing fast. While initial customer acquisition happened through the contacts and network of our advisors, we are now onboarding new customers because of the merit of our products.

During these whole 2.5 years, my team members really worked hard and I give full credit to them for where we are today. Personally, for me as a young entrepreneur, bootstrapping to $1M at the age of 25 years is a celebration-worthy achievement. However, we have a long way to go in building a global SaaS company from India.

I’d like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank the Cogno AI
 Team members, Customers, Mentors and Advisors, and also my parents. They’ve always been by our side and supported us in this journey. Without them, nothing would have been possible.

I believe that while we should celebrate the small wins, we should always keep the big picture in mind — a vision of helping Businesses manage Customer Experience at Scale.

I will conclude with a quote I love.

And everything went wrong.\n\nWhen in August 2018 he left, I sat down with a sheet of paper and noted down the mistakes we made — every single mistake. I wanted to reflect upon what went wrong and how can such mistakes be avoided in the future.\n\nI realized that the biggest mistake we were making is that we were not focused at all. We had a limited amount of time and bandwidth and we had to focus on depth rather than breadth. 10 different ideas won’t take us anywhere. It is easier to build 1 product and take it to 100 customers than to build 10 different products and take them to 10 different customers.\n\nWhen I write this article, I feel stupid that we didn’t realize this horribly silly mistake back then. It indeed was quite stupid of us to focus on so many things.\n\nI decided to cut off all the random ideas and focus on just 1 thing that was working — the ChatBot solution.\n\nAt that time, we had an intern and a full-time Software Engineer along with my new Co-founder. So, including me, there were 4 people. I discussed this idea with the 3 of them and we all aligned ourselves in 1 single direction — build a fantastic ChatBot platform for large enterprises.\n\nWe spent about 3 months working on this platform and it shaped really well. We knew what was to be built based on the 1.5 years of services business experience. One of our existing clients called us for a meeting with their Recruitment Head, who was exploring collaboration with startups for their problem statements around Recruitment.\n\nI showed him our platform and he really loved it. He was quite impressed and immediately asked his team to onboard us. We spent time building and perfecting the product with his feedback.\n\n(Honoured by one of our Clients)\n\nWe showed our platform to a couple of other prospects also, and they liked the platform. Things seem to be going in the right direction now. We realized that focusing on 1 thing was really working well for us and we spent time really building the best ChatBot development platform.\n\nWith the reference of our existing clients came more clients. With the help of one of our mentors, we built a subscription-based pricing model which was suited to large enterprise clients. We realized that charging a bomb on day 1 makes no sense and that the land and expand strategy would work the best.\n\nWe priced the product in such a way that a VP-level person can approve it within her budget. Once she gets sold, she can share references for other people within her organization for other use-cases.\n\n(Honoured by the Ministry of Information Technology)\n\nChatBots have a bunch of use-cases in Financial Services — the sector we operate in.\n\nCustomer Support Bot\nEmployee Support Bot\nRecruitment Bot\nField Agent Support Bot\nLead Generation Bot\nWhatsApp Bot\nVoice Bot on Alexa and Google Assistant\nBot for Privilege Banking Agents\nBot for Relationship Managers\nBot for Call center agents\n\nThese are just a few. A typical Financial Institution has at least 50 business teams and you can sell a Bot to each of them. This means that 1 large enterprise client is essentially equivalent to 50 customers.\n\nWe further realized that for selling 1 implementation, we need to get buy-in from 6 people — Business, IT, Information Security, Legal, Compliance, and Procurement.\n\nThis obviously is a tedious process. However, we figured that if we have the clearance from the last 5, we don’t need it again and again for selling to the other business teams within the organization.\n\nFor instance, if you have the SLA signed (Legal), you don’t need a separate SLA for your other implementations. A short 1-page addendum can be added to the existing SLA. Similarly, once the price has been agreed with the procurement team, it can be used for all the implementations.\n\nThis works not only across the business teams within a Financial Institution, but also it works across the group companies. For instance, ICICI Securities would easily accept the Service Level Agreement for ICICI Bank. The same holds for an Information Security clearance and procurement clearance. Obviously, some extra formalities would be required. But you can save time from the negotiation of terms and that helps you move deals faster.\n\nWe realized this early in the journey and it worked like a charm. Customers came flowing in like crazy. People absolutely loved our product. I spent my full-day meeting customers and understanding their challenges and adding features to our product.\n\n(Select clientele)\n\nWe focused heavily on building things that our customers love. References and revenue came as a by-product. Our ChatBot platform has some fantastic features:\n\nExtremely easy to customize and build, even for Business teams.\nCan be integrated with almost all types of backend systems.\nBuilt for enterprise scale.\nStrong NLP which can interpret and understand a wide variety of customer queries.\nA deep analytics layer that shows actionable reports\n\nOn top of that, we provided fantastic support and SLA. I personally took customer calls when needed to have a full assurance that we are always by their side, be it a Saturday or a Sunday.\n\n(We help enterprises manage customer experience at scale)\n\nLater when COVID-19 happened, we added 2 new modules to our Product:\n\nLive Agent Chat: so that Bot can transfer the chat to Live Agents.\nCobrowsing: so that Sales agents can help the customers make a purchase easily.\n\nBoth these solutions got a wide acceptance among our customers. In fact, these solutions came from our customer’s problem statements. We co-created our products with our customers.\n\nAt the time of COVID, our products turned out to be a boon for our customers. The usage shot up significantly. We helped our clients digitize their contact centers in a smooth manner to Bots and Live Chat.\n\nToday, as of May 2021, we are ~85 members in the team and growing fast. While initial customer acquisition happened through the contacts and network of our advisors, we are now onboarding new customers because of the merit of our products.\n\nDuring these whole 2.5 years, my team members really worked hard and I give full credit to them for where we are today. Personally, for me as a young entrepreneur, bootstrapping to $1M at the age of 25 years is a celebration-worthy achievement. However, we have a long way to go in building a global SaaS company from India.\n\nI’d like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank the Cogno AI\n Team members, Customers, Mentors and Advisors, and also my parents. They’ve always been by our side and supported us in this journey. Without them, nothing would have been possible.\n\nI believe that while we should celebrate the small wins, we should always keep the big picture in mind — a vision of helping Businesses manage Customer Experience at Scale.\n\nI will conclude with a quote I love.\n\nHard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.2813

Vinod Mahendroo,4y,Why has WeWork had such issues with its IPO?,"Like many Unicorns (Lyft, Uber, Peloton, Doordash, Postmates), there is no clear business model to generate the kind of outsize returns promised.

There is a direct competitor which is profitable, but alas, it has a valuation of $ 4.76 B today, which just won’t do for a company like WeWork which has raised $12.8B to date, and was valued at $47B before its debacle, starting with its S-1.

WeWork has tried to present itself as a technology company, but it is a real-estate arbitrage play, buying long term commercial leases and selling short term leases to its “members” who rent “workstations”.

It is poorly run - and mostly for the benefit of one person, CEO Adam Neumann and his family/friends.

Governance is abysmal. It is insulting for investors to see the company return an egregious payment of $5.39M to the CEO (for rights to “We”), change its S-1 to show the CEO reduce his special share voting rights from 120 x to 10 x (he still maintains total control), appoint a lady who was previously a consultant on their board and say that the Board, not Mrs. Neumann will choose Mr. Neumann’s successor, and present this as an improvement in governance.

Finally, as a company that lost $2 for every $1 it got in 1H 2019 Revenue, WeWork desperately needs cash. A minimum IPO raise of $3.5B was necessary to also kick-in a $6B loan facility (for a total of $9.5B). Without it, the company will be under duress.

To complicate things, Softbank is trying to raise its Vision Fund II. Softbank has marked up the value of its investments greatly in the recent past, and with Slack, Uber and WeWork so deeply under water, it must write down the value of its Vision Fund I investments at a most inopportune time.

The Saudi PIF and Mubadala had balked at the January funding of WeWork at $47B, and are unlikely to blindly follow Mr. Son in the future into Vision Fund II.

As a result, we saw the public spectacle of Softbank trying to get WeWork to delay the IPO, and WeWork trying to get Softbank to commit to buying 20–25% of the IPO float to try to prop up the price.

I’ve answered questions on WeWork’s likely future here How do you think the WeWork IPO will play out?, and their recent governance changes here Vinod Mahendroo's answer to What do you think of WeWork’s planned significant changes to its governance in advance of its NASDAQ listing?

I haven’t seen such an egregious display of naked ambition, BS/chutzpah and greed, since … well, since Juul insisted that mango bubble gum is an adult vaping flavor.

Thank you for the a2a.

And parents, please don’t let your children grow up to be like Mr. Neumann. The startup world needs common decency and business ethics more than ever today.

Colby Lepore,4y,What is the fastest angel investment exit you have seen?,"Kevin O’leary from Shark Tank invested $75k into a company called “Wicked Cupcakes”.

Instead, they ended up selling a quarter million dollars in cupcakes over the course of that next week.

James Altucher,Updated 9y,How does venture funding work? How much money can one get through VCs?,"I'm going to explain how venture funding works in detail but it may or may not answer your question. If you have further questions, you can ask me in the comments.  First, I'm going to address technically how it works. The first question you ask which is ""What is Venture funding?""  Then I'm going to answer the second question you ask which is , ""how much can you get from venture funding?""  These are two completely separate questions but I will try and answer them both..  WHAT IS VENTURE FUNDING?  I will take a simple example and from this you will be able to figure out all the ins and outs of venture funding.  Imagine you want to set up a lemonade stand. Your company is going to attempt to sell lemonade to all the people who pass by.  Your fixed costs are:   Your table: $30  A sign and some paint: $40 Your variable costs are the amount of lemonade you will need because it will depend on demand. But you figure you will be profitable from the first week.  You figure you will need $10 worth of lemonade and that will generate 10 cups of $2 each so you will make $20 in revenues.  Which means gross profit will be $10, which you may choose to reinvest in more lemonade (if demand is high) or more signs (to create more demand).  So how much money do you need. You need at least your fixed costs ($70) plus some money for lemonade. Since you think you will be profitable in your first week you will need $10 more to buy the lemonade.  So you need $80.  You don't have it.  So you make a business plan. - You need $80 for all of the reasons above. - you have vast experience helping your cousin last year run a successful lemonade stand- 100 people a weekend will walk by your lemonade stand (you counted last weekend) and at least 10% will buy (according to how your cousin's stand worked last year) so you will make $10 a week in gross profit (see above) That means you will make $500 a year in gross profit (you live in Florida so it's hot all year round).  In other words: if you can implement your business plan, there's $500 in profits that can be shared or reinvested (perhaps you will open up other lemonade stands and hire other kids to run them).  All is good except for the fact that you need $80.  You approach your daddy and ask for ""venture funding"". It's ""venture"" because you are a venture. It's like an adventure that needs money.  It's ""funding"" because he will provide the money.  Your daddy drives a hard bargain.  He says, ""I will give you $80 but I need 50% of the company"".  This means one of two things initially:   - if you have profits in the company and want to take them out of the company then you have give him 50% of all the profits.   - if you sell the lemonade stand to your neighbor (because he would rather buy your lemonade stand than build one himself) then 50% of the proceeds go to you and 50% go to your father.  But now your father throws in some other terms.  Up until now your company has just had ""common stock"". You had 100% of the common stock. Don't worry about how many shares that means. Just know that you had 100% until this moment.  Your daddy says, ""if you sell the company for less than it takes for me to make my money back, then I am the first money out.""  This means his stock is now ""preferred"" and yours is ""common"".  This means if you sell your company for $160 he gets $80 and you get $80.  But if you sell your company for $150, then he gets $80 (the first money out) and you get $70.  If you sell your company for $60, he gets all $60 and you get $0 and probably feel bad.  He also says, ""if you raise any more money then I can keep my 50% of the company by putting in more money also."" This is called anti-dilution rights.  He also says, ""if you leave the company, then I get all my money back first."" Meaning, if you let your neighbor take over the lemonade stand, your daddy doesn't necessarily trust your neighbor so you have to figure out how to get him his money back.  This is roughly a ""change of control provision"".  He also says ""if you insult the customers, then I get to fire you."" This is a gross negligence provision.  He may also say that no major decision involving more than $50 can made without both of you approving.  ""Ok,"" you say, and you agree to everything and take in the $80. You just got venture funding and now there are two ""classes"" of stock: common (your stock) and ""Preferred A"" (your daddy's stock).  Let's say a week goes by and only 5 people bought lemonade for $2 a cup. So you ran out of lemonade and have no profits.  You need to raise another $10. You go to Daddy and he says ""NO!""  Now you go to Mommy. She does more distressed venture funding.  She agrees to the $10 but she says two things.   - ""I am the first $10 out if you sell the lemonade stand"". So now she is making her stock ""Preferred B"" which has more rights than ""Preferred A"" or Common stock.  In other words, if you sell the lemonade stand for $15, she gets her full $10 back. Your daddy only gets $5 back of the $80 he put in. And you get $0.  She also says she wants 50% of the company for her $10. She's what's called a ""vulture capitalist"" behind her back.  This means that if the company is sold, she gets 50% of the company, your daddy gets 25% and you get 25%. Same as if you distribute profits: 50% / 25% / 25%.  So, even in this simple example you have to make sure of several things:   - you measure demand correctly (not so easy) - you measure what your fixed costs are correctly - you measure what your variable costs are correctly - you determine what your selling points are about yourself - you try to foresee how much of the company you are willing to give up so that it's still worth it to you.   - you understand everything a venture capitalist might ask for that maybe you can negotiate.  For instance, maybe you could've have said to Daddy that since you were going to make $500 a year in profits maybe it would be unfair to give him 50% of the company for $80. He could say ""Screw you"" but then you can go to your best friend's dad and show him the same business plan and get more than one venture funder to consider funding your lemonade stand.  Always good to diversify the people go to for venture funding.  Now, I will answer your second question. I hope the above was helpful.  HOW MUCH VENTURE FUNDING CAN YOU GET?  I indirectly answered this above but I will add a little more color here.  Having just an idea will get you nothing. Chances are you need to have a sense of demand. If you are in an old-fashioned business (lemonade stand, laundromat, McDonalds franchise, etc) then this is easier.  If you are in a business that has never been done before then answer these questions:  - Urgency: how urgent is the need for the product you would like to create- Unique: is anyone else doing it and why is yours better- Useful: Does this solve a real problem- Ultra-specific: How does your solution work- User-Friendly: What does the venture capitalist get for his money. You want to make it easy for him or her to say yes. - Unquestionable Proof: proof that your product is as good as you say it is.  If you haven't created the product yet and have no customers then that final ""U"" is going to be very difficult. Then you aren't being very ""user-friendly"", i.e. you are making it difficult for the venture funder to say ""yes"". And without a product, in a brand-new industry, you will have a hard time measuring the urgency (demand) of that product.  And if you haven't created the product you might have a hard time understanding what the fixed and variable costs are. Making it difficult to make a business plan, making it even more difficult for a venture capitalist to say yes.  This answers half of your question. If you can do the above then you are starting to be in a position where you can ask for money.  But how much?  This is more art than science. If it were science, everyone would be filthy rich.  But most people go broke investing in ventures.  Once you have a sense of all of the above you can use the same math as in the lemonade stand example to determine what your company is worth.  Ultimately a company is worth ONLY the amount of cash it will generate from now until the end of time.  But it's hard to predict the future.  Typically, a company will attempt to predict three or four years in the future how much profit it could generate and then discount that by anywhere from 50% to 75% or more in order to give the venture capitalist a reasonable deal, given that you can't really predict the future.  Often, though, companies are not profitable in the first three years.  So even though the only way to value a company is on the basis of its future (but unpredictable) cash flows, there is another way you can try to convince venture capitalists to invest.  You look at similar companies and how much money they raised when they were at your similar state.  For instance, your cousin's lemonade stand might've gotten $200 for 30% of the company.  And your daddy can say, ""but his corner was twice as busy"".  And you can say, ""but I have higher quality lemonade"".  And so on. That's a negotiation. Which is another topic.  I think this answers both of your questions so now I will give advice.  ADVICE: - build a product. Even if you have to do it over years while at a full time job so you are only working on the side. - get customers- get feedback on your product. - try to scale and get more customers.  This gets you a sense of demand, gives you experience on the costs, and lets you build a product people can see instead of just imagine.  Now go out and raise a whole lot of money and get really rich.

Then I\'m going to answer the second question you ask which is , ""how much can you get from venture funding?""  These are two completely separate questions but I will try and answer them both..  WHAT IS VENTURE FUNDING?  I will take a simple example and from this you will be able to figure out all the ins and outs of venture funding.  Imagine you want to set up a lemonade stand. Your company is going to attempt to sell lemonade to all the people who pass by.  Your fixed costs are:   Your table: $30  A sign and some paint: $40 Your variable costs are the amount of lemonade you will need because it will depend on demand. But you figure you will be profitable from the first week.  You figure you will need $10 worth of lemonade and that will generate 10 cups of $2 each so you will make $20 in revenues.  Which means gross profit will be $10, which you may choose to reinvest in more lemonade (if demand is high) or more signs (to create more demand).  So how much money do you need. You need at least your fixed costs ($70) plus some money for lemonade. Since you think you will be profitable in your first week you will need $10 more to buy the lemonade.  So you need $80.  You don\'t have it.  So you make a business plan. - You need $80 for all of the reasons above. - you have vast experience helping your cousin last year run a successful lemonade stand- 100 people a weekend will walk by your lemonade stand (you counted last weekend) and at least 10% will buy (according to how your cousin\'s stand worked last year) so you will make $10 a week in gross profit (see above) That means you will make $500 a year in gross profit (you live in Florida so it\'s hot all year round).  In other words: if you can implement your business plan, there\'s $500 in profits that can be shared or reinvested (perhaps you will open up other lemonade stands and hire other kids to run them).  All is good except for the fact that you need $80.  You approach your daddy and ask for ""venture funding"". It\'s ""venture"" because you are a venture. It\'s like an adventure that needs money.  It\'s ""funding"" because he will provide the money.  Your daddy drives a hard bargain.  He says, ""I will give you $80 but I need 50% of the company"".  This means one of two things initially:   - if you have profits in the company and want', 'result': {'fake': 0.7224, 'real': 0.2776}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'to take them out of the company then you have give him 50% of all the profits.   - if you sell the lemonade stand to your neighbor (because he would rather buy your lemonade stand than build one himself) then 50% of the proceeds go to you and 50% go to your father.  But now your father throws in some other terms.  Up until now your company has just had ""common stock"". You had 100% of the common stock. Don\'t worry about how many shares that means. Just know that you had 100% until this moment.  Your daddy says, ""if you sell the company for less than it takes for me to make my money back, then I am the first money out.""  This means his stock is now ""preferred"" and yours is ""common"".  This means if you sell your company for $160 he gets $80 and you get $80.  But if you sell your company for $150, then he gets $80 (the first money out) and you get $70.  If you sell your company for $60, he gets all $60 and you get $0 and probably feel bad.  He also says, ""if you raise any more money then I can keep my 50% of the company by putting in more money also."" This is called anti-dilution rights.  He also says, ""if you leave the company, then I get all my money back first."" Meaning, if you let your neighbor take over the lemonade stand, your daddy doesn\'t necessarily trust your neighbor so you have to figure out how to get him his money back.  This is roughly a ""change of control provision"".  He also says ""if you insult the customers, then I get to fire you."" This is a gross negligence provision.  He may also say that no major decision involving more than $50 can made without both of you approving.  ""Ok,"" you say, and you agree to everything and take in the $80. You just got venture funding and now there are two ""classes"" of stock: common (your stock) and ""Preferred A"" (your daddy\'s stock).  Let\'s say a week goes by and only 5 people bought lemonade for $2 a cup. So you ran out of lemonade and have no profits.  You need to raise another $10. You go to Daddy and he says ""NO!""  Now you go to Mommy. She does more distressed venture funding.  She agrees to the $10 but she says two things.   - ""I am the first $10 out if you sell the lemonade stand"". So now she is making her stock ""Preferred B"" which has more rights than ""Preferred A"" or Common stock.  In other words, if you sell the lemonade stand for $15, she gets her full $10 back. Your daddy only gets $5 back of the $80 he put in. And you get $0.  She also says she wants 50% of the company for her $10. She\'s what\'s called a', 'result': {'fake': 0.3498, 'real': 0.6502}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': '""vulture capitalist"" behind her back.  This means that if the company is sold, she gets 50% of the company, your daddy gets 25% and you get 25%. Same as if you distribute profits: 50% / 25% / 25%.  So, even in this simple example you have to make sure of several things:   - you measure demand correctly (not so easy) - you measure what your fixed costs are correctly - you measure what your variable costs are correctly - you determine what your selling points are about yourself - you try to foresee how much of the company you are willing to give up so that it\'s still worth it to you.   - you understand everything a venture capitalist might ask for that maybe you can negotiate.  For instance, maybe you could\'ve have said to Daddy that since you were going to make $500 a year in profits maybe it would be unfair to give him 50% of the company for $80. He could say ""Screw you"" but then you can go to your best friend\'s dad and show him the same business plan and get more than one venture funder to consider funding your lemonade stand.  Always good to diversify the people go to for venture funding.  Now, I will answer your second question. I hope the above was helpful.  HOW MUCH VENTURE FUNDING CAN YOU GET?  I indirectly answered this above but I will add a little more color here.  Having just an idea will get you nothing. Chances are you need to have a sense of demand. If you are in an old-fashioned business (lemonade stand, laundromat, McDonalds franchise, etc) then this is easier.  If you are in a business that has never been done before then answer these questions:  - Urgency: how urgent is the need for the product you would like to create- Unique: is anyone else doing it and why is yours better- Useful: Does this solve a real problem- Ultra-specific: How does your solution work- User-Friendly: What does the venture capitalist get for his money. You want to make it easy for him or her to say yes. - Unquestionable Proof: proof that your product is as good as you say it is.  If you haven\'t created the product yet and have no customers then that final ""U"" is going to be very difficult. Then you aren\'t being very ""user-friendly"", i.e. you are making it difficult for the venture funder to say ""yes"". And without a product, in a brand-new industry, you will have a hard time measuring the urgency (demand) of that product.

Kip Wheeler,Updated 1y,Why is the word “i” capitalized?,"Because of medieval calligraphy.

When scribes wrote up-and-down vertical strokes, medieval calligraphy usually had thick vertical components of each letter and very thin, spidery horizontal components connecting the others. The vertical strokes are called minims in scholar-talk.

The problem is that several letter combinations involving i, m, n, and u tend to be very difficult to read. You can end up with multiple half-line minims in rapid sequence. Letter combinations like “minim” as a word itself has ten downward strokes in a row.

Here’s a visual illustration:

This Latin text reads “mimi numinum niuium minimi munium nimium uini muniminum imminui uiui minimum uolunt.”

You can see how the letter i could easily get lost in such a combination, especially with sloppy handwriting or very small letters.

So, medieval scribes basically had at least three options (and at various times, did all three either solo or in conjunction with others).

First, you can take the most common vowel sound and put a big, visible dot over it (technically, this is called a jot, from the word iota, though see comments below this answer about tittle as another related phrase). That’s why we dot our i’s.
Second, you can take the vertical stroke of the letter i and extend it below the line of writing to give it a tail. (Hence, the letters j and y are born).
Third, you can switch the lower-case i to a capital I, so it stands out visibly.

In most words, the dot or the extended tail became our standard solution. In the case of Middle English, I by itself is our most common pronoun, so the letter I was especially common as a standalone word. (You can contrast that with the Old English first-person singular pronoun iċ, our ancestor of I; since it also included the letter c, the OE iċ was rarely capitalized.)

So, rule #3 became the custom to distinguish this pronoun/letter, since it’s hard to make out the sense of the sentence in English if you can’t spot the subject. That custom became most widespread, and thus the capitalization of “I” was necessary.

That wasn’t as urgent in languages in which the first-person pronoun contains multiple letters, as French je, Spanish yo, and Latin ego have at least two letters, and thus are more legible in calligraphy. Additionally, their first person pronouns have final letters that are not singular minims, which also makes them more visible in medieval calligraphy. Finally, many of these languages had a grammar in which the verb alone was sufficient to indicate a subject was singular first-person, and thus they could omit the subject entirely.

So, these other languages kept their first-person pronouns uncapitalized. They had no need to do otherwise.

Addendum: A throng of readers in the comments have been sending me proposed Google Translations of the Latin and asking if the Google translation is correct, or just asking about the meaning of the lines.

The passage itself isn’t probably meant to be completely sensible—it’s just a medieval scribe going nuts with words to create minims, stringing together an unlikely combination. It’s a mock sentence. Different scholars try to decipher it different ways. One paleography textbook translates it as follows:

The very short mimes of the gods of snow do not at all wish that during their lifetime the very great burden of (distributing) the wine of the walls to be lightened.

Alternatively, (and I think less well), Wikipedia translates the lines as follows in their “Paleography” entry:

The smallest mimes of the gods of snow do not at all wish that in their lives that the great duty of the defences of the wine be diminished.

The quotation comes from the text of a personal miscellany, a collection of lyrics, phrases and florilegia in 13th century France, MS IV 524 Bl.3 recto at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library.

Karen X. Cheng,10y,What is it like to be rejected by Y Combinator?,"You don't hear about this side of things much, huh? It's not news. News is when so-and-so raised a $15 million round from Sequoia-this or Andreessen-that.

Yesterday, we had an interview with Y-Combinator for our video startup, 100
. We just had a pretty good launch earlier in the week. My co-founder Finbarr is more reserved than I am — he doesn’t like to count his chickens before they hatch. But me, I had practically made myself a chicken sandwich. We’d get in for sure!

A little embarrassing to admit, but I’d already started writing my self-congratulatory Facebook status in my head. “So excited to announce that 100 has been accepted into the next batch of Y-Combinator,” I’d say.

Then at 8pm: we got our rejection email.

Ugh.

Here’s the Facebook status that went out instead:

So excited to announce that we had our YC interview today and
…didn’t get in.




You only hear about people when they succeed huh? I’m way guilty of this too. Only posting the good news on Facebook. Painting an artificially glossy version of my life.




But I better start practicing what I preach. Show my mistakes. Don’t be ashamed of failure. Be proud I tried my hardest. Fall 7 times, get up 8.




YC gave us some good, actionable feedback in their rejection email. They even challenged us to prove them wrong. I appreciate that.




Challenge accepted.


Then a cool thing started happening. One by one, people left comments about how they’d failed before. Joel Gascoigne from Buffer
 wrote how they didn’t get into YC — they didn’t even get an interview. People told me about other YC founders who didn’t get in on their first try. Drew Houston from Dropbox is one of them.

Overall, Silicon Valley is pretty good about embracing failure. Here, it’s not taboo to say you started a business and it failed. I don’t know anywhere else like that.
But that’s easy to forget when we see shiny headlines on TechCrunch. We’re only seeing a brief moment of glory. We don’t see the self doubt, the lost sleep. The dozens — sometimes hundreds — of rejections from investors.

We’re good at embracing failure — but we could be better. Do the scarier thing. When we stop hiding our failure, we stop fearing it.

The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.

Terrence Yang,Updated 7y,What are the hardest or most valuable lessons investors learn as they become more experienced?,"1. If you are not sure who the fool is in a trade or complicated investment, there is likely a fool and that fool is likely to be you.

Note: Investments are often different. ht David Kressel

2. If it's complicated, the salesperson is making a lot of money off you.

3. Annual fees, short term capital gains and losses, and performance fees can wreak havoc on returns.

4. Trust folks like John Bogle and Charlie Munger. Trust but verify just about everyone else.

5. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

6. On average, asset allocation accounts for 90% of your returns.

7. Protect your downside risk. Invest with a margin of safety, use stop limits, buy puts, etc.

8. Cut your losses early and often.

9. Read Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger.

10. Glamour investments like Tesla stock are expensive. Instead, get a Tesla car. Its cheaper.

11. Most venture capital funds and hedge funds are not great at beating the market. Most can't even beat the S&P 500 or Russell 2000 over time.

12. The market is a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run.

13. Either diversify and index or be sure of your bets and go big when the opportunity strikes.

14. Avoid investing in things you don't understand.

15. Get it in writing.

16. Don't buy stuff the salesperson doesn't buy himself or herself.

17. Don't invest in illiquid ETFs or stocks. You will move the market against you when you build up your position. And when you sell.

18. Salespeople in finance are often disguised as product managers, business development, client services, etc. Be careful.

19. No, you are not going to beat Goldman Sachs and Bridgewater at their game, so stop day trading and trying to predict macro trends.

I worked on Wall Street for many years. The smartest people tended to be proprietary traders. Each time you trade, there is a good chance they are on the other side, picking you off.

20. If you don't know what you're doing, buy some Vanguard index funds or Berkshire Hathaway stock.

21. If you get inside information, it's either illegal or wrong. Don't trade on it. I had an ex-M&A banker from a top i-bank tip me off once. A good friend, too. I didn't trade on this.

22. Just because a company is great doesn't mean you should buy its stock. The stock may be not be a great deal.

23. Uncorrelated assets are often just another way for salespeople to make a huge profit off of you.

24. Understand what you are signing before you sign it. At Merrill Lynch I cut their investor letters on certain types of deals from about 15 pages to 2.

I made sure the terms were just as, if not more, favorable to Merrill. Pretty plain English.

Never got sued on any deal I worked on, out of hundreds if not thousands of deals and hundreds of billions in principal amount.

25. Don't buy annuities. There are much cheaper alternatives. Annuities are quite complicated to model and value for most people. Annuities look simple (7% for life, etc.) And they are a product the salesperson can get away with selling at high margin. Someone's making high margins off you when you buy, when you sell and every year you own it.

26. A particular stock or market can be overvalued or undervalued for several years at a time. Be patient.

27. Stop watching CNBC and Bloomberg unless you are a good proprietary trader.

28. A quick way to financial ruin is to day trade products you can't price and model, like futures, options. Another way is to trade on margin.

29. Most folks in the retail and high net worth financial space do not add much value. Some subtract a lot of value. Be careful. If you have doubts, just go to Vanguard. They take money at all levels, not just retail, so if you have $1m plus or $5m plus you will get good service.

30. If you can't hold an investment for at least a year, do the trade out of your retirement account to reduce taxes.

31. Investing can be hard and humbling, but trading is far worse. Either way, you have to know when to buy AND when to sell every time and then do it.

32. Investing and trading are completely different. Most people have no business trading. At all.

In trading, there's no intramural league. The pros are everywhere, picking you off and taking advantage of your less superior trading skills.

In investing, the intramural league is index funds. Admit you can't beat the market. So match it. After expenses and 40 years, your index fund will beat 99% of managed funds in the same sector.

On Wall Street smart traders screwed up all the time, losing hundreds of millions, billions.

Yes, they got fired.

But then they usually got jobs at another bank.

What are you going to do when you lose 80-100% of your net worth?

33. Sell when others are greedy. Buy when others are fearful.

In 2011, many investors freaked out over Greece and the Fed's money printing. So they bought gold, sold stocks.

I bought lots of Berkshire Hathaway then.

34. Don't dwell on your losses and mistakes. Learn from them and move on. Next.

35. Avoid leverage until you know what you are doing. Or if you are buying real estate and can take full advantage of the mortgage interest rate deduction. I would only borrow if you don't need the money.

36. Dollar cost average. It's hard to time the market, so set up an automatic purchase of the same amount, e.g., $100, each week or month and build up your portfolio.

37. If you read this far, thank you. I saved the best for last. Compounding is a powerful friend or enemy. Make it your friend.

If you are borrowing money, compound interest can be a killer.

If you are investing, you have no better friend than compounding. Especially if you invest early in life.

Understand what you are signing before you sign it. At Merrill Lynch I cut their investor letters on certain types of deals from about 15 pages to 2.\n\nI made sure the terms were just as, if not more, favorable to Merrill. Pretty plain English.\n\nNever got sued on any deal I worked on, out of hundreds if not thousands of deals and hundreds of billions in principal amount.\n\n25. Don't buy annuities. There are much cheaper alternatives. Annuities are quite complicated to model and value for most people. Annuities look simple (7% for life, etc.) And they are a product the salesperson can get away with selling at high margin. Someone's making high margins off you when you buy, when you sell and every year you own it.\n\n26. A particular stock or market can be overvalued or undervalued for several years at a time. Be patient.\n\n27. Stop watching CNBC and Bloomberg unless you are a good proprietary trader.\n\n28. A quick way to financial ruin is to day trade products you can't price and model, like futures, options. Another way is to trade on margin.\n\n29. Most folks in the retail and high net worth financial space do not add much value. Some subtract a lot of value. Be careful. If you have doubts, just go to Vanguard. They take money at all levels, not just retail, so if you have $1m plus or $5m plus you will get good service.\n\n30. If you can't hold an investment for at least a year, do the trade out of your retirement account to reduce taxes.\n\n31. Investing can be hard and humbling, but trading is far worse. Either way, you have to know when to buy AND when to sell every time and then do it.\n\n32. Investing and trading are completely different. Most people have no business trading. At all.\n\nIn trading, there's no intramural league. The pros are everywhere, picking you off and taking advantage of your less superior trading skills.\n\nIn investing, the intramural league is index funds. Admit you can't beat the market. So match it. After expenses and 40 years, your index fund will beat 99% of managed funds in the same sector.\n\nOn Wall Street smart traders screwed up all the time, losing hundreds of millions, billions.\n\nYes, they got fired.\n\nBut then they usually got jobs at another bank.\n\nWhat are you going to do when you lose 80-100% of your net worth?\n\n33. Sell when others are greedy. Buy when others are fearful.\n\nIn 2011, many investors freaked out over Greece and the Fed's money printing. So they bought gold, sold stocks.\n\nI bought lots of Berkshire Hathaway then.\n\n34. Don't dwell on your losses and mistakes. Learn from them and move on. Next.\n\n35. Avoid leverage until you know what you are doing. Or if you are buying real estate and can take full advantage of the mortgage interest rate deduction. I would only borrow if you don't need the money.\n\n36. Dollar cost average. It's hard to time the market, so set up an automatic purchase of the same amount, e.g., $100, each week or month and build up your portfolio.\n\n37. If you read this far, thank you. I saved the best for last. Compounding is a powerful friend or enemy. Make it your friend.\n\nIf you are borrowing money, compound interest can be a killer.\n\nIf you are investing, you have no better friend than compounding. Especially if you invest early in life.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nFeedback wanted. Biased. Not for reproduction. Not my final answer. Not advice. Don’t rely."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.35676666666667

Asim Qureshi,5y,What are all the different kinds of investors?,"Based on my experience there are two kinds of investors.

One kind invests a small amount of money but it's a large proportion of their total assets. If things go wrong they will be calling you every few weeks to subtly harass you. I guess it could get worse but I've never been there.

The other kind invests a large amount of money but it's a small proportion of their asset base. If things go wrong, as long as you haven't screwed them, they don't really care - they win some, they lose some.

Rachel Ryan,9mo,Is it better to be a venture capitalist or an entrepreneur?,"I believe that there isn’t a clear cut answer to this question as both venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have their advantages and disadvantages.

It really depends on what type of person you are and which venture you’re looking to pursue.

As a venture capitalist, you will have the opportunity to invest in many different projects and help guide their progress from the sidelines.

This carries many benefits such as a steady income, less risk, and the ability to maneuver the investments for maximum financial reward.

However, you won’t have the opportunity to develop ideas on your own and will be relying on the success of others.

On the other hand, being an entrepreneur is a much more involved role.

You’re able to develop your own projects and create something from the ground up.

This will give you the chance to innovate, be your own boss, and have direct control over what you create.

The downside is that you’re taking on the majority of the risk, and the rewards are only realized if the venture is successful.

At the end of the day, the decision to be a venture capitalist or an entrepreneur comes down to personal preference and skill set.

Do you have the drive and creativity to risk it all and take on the challenge of being an entrepreneur or would you rather take a more passive role and invest in other’s ideas?

Pedro Miranda,4y,What's your opinion on WeWork slashing its IPO valuation from $47 B to less than $25 B? What according to you is the fair valuation?,"Wall St is calling bullshit on Silicon Valley.

In the private markets anything can fly, but in public markets it is very different.

Public markets don’t give a flying F*ck that a “founder-run startup wants to change the world”. They want a company that makes money and meets quarterly goals.

What’s cute and admired in Silicon Valley is ridiculed by Wall Street.

SNAP: Hi. I’m a camera company.

Silicon Valley: Bravo! bravissimo!

Wall St: F U

This is what is happening with WeWork. This is a real estate company - not a tech company. WeWork has a nice product and uses technology to improve the user experience so it probably is worth a premium over other real estate companies as Jeremy Arnold pointed out. But there is a limit to the premium.

The problem with most unicorns is that they will never get to their private valuations. And as they grow very large like WeWork, Uber, Etc it is very hard to exit via acquisition. The only route is the public markets.

Why is this a problem? Because you are selling to a different audience.

It is way easier for a founder to sell his company to one of the existing large tech companies at a good valuation than IPO. Very likely the VC that backed the founder also has seats on the board, influence over M&A decisions, and are all drinking the same kool aid.

So if you want to change the world stay in the Silicon Valley ecosystem.

On Wall St, the world will change you.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4xlgd60zwv2c9k37', 'title': ""What's your opinion on WeWork slashing its IPO valuation from $47 B to less than $25 B?

Wade Myers,Updated 6y,What are the most ridiculous things VCs have said to you?,"Story #1:

Year: 2000
Status: 6 months into launch, $3m in Revenue
Setting: Phone conversation with one of the biggest VC brands in Silicon Valley, pitching a $25m Series A
Attribution: From one of the Managing General Partners:

“We’d love to invest, but you would need to move your company – or at least your headquarters – to Silicon Valley, ideally within a few blocks of our office. I don’t want to travel to board meetings.”

The rest of the story: I wasn’t willing to split up the company and disrupt my life/family just to get a sexy VC brand on board and make life easy for him. I moved on and kept pitching.

Story #2:

Year: 2000
Status: 12 months into launch, $6m in Revenue
Setting: The first board meeting after closing a $25m Series A
Attribution: From one of the two board members from the NYC VC that led the round:

“Now that you have us on your team, you never have to worry about raising capital. We will fund whatever you need. Given that, you need to move a lot faster. You need to open offices around the world and you need 500 employees. Then we can IPO.”

The rest of the story: Two months later they committed to leading another $50m round, but then pulled out. I got a term sheet from another VC and brought it to the board for approval, but he told me to turn it down (it was from a competitor) and that he would lead after all. One month later, he again pulled out. We found another lead and finally got a $45m deal done, but it was quite a ride.

Story #3:

Year: 2002
Status: Planning stage
Setting: Had already had two day-long meetings with an Austin-based VC for the seed funding and they were presenting their Term Sheet for $10m of funding, which looked nothing like we had discussed, nor were the terms what they had indicated the Term Sheet would include. They emailed me the Term Sheet five minutes before our scheduled call.
Attribution: From the Managing General Partner of the firm in a profanity-laced rant when I told him the Term Sheet didn’t reflect the deal terms we had discussed:

“You’ve been playing in the minor leagues up until now. We are the major leagues and the 900-pound gorilla in Texas. This is the deal we are offering, so take it or leave it. By the way, it would be the biggest mistake of your career if you turn us down. You would regret that the rest of your life.”

The rest of the story: I turned them down only to have him swear at me profusely about what an idiot I was for saying no. I calmly told him that he had provided me all of the input I needed for my decision and that I did not need more time to think about it. I got seed funding from another firm that was very friendly to work with.

Story #4:

Year: 2003
Status: $500k of seed funding in place (see above), ready to fully launch
Setting: Pitching a Boston-based VC to co-invest with my seed investor in a $5m Series A
Attribution: From the Managing General Partner of the firm:

“I don’t like it that you have equity in a couple of other startups. I don’t want you to have any other upside except for this deal – I basically want to own you financially.”

The rest of the story: I ended the meeting and left. My next pitch was a few blocks away to another Boston VC firm that went well with very friendly partners that ended up investing.

Lessons learned: Life is short and startups are stressful. Taking money from a VC is like a five to ten year marriage with lots of ups and downs and you don’t want to be married to idiots or jerks.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yvlino3x7gde2cmw', 'title': 'What are the most ridiculous things VCs have said to you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9251, 'ai': 0.0749}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Story #1:\n\nYear: 2000\nStatus: 6 months into launch, $3m in Revenue\nSetting: Phone conversation with one of the biggest VC brands in Silicon Valley, pitching a $25m Series A\nAttribution: From one of the Managing General Partners:\n\n“We’d love to invest, but you would need to move your company – or at least your headquarters – to Silicon Valley, ideally within a few blocks of our office.

Aviral Bhatnagar,5y,How was your selection process at Guild Capital during IIM Ahmedabad placements?,"Venture capital is a very niche industry with very limited roles, and it is pretty hard to break into.

In my 5th semester at IIM Ahmedabad, most folks go on exchange and course curriculum is quite light. I had almost 2 months free at hand and I thought it might make sense to get some experience on the VC side.

I did a cold reach out to the Guild team for doing a short internship and they got me on board. After a good 6 weeks, I had a discussion with my (now) boss about how I was thinking of my future. He mentioned that it might make sense to get some experience at a top tier consulting firm before joining a VC firm. I mentioned to him that the BSchool experience was a good substitute for consulting, and I had always been excited about VC.

As I went back to campus and was looking at investment banking and consulting opportunities, Guild made me an offer to join. I had a problem of plenty - and of limited data points to decide. Given that I had no work experience, I would be taking a leap of faith with virtually any decision I took. Venture capital seemed exciting, working in small teams always attracted me and I wanted to be close to entrepreneurs.

I took up the Guild offer and opted out of the placement process. Given that Guild didn’t recruit from campus, I technically did not get placed from IIM Ahmedabad. Most of my friends were quite surprised, because I was the only one in my entire batch doing something like this.

Aviral Bhatnagar,6y,How would you explain venture capital to a 10 year old?,"Let’s say you’ve just started running a lemonade stand.

You’ve been living in an area where you know a lot of kids your age, and a lot of them said that they like lemonade. You decide that you would make them lemonade, and learnt how to from your mother. You get lemons, water, sugar and salt from home - and got some jugs and glasses as well. You’ve now setup your lemonade stand in your area!

Your lemonade sells for 10 Rupees (16 cents), while the shopkeeper sells you stuff to make 100 glasses of lemonade for 800 Rupees, so you end up making 200 Rupees for the first 100 glasses! The first few kids come and have your lemonade - they say it’s awesome! Soon the awesomeness of your lemonade spreads, and there are many, many kids near your lemonade stand.

You need to start buying more lemons, sugar, glasses! You only have 200 rupees, but you need to spend 1600 Rs for the things to make 200 glasses! You don’t have the money, so you ask your Dad to give you 1600 Rs. You tell him that in exchange for his 1600 Rs, for every 100 rupees you earn - you will give your Dad 20 Rupees. Your Dad likes your enterprising nature, and agrees. Soon your lemonade stand becomes even more popular, and you sell in more areas. You get along a few more friends and give them some of the money to help you.

Now let’s look at how this translates to venture capital:

People like Lemonade: A market exists for a product
Lemonade Stand: Your startup or a young company
Lemonade: This is your product
Mom’s Lemonade: This is the technology to build the product
Love your Lemonade: This is called product market fit
More Lemonade: This is your company’s growth
Spend More than Earned: This is because you are growing but don’t have money to meet demand, you need to be funded
Dad: A smart venture capitalist who wants to fund your growth
Dad’s %age of Earning: This is like equity in your company, because you don’t have money to give the venture capitalist immediately

Venture capital is an exciting business, and you’re always learning what works. Especially when you’re selling lemonade!

Jason M. Lemkin,Updated 11mo,Why do venture capitalist take board seats?,"It took me a while to figure this out.

When I started writing venture (vs. angel) checks, the last thing I wanted to do was take another Bored (sic) Seat.

As a CEO/founder, I saw board meetings as important accountability sessions, for me and especially the team, but beyond that, viewed them as a time sink. Very few of my VCs as a founder ever added any “value” that I could see.

Then, as a founder-turned-investor, I viewed my job as helping. And getting out of the way. Not being a critic at a board meeting. And certainly not being anyone’s “boss”.

And so I felt for over a year. Every board meeting as an investor just felt like a tax on my time. I even tried to structure deals so I wouldn’t have to be the one on the board, so my co-investor would be instead.

And then … I saw the ramifications:

A start-up that has raised > $1m needs external accountability. Companies without a financial investor on the board more often I’d hoped and expected do … odd things … with the money. This is just too much money to have zero checks and balances on. At least a checkpoint.
Investing is kind of scary. There need to be controls. If I am giving you $25k personally, c’est la vie. But if I am giving you $2,500,000 … there’s a lot of trust in that. You know what solidifies trust? A board seat. Belt and suspenders, perhaps. But really — it’s a control. Money needs controls. In any organization. Without them, even best case, lots of stress ensues unless the company is minting cash.
One investor has to carry the weight of the “next round”. That has to be one investor that carries the weight. That gets the next round done. That is the social proof for the next round (beyond the company itself). And that leverages her social capital to get it done. Companies without a strong lead investor and board member have a much harder time getting the next round done on good terms, and in the right way.
A “bad” board member can cause some harm. Bad board members can do harm. A bad lead board member can make recruiting, fundraising, and many other things much harder. So it’s worth stepping up in those situations.

Fast forward today, I have my own $70m fund. Now I’m responsible for the whole thing. Not just a small piece of someone else’s fund.

My stress level has gone up as a result (a good thing). And you know how I sleep at night?

A board seat.

Anthony Zarrella,5y,"Former Young & Rubicam head, Peter Georgescu, has written that capitalism is ""killing America"" by caring for investors over everyone else. Do you agree?","“Former Young & Rubicam head, Peter Georgescu, has written that capitalism is ""killing America"" by caring for investors over everyone else. Do you agree?”

I agree, in most part, with what Georgescu actually wrote—which was not that “capitalism is killing America.”

What he wrote was that the myopic focus on short-term shareholder value is causing an implosion of corporate America, because the drive to “produce value” for those shareholders is deterring both reinvestment in the company itself and also investment in the workforce and the community.

He argued that the heyday of capitalism was in the post-war era, in which corporations focused on customers, employees, company growth, and community investment all before shareholder value… and shareholders did well anyway, because investing in the first four produced a stronger, more profitable company.

And I agree wholeheartedly.

As the article details, a lot of what corporations do today to maximize shareholder value is not actually improving profits, but merely using bookkeeping gimmicks to funnel a larger share of the profits to shareholders. The stock market now drives corporate America, rather than the other way around.

I, on the other hand, grew up literally smack in the middle of the growth of a start-up business from a one-man shop in a basement to a 40+ employee business with national and even international contracts. Some of my earliest memories of my father working were literally him sitting at a typewriter in my grandparents’ basement—and now Research Results, Inc. has contracts to do the lion’s share of survey work for companies like CVS and NBC.

Now, we don’t have shareholders—at least, not publicly-traded shares. But from 1987 to today, RRI has always put priorities in exactly the order Georgescu recommends:

Customers
Employees
Company Growth
Community
Then investors (i.e., mostly my father)

And the “investor” has made out quite well on the deal—far better than he ever could have if he’d focused on profits from the outset.

I don’t pretend that what works for a 40-person business will work unchanged for a national or multinational corporation with thousands of employees and possibly millions of stockholders.

But the principle is sound.

Satisfy your customers, and they’ll stay loyal even if competitors manage to undercut you. And they’ll bring more customers, too.
Treat your employees like valued assets (or even like family, if the corporate structure permits), and they’ll work much harder for you than their contract demands, and stick around long past the point where they get a “better” offer somewhere else.
Invest in the company, because you can’t move forward by sitting still and spinning your wheels.
Invest in the community, for more reasons than I can count, but among them:
Reputation, which drives new customer relationships
Good relationship with local regulators
Better life for locals means more time and/or money to spend on your products/services
And then, if you’ve done all that, you’ll have a business that pays its investors. Maybe they won’t make staggeringly huge, OMGWTFBBQ levels of return on investment—but those returns will be stable and reliable, not a white-collar roulette wheel.

Of course, I’m not saying, or even suggesting, that companies should be forced to act in this manner. It’s their money—if they want to continue pumping their profit bubble until it bursts, that’s their business.

But I agree that they’d be wiser not to—and that we’d all be better off.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rpxg2d9hkwlv60jz', 'title': 'Former Young & Rubicam head, Peter Georgescu, has written that capitalism is ""killing America"" by caring for investors over everyone else.

Jason M. Lemkin,Updated 1y,How difficult is to become a venture capitalist after 45?,"It can be harder than you might think. Time becomes your enemy. Because venture capital … is sloooow.

The further you are along in your career, the easier it is to have the time, networks and personal capital to be an investor. No question.

And it can take a decade or more to make any real money from investing. It’s hard to have a way to do that, for most of us, at 21. We just don’t have the resources, the background, or the network.

So one might think 45 or so is sort of the perfect age to start. Imagine you’d built a successful company or two, still had tons of energy but enough zen and experience to prefer to help others at the next stage.

That all makes sense. 45 is a great time to transition to helping the next generation, if you were fortunate enough to have success earlier than that. Maybe the best time of all for that transition.

The “problem” though is the length of venture capital funds:

VC funds these days last 12–14 years. It used to be 10, but with companies waiting longer to IPO, funds often last a dozen or more years.
You really need to commit to being a partner in 3 funds. This is what the Limited Partners (the ones that invest in VC funds) expect. And it’s also probably what it takes to get good at it.
So, 12 years per fund, with a 3 year gap between each fundraise … equals an 18–20+ year commitment.

Do you want to make a 20 year commitment to investing at 45?

First, are you sure you still want to do it at 65? Let’s assume you are. But really … many folks aren’t that committed all the way to 65. It’s a competitive job. Technology changes a lot over two decades. Are you really committed to keeping up? To going to every demo day for the next 20 years? For begging 20 year old founders to let you into hot deals … when you are 60?

But assuming you are OK committing to 65 … now imagine at 45 you are a successful founder and made say $25m in your start-ups. A lot!

Now, you invest for 20 years, a total of 3 funds of $150m each with 3 partners. So that’s $450m invested. And assume the funds in total do 2x net of fees (top 25% performance). So the funds make $900m+ gross returns (not easy) and a $450m profit (after the $450m invested). 20% of that profit generally goes to the partners. That’s $90m to the partners. Which at first, sounds like a lot.

But … it’s split at least 3 ways, with some also to non-partners. So assume each partner makes $25m. But remember, that’s over 20 years. So that’s $1.25m a year over 20 years (with a lot of that backloaded). Yes, a lot. But not that much compared to the $25m you made from your successful start-ups. And it takes … 20 years! And … you probably aren’t the CEO anymore, if it isn't your fund.

If you have no success yet, that $1.25m could indeed be incredible. But if you made 10x-20x or more than that already … is it worth it? Especially all the headaches, the dramas, the VC politics, and all that?

So 45 can be a great time to start, the perfect time to start.

But also a tough time to start.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2wayhzpxe9fodn05', 'title': 'How difficult is to become a venture capitalist after 45?', 'score': {'original': 0.5185, 'ai': 0.4815}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""It can be harder than you might think.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 3y,How can you tell whether a new entrepreneur will make it or not?,"“What are you doing, Luigi?” Mario asked.

“I’m starting my e-commerce web store,” Luigi said.

“Tell me about it,” Mario requested with curiosity. “Sounds like a very interesting project. What’s your strategy?”

Luigi got all excited and a little arrogant.

“Well, Mario, I’m going to crush the market with efficiency,” Luigi said.

“Efficiency? That’s your strategy?” asked Mario.

“Nobody will be able to beat me. I’m investing heavily in the best computers and the best software. I’m not cheap like you, Mario!”

“Well, I don’t necessarily call it cheap,” Mario said.

“I’m setting up the fastest servers with the latest e-commerce tools. I’ll be able to process thousands of orders per day! You know how the saying goes, ‘Go big or go home,’ Mario!”

“Interesting strategy,” said Mario respectfully.

“What about you, Mario? What’s your strategy?” Luigi asked while showing off his powerful servers.

“My strategy is more into being the most effective, not necessarily the most efficient,” he said.

“What does that mean?” Luigi asked.

“It means that while you’re focused on speed, I’m focused on direction. Yes, while you may have the ‘fastest’ servers, they’re worthless if they’re not effective.”

Luigi sat quietly for a few moments thinking.

Mario continued, “Efficiency is just one of the multiple variables needed for achieving success in business. Yes, it’s good to go fast, but know that the faster you go in the wrong direction, the faster you will dig your own grave.”

To answer your question, how can you tell whether a new entrepreneur will make it or not?

Most are obsessed in DOING, and not thinking.

In war and in business — “Strategy wins wars.”

All your hard work and resources will be worthless if there’s no market for your product or service.

When starting, do NOT focus on the HOW — focus on the WHO you’re serving.

Sia Vilchinskaya,3y,Are there any examples of a unicorn startup that was bootstrapped?,"Simply put, a unicorn company is privately owned startup which is valued at over $1billion.

Important fact: Unicorn companies only exist in 24 countries of the world. In 2018, China overtook the US in the number of unicorns, topping the list with 206 unicorn companies, while the United States has 203 unicorn companies. India comes 3rd place with only 21 unicorns while the rest is shared by the remaining countries.

Bootstrapped companies

Bootstrapping, in business terms, refers to building a company from scratch, without any outside funds. A bootstrapped company is one which is entirely powered by the entrepreneurs' personal funds, and in some cases, the cash flow from its initial sales.

Despite how difficult it sounds to bootstrap a company, these kinds of companies are quite common, and among them, there are immensely successful ones such as eBay, Oracle and Microsoft.

It is not very common to find bootstrapped startups that make it to the list of unicorn companies. However, this does not mean that there are absolutely no companies which were both bootstrapped and unicorns at the same time. Examples of companies like this include:

MailChimp
Shutterstock
GoPro
Mojang (Minecraft)
Shopify
Lynda

Jason M. Lemkin,Updated Nov 6,What tells a VC that you are an amateur?,"Being an amateur is OK, even endearing — if it’s authentic. You probably don’t want to be too polished, especially in the early days.

But here are some things that say you just aren’t ready to raise venture capital:

You bring “weird” people to the pitch meetings. Do not bring “advisors”. Do not bring anyone that isn’t a key employee. Don’t have a non-CEO/founder lead a meeting. CEO or CEO + co-founder only to start.
You change / make up a new valuation based on how much the VC wants to invest. This is subtle, but don’t do this. Don’t change the price, at least not explicitly, based on a VC saying they’d invest $Xm or $Xk. “Oh if you want to invest $2m, then the price is $20m. For $3m then it’s $30m.” Don’t do that.
You ask for money to help you build a “sales process”. No. You ask for money to help you sell faster and better. Not to figure out how to sell. You need to do that yourself.
You don’t know your core metrics fluently. You just gotta know your MRR (revenue), average deal size, latest customers you closed, burn rate, etc. If you the CEO has to turn to her/his co-founder for an answer, you’ve already lost.
You don’t know the competitive landscape. It’s OK to say “I should know more about [competitor], but I’m not sure of the answer”. Not great but OK. But don’t look clueless.
You badmouth the competition too much. A tiny bit isn’t the end of the world, but great founders respect the competition.
You don’t know much about the VC firm. Dude.
You show up late. This is sales. It’s selling stock, yes, but it’s sales.
You’re too nervous. You’re selling yourself and your vision. Yes, the VC firm may have all the money and a fancy office. But be confident enough in yourself.

Asim Qureshi,6y,How much should an entrepreneur worry about competition in an early-stage startup?,"Focus on your own business.

One of the mistakes entrepreneurs make is worry about competition too much.

Sure, sometimes that worry is valid, but in the majority of cases it’s exaggerated hugely. And that distracts you from focusing on your customers.

The test is simple. If your sales leads keep bringing up your competitor’s name, only then do you need to worry about that competitor.

So two years ago we started PayrollPanda.my, a payroll solution targeting Malaysian businesses. There was a well-funded competitor in our space with a one year advantage.

But we’ve never given two hoots about them. Why? Because hardly any of our potential customers had even heard of them. Not surprising as they are a startup.

Their CEO called our staff and tried poaching some, tried to find out about our strategy from the interviews, and recently we’ve seen them copying us.

We just focused on our product and customers.

The result? Today, many of their customers think their product is buggy and difficult to use - and we know this because their ex-customers are switching over and telling us.

Sean Kernan,2y,What are the signs of desperation in an entrepreneur?,"They start handing cash to customers—and it works.

Paypal bribed users to use their app

PayPal wanted to create a borderless cash transfer app. They gave away millions in their first year, $10 to each user, which seems crazy for a startup with no revenue. But it allowed them to reach a million users in only 15 months.

Their cash-giveaway is now the default strategy for new entrants in this market. They demonstrated that to truly differentiate yourself in a busy market or to announce yourself with a bold idea, you needed to put substantial skin in the game. Startups are a hardcore, competitive arena that weed out flimsy competitors. It favors bold players who aren’t afraid to bet huge and fail hugely.

One of my favorite mistakes by PayPal was when they accidentally gave $92,233,720,368,547,800 ($92 quadrillion) to a man’s Paypal account, more than 1000 the entire planet GDP.

He never got the money back but understood that it was a software error.

Avinash Hiremath,Updated 6y,"Why is Flipkart still looking for investors, as their founders are billionaires, now? They can help themselves.","Brilliant question. I almost fell for it! But hey, they are actually the ones funding Flipkart now.

If one actually thinks that Bansals have billions worth of cash sitting in bank and why don’t they help themselves then the premise is wrong. They have stake on papers and only when they sell that stake, they can buy fuel for the company.

Bansals as individuals will not have more the few single/double digit crores in their account.

Flipkart today has multiple valuations floating around in the market. Its owners(sellers) value at ~$15b while 3rd party analysts(buyers) estimate little over $5b.

Lets average it out to $10b for simplifying the calculation. With $10 billion valuation both Bansals combined will sell 10% stake to raise $1 billion. of course other stakeholders can participate in this funding round as well.

Here is the ownership structure of Flipkart:

And another way of looking at the ownership structure is:

Now there’s a subtle difference between preferred stock and common stock
:

This means that when the company must liquidate and pay all creditors and bondholders, common stockholders will not receive any money until after the preferred shareholders are paid out. Second, the dividends of preferred stocks are different from and generally greater than those of common stock.

Out of context but Bansals now do not have much of controlling power over taking decisions for the company. Its pretty much run buy the investors (preferred stock holders).
Also, in case Amazon or anyone buys Flipkart then its the preferred stock holders who will make cash first, then if something is left, the founders will get part of that.

There’s another way of looking at the shareholder pattern
:

So the Bansal’s each hold ~9% of the company. When Flipkart was valuated at $15b in 2015
, Bansals were worth 9% of $15b = $1.35 billion each.

Now as the valuation is coming down, their stake+networth is also coming down. At $5b valuation each will be worth little over $450 million.

That said, Flipkart owners are billionaires on paper, not with real cash. There’s a difference between Mark Zuckerberg being a billionaire and Bansals being a billionaire.

Mark owns 14% of Facebooks stocks which is around 410 million shares and with each share trading at $140, his net worth is over $57 billion.

This essentially means if tomorrow Facebook or Mark needs $1 billion, he can sell $1billion/140 equivalent of shares.

On the other hand, if Bansals want to infuse $1 billion of capital in Flipkart, they need to approach private investors like Tiger Global, Accel Partners and sell part of companies stake. Diluting everyone's share a little bit.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/swcfkeit7blpjumr', 'title': 'Why is Flipkart still looking for investors, as their founders are billionaires, now?

Jennifer Collins,01-Sep,What are the good ways to calculate percentage of equity giving to venture capital when a startup gets funded?,"Ah, the eternal question of how to give away a piece of your pie without feeling like you've been robbed.

Well, as an expert in startups and venture capital, I can tell you that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.

It's all a matter of negotiation and finding a balance between getting the funding you need and maintaining enough equity to keep the ship afloat.

That being said, there are a few things to keep in mind when calculating the percentage of equity to give away.

First and foremost, make sure you have a solid business plan and realistic projections for growth.

Investors want to see that you have a clear path to success and a plan for how their investment will help you get there.

Second, do your research on comparable companies in your industry and what their typical equity structures look like.

This will give you a better idea of what's reasonable and what's not.

Finally, don't be afraid to negotiate.

Remember, the investors need you as much as you need them, so don't be shy about pushing back if you feel like you're getting a raw deal.

In the end, getting funded is a balancing act between getting the money you need and maintaining enough control to steer your company in the direction you want it to go.

It's not always easy, but with a little bit of savvy negotiating and a lot of hard work, it's certainly achievable.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/u8xdlnekbj0v4h7t', 'title': 'What are the good ways to calculate percentage of equity giving to venture capital when a startup gets funded?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Ah, the eternal question of how to give away a piece of your pie without feeling like you've been robbed.\n\nWell, as an expert in startups and venture capital, I can tell you that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.\n\nIt's all a matter of negotiation and finding a balance between getting the funding you need and maintaining enough equity to keep the ship afloat.\n\nThat being said, there are a few things to keep in mind when calculating the percentage of equity to give away.\n\nFirst and foremost, make sure you have a solid business plan and realistic projections for growth.\n\nInvestors want to see that you have a clear path to success and a plan for how their investment will help you get there.\n\nSecond, do your research on comparable companies in your industry and what their typical equity structures look like.\n\nThis will give you a better idea of what's reasonable and what's not.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to negotiate.\n\nRemember, the investors need you as much as you need them, so don't be shy about pushing back if you feel like you're getting a raw deal.\n\nIn the end, getting funded is a balancing act between getting the money you need and maintaining enough control to steer your company in the direction you want it to go.\n\nIt's not always easy, but with a little bit of savvy negotiating and a lot of hard work, it's certainly achievable."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1989309, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Ah, the eternal question of how to give away a piece of your pie without feeling like you've been robbed.\n\nWell, as an expert in startups and venture capital, I can tell you that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.\n\nIt's all a matter of negotiation and finding a balance between getting the funding you need and maintaining enough equity to keep the ship afloat.\n\nThat being said, there are a few things to keep in mind when calculating the percentage of equity to give away.\n\nFirst and foremost, make sure you have a solid business plan and realistic projections for growth.\n\nInvestors want to see that you have a clear path to success and a plan for how their investment will help you get there.\n\nSecond, do your research on comparable companies in your industry and what their typical equity structures look like.\n\nThis will give you a better idea of what's reasonable and what's not.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to negotiate.\n\nRemember, the investors need you as much as you need them, so don't be shy about pushing back if you feel like you're getting a raw deal.\n\nIn the end, getting funded is a balancing act between getting the money you need and maintaining enough control to steer your company in the direction you want it to go.\n\nIt's not always easy, but with a little bit of savvy negotiating and a lot of hard work, it's certainly achievable."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Patrick Mathieson,8y,How is Slack's rumored $2.76 billion valuation calculated?,"When you're growing as fast as Slack, you don't have to justify your valuation with numbers or multiples or whatever. The quantity of investors that want to put money into the deal is nearly endless. It's merely a matter of supply and demand.

The process in hyper-growth companies like Slack is more akin to this:

Stewart (into a loudspeaker): ""Okay you bastard VCs. I need to raise one hundred and sixty million dollars. I'm going to let five of you invest in my company. How many of you will invest at a $2 billion valuation?""

VCs: (485 arms raise in the air.)

Stewart: ""Hmmm.... that's too many. What about $2.5 billion?""

VCs: (65 arms are still raised.)

Stewart: ""$2.7 billion?""

VCs: (8 arms still up.)

Stewart: ""Nice, almost there. What about $2.8 billion?""

Anonymous,8y,How can a bootstrapped startup beat a $13 million pre-A founded startup?,"I will share you with some experience. I was in a very similar situation a few years ago, you could say it was worse.

I had a competitor who was funded to the tune of $50 million. There I was with my little start up, bootstrapped. They did everything they could to attack us, even though they were 50 employees and we were only 10.

They played dirty, and even tried to sue us. In the end we focussed on our product, not theirs. We built the best we could, we created a customer experience that was second to none.

Meanwhile, they did the opposite, they were held to account by investors, and so had to produce the maximum profit, they offshored their entire customer processed, they bought from the cheapest suppliers.

Every time we have gone head to head with them since we have won, we have won industry awards and every pitch against them. They have raised more and more funding, but are basically circling the drain.

We continue to grow, and are profitable.

I believe that the strengths that come with taking investment also come anchor points, think of a large object trying to maneuver in a gravity well, the smaller object can escape, while a larger object is bound by its own mass, the thing that defines it.

It stacks up. You should pass, but you want to see just one more proof point, so you can believe. Maybe, by mulling it over, you'll see that one more proof point.

Jason M. Lemkin,Updated Oct 9,"What are some signs that an ""angel investor"" is really a ""devil investor""?","Some top signs that trouble may come later:

The terms are way, way, way too complicated. To me, this is flag #01 by far. Angel investing should be simple. What matters is price, check size, and maybe, pro rata rights in the next round (if you have a significant amount of capital to invest later). Nothing else really matters. Complex, multi-page term sheets for an angel investment are signs of problems to come.
Too much focus on control. Money should have checks-and-balances. No one should have to worry that founders will misuse funds. But investors shouldn’t be worried about controlling a board of directors, or rights to pick the CEO, etc. in an angel round. If you are selling > 20% of your company, granting a board seat to the investors is fair. But even there, it should be simple.
Confused about the risks, needs too many financial models and financials. Asking for a financial model is more than fair. But there isn’t 30 days of financial analysis to do in an angel investment. The company just isn’t far enough long. If the financial diligence is too complicated, something is off.
Haven’t made enough similar investments. 9 times out of 10, try to avoid angels that haven’t already made similar investments. It’s too hard for new investors to get their arms around the risks and issues.
Haven’t made money from investing yet. I wouldn’t use this as a bright line. But it’s better to have investors that have already made money from tech investing. You don’t want tourists.
Can’t get a straight answer. Are they are in or out? It’s fair to ask. And “not today, but maybe in a few months when I see more progress” is also fair. But try to avoid folks that just take too long to come to a conclusion.
Can’t afford it. Can’t afford to lose it all. My final point. Avoid whenever possible angels that just can’t afford it. No one should be putting more than 10% of their liquid net worth into angel investments. And you probably need to do at least 20 of them to spread out the risk. That means anyone investing more than 0.5% of their liquid worth into your start-up is … risky. Risky to freak out. To worry too much. To be more trouble than they are worth. Mom and dad MAY be an exception. That worked out well for Amazon and Atlassian.

Pranav Gokhale,5y,What was Masayoshi Son like as a student at UC Berkeley?,"For context, Masayoshi Son is the founder and CEO of SoftBank, the Japanese telecom company that has changed the landscape of venture investing by raising and rapidly deploying the $100 Billion Vision Fund
. SoftBank is responsible for a stunningly wide selection of massive investment rounds in companies like Didi Chuxing, DoorDash, FlipKart, Nvidia, Ola, Slack, Uber, Wag, and many more[1].

Son earned his bachelor’s degree at UC Berkeley in the mid 1970s. I actually asked this Quora question myself, because (a) I’m curious about what he was like as a student and (b) a friend sent me this obscure but insightful anecdote:

In an interview in which Son was asked about how he paid for his education while studying full-time at Berkeley, he responded[2]:

MASAYOSHI SON: I ask my friends, isn't there a job that I can earn $10,000 in five minutes a day? My friend said you are crazy, that's impossible. Do you want to sell drugs? No, no I don't want to do that. So I said, okay what is the best most efficient use of my time? It's invention and I have to file a patent. If I get the patent, five minutes, if I focus I can make some ideas. So I set the alarm clock for five minutes. Tick tick tick. In five minutes, I said come invention. So I did that.

DAVID RUBENSTEIN: And if worked?

MASAYOSHI SON: It worked.

DAVID RUBENSTEIN: You invented a machine that helped people translate languages?

MASAYOSHI SON: Yeah, that one was the electronic dictionary. The first electronic dictionary. Many students use electronic dictionary. The first one ever made was by myself.

DAVID RUBENSTEIN: The first electronic dictionary?

MASAYOSHI SON: Yes.

DAVID RUBENSTEIN: And you sold it to Sharp?

MASAYOSHI SON: Yes to Sharp.

DAVID RUBENSTEIN: And you made a lot of money.

MASAYOSHI SON: Yeah, $1.7 million.

DAVID RUBENSTEIN: So what did you do with $1.7 million then?

MASAYOSHI SON: Well, I used it to start Softbank. I did one more project and made another $1.5 million, so I made $3.2 million in 18 months, so that is better than $10,000 per month. I told that to my friend look I got $3.2 million and I kept working only five minutes a day as I promised you.

At a glance, this anecdote is reminiscent of the Tim Ferriss Four Hour Workweek mentality. But I think the key differentiator is that Masayoshi Son believed invention to be the highest ROI way to spend 5 minutes per day—not affiliate marketing, eBay reselling, etc.

Has it worked? Well, last year, Son raised $45 Billion through a 45 minute conversation with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince, who was convinced by Son’s vision of technology and invention. So he’s clearly on to something!

Anurag Bhatia,Updated 7y,What is the weirdest venture or business that you've ever invested in?,"Major update: Shreyansh Singh commented on this answer saying that he wants to pay for Rohini's daughter's hostel fee from his first salary. We've had a conversation and have decided how to go about it. While most people blow up their first salary on a night of partying, Shreyansh's efforts make me so proud. I salute him.

I once invested in three cows and a buffalo and it worked out reasonably well.

There was a phase in life where I was obsessed with figuring out self sustainable social business models after reading C.K. Prahalad's book - Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid
. At the same time I was working on a World Bank backed research on the viability of microinvestments in rural Karnataka keeping in mind harvest cycles and reliance on monsoon. What microfinance did for rural lending, I wanted to replicate that for investing.

I was engaged with women's self groups trying organise them into co-operative societies so that they could access bank credit to get capital to start business. I succeeded in getting each and every woman in the group the capital they needed, except one, Rohini.

Rohini is a widow and worked as a daily labourer on sugarcane fields. She is also asthmatic and has a leg injury. Rohini wanted to start a dairy business and needed about 1.5 lakhs to purchase cows, build a shed and buy fodder. Primarily to learn how business is done in rural India, instead of fronting her the cash, I went and purchased three cows and a bull and transported them to her shed. Please please don't try to do it yourself. It's not fun. Or hygienic. The cow will hit you with its poop encrusted tail.

The buffalo costed 37,000 rupees and produces about 10 litres of milk a day. The cows costed 35k and produce 8 to 10 litres milk a day (A2 genetic variant). After about 18 months she had saved enough to purchase two more cows of the Ongole breed. Ongole breed are those with the odd shaped hump. They're a dual purpose cattle: they produce milk as well as pull bullock carts and till fields.

Pictured above is an Ongole breed cow

Rohini expanded her business from just a dairy shed to renting out cows once they had been milked, increasing her income by 60%. I taught Rohini basic accounting and asked for a 15% interest on my investment. She's doing well now. My 15% interest goes right back into her sons school fees and there's some left over which I'm secretly investing for his college. She still thinks the school fees comes from the Army Pension Scheme!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/begj2zx7pwokdvcu', 'title': ""What is the weirdest venture or business that you've ever invested in?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Major update: Shreyansh Singh commented on this answer saying that he wants to pay for Rohini's daughter's hostel fee from his first salary.

Mike Maples,10y,"As a VC, how does one balance the pressure to provide a return for their fund LP's, with their pledge to their portfolio companies? Are there occasions where conflicts of interest arise?","In my opinion, there is actually less conflict than some may think.  Here's why: Returns in the venture industry follow a power law distribution.  Typically what this means is that the best outcome in a fund is more valuable than all of the other outcomes in the fund combined.  The second best outcome is worth more than all of those remaining.  And so on.  Paul Graham wrote that this was true about Y Combinator in his ""Black Swan Farming"" post.  It has also been true for my Angel investments (Twitter worth more than all others combined) as well as our Floodgate funds (Demandforce returned almost 3x Fund I by itself.) When you view it through this lens, the most important thing a VC can do is select a company that has a massive multiple and do everything possible to accelerate that massive return even further.  Even a small fraction on top of an already massive number is usually a bigger number than playing with the cap table of a losing company and fighting the founders for the scraps of the value that is left. In my experience, the problem is that power law distributions are exponential curves and very counter-intuitive.  They are much harder to understand and internalize than a normal distribution curve of returns that define a lot of other classes of investing. If an investor is confused -- if he or she thinks that it's important to get the most you can out of every company you can -- this is often a consequence of not having a handle on the exponential / power law dynamic that drives returns in the VC business.  In other words, the VCs who do the best are usually the ones more preoccupied with massively growing the pie rather than those preoccupied with claiming a slightly bigger slice.  In the startup world, the returns generated by the winners are so massively great that acceleration is the core concern....and this concern unites the LP, VC, and founder far more than it creates conflicts, as long as the VC doesn't forget what the business is really about.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dbv982nsx6h5cwrp', 'title': ""As a VC, how does one balance the pressure to provide a return for their fund LP's, with their pledge to their portfolio companies?

Tim Berry,Updated 3y,As an angel investor or VC what are things that annoy you when entrepreneurs pitch to you?,"Profits. Talk of profits, overestimated profits, the failure to understand that investors make money on growth, not profits; startups with high growth rates are rarely profitable; profits in high-growth startups stunt growth and reduce the odds of successful exit. That’s why you need to spend other people’s money, right?
“I don’t need no stinking projections.” Surprises me how often I’ve seen it. “We all know,” the pitcher says in a cynical tone, “that all these projections are useless.” Or sometimes it’s a holier-than-thou tone. But no. I need you to think though unit costs, realistic volume, the conceptual links between marketing spend and volume, what it takes to fund growth. I want to know that you know, roughly, that your growth will take a ton of marketing spend, and that when you get to $20 million annual sales you are going to have a big payroll and overhead.
Expecting me to believe your numbers. You’re damn right I want to see them, but don’t expect me to believe them. I use them to guess how well you know the nuts and bolts of your business. But at the moment of truth, I’m going to trust my instinct for what I think you can sell, and how much I think you can grow, given the stories you’ve told me and the markets you’ve carved out.
Discounted cash flow. IRR and NPV. Amazing how people can believe numbers that project the future based on a compounded absurdity of assumed sales, less assumed spending, multiplied by an assumed discount rate, five years from now. And yet, I see young people crushed because I wanted something that had a lower IRR than their thing. Y’see, I didn’t believe the IRR either way. I went with the people and the market. This is actually a particularly annoying subset of the point above it.
The annoying myth that nobody reads business plans. Big mistake: confusing the obsolescence of the big pompous formal use-once-and-throw-away business plan of the past with not wanting or needing planning. Ask the two faces of lean startups, Eric Ries and Steve Blank, whether startups need to set strategy, tactics, milestones, metrics, and essential projections for revenue, spending, and cash, and they’ll say the equivalent of “yes of course.” But they are (mis)quoted often as saying don’t do a business plan. What they mean – ask them – is don’t do an old fashioned business plan. Keep it lean, revise it often, and manage with it.
Knowing everything. Sometimes people think investors want founders who know everything, answer each question no matter what, and are the world’s leading expert on any possible subject to come up. No. I want people who know what they don’t know, and aren’t afraid to be not certain.
I don’t want people who get all defensive when challenged. The win is in the relationship, long term. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen private discussions between investors, after a pitch, go negative for somebody who investors feel “isn’t teachable.” It’s easier to work with people who listen, digest, than with people who think every doubt is a challenge to their leadership and authority.
The small piece of a huge market. No, please, don’t ever tell me that your $10 million sales figure is realistic because it’s only one percent of a $1 billion-dollar market. Or 1/10th percent of a $10 billion market. That logic never works. Build your forecast from the units up, not from the top down.
Oversharing the science or technology. I want to hear about the business, not the physics, not the biology, not the chemistry. Pitches and plans are not the right place to show off all of your knowledge.
Not needing the money. If you don’t need the money then don’t seek investment. Own it yourself. Never seek outsider money you don’t really need. People who can live off of their generated cash flow are never going to exit
(bonus point) The way-overused stock phrases that have been diluted to meaningless. Things like “game changer” and “disruptive.” Don’t tell us that. Cross your fingers, and hope we tell you.

Thanks for a2a. And someday I’m going to answer the question what annoys me about my fellow investors. Because writing these items generates a thought about that side of the table too.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cs9zu2705dfvmqij', 'title': 'As an angel investor or VC what are things that annoy you when entrepreneurs pitch to you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9154, 'ai': 0.0846}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Profits.

DAVIS THE FINANCE PROMOTER.,1y,What is the best way to invest $10000?,"You wish to invest or trade stocks with $1,0000. 
You choose Apple (AAPL) because you believe the business is doing well and that its stock price will increase soon. 
You deposit the $1,0000 you have into an online brokerage account that you open. 
At the current price of $142 for AAPL, you have enough cash to acquire 7 shares.  

PREPARATION

Open a brokerage account.
Set a stock trading budget.
Learn to use market orders and limit orders.
Practice with a paper trading account.
Measure your returns against an appropriate benchmark.
Keep your perspective.
Lower risk by building positions gradually.
Ignore 'hot tips'

Angelina Logan,3y,"If you have invested in Bitcoin, what was the value of your capital?","My personal experience with cryptocurrency, especially bitcoin.

When i first heard about bitcoin, i pretty much rushed into investing in bitcoin because i had heard all these sweet stories about people making a lot from trading. I did basic research and thought i knew all i needed to know about the crypto market. Boy was i wrong. I invested $100 at the time. It was around April 2018.

When i started, i made a profit of $130 and thought i had the market in my pocket. I can’t forget how i felt, it was a beautiful feeling. I felt like i had found my calling. Hehe. To cut the story short, i lost all my starting capital after messing around for a while. So, i decided to buy 1 btc after a while and HODL. At the time, 1 btc cost about $6,000. After a couple of months, i had made roughly negative $200. It was shocking but a couple of months later, i had made $400 profit.

I didn’t like how little i made over a long period. I kept hearing how people were making a lot of money trading. So i decided to learn from a professional, i watched videos and read a lot more. I started trading again but i kept my trades small and make little profits here and there and some losses too.

Eventually, while continuing my research, i came across an investment platform that saves you all the stress of having to stay awake checking the news and hoping you don’t lose money. This platform is where you invest bitcoin or ethereum or other cryptocurrencies and get paid weekly. The best part about the company is they take all the risk off your hands. I decided to take the risk to try them out. I had a little over 1 btc so i decided to invest 0.5 btc. After 6 days, i was credited with double of my investment. I tried again with the same 0.5 btc and after a week, i got 1 btc credited in my wallet. I have been using the platform for almost a year now. I have also tried other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and ripple. If you would like to know more, visit CoinsFlux (www.coinsflux.com)

Whatever i make from the platform, i use it to invest in others things my hands are into right now. That way, i have multiple streams of income.

It was around April 2018.\n\nWhen i started, i made a profit of $130 and thought i had the market in my pocket. I can’t forget how i felt, it was a beautiful feeling. I felt like i had found my calling. Hehe. To cut the story short, i lost all my starting capital after messing around for a while. So, i decided to buy 1 btc after a while and HODL. At the time, 1 btc cost about $6,000. After a couple of months, i had made roughly negative $200. It was shocking but a couple of months later, i had made $400 profit.\n\nI didn’t like how little i made over a long period. I kept hearing how people were making a lot of money trading. So i decided to learn from a professional, i watched videos and read a lot more. I started trading again but i kept my trades small and make little profits here and there and some losses too.\n\nEventually, while continuing my research, i came across an investment platform that saves you all the stress of having to stay awake checking the news and hoping you don’t lose money. This platform is where you invest bitcoin or ethereum or other cryptocurrencies and get paid weekly. The best part about the company is they take all the risk off your hands. I decided to take the risk to try them out. I had a little over 1 btc so i decided to invest 0.5 btc. After 6 days, i was credited with double of my investment. I tried again with the same 0.5 btc and after a week, i got 1 btc credited in my wallet. I have been using the platform for almost a year now. I have also tried other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and ripple. If you would like to know more, visit CoinsFlux (www.coinsflux.com)\n\nWhatever i make from the platform, i use it to invest in others things my hands are into right now. That way, i have multiple streams of income. So, you could say that my starting capital is 0.5btc.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9976
Rachel Ryan,16-Nov,Are there any active Venture Capital / Incubator company in Indonesia?,"Oh, Indonesia, the land of opportunities and potential!

Let me tell you, my dear friend, that when it comes to venture capital incubators in Indonesia, it's like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Yes, they do exist, but they are about as rare as a unicorn sighting.

Now, don't get me wrong, Indonesia has a thriving startup scene with plenty of entrepreneurial spirit.

But when it comes to venture capital incubators, the landscape is still developing.

It's not like you can stroll down the street and find an incubator on every corner.

You'll have to dig deep, do your research, and maybe even perform a secret handshake to uncover these elusive creatures.

But hey, don't let that discourage you.

If you're determined and persistent, you might just stumble upon a hidden gem in the Indonesian startup ecosystem.

Who knows, you might even be the one to start the next big venture capital incubator in the country.

Lastly, you might find technology-focused funds in the mix, given Reddit's place in the social media tech space.

Michael Wolfe,Updated 10y,How long should I let an unfunded startup string me along?,"I would bail on this startup, but probably not for the reasons you think.

It is not surprising at all that their funding keeps getting delayed. Getting funded is hard, and it always takes longer than you think it will. There is a good chance they won't get funded at all, but even if they do, you should think hard before joining them.

Here is why: the founders are poor people managers. A startup almost can't succeed without good management, and it certainly won't be a fun place to work.

Here is what they should be doing:


They should have you into the office regularly to update you on progress and keep you excited.
They should have you meet the other recruits and try to have some brainstorming sessions with all of you, both to see how you work together and to keep you all engaged.
They should give you regular updates on the funding, even when the news is bad.
They should never promise to get back to you and then not do it.
They should apologize and acknowledge that they are frustrated, but ask you to hang in there.
They should take you out for beers from time to time.


If they aren't doing these things, they have a poor sense of how to hire people, engage them, and communicate with them. They also seem disorganized and do not keep their commitments.

Like any startup, if they do manage to close their round, they are only at the starting line. At that point they need to hire and retain a great team and get them motivated and working on the right things. With people management skills as poor as what you describe, the company is likely to be a comedy of errors. It will probably struggle at every step of the way, and its employees will be in for a frustrating experience.

If you got a job at this startup, that means you could get a job at many other startups.

Jason M. Lemkin,Updated Nov 7,What do partners at venture capital firms do?,"My learnings and experiences:

First, the average partner spends at least 25% of his or her time simply travelling to, and attending, board meetings.

(Less travel now with Covid for sure, but even more board meetings over Zoom, so it’s a wash.)

If you are on 10 boards, with 10 board meetings a year per company, and travel and attendance together take say 5 hours per meeting ... that's 500 hours right there!

Once a VC serves on > 10 or so boards, they are often called Professional Board Members.

There's a reason Andreessen Horowitz has ""board partners"". To get back this 25% time (at least in theory).

Also, this is why VCs constantly blog about board meetings. Because they spent so much collective time in them.

Second, at least 25% of his or her time is dealing with existing investments. Helping, not helping, sourcing VPs, helping fundraise next round, dealing with hiring and people issues, etc. etc. This makes sense ... the ratio almost has to be 1:1 vis-a-vis the time spent at board meetings.

Just following up with action items and issues from any meeting almost always takes as much time as the meeting itself, no matter what the context.

Third, at least 25% of his or her time is spent with administrative matters -- Monday partner meetings (this can take up almost an entire day right there -- 20% of the working week), fundraising for a new fund (a ton of time for all but the very top funds -- it can take years in some cases), meeting with their own existing investors (LPs), dealing with administrative matters (there's a lot to do to manage hundreds of millions of dollars).

>> So really ... it doesn't leave a lot of time to work on new investments and meeting with new companies ...

VCs don't actually do as much of that as you might think.

Kendra Morgan,11mo,What are the different types of venture capital firms?,"Venture capital firms come in all shapes and sizes.

In general, there are four main types of venture capital firms.

Early-stage venture capital firms are the ones who invest in a startup’s earliest rounds of funding.

These firms typically invest in the seed or angel investment stages of a project.

They provide the startup with capital to help get the project off the ground and give entrepreneurs the resources they need to make their venture a reality.

Mid-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in a project’s later stages, such as Series A, B, and C rounds.

These firms are typically larger and have a higher level of expertise and experience with venture capital.

They are looking for a larger return on their investment and often bring valuable resources and expertise to the table.

Later-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in project’s later rounds such as Series D and E.

These firms are looking for the highest return on their investment and often have the resources and expertise to help the startup reach a successful outcome.

Finally, growth-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in later-stage startups that have already established a product or service and have a successful customer base.

They are looking for a quick return on their investment, often through the acquisition or IPO of a startup.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ampln08ydiqof1gt', 'title': 'What are the different types of venture capital firms?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Venture capital firms come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nIn general, there are four main types of venture capital firms.\n\nEarly-stage venture capital firms are the ones who invest in a startup’s earliest rounds of funding.\n\nThese firms typically invest in the seed or angel investment stages of a project.\n\nThey provide the startup with capital to help get the project off the ground and give entrepreneurs the resources they need to make their venture a reality.\n\nMid-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in a project’s later stages, such as Series A, B, and C rounds.\n\nThese firms are typically larger and have a higher level of expertise and experience with venture capital.\n\nThey are looking for a larger return on their investment and often bring valuable resources and expertise to the table.\n\nLater-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in project’s later rounds such as Series D and E.\n\nThese firms are looking for the highest return on their investment and often have the resources and expertise to help the startup reach a successful outcome.\n\nFinally, growth-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in later-stage startups that have already established a product or service and have a successful customer base.\n\nThey are looking for a quick return on their investment, often through the acquisition or IPO of a startup.', 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1989217, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Venture capital firms come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nIn general, there are four main types of venture capital firms.\n\nEarly-stage venture capital firms are the ones who invest in a startup’s earliest rounds of funding.\n\nThese firms typically invest in the seed or angel investment stages of a project.\n\nThey provide the startup with capital to help get the project off the ground and give entrepreneurs the resources they need to make their venture a reality.\n\nMid-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in a project’s later stages, such as Series A, B, and C rounds.\n\nThese firms are typically larger and have a higher level of expertise and experience with venture capital.\n\nThey are looking for a larger return on their investment and often bring valuable resources and expertise to the table.\n\nLater-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in project’s later rounds such as Series D and E.\n\nThese firms are looking for the highest return on their investment and often have the resources and expertise to help the startup reach a successful outcome.\n\nFinally, growth-Stage venture capital firms typically invest in later-stage startups that have already established a product or service and have a successful customer base.\n\nThey are looking for a quick return on their investment, often through the acquisition or IPO of a startup.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Hampus Jakobsson,10y,I'm tired of running my (very) successful (VC funded) startup after 5+ years. What should I do?,"I guess you have thought about this a lot and it is not as if a short vacation will solve it for you. Maybe - then try that. But:

First of all: I have been in your shoes and I completely understand you. 2002, when I was 23 years old, together with five friends I founded TAT (TAT The Astonishing Tribe
) and grew that from six friends to 180 people in five counties and with clients such as Google, Nokia, Samsung, Sony, Disney, etc. During these years pressure was immense and we doubled every year - size & revenue and slowly shifted revenue to recurring licenses. And we never brought in a VC but grew it mostly with revenue.

But - with six young friends you can easily tell that the chance of everyone taking the same high level of roles, developing at the same pace, and devoting themselves so utterly (which is required) is low. So - we were three that did and the last years slowly the other two phased away. I felt very lonely and under a lot of pressure. And most of all - I realised that I liked to create things, and not to manage them.

So - what did we do? We actually hired experienced management and moved to business development, innovation, and board positions. And the CEO we hired had more of a COO profile. She was great with both customers, partners, and employees, but she wasn't the charismatic leader some media wanted and not the visionary required. We filled those shoes. I wouldn't say we puppeteered her, because she is all to gifted for that. But at least we were more in a CEO position in some sense and she in a COO position. But, I never think we could have hired a COO and made that person as motivated and dedicated as our CEO became. TAT ended up being acquired by Blackberry in 2010 for $150m (with a turnover of around $30m).

I would think of what you enjoy and are best at - is it sales/marketing, new product/R&D, corporate strategy, etc. And then move into that role + become head of the board (or similar) + hire a CEO who you feel that you have a great personal chemistry with. Your biggest hurdle will be your pride & ego. Can you ""report"" to someone? (Who in a sense reports to you in return as you are part of the board.)

(Of course your vesting clause might affect this, but at the end of they day the VC wants as much value as possible and if you are better in another role, as long as it is an operational one, I think it should work and be better for the company.)

Brendan Baker,Updated 11y,"What should be the answer to ""What if Google builds the same product as yours tomorrow""? What do investors expect when they ask this question?","I have a more dismissive answer to this question than most people. I feel that most of the time, investors who ask these types of questions either:

a) don't know what they're talking about, or
b) know there's a good answer and just want to hear you say it.

First, I would acknowledge that there are a small number of product areas where this is a real risk. I'd have a few examples ready (certain types of ads/ad networks, indexing content, analytics, etc)

Then I'd dive into a few reasons why big companies can't always beat smaller, quicker companies in the same product area:

1) We're hyper focused on building this solution, whereas Google's got X products on their plate (I'd bet X>50, though I haven't counted). This also means we can move faster.

2) Google has to extend or protect existing, successful products. This affects their ability to build new products in ways that might threaten current business. We can be more challenging or extreme.

3) Google doesn't have it in their DNA or culture to build this product properly. This is my favorite. Companies have specific worldviews, baked into culture and processes, that allow or prevent them from building products in certain areas.

Let's take an extreme example. Apple will never build a successful social network because they work with high structure, secrecy, very careful planning, and defined, public launches. No viable social network can be built under those conditions. As strong as they are, they're just not a threat here.

Finally, I'd have a list ready of all of the Google products that haven't dominated in the market. Wave, Video Player, Health, Web Accelerator, Answers, Coupons, Voice Search, Buzz, X, Catalogue, Audio Ads, Page Creator, Notebook...


So my argument would go like this:

""Yes, it's true Google threatens a few areas like A, B and C. They can do this because they're great at D. But they won't be able to create a dominant product in our space because of E and F. And this isn't the only space Google can't claim, they've failed at example, example, example and example in the past. That's why we respect, but aren't worried about Google.""

They believe in the power of personal connections, because who needs technology when you have charm and charisma?

But of course, they also use some fancy software platforms to keep tabs on potential investment opportunities.

These platforms claim to use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze mountains of data and identify promising startups.

Rachel Ryan,14-Dec,How can you raise lots of venture capital and then end up making no money?,"Well, it's quite an art, isn't it?

Raising loads of venture capital and then magically turning it into no money.

It's like a talent show for entrepreneurs - how to burn through cash without creating any actual value.

Now, let me share my expert insights on this fascinating phenomenon.

First and foremost, you need a grand vision.

Something so mind-bogglingly revolutionary that investors can't resist throwing their money at you.

It doesn't matter if your business model is as elusive as a unicorn in the wild, as long as you can sell them the dream.

Remember, substance is overrated.

It's all about the hype.

Next, make sure to surround yourself with a team of brilliant minds who are equally skilled at spending money as you are.

Hiring top-tier talent and paying them extravagant salaries is a must.

Who cares if they lack a sense of urgency or a basic understanding of profitability?

As long as they look good on paper and can deliver impressive PowerPoint presentations, you're golden.

Now, let's talk about execution, or should I say lack thereof.

Be agile, my friend.

Pivot left, pivot right, pivot in circles - just keep pivoting.

Ignore those pesky details like market research, customer needs, and revenue generation.

Focus on scaling at all costs and expanding your user base, even if it means giving away your product for free.

Monetization is for the weak.

Lastly, never underestimate the power of irrational exuberance.

Ride the wave of hype and inflated valuations as long as you can.

Keep raising more capital, even if it means diluting your ownership to the point of insignificance.

After all, it's not about building a sustainable business; it's about becoming the next disruptor and cashing out before the house of cards collapses.

So there you have it, my friend.

The art of raising tons of venture capital and ending up with no money.

It's a delicate balance of audacity, mismanagement, and a touch of delusion.

Now, go forth and conquer the startup world with your newfound wisdom.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h4rp17ysmjew0obv', 'title': 'How can you raise lots of venture capital and then end up making no money?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Well, it's quite an art, isn't it?\n\nRaising loads of venture capital and then magically turning it into no money.\n\nIt's like a talent show for entrepreneurs - how to burn through cash without creating any actual value.\n\nNow, let me share my expert insights on this fascinating phenomenon.\n\nFirst and foremost, you need a grand vision.\n\nSomething so mind-bogglingly revolutionary that investors can't resist throwing their money at you.\n\nIt doesn't matter if your business model is as elusive as a unicorn in the wild, as long as you can sell them the dream.\n\nRemember, substance is overrated.\n\nIt's all about the hype.\n\nNext, make sure to surround yourself with a team of brilliant minds who are equally skilled at spending money as you are.\n\nHiring top-tier talent and paying them extravagant salaries is a must.\n\nWho cares if they lack a sense of urgency or a basic understanding of profitability?\n\nAs long as they look good on paper and can deliver impressive PowerPoint presentations, you're golden.\n\nNow, let's talk about execution, or should I say lack thereof.\n\nBe agile, my friend.\n\nPivot left, pivot right, pivot in circles - just keep pivoting.\n\nIgnore those pesky details like market research, customer needs, and revenue generation.\n\nFocus on scaling at all costs and expanding your user base, even if it means giving away your product for free.\n\nMonetization is for the weak.\n\nLastly, never underestimate the power of irrational exuberance.\n\nRide the wave of hype and inflated valuations as long as you can.\n\nKeep raising more capital, even if it means diluting your ownership to the point of insignificance.\n\nAfter all, it's not about building a sustainable business; it's about becoming the next disruptor and cashing out before the house of cards collapses.\n\nSo there you have it, my friend.\n\nThe art of raising tons of venture capital and ending up with no money.\n\nIt's a delicate balance of audacity, mismanagement, and a touch of delusion.\n\nNow, go forth and conquer the startup world with your newfound wisdom."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 4, 'credits': 1989195, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Well, it's quite an art, isn't it?\n\nRaising loads of venture capital and then magically turning it into no money.\n\nIt's like a talent show for entrepreneurs - how to burn through cash without creating any actual value.\n\nNow, let me share my expert insights on this fascinating phenomenon.\n\nFirst and foremost, you need a grand vision.\n\nSomething so mind-bogglingly revolutionary that investors can't resist throwing their money at you.\n\nIt doesn't matter if your business model is as elusive as a unicorn in the wild, as long as you can sell them the dream.\n\nRemember, substance is overrated.\n\nIt's all about the hype.\n\nNext, make sure to surround yourself with a team of brilliant minds who are equally skilled at spending money as you are.\n\nHiring top-tier talent and paying them extravagant salaries is a must.\n\nWho cares if they lack a sense of urgency or a basic understanding of profitability?\n\nAs long as they look good on paper and can deliver impressive PowerPoint presentations, you're golden.\n\nNow, let's talk about execution, or should I say lack thereof.\n\nBe agile, my friend.\n\nPivot left, pivot right, pivot in circles - just keep pivoting.\n\nIgnore those pesky details like market research, customer needs, and revenue generation.\n\nFocus on scaling at all costs and expanding your user base, even if it means giving away your product for free.\n\nMonetization is for the weak.\n\nLastly, never underestimate the power of irrational exuberance.\n\nRide the wave of hype and inflated valuations as long as you can.\n\nKeep raising more capital, even if it means diluting your ownership to the point of insignificance.\n\nAfter all, it's not about building a sustainable business; it's about becoming the next disruptor and cashing out before the house of cards collapses.\n\nSo there you have it, my friend.\n\nThe art of raising tons of venture capital and ending up with no money.\n\nIt's a delicate balance of audacity, mismanagement, and a touch of delusion.\n\nNow, go forth and conquer the startup world with your newfound wisdom."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Rachel Ryan,05-Sep,How does an entrepreneur know if he/she needs venture capital for his/her startup idea?,"As an expert in the field, I would respond to this question by saying that the first and most important step for any aspiring entrepreneur is to determine whether or not they actually have a good startup idea.

You see, in today's saturated market, everyone and their grandmother think they have the next big thing.

But let's be honest, most of these ideas are simply mediocre at best.

Once you've done the soul-searching and confirmed that your idea is indeed groundbreaking and revolutionary (which, trust me, is a rarity), you can start considering whether or not to pursue venture capital.

But here's the catch: venture capital is not a magic solution.

Too many entrepreneurs chase after it blindly, thinking that it's their only ticket to success.

Well, let me burst that bubble for you.

Most venture capitalists are looking for startups that have already proven themselves and have some level of traction.

They want to see revenue, customers, and a solid business model.

So, my dear entrepreneur, before you even entertain the thought of venture capital, make sure you have a truly exceptional idea and have diligently worked to turn it into a robust and revenue-generating business.

And if you're one of those who just wants to fund their wild dreams, well, good luck with that.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/runp3zgw6eqoj5am', 'title': 'How does an entrepreneur know if he/she needs venture capital for his/her startup idea?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""As an expert in the field, I would respond to this question by saying that the first and most important step for any aspiring entrepreneur is to determine whether or not they actually have a good startup idea.\n\nYou see, in today's saturated market, everyone and their grandmother think they have the next big thing.\n\nBut let's be honest, most of these ideas are simply mediocre at best.\n\nOnce you've done the soul-searching and confirmed that your idea is indeed groundbreaking and revolutionary (which, trust me, is a rarity), you can start considering whether or not to pursue venture capital.\n\nBut here's the catch: venture capital is not a magic solution.\n\nToo many entrepreneurs chase after it blindly, thinking that it's their only ticket to success.\n\nWell, let me burst that bubble for you.\n\nMost venture capitalists are looking for startups that have already proven themselves and have some level of traction.\n\nThey want to see revenue, customers, and a solid business model.\n\nSo, my dear entrepreneur, before you even entertain the thought of venture capital, make sure you have a truly exceptional idea and have diligently worked to turn it into a robust and revenue-generating business.\n\nAnd if you're one of those who just wants to fund their wild dreams, well, good luck with that."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1989192, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""As an expert in the field, I would respond to this question by saying that the first and most important step for any aspiring entrepreneur is to determine whether or not they actually have a good startup idea.\n\nYou see, in today's saturated market, everyone and their grandmother think they have the next big thing.\n\nBut let's be honest, most of these ideas are simply mediocre at best.\n\nOnce you've done the soul-searching and confirmed that your idea is indeed groundbreaking and revolutionary (which, trust me, is a rarity), you can start considering whether or not to pursue venture capital.\n\nBut here's the catch: venture capital is not a magic solution.\n\nToo many entrepreneurs chase after it blindly, thinking that it's their only ticket to success.\n\nWell, let me burst that bubble for you.\n\nMost venture capitalists are looking for startups that have already proven themselves and have some level of traction.\n\nThey want to see revenue, customers, and a solid business model.\n\nSo, my dear entrepreneur, before you even entertain the thought of venture capital, make sure you have a truly exceptional idea and have diligently worked to turn it into a robust and revenue-generating business.\n\nAnd if you're one of those who just wants to fund their wild dreams, well, good luck with that."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Hannah Scott,14-Oct,What are the best venture capital firms in LA?,"Ah, venture capital firms in LA, the land of dreams and opportunities.

Well, let me tell you, my dear questioner, LA is buzzing with all sorts of VC firms, each claiming to be the best thing since sliced bread.

But let's be real, shall we?

First up, we have the Hollywood VC, where you'll find a bunch of flashy investors who think they can predict the next big blockbuster and turn it into a billion-dollar unicorn.

They're more interested in rubbing shoulders with celebrities than actually making sound investment decisions.

Then there's the Tech Bro VC, filled with hoodie-wearing, kombucha-sipping Silicon Valley wannabes who think they're revolutionizing the world with their latest app.

But let's face it, most of their ideas are just recycled versions of what's already out there.

And of course, we can't forget about the Influencer VC, where social media followers are the primary metric for investment potential.

Because who needs a solid business plan when you can have a million Instagram followers, am I right?

Now, don't get me wrong, there are some legitimate VC firms in LA too, but they often get overshadowed by the glitz and glamour of the industry.

So my advice to you is to do your due diligence, look beyond the hype, and find those hidden gems that actually know what they're doing.

Jennifer Collins,10mo,What happens when a startup loses all the funding received from venture capitalists? What are the clauses in the contract to be aware of?,"When a startup loses all their venture capital funding, it can be a devastating experience.

Depending on the terms of the agreement between the startup and the venture capitalists, the venture capitalists may be entitled to reclaim the funds they’ve invested in the company, or they may even take ownership of the company’s assets.

Additionally, if the venture capitalists have a seat on the board or are significant shareholders, they may also be able to influence decisions about the company’s future.

It’s important for startups to understand the exact terms of their contract with venture capitalists before the funding is provided.

Clauses to be aware of include those that cover the venture capitalists’ rights in the event of a loss of funds or change in the company’s management.

A good contract will also cover the venture capitalists’ liabilities should the startup fail.

Finally, it’s important for startups to understand the exact conditions for the return of invested capital in case of a success or failure.

Knowing what to expect in the event of a disastrous loss of funding can save a startup from a financial disaster.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ehlmnqvszkuray23', 'title': 'What happens when a startup loses all the funding received from venture capitalists?
