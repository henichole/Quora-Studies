Marshall Karp,Updated 4y,What was the largest refund you ever got from a purchase?,"Twenty years ago my wife and I saw an ad in the New York Times travel section. Round trip from JFK to Barbados on the Concorde, plus a week at the hotel of your choice (there were 5 hotels to choose from).

The Concorde? Let’s do it.

We called British Airways Holidays. (It was still the early day of Internet commerce. Back in 2000 you picked up the landline.)

“We’re flexible on dates,” I told the agent. “But the hotel has to be the Fairmont Royal Pavilion.”

No problem. The agent found a date that worked and took our money (about $13,000 all in). Pricey, but hey — the Concorde.

Two nights before our departure date there was a message on our home answering machine. “This is British Airways Holidays. We’ve had to make some adjustments to your itinerary. You will now be staying at the Royal Pavilion’s sister property, Glitter Bay.”

Sister property. It sounds like kind of the same thing. Except it’s not. Royal Pavilion is for adults only. Glitter Bay is for families with kids. Lots and lots of kids. We love kids. We raised two. But the reason we picked the Royal Pavilion was because we wanted to spend a week without kids.

I called British Airways Holidays. No answer. They’re not an airline. They’re just the travel planners for the airline and work from 9 to 5. We left a voicemail.

The next morning we called the Royal Pavilion and spoke to the General Manager of both properties. He said, “British Airways does this all the time. They take your money, and then they switch your hotel. Here’s what I can do. For the same price I can put you up in a large one-bedroom private villa at Glitter Bay. It’s off the beaten path, far from the kids, an easy walk to the Royal Pavilion, and you’ll have complete access to all our facilities and amenities. I’ll send my wife over to take photos of the villa.”

An hour later I got the pictures. It was incredible. We decided to take it.

British Airways never called back. The guest relations guy who met us at the airport in Barbados never told us we’d been switched to another hotel. He drove us to Glitter Bay. Or as we called it all week, Glitter Bait and Switch.

Let me sum up that week-long vacation: The Concorde was a once in a lifetime experience. Our villa was spectacular. But still, it wasn’t what we’d signed on for.

The General Manager was a total sweetheart. He suggested that I write to British Airways, but warned me not to get my hopes up for a refund.

We’ll just see about that decided the man who writes for a living. I spent days crafting the letter. A week after I sent it I got a call from a British Airways rep in London. She apologized for the “misunderstanding,” and asked how she could make it right.

I told her I wanted a public apology. An ad in the New York Times travel section telling the world what they had done and promising not to sucker in any more people. She said, “Sir, we can’t do that.”

I told her if she didn’t I would go public on this Internet thing that was still just taking hold and tell the whole world wide web what a bunch of crooks they were.

She said, “I’ll get back to you.”

A week later she called back. “We’d like to offer you and your wife an all-expense paid trip from New York to London,” she said. “We’ll fly you there on the Concorde, put you up in a five-star hotel, and fly you back first class on a 747.”

If she had seen the look on my face, she’d have known she had me. But she couldn’t see me. So I doubled down.

“Absolutely not,” I said. “You already flew me to a hotel I didn’t want to go to. Why would I want you to fly me to another place I don’t want to go to? I want a public apology. An ad in the New York Times.”

“Let me talk to my management,” she said.

Another week passed. She called back. “Sir, we absolutely can’t print a public apology. The best we can offer you is a full refund. Airfare and your entire hotel bill including meals and other amenities and services you may have charged. If you say yes, we will credit your American Express card with the entire amount.”

I grumbled, and told her that it wasn’t what I wanted, but she’d won. I begrudgingly accepted the more than $13,000 refund.

Then I hung up, did a happy dance, and told my wife the news.

The next day I called the General Manager of the Royal Pavilion and booked their best villa for a week the following spring. Three bedrooms. Perfect for me, my wife, my son, my daughter and their significant others. The cost of the villa, along with airfare (non-supersonic) for six people — a little over $13,000.

Best all-expenses-paid vacation ever.

EDIT — Sometimes I post and hear crickets. But this one — over 100k views and 9k upvotes in less than 24 hours. That’s like Mach 2 in Quora terms. Thank you. Several people asked if they could see the letter I sent.

I’d have thought that after 20 years it would be lost to the ages, but I was amazed to see that it was still buried in my archives. It’s 1700 words, and I’d be embarrassed to reprint it. My recounting of the event on Quora was written with a smile on my face. The complaint letter is me at my pissiest.

But I can give you the highlights. Basically, the letter stated the facts. Re-reading it after 20 years, it’s clear that British Airways was even more underhanded than I remembered, so those facts were pretty damning. The manager of the Royal Pavilion taught me some of the tricks of the trade, and he explained why they waited till I was 48 hours away from departure, even though they knew they had overbooked weeks before. He also assured me that BA overbooked, not the hotel. I made sure they knew I was a very knowledgeable consumer.

My closing was this: “I feel violated and am angry enough to take my complaint to the FAA, the appropriate consumer fraud departments in New York, the travel press and travel newsgroups on the Internet. I also feel justified in pursuing legal action where I would seek compensation for both the cost of a lost vacation and for being the victim of dishonest business practices.”

But my best line was this: “Under no condition would I have considered a vacation at Glitter Bay, much less pay $13,186.90 for the privilege of living in the middle of a high rent day care center.”

It’s hard to go up against a corporate Goliath and win. But every now and then… I hope this is the kind of encouragement you need to never quit trying.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ijq93dbkgy2tn7xp', 'title': 'What was the largest refund you ever got from a purchase?', 'score': {'original': 0.37193333333333, 'ai': 0.62806666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Twenty years ago my wife and I saw an ad in the New York Times travel section.

Raaz Kumar,Updated Feb 13,What do I do if the amount deducted from Google Pay while Airtel recharge failed and still after 10 days money is not refunded?,"If you have experienced a failed Airtel recharge through Google Pay and the money has not been refunded even after 10 days, here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Check transaction status: Verify the transaction status in your Google Pay transaction history. Make sure that the transaction is indeed marked as failed and the amount was deducted.

2. Contact Airtel customer support: Reach out to Airtel customer support to report the failed transaction and request a refund. Provide them with the necessary details such as the transaction ID, date, and amount. They should be able to assist you in resolving the issue or initiating the refund process.

3. Contact Google Pay support: 9635-012811 If you do not receive a satisfactory response from Airtel or if they are unable to resolve the issue, you can contact Google Pay support. Explain the situation, provide them with the transaction details, and request their assistance in resolving the matter.

4. Escalate the issue: If both Airtel and Google Pay support are unresponsive or unable to resolve the problem, you may need to escalate the issue further. You can consider contacting consumer protection organizations or filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authority in your country. They can guide you on the next steps to take and help you resolve the matter.

Remember to keep any relevant documentation, such as transaction IDs, screenshots, or email correspondences, as evidence throughout the process. This can be useful in case you need to provide proof or escalate the matter.

It's important to note that while I strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, the specific processes and contact details may vary depending on your location and the policies of Google Pay and Airtel.

Chris Wojcik,2y,How can you learn faster?,"Here are 10 (literally) battle-tested ways that you can learn anything faster. I used these strategies to become a BJJ world champion a few years ago, a top writer on Medium, and to improve my relationships and mental health.

1. Ridiculously specific goals.

Goal-setting is everything, and most people do it wrong. “I want to be a champion” isn’t a goal, it’s a dream. Try, “I want to improve a ____ aspect of ____ skill today”. Specific goals will change your life.

2. Shock your environment.

Skill development comes at the intersection of the comfort zone and your limitations. By shocking your environment thoughtfully, you can simultaneously improve your skills without completely shattering your comfort zone.

3. Practice in public.

For martial arts, this means competing. For writing, this means publishing. Practicing in public is the ultimate way to test your skills and get a better idea of where you’re really at.

4. Quit.

Don’t quit the thing you’re trying to improve at, quit everything else that is of no use to you and your skill development. Quit bad relationships, quit draining jobs, and quit your bad habits. Quit things that drain your energy.

5. Teach other people.

When I started teaching, I didn’t get paid for it. However, the benefits I received from my early teaching was that I learned how I learn. Learning to teach helped me teach myself how to learn better.

6. Rest.

Burnout is very real, and it’s where skill development goes to die. Relax. Take a break. Take a mental vacation every once in a while. The grind will always be there. If you never take time to chill, you’ll struggle to keep up with the pace of improvement.

7. Read and write about your skill.

Writing is organized thought. Reading is the study of someone else’s organized thought. The more you study, the more you can absorb. Just remember to rest your mind too every now and again.

8. Study yourself.

Self-awareness is a bit of a doozy for some people, but if you want to get better faster, it’s a requirement. You need to know where you are in order to get better faster.

9. Micro-drilling.

I’ve been using micro-drilling to improve my BJJ technique and headline writing for a year now, and it’s changed my life. Micro-drilling is the isolated repetition and “drilling” of a specific technique or concept within a larger domain. This is the “grind” of skill development. Periodic grinding is good for you.

10. Enjoy yourself (like, for real).

At the end of the day, all of the learning we do doesn’t change the fact that our time on this earth is limited. If you struggle with the concept of your own mortality and your own limitations, you’ll also struggle with the abundance mindset that can help propel you in skill development. This sounds corny, but it’s true: the memories you make are just as important as the stuff you learn.

By shocking your environment thoughtfully, you can simultaneously improve your skills without completely shattering your comfort zone.\n\n3.

James Henderson,Sep 18,I sent some money to an online romance scammer. How can I get my money back?,"Everyone wants to find love, right? About a million people around the world use social networks and online dating apps to find someone. But many people, instead of meeting the love of their lives, stumble upon online scammers who try to trick them into sending them money.

These online romance scammers create fake accounts on online dating apps and websites or directly reach their target audience through popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram , Snapchat, Google Hangout, etc. After gaining trust, they set up fake accounts. stories to gain sympathy and ask for money. What is a romance scam?

When a person is led to believe that they are in a romantic relationship with someone they met online when in reality, their significant other is a cybercriminal using a fake identity to curry favor with them and make demands they send money or blackmail her, this is called online love scam.

**Common forms of romance scams**

Often, scammers do not provide accurate information about themselves and pretend that they are in a profession or in a more difficult place to meet. Some reasons are mentioned below:

* They were recruited as military personnel or soldiers.

* They work as doctors or medical staff abroad for charity. * They reside in any other foreign country.

* They trade internationally.

* These are businessmen or women working abroad.

* They work on an oil rig abroad.

These scammers often make up false stories so that victims can easily trust them and receive love and financial help from them, such as:

* They are seriously ill and need money for surgery or other medical expenses. * They conduct business and have an opportunity for you to invest.

* They are stuck abroad or their visa has expired and they need money for visa, airfare or other travel expenses.

* They have debts to pay and need money to pay them.

* They need cash to import and export products as well as pay customs fees.

In such cases, scammers often ask to make a bank transfer. Ask you to buy gift cards from sites like Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, and Google Cards, and send images of the gift card codes so you can use them to buy things later. The goal is that they can receive money quickly and above all anonymously.

**How ​​do I report an online dating scam?**

Have you ever thought you were being scammed online? Have you ever sent money to someone you connected with online to help them overcome a financial difference? Or is someone offering you the opportunity to invest in their business or online business? If you answered yes to any of the above questions or sent money to someone you've never met in person, you may be the target of a romance scam.

Victims of online romance scams should seek help from recovery companies like trustsiege, which will increase their chances of recovering their lost money.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bjcxa0lte5p4u8y1', 'title': 'I sent some money to an online romance scammer.

Istiaque Ahmed,Dec 2,I just bought my dog a dog bed heavy duty from Walmart for her create and she ripped it. Can I get a refund back? I just bought it.,"Oh, the trials and tribulations of pet parenthood! It seems your furry friend has put the ""heavy-duty"" claim of the dog bed to the ultimate test. Fear not, for the retail journey is often accompanied by a safety net. Let's explore the steps to potentially secure a refund for your canine's handiwork.

1. Check Walmart's Return Policy:

Before embarking on the refund quest, acquaint yourself with Walmart's return policy. This vital document details the terms and conditions regarding product returns, including timeframes and acceptable conditions.

2. Gather Proof of Purchase:

Arm yourself with the ammunition of proof—a receipt, order confirmation, or any documentation that validates your recent purchase. This evidentiary treasure is your key to unlocking the return process.

3. Inspect the Dog Bed:

While a torn dog bed might seem like a clear-cut case, ensure that the damage falls within the parameters set by Walmart's return policy. Some retailers have specific guidelines for returns, especially when it comes to pet products.

4. Contact Walmart Customer Service:

Reach out to Walmart's customer service either through their website, a phone call, or a visit to the store. Clearly articulate the situation, emphasizing that the dog bed did not withstand the anticipated ""heavy-duty"" standards.

5. Be Polite and Assertive:

Approach the situation with a mix of politeness and assertiveness. Explain the circumstances, expressing your disappointment in the product's durability. A polite demeanor often works wonders in customer service interactions.

6. Request a Refund or Exchange:

Clearly state your desired resolution—whether it's a refund, an exchange for a sturdier product, or store credit. Providing a solution will guide the customer service representative in addressing your specific needs.

7. Document Communication:

If possible, document your interactions with customer service. Note down names, dates, and a summary of the conversation. This documentation can serve as a reference if further action is required.

8. Explore Additional Avenues:

If your initial attempts don't yield results, consider escalating the matter to a supervisor or exploring alternative channels, such as social media or online reviews. Companies often prioritize customer satisfaction and may be willing to go the extra mile.

9. Learn for the Future:

Take this experience as an opportunity to learn about the durability and return policies of pet products. It might guide your future purchases, ensuring a snug and tear-resistant haven for your furry companion.

In the grand saga of retail adventures, remember that your satisfaction as a customer is a valuable melody in the symphony of commerce. With patience and persistence, you just might find a harmonious resolution to the torn dog bed saga.

Ross.Lederhman,3y,How can you learn faster?,"My entire educational and work career (a blend of financial mathematics) my learning was always the following;

Before (at university for example), a semester would start, I would have read the entire curriculum. Not only that, I would read far more outside of the usual curriculum. Ask others (wherever possible) who are practitioners in this field what it is they do, how it is they do things. I could be as blunt as approaching someone I knew who would work in a financial environment. I wouldn't ask, “help me, what is trading”, no, I would provide my logic and reasoning and wanted them to help show me where my thinking process was incorrect.
Before I would start a new job, I would try to reverse engineer work it is they do. I would do this by looking at their annual report. Its rather obvious that in the 300-page annual report, they showcase figures and text which they actually produce every day.

As a result, before day 1 at uni, or day 1 at work, I had a perception of something. Once I was taught by the actual professor or finance practitioner, I could compare, like for like. That is what I call learning. Fast learning. Proper learning.

And I felt, a result, I progressed quicker than my peers.

I wouldn't ask a professor how to derive black and scholes. I would ask him if my way would be acceptable, and I would also apply this from a practitioner point of view. Deriving radon-nikodym, vasicek, or b&s means nothing. Usefulness and weaknesses in a practitioner format means everything

I could literally read up on a whole year of history books before my semester started in high school. Or having read, practiced everything in a module, before day 1 of the semester at uni started. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what you might get taught at year 3 during your first weeks as a first year BSc student.

F# focus, f# schedules and lists and reminders. It (in my opinion) gives a false sense of control or knowing what you are doing.

Nothing prevents you, if a financial career is what you are looking for to start trading now, start reading now, and not let your life be driven by others or mentors or whatever. Practice what you read.

An example, bonds, interest rate and stock prices.

You read about a relationship. Don't take it for a blind fact.

F# that.

Download the data, do the regressions, think out loud what it is you do, and report your observations to your professor. That is how you learn.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ey2k7w3xq19pn4cg', 'title': 'How can you learn faster?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""My entire educational and work career (a blend of financial mathematics) my learning was always the following;\n\nBefore (at university for example), a semester would start, I would have read the entire curriculum.

Now if you ate the steak (especially if you finished it), then things are different. It depends on the restaurant and the management, but the best case scenario would be a discount or get a free drink or dessert. The worse case is being told to go pound sand.

1. Contact HDFC Bank Customer Care: Call HDFC Bank's customer support 9635-012811 as soon as possible to report the incorrect transaction. They can guide you through the process of reversing the transaction. The customer care number can typically be found on the bank's website or on the back of your debit/credit card.

2. Provide Transaction Details: Be prepared to provide the customer care representative with all the relevant details about the transaction, such as the date, time, and amount of the transaction, as well as the account number to which the money was mistakenly transferred.

3. Lodge a Formal Complaint: If the initial response from the customer care representative does not resolve the issue, you can consider lodging a formal complaint with HDFC Bank. They may provide you with a complaint reference number, which you should keep for future reference.

4. Follow Up: It's important to stay in touch with the bank and follow up on your complaint regularly. Keep a record of all communication, including the names of the bank representatives you speak to, their contact information, and any assurances or commitments made.

5. File a Police Complaint: If the bank is unable to resolve the issue or if there is suspicion of fraud or unauthorized transaction, you may need to file a complaint with the police. Provide them with all the relevant details, including the transaction information and any communication you've had with the bank.

6. Approach Banking Ombudsman: If all attempts to resolve the issue directly with HDFC Bank are unsuccessful, you can approach the Banking Ombudsman. The Banking Ombudsman is an independent body set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resolve customer complaints against banks.

Remember, it's crucial to act quickly and provide accurate information when reporting the incorrect transaction.

Contact your Bank customer support 9007-072-458 cases, if a POS transaction fails and the amount is debited from your bank account, the refund process typically involves the following steps: vestigation: The bank will verify the transaction details and investigate the reason for the failure. This may involve contacting the merchant or payment processor to gather information.

2. Resolution: Once the bank identifies the cause of the failed transaction, they will take the necessary steps to resolve the issue. This may include reversing the debit entry and crediting the funds back to your account.

3. Timeframe: The time it takes for the refund to be processed can vary. In some cases, it may be resolved within a few business days, while in other instances, it may take longer, potentially up to a few weeks. The exact timeline can depend on the complexity of the case, the bank's internal processes, and any external factors involved.

Amanda Kevin,Aug 30,"If you request a refund on Airbnb and then block your account, will you still receive the refund?","If you request a refund on Airbnb and then block your account, will you still receive the refund?

So, unless you have some secret teleporting technology that allows funds to materialize in thin air, blocking your account won't change a thing.

It's like expecting a lion not to roar just because you covered your ears.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but refunds work based on the payment channel, not on your social media preferences or account blocking skills.

Amanda Kevin,Oct 8,Can I get a refund for an Airbnb if I need to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances?,"As an expert in property image enhancement, it's quite amusing to see this question pop up on Quora.

The concept of getting a refund for an Airbnb booking due to unforeseen circumstances is like expecting a unicorn to deliver your groceries.

I mean, come on!

Life happens, and sometimes plans change, but expecting a full refund simply because things didn't go as planned is a bit unrealistic, don't you think?

Now, don't get me wrong, I understand that unforeseen circumstances can genuinely disrupt your travel plans.

But let's be honest here, Airbnb hosts are not fortune tellers.

They can't predict the future or foresee the unexpected events that might come your way.

So, while it's always worth reaching out to your host and explaining the situation, expecting a refund is like hoping for a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.

My advice?

Embrace travel insurance and read the cancellation policies before booking.

It's better to be prepared than to rely on the generosity of others in uncertain times.

Julian Edith,Updated Oct 12,"Despite the strict operations of the local, federal, and international authorities, scammers still find a way to scam victims. Are there any chances of getting your money back if you ever get scammed?","A relative of mine lost money to a tech-support swindle, a common scheme with many variants. Often, it starts when the mark gets a call from someone offering unsolicited help in getting rid of a malware on a computer’s hard drive or the likes. Being completely ignorant of technical complications, my aunt gave a stranger access to her banking information and lost everything she had in that account within a flash.

There’s a limit to what the authorities can do to prevent scams because we as individuals also have a role to play as well as a level of control over our finances so a little error or ignorance on our part could result in losing loads of our finances to scams. In the unfortunate event of falling victim to a scam, communities such as scamreveal/net has been set up to give victims a platform to be specific about their experiences and aid victims’ access to their stolen finances while also building enough evidence to apprehend perpetrators who hide behind the veil of anonymity afforded by the internet.

Greed is another reason people still lose money to scams despite the strict operations of the authorities. I once read about a finance officer, quite savvy minded when it came to money. He was confident he knew how to spot the warning signs of a scam. After searching the internet for high-return bonds, he received a call the next day about investing in student accommodation. He found legitimate details of the company online, everything seemed genuine, so he invested. A few months later, after a couple more investments, he started to get a bit worried as he still hadn’t received confirmation of the latest investment. He tried to call the contacts he had been speaking with, but the numbers were invalid.

For those wondering, I refused to eat my order when it finally arrived and did not pay for it either even though it was a company expense. I made it quite clear I knew what they were doing and that I thought it was disgraceful.

Carrie,Updated 1y,"If a meal takes an excessively long time to be served in a restaurant, is it acceptable to tell the waiter that you no longer want it as it’s taking too long and ask for a refund?","My husband and I took our son and his girlfriend to a new Mexican place near our local movie theater. When we got there, it was busy, but not full, and we were seated quickly.

We had prepared ahead of time by looking the menu up online and everyone knew what they wanted. We informed the server that we had a movie beginning in one hour, so we had a hard cutoff time. Then, we ordered appetizers for the table, drinks and meals.

The drinks came out, then one of the appetizers.

We nibbled on that one, and waited on the second appetizer.

30 minutes later, we still hadn’t been offered refills on our drinks when a different server buzzed by and dropped off the second appetizer.

Meanwhile, tables around us were being served, and even packing up to leave, even though they were seated after us. Something was definitely off.

I was starting to wonder if we were going to ever get our entrees. We flagged our server down, reminded him that we needed to be out in less than 30 minutes and asked him to check on our meals.

He didn’t come back for a long time, when he did, he said it would be only about 10–15 more minutes for our food. I know enough about Mexican cooking to know that meant the kitchen hadn’t even started our entrees, and wouldn’t be starting them for a while.

We told him to cancel and just bring a check for the appetizers and drinks immediately as there was no way we would have time to eat and still make it to our movie.

I felt 100% justified in that request. We made it clear up front we had a time limit. If the restaurant wasn’t going to be able to meet that, they had every opportunity to tell us before it got to that point.

The owner seemed to agree. She comped our bill that night and gave us a discount for our next visit.

ETA - just because people want to bitch.

By “drinks” I mean two waters, one iced tea and one Diet Coke.

Appetizers were chips and guacamole - filled at the server station and empanadas, which yes, have to be fried in the kitchen, that’s why we didn’t mind the guac coming out first.

Entrees were street tacos - the house specialty.

We watched tables get seated after us, have drinks and apps immediately, and get their entrees before we even got our second appetizer. There was a distinct failure on our ticket - I don’t know or CARE whose fault it was. We offered to pay for what we were served and didn’t ask for special treatment.

This wasn’t some kind of “fine dining” experience - its a restaurant that opened next door to an AMC theater with the expectation that people would often be eating before their movies.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5n2zi01yde6oxb9m', 'title': 'If a meal takes an excessively long time to be served in a restaurant, is it acceptable to tell the waiter that you no longer want it as it’s taking too long and ask for a refund?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My husband and I took our son and his girlfriend to a new Mexican place near our local movie theater.

Jae Alexis Lee,7y,"What is the best way to tell a customer ""no"" to an unreasonable request for financial compensation?","“You can start by giving me a refund of 50% of everything I’ve ever paid your company for the past six years, and then….”

It was, I don’t know, another Tuesday and I was talking to yet another customer who was being a little… let’s say over the top with the amount of a refund he felt he was entitled to for what he perceived as substandard service he had received. In my line of work at the time, as a manager of a line of business that talked to customers who were pre-selected to be likely to be angry before they even called us, much less the point where they’d demanded to talk to a manager… this wasn’t really that unusual of a shouted demand.

So how do you handle customers making unreasonable demands for financial compensation?

Don’t confront the demand directly… at least not yet.

Customers assert their right to unreasonably large financial compensation on a regular basis. That said, telling the customer they’re being unreasonable will only put you directly into conflict with the customer and that’s not a place where you want to be. Saying things like “that’s not going to happen” or “that’s unreasonable” are confrontational and does nothing to enable communication between you and the customer, much less progress towards resolution of the customer’s issue. When the customer makes an unreasonable request for financial compensation, acknowledge it but don’t confront it, we’ll get to that later.

Understand the motive.

Once you’ve acknowledge the customer’s request, you need to understand what informs that request. What’s your customer thinking? Why do they feel like you owe them that much money?

Your job right now isn’t to judge their thinking, it’s to understand their thinking. Did your product or service do damage to their property? Are they dissatisfied with the quality of service? What’s driving this feeling that they are owed substantial financial compensation?

Listen, pay attention, and don’t argue. Not yet. If you don’t understand the customer you’re just going to get into conflict with them and if you can’t empathize with their feelings on the issue then they won’t listen to you when you tell them no. Ask clarifying questions: How long have you been having problems? What were you using the product for when it failed? etc. Make sure you’ve got a really good understanding of what they’ve experienced and what they’re feeling about it.

I’ll see what I can do.

Reassure the customer that you are their advocate and you’re going to make sure that you and your company do right by them. Notice I didn’t say to reassure them that you’re going to give them the money they asked for? Don’t say that, you know the request isn’t reasonable, don’t make a promise to them that you can’t keep.

What you can and should promise the customer is that you’re going to take care of them. That you’re going to make sure their issue is addressed. That’s why you’re here after all! Customers want the reassurance that something will be done.

But what, exactly, do you do?

Strategy.

You need to put together a resolution for your customer. That may not even be financial compensation, or it may be compensation that’s less than what they’re asking for. You know what tools you have to work with to resolve issues and I highly suggest that customer service reps work with their management and management work with their senior leadership to build strategies well in advance for common complaints so that everyone involved knows what you’re able to do for a customer.

One of the biggest keys of your strategy that I see go wrong so frequently is this. If you learn nothing else here than remember this line:

Solve problems before you compensate the customer.

I cannot emphasize this enough. Make your customer whole then you can talk about compensation. Throwing money at the customer is rarely a solution. If the customer complains because their service is poor and you give them a discount, what have you done to improve their service? Nothing. The only thing you’ve done is make them feel like your service isn’t worth what they were paying for it. While they may accept the money, if you haven’t resolved the problem they’re just going to get angry again when either the discount goes away or when the service quality issues once again cross their threshold of ‘bad enough to complain about.’

Whatever reason the customer has given you for wanting compensation, you need to resolve their underlying issues as part of your strategy.

Get them on your side.

Delivering an actual solution for their problem is the first step in building real trust and customer faith in you as the person to handle things for them. That’s important. Once they see you taking action to address their issues the customers feeling of needing that unreasonable sum of money start to fade. If you are going to be able to compensate them financially you may make mention that you’re going to take care of that once the root issues are resolved but that your first priority is to make sure that they have functional product and / or service. Take care of the root causes, it will build customer faith in you and goodwill and you’re going to need that to say ‘no’ to the unreasonable demand.

Explain what’s going to happen with their request for financial compensation.

Before you mention a dollar figure you want them to understand what that dollar figure is based on. Dollar figures should never be communicated as “this is the maximum amount my manager can authorize”… things like that just get the customer asking for your boss’s boss on the theory that someone higher up can say yes to more money.

Instead, explain the basis of the compensation you’re able to offer them. Saying things like “I’m going to refund what you paid for every day you were without service” tells the customer that the financial compensation they’re going to get is proportional to the loss.

You may also need to set boundaries at this stage: “we can only issue refunds for issues within the past X amount of time.” Mister 50% for six years that I mentioned in the beginning? He’d renewed his service agreement twice in that time… if it was so bad that he didn’t want to pay for it, he should have left at the first renewal instead of signing on for another two years and once his service issue had been addressed even he could agree that he had opportunities for remedy long before now and that going back to the very beginning wasn’t reasonable.

Frame your boundaries as positive statements about what you can do rather than what you can’t. Saying “I can refund for the past X periods” instead of “I can’t go back further than Y.”

Whatever you are (or aren’t) going to offer them for compensation, you want their buy in before you get to a dollar figure. Saying “I can refund you for every day you were without service” sounds reasonable. Saying “I’m going to refund you $4.63” doesn’t cary the same weight with the customer. You want to come to agreement with them that the compensation amount is going to be fair or reasonable given their problem without them thinking about the actual amount of money. When you do get to the dollar amount if you have their buy in for the way their compensation will be calculated they push back very little on the resulting number.

Whatever you do, do right by your customer.

One of the managers I most respected once told a customer: “You may not like me, lots of people don’t like me, but I promise you that I’m going to work very hard to make sure that you have high quality service and that you pay a fair price for that service. I promise you that if things are broken we’ll fix them as quickly as they can be fixed. We’re going to take care of you as a customer and while you may not like me or some of the things I need to tell you I promise you that at the end of the day we’re not going to leave you high and dry.”

Customers rarely like us when we tell them ‘no.’ What they like even less though is paying for products and services that have failed them. Giving them their money back doesn’t make them 100% whole. They still came to you with a need for your product or service and until you’ve delivered that you won’t have satisfied your customer. But once you do deliver on that you’ll find that the customer’s need for compensation is greatly reduced because really, when they started yelling about half their money back for six years they didn’t really want a pile of cash… they just wanted to have their needs met, and that’s exactly what we’re all in the business of doing.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a4mif0jv7poz5q1c', 'title': 'What is the best way to tell a customer ""no"" to an unreasonable request for financial compensation?', 'score': {'original': 0.9181, 'ai': 0.0819}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“You can start by giving me a refund of 50% of everything I’ve ever paid your company for the past six years, and then….”\n\nIt was, I don’t know, another Tuesday and I was talking to yet another customer who was being a little… let’s say over the top with the amount of a refund he felt he was entitled to for what he perceived as substandard service he had received.

Amanda Kevin,Oct 5,Why does Airbnb have makes the first 30 days non-refundable? Does the host keep the money?,"As an expert in the field, I can tell you that Airbnb's decision to make the first 30 days non-refundable is simply mind-boggling.

It's almost as if they want to encourage hosts to keep the money regardless of the circumstances.

I mean, who needs flexibility and consumer protection anyway, right?

But seriously, this policy seems to prioritize the hosts' financial gain over the guests' peace of mind.

It's like saying, Hey, go ahead and book with us, but if anything goes wrong or you change your mind within the first month, tough luck!

We'll happily pocket your hard-earned money.In my opinion, this approach is not customer-friendly at all.

It's important for platforms like Airbnb to strike a balance between protecting the interests of both hosts and guests.

Making the first 30 days non-refundable only benefits the hosts while leaving the guests vulnerable.

It's high time Airbnb reevaluates this policy and puts more emphasis on fairness and customer satisfaction.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hyxt7zedn25qv4ij', 'title': 'Why does Airbnb have makes the first 30 days non-refundable?

Jane Reeves,Jan 7,How long does it take for a refund on a credit card from Airbnb when a host canceled after taking the reservation?,"I'm not Anna Fischer, but I can still help you with your question.

When it comes to refunds on a credit card from Airbnb, the time it takes for the refund to process can vary.

Typically, Airbnb states that refunds can take up to 10 business days to appear on your credit card statement.

However, in some cases, it may take longer due to processing times with your credit card company or bank.

If your host canceled after taking the reservation, it's important to contact Airbnb's customer support team as soon as possible to initiate the refund process.

Once you've done that, you can check the status of your refund by logging into your Airbnb account and going to the Trips section.

From there, you should be able to see if the refund has been processed and when it's expected to hit your credit card.

Now, I know it can be frustrating to wait for a refund, especially when you're counting on that money to cover other expenses.

But it's important to remember that refund processing times are largely out of Airbnb's control and depend on a variety of factors, including your credit card company or bank's policies.

So, try to be patient and keep an eye on your credit card statement for the refund to appear.

And if you have any issues or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to Airbnb's customer support team for assistance.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8k9x3uw6e5chjz72', 'title': 'How long does it take for a refund on a credit card from Airbnb when a host canceled after taking the reservation?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I'm not Anna Fischer, but I can still help you with your question.\n\nWhen it comes to refunds on a credit card from Airbnb, the time it takes for the refund to process can vary.\n\nTypically, Airbnb states that refunds can take up to 10 business days to appear on your credit card statement.\n\nHowever, in some cases, it may take longer due to processing times with your credit card company or bank.\n\nIf your host canceled after taking the reservation, it's important to contact Airbnb's customer support team as soon as possible to initiate the refund process.\n\nOnce you've done that, you can check the status of your refund by logging into your Airbnb account and going to the Trips section.\n\nFrom there, you should be able to see if the refund has been processed and when it's expected to hit your credit card.\n\nNow, I know it can be frustrating to wait for a refund, especially when you're counting on that money to cover other expenses.\n\nBut it's important to remember that refund processing times are largely out of Airbnb's control and depend on a variety of factors, including your credit card company or bank's policies.\n\nSo, try to be patient and keep an eye on your credit card statement for the refund to appear.\n\nAnd if you have any issues or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to Airbnb's customer support team for assistance."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1980218, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""I'm not Anna Fischer, but I can still help you with your question.\n\nWhen it comes to refunds on a credit card from Airbnb, the time it takes for the refund to process can vary.\n\nTypically, Airbnb states that refunds can take up to 10 business days to appear on your credit card statement.\n\nHowever, in some cases, it may take longer due to processing times with your credit card company or bank.\n\nIf your host canceled after taking the reservation, it's important to contact Airbnb's customer support team as soon as possible to initiate the refund process.\n\nOnce you've done that, you can check the status of your refund by logging into your Airbnb account and going to the Trips section.\n\nFrom there, you should be able to see if the refund has been processed and when it's expected to hit your credit card.\n\nNow, I know it can be frustrating to wait for a refund, especially when you're counting on that money to cover other expenses.\n\nBut it's important to remember that refund processing times are largely out of Airbnb's control and depend on a variety of factors, including your credit card company or bank's policies.\n\nSo, try to be patient and keep an eye on your credit card statement for the refund to appear.\n\nAnd if you have any issues or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to Airbnb's customer support team for assistance."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Amanda Kevin,Sep 1,"If my Airbnb host backed out of an initial agreement, can I raise a dispute and get back a full refund?","Well, well, well.

Looks like we've got another flaky Airbnb host on our hands.

Fear not, my dear traveler, for you do have options!

You can indeed raise a dispute and potentially get a full refund if your host reneges on their initial agreement.

But, let's be real, wouldn't it be nice if hosts just followed through on their promises in the first place?

Here's my two cents: hosts, please hold up your end of the bargain.

Travelers, protect yourself by reviewing cancellation policies and communicating clearly with your host before booking.

And if all else fails, don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and your hard-earned coins.

Allison Allen,Oct 1,Why are some travel firms and airlines refusing to issue refunds?,"As an expert in AI audio transcription, it's quite amusing to see travel firms and airlines refusing to issue refunds.

I mean, who needs money back when you can just keep it, right?

It's not like people deserve to be reimbursed for services they didn't receive or flights that were canceled due to unforeseen circumstances.

Let's just hold on to that hard-earned cash and leave customers hanging.

Brilliant business strategy!But seriously, it's mind-boggling how some companies prioritize their own profits over customer satisfaction and basic decency.

Refusing to issue refunds is a surefire way to lose trust and tarnish your reputation.

Maybe these travel firms and airlines should take a page out of the AI transcription book and focus on providing error-free and efficient service.

After all, customer loyalty and goodwill are worth much more in the long run.

James Henderson,Sep 18,How can I get my money back from a binary options scam?,"Binary options trading scams falsely advertise high investment returns from trading at a binary options company. These scams often target unsuspecting people who want to make money in the binary options market but have no idea how binary options trading works.

Scammers may use tactics such as offering free training, presenting a perfect fake trading system and pressuring newbies to make larger investments or promising unrealistic profits . This is why you need to conduct thorough research before investing in any financial product. Also, be wary of unsolicited offers or unrealistic promises of high profits.

**5 common binary options scams;**

There are many scams used in binary options trading that you should know about, such as the following:

**1; Get-rich-quick scams; **

These companies often pressure investors to make large investments and may even use high-pressure sales tactics to persuade investors to invest more money.

**2; Free training scam; **

This scam involves companies offering free training or education on binary options trading, but then pressuring investors to make large investments or use an options trading platform. Choose their binary.

These companies may also provide false or misleading information to investors, which could lead to financial losses.

**3; Managed account fraud; **

This scam involves companies offering to manage your account and make transactions on your behalf. These companies may promise high investment returns and may even provide fake business profiles to convince investors to invest. However, these companies often make all the profits, leaving investors with significant losses.

**4; Signal provider fraud; **

This scam consists of companies providing signals to traders to help them make profitable trades. These companies may charge high fees for these signals but they often provide false or misleading information that can lead to financial losses.

**5; Broker fraud ;**

This scam involves companies acting as binary options brokers and taking customers' money but never making any trades. They can also create losing trades and quickly disappear with the money.

Therefore, avoid unsolicited offers or unrealistic promises of high returns and invest only with regulated and reputable brokers.

**Seek expert advice.**

Amanda Kevin,Jan 28,"What should I do if my Airbnb renter is trying to bribe me? They say they want a refund of $500.00(30%) for their 3-night stay because they saw a mouse, lost power, and weren’t warm enough. If I don’t give a refund they will leave a negative review.","I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're facing with your Airbnb renter.

It's never easy to deal with guests who make unreasonable demands or try to take advantage of you.

However, it's important to handle this situation with professionalism and assertiveness.

First of all, I would recommend documenting all communication with the renter and gathering any evidence that could support your case.

This could include taking pictures or videos of the property to show that it was in good condition before the renter arrived, as well as keeping a record of any emails or messages exchanged between you.

As for the bribe offer, I would advise you to politely decline and stand firm on your cancellation policy.

Offering a refund under these circumstances could set a dangerous precedent and encourage other renters to make similar demands in the future.

Instead, I would suggest offering a solution that addresses the renter's concerns while still protecting your interests.

For example, you could offer to provide extra heating or cleaning services to make the property more comfortable, or you could offer to reduce the price of their stay if they agree to leave a positive review.

Ultimately, the key to handling this situation is to remain calm and confident, and to prioritize the long-term reputation and success of your Airbnb business over short-term gains.

Good luck!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ex3asutyfr4c69gl', 'title': 'What should I do if my Airbnb renter is trying to bribe me?

Stephanie Tyler,Dec 7,I’ve paid more for the Photoshop monthly subscription than the one-time license payment costs. Am I eligible for a refund for the difference?,"In my expert opinion, expecting a refund for the price difference between a monthly Photoshop subscription and a one-time license payment is like asking for a refund on a cup of coffee because you found a cheaper brand at the grocery store.

It's simply not how things work in the world of software licensing.

When you choose a subscription-based service like Photoshop, you're paying for the convenience of regular updates, technical support, and access to the latest features.

It's like having a barista make your coffee just the way you like it every morning.

On the other hand, a one-time license payment gives you the software as it is at the time of purchase, without any future updates or support.

So, while it's understandable to want the best value for your money, it's important to consider the benefits and value that come with each payment option.

In the grand scheme of things, the difference in cost between a monthly subscription and a one-time license payment is a small price to pay for the ongoing benefits and convenience that a subscription provides.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ydarsmf3x9etb18n', 'title': 'I’ve paid more for the Photoshop monthly subscription than the one-time license payment costs.

Amanda Kevin,6mo,What has been your experience with Airbnb for a refund if you were unsatisfied with the accommodations?,"As an expert in the field, I can tell you that my experience with Airbnb refunds has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride.

It's like playing a game of chance, where the odds are never in your favor.

You book a place, hoping for a cozy retreat, only to find yourself stuck in a rundown shack with faulty plumbing and questionable hygiene standards.

When it comes to requesting a refund, be prepared to enter a labyrinth of bureaucratic hoops and endless back-and-forth with customer service.

It's like trying to navigate a maze blindfolded, with no clear path to success.

And even if you manage to present a compelling case, there's no guarantee that you'll receive a satisfactory resolution.

So, my dear friend, if you're looking for a smooth and hassle-free refund process, I suggest you look elsewhere.

Airbnb may have its merits, but their refund policies leave much to be desired.

Save yourself the frustration and opt for more reliable alternatives.

Lucia Welch,Jan 25,What can senior citizens do if a tour and travels company does not refund their money for a cancelled trip?,"Dear concerned senior citizen,I'm truly sorry to hear about your difficulty in obtaining a refund from a tour and travel company for your cancelled trip.

It's unfortunate that some businesses take advantage of vulnerable populations, such as seniors, who may not be as tech-savvy or familiar with their rights.

Firstly, I would recommend checking the company's refund policy, which should be clearly stated on their website or in your booking confirmation.

If the policy is not in your favor, you can try negotiating with the company directly, explaining your situation and appealing to their sense of empathy.

If negotiations fail, I would suggest filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or your local consumer protection agency.

These organizations can help mediate the dispute and may be able to secure a refund on your behalf.

Additionally, consider reaching out to your credit card company or bank to dispute the charge and request a chargeback.

This can be an effective way to recoup your losses, especially if the company is not responding to your requests for a refund.

Lastly, if all else fails, you may want to consider seeking legal counsel to explore your options for pursuing a lawsuit against the company.

While this may be a more drastic measure, it's important to stand up for your rights as a consumer and hold companies accountable for their actions.

Best of luck, and I hope you are able to recover your hard-earned money.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/uw3e0r6fnvqopz12', 'title': 'What can senior citizens do if a tour and travels company does not refund their money for a cancelled trip?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Dear concerned senior citizen,I'm truly sorry to hear about your difficulty in obtaining a refund from a tour and travel company for your cancelled trip.\n\nIt's unfortunate that some businesses take advantage of vulnerable populations, such as seniors, who may not be as tech-savvy or familiar with their rights.\n\nFirstly, I would recommend checking the company's refund policy, which should be clearly stated on their website or in your booking confirmation.\n\nIf the policy is not in your favor, you can try negotiating with the company directly, explaining your situation and appealing to their sense of empathy.\n\nIf negotiations fail, I would suggest filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or your local consumer protection agency.\n\nThese organizations can help mediate the dispute and may be able to secure a refund on your behalf.\n\nAdditionally, consider reaching out to your credit card company or bank to dispute the charge and request a chargeback.\n\nThis can be an effective way to recoup your losses, especially if the company is not responding to your requests for a refund.\n\nLastly, if all else fails, you may want to consider seeking legal counsel to explore your options for pursuing a lawsuit against the company.\n\nWhile this may be a more drastic measure, it's important to stand up for your rights as a consumer and hold companies accountable for their actions.\n\nBest of luck, and I hope you are able to recover your hard-earned money."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1980136, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Dear concerned senior citizen,I'm truly sorry to hear about your difficulty in obtaining a refund from a tour and travel company for your cancelled trip.\n\nIt's unfortunate that some businesses take advantage of vulnerable populations, such as seniors, who may not be as tech-savvy or familiar with their rights.\n\nFirstly, I would recommend checking the company's refund policy, which should be clearly stated on their website or in your booking confirmation.\n\nIf the policy is not in your favor, you can try negotiating with the company directly, explaining your situation and appealing to their sense of empathy.\n\nIf negotiations fail, I would suggest filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or your local consumer protection agency.\n\nThese organizations can help mediate the dispute and may be able to secure a refund on your behalf.\n\nAdditionally, consider reaching out to your credit card company or bank to dispute the charge and request a chargeback.\n\nThis can be an effective way to recoup your losses, especially if the company is not responding to your requests for a refund.\n\nLastly, if all else fails, you may want to consider seeking legal counsel to explore your options for pursuing a lawsuit against the company.\n\nWhile this may be a more drastic measure, it's important to stand up for your rights as a consumer and hold companies accountable for their actions.\n\nBest of luck, and I hope you are able to recover your hard-earned money."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Jamie Perkins,Feb 5,"I accidently cancelled a non-refundable hotel reservation and How do I re-instate the reservation or get a refund (I booked through expedia and cancelled through expedia, but hotel says my reservation is not cancelled in the system yet ?","I'm sorry to hear about the inconvenience you're experiencing with your hotel reservation.

When you cancel a non-refundable reservation, it's generally not possible to reinstate it, as the room has likely been resold to another guest.

However, it's worth reaching out to both Expedia and the hotel directly to see if there's anything that can be done.

In terms of getting a refund, it's important to note that non-refundable reservations are typically just that - non-refundable.

If you accidentally cancelled your reservation, it's possible that the hotel may be able to reinstate it for an additional fee, but again, this is not guaranteed.

Moving forward, I would recommend being extra careful when canceling reservations in the future.

Double-check that you've selected the correct reservation before clicking the cancel button, and make sure to read through the cancellation policy carefully before booking.

Brittany Alex,Jan 24,How long does it take to get a refund from Southwest Airlines?,"Dear Quora user,Oh, Southwest Airlines refunds, where do I even begin?

If you're lucky, it might take a few days to a week.

But if you're not, well, buckle up, because it could be a long and bumpy ride.

You see, Southwest has this quirky little policy where they don't guarantee on-time performance, and it seems like they've extended that same principle to refunds.

But don't worry, I'm sure they're just swamped with requests from all the passengers who were delayed on their flights or experienced those infamous cancellations.

Amanda Kevin,Feb 2,"Airbnb-hosts wants to reduce rooms, can we get refund?","While I understand the financial pressures that may lead Airbnb hosts to consider requesting a refund for unused rooms, I would like to clarify that Colossis.io does not provide legal or financial advice.

However, I can offer some insights based on my experience in the property imaging industry.

First and foremost, it's important to review Airbnb's cancellation policy, which hosts agree to when they create their listings.

This policy outlines the circumstances under which hosts can cancel a reservation and potentially receive a refund.

If a host needs to reduce the number of rooms available for booking, they should consider adjusting their listing accordingly and communicating any changes to guests in a transparent and timely manner.

That being said, I would caution against expecting a refund for unused rooms as a matter of course.

Airbnb's platform is designed to facilitate short-term rentals, and hosts are expected to manage their listings accordingly.

If a host finds themselves unable to fulfill their obligations to guests, it may be more appropriate to consider adjusting their listing or temporarily suspending their availability rather than seeking a refund for unused rooms.

Ultimately, it's up to Airbnb and its users to determine the appropriate course of action in these situations, and I would encourage hosts to review their options carefully before taking any decisive action.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2fumnetc65qxsr08', 'title': 'Airbnb-hosts wants to reduce rooms, can we get refund?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""While I understand the financial pressures that may lead Airbnb hosts to consider requesting a refund for unused rooms, I would like to clarify that Colossis.io does not provide legal or financial advice.\n\nHowever, I can offer some insights based on my experience in the property imaging industry.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's important to review Airbnb's cancellation policy, which hosts agree to when they create their listings.\n\nThis policy outlines the circumstances under which hosts can cancel a reservation and potentially receive a refund.\n\nIf a host needs to reduce the number of rooms available for booking, they should consider adjusting their listing accordingly and communicating any changes to guests in a transparent and timely manner.\n\nThat being said, I would caution against expecting a refund for unused rooms as a matter of course.\n\nAirbnb's platform is designed to facilitate short-term rentals, and hosts are expected to manage their listings accordingly.\n\nIf a host finds themselves unable to fulfill their obligations to guests, it may be more appropriate to consider adjusting their listing or temporarily suspending their availability rather than seeking a refund for unused rooms.\n\nUltimately, it's up to Airbnb and its users to determine the appropriate course of action in these situations, and I would encourage hosts to review their options carefully before taking any decisive action."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1980124, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""While I understand the financial pressures that may lead Airbnb hosts to consider requesting a refund for unused rooms, I would like to clarify that Colossis.io does not provide legal or financial advice.\n\nHowever, I can offer some insights based on my experience in the property imaging industry.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's important to review Airbnb's cancellation policy, which hosts agree to when they create their listings.\n\nThis policy outlines the circumstances under which hosts can cancel a reservation and potentially receive a refund.\n\nIf a host needs to reduce the number of rooms available for booking, they should consider adjusting their listing accordingly and communicating any changes to guests in a transparent and timely manner.\n\nThat being said, I would caution against expecting a refund for unused rooms as a matter of course.\n\nAirbnb's platform is designed to facilitate short-term rentals, and hosts are expected to manage their listings accordingly.\n\nIf a host finds themselves unable to fulfill their obligations to guests, it may be more appropriate to consider adjusting their listing or temporarily suspending their availability rather than seeking a refund for unused rooms.\n\nUltimately, it's up to Airbnb and its users to determine the appropriate course of action in these situations, and I would encourage hosts to review their options carefully before taking any decisive action."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Evelyn Holland,Jan 18,"Is ""Dubai Jobs"" real or is it a scam? I can’t get them to refund the money it says they will do in their website.","I'm not Ayako Sato, but I can still provide some insight on this matter.

Dubai Jobs is just one of the many job search platforms available online, and like any other site, it has its own set of pros and cons.

However, if you've already paid for a service and didn't receive the refund as promised on their website, it's reasonable to be concerned about their legitimacy.

It's important to remember that no reputable job search platform should ask you for money upfront.

Legitimate employers will cover the costs associated with hiring, such as background checks or drug screening, not the job seekers.

So, if a website is asking for your money, it's a major red flag.

Moreover, if Dubai Jobs is refusing to refund your money, it's a clear sign of unprofessional behavior, and you should consider reporting them to the authorities.

In the meantime, I would recommend looking for job opportunities on more established and trustworthy job search platforms.

Remember, your time and money are valuable, so always be cautious and do your research before using any online service.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5lxk7fatv9y20qdr', 'title': 'Is ""Dubai Jobs"" real or is it a scam?

Daniel Allen,Feb 5,How can I get a refund for my non-refundable airline ticket if I have to cancel my vacation?,"While I understand the frustration of having to cancel a vacation and wanting to recoup some of the costs, it's important to remember that non-refundable means just that.

Airlines have strict policies in place for a reason, and unfortunately, there are no guaranteed ways to get a refund for a non-refundable ticket.

That being said, there are a few strategies you can try.

First, check the airline's cancellation policy to see if there are any exceptions or loopholes that might apply to your situation.

Some airlines may offer a partial refund or credit towards future travel if you cancel within a certain time frame or if the flight is significantly delayed or cancelled.

Additionally, you can try contacting the airline directly to see if they will make an exception to their policy.

It's worth a shot, but be prepared for a firm no.

Remember to be polite and persistent, but don't get your hopes up too high.

In the end, the best way to avoid this situation is to purchase travel insurance or a refundable ticket in the first place.

Yes, it may cost a bit more upfront, but it can save you a lot of headache and heartache in the long run.
