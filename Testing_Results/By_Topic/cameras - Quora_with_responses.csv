Saharsh Chordia,Updated 6y,Is there any interesting thing accidentally caught on your camera?,"Reflections never lie. Who said that?! The below one does lie!

Story behind the pic:

I was in Mumbai around Oct 2010 and went to Marine Drive for a stroll (Well, who wouldn’t do that in Mumbai!) With some more time to kill, we visited the Wankhede stadium, because why not! (After all, this was going to be the place where India was going to re-write history, just 4 months later!) It was under renovation and security guards were convinced that we three young bachelors without any bags are incapable of putting the place under any threat. So they allowed us to go inside. Outside the BCCI office, this countdown timer was on for World Cup 2011 [Yes, the one that India won! :) ]. I randomly clicked a photo of the countdown timer on my mobile phone cam (It was Sony Ericsson W595, with a basic 3 MP camera).

The Voila Moment!

It was much later that I realized that the seconds readings in clock and reflection are different! While the time on clock shows 18:03:51, the reflection captures 18:03:52! Similarly, the countdown in clock shows 8 seconds left, and reflection says 7 seconds to go! Reflection was a second ahead of the actual clock (as per the pic, at least).

Now what kind of a time precision is required to capture that, reiterating, on a 3 Megapixel mobile phone camera! (Those were the good ol’ non smartphone days!)

Edit 1:

There are a lot of comments on how it happened! Infact, thanks to User-13002019950956116690, Naman Sharma and User-11445680367544107775 and Tathagata Biswas, my own understanding enhanced on this! This is how it happens:

Cameras have rolling shutter feature. That means it captures the image like a scanner. One horizontal line at a time, from top to bottom. So till the time my camera reached the bottom of actual clock, the clock had shown 8 seconds in countdown and 51 seconds on the top (actual time). Once the shutter crossed it, the countdown changed to 7 and actual time on top changed to 52. Before the shutter could reach the reflection of the clock, light had reached there! After all, who can match 299792458 m/s speed! So now when the shutter line reaches reflection, it reads 7 and 52 in countdown and actual time respectively.

And how much time would this situation exist for? That comes to about 2.5 milliseconds (0.0025 seconds). I assumed that the shutter speed of the camera was 1/60 seconds (which is an average speed for basic cameras). That means the shutter scanned the whole image from top to bottom in 1/60 seconds. Roughly assuming the vertical distance covered by shutter to be 20 ft (10 ft above ground, and 10 ft in reflection) the

Speed of shutter = 1200 ft/s

The shutter should be between the actual countdown and the reflection to capture this change. Otherwise, it will capture same number in reflection as well. Assuming the lowest part of ‘08’ in countdown is 1.5 ft above the ground, that distance would be 3 ft (1.5 ft above ground, 1.5 in reflection). So,

Distance to be covered = 3 ft

Hence,

Time = 3/1200 = 0.0025 seconds, or 2.5 milliseconds.

So I have to capture the image within the 2.5 millisecond time for this to happen. Also, I understand that the actual distance the shutter would travel is much shorter! After all, I don’t have 20 ft of space on my mobile for the shutter to roll. But that distance would be in proportion with the distance covered in image (Neglecting spherical effects of lens).

Thanks for 15k+ upvotes!

PS: This is an accidental photo and I myself believe that such a photo cannot be deliberately taken with a mobile cam. It has to be a superlative degree of coincidence to press the click button in that 2.5 millisecond time!

Vineet Shetty,Updated 6y,Is there any interesting thing accidentally caught on your camera?,"I captured this in Paris when we visited Eiffel Tower. It was a weekend and naturally the place was crowded and with everyone trying to capture the beauty, there was hardly any space and time to focus and capture.

I tried my best to capture some pics with my mobile cam and later I realized that I was able to capture Eiffel Tower's shadow almost perfectly. I was happy as I never thought it would come out this good (at least for me!).

Edit 1:: I got couple of comments and several messages asking date and time of capture so here you go

Edit 2:: Pasting Suryansh’s comment

Date: 8th Apr

Pretty close to the spring equinox, when Sun is directly over the equator. 8th April means sun a wee bit towards the North of the equator

Time: 11.38 in Paris with Day light saving.

Paris is pretty much on the same longitude as Greenwich.Paris is 48.8°N 2.3°E.Difference between GMT and local Paris time, 2 hours.Which means, solar time at Paris was 11.38–2 + (2.3*4mins) = 9.47AM.

So, the time suggests that Sun was almost at 45° inclination.Latitude also 48° but since the date is 8th Apr and sun has drifted Northwards so its elevation in sky was again 45°.

The time and location both were conducive to get an angle of 45°, which means your shadow was exact the same size as the tower itself and the angle of the shadow pointing somewhat North west.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/18qlzhicgsf2njp5', 'title': 'Is there any interesting thing accidentally caught on your camera?', 'score': {'original': 0.9983, 'ai': 0.0017}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I captured this in Paris when we visited Eiffel Tower.

Richard Klaus,Updated 2y,What was the most surprising thing you found on an old camera?,"I recently found an old Flip video camera. The two AA batteries where dead, so on a hunch I put some new ones in. The little camera came to life, and showed that there were some files in memory.

I connected the camera into my computer and found videos from the last time my wife (June) and I had gone to Dublin, Ireland.

June has been dead a little over four years now, and her voice on the background of the video’s was a powerful moment.

Edit: I’m a little taken aback by the response to this shared memory. Thought it might be appropriate to add a photo of June, so you could put a face with the story. This was taken some years ago in Wales. Oh and incidentally, that’s the little video camera in her hands. And yes I do miss her very much.

Jeff Edwards,Updated 1y,Why do some people cover their laptop cameras with tape? Is it just paranoia?,"I once took a cyber security course in which one of the instructors hacked into six or seven laptop cameras in the class before the lunch break on the first day. The computers in question were brought by the students, not supplied by the training facility. By the second day, every student in that class had tape over their laptop cameras.

I’ve seen how vulnerable those things are. I will never again leave my laptop camera uncovered unless I’m actually using it.

Edit:

Of all the answers I’ve written, I never expected this one to take off. Over 13,000 upvotes and still climbing. Wow!

I’m seeing a lot of repeated questions in the comments, so I’ll try to answer the most common ones:

I won’t provide the name of the course or the company that taught it. Frankly, we weren’t particularly impressed with the overall content, the professionalism of the instructors, or the value for the investment. The one interesting takeaway from the course was that laptop cameras are vulnerable to hacking.
As I recall, the exploit in question used a malicious applet to take advantage of an unpatched vulnerability in Java.
Some laptop cameras have hardwired lights that can’t be turned off by software. But some cameras have a software toggle that can turn off the light while the camera is active. Depending on your particular machine, the absence of a light is no guarantee that your camera has not been activated.
A five second Google search will turn up numerous criminal cases that involve webcam/laptop camera hacking. In 2014, Jared James Abrahams
 was sentenced to 18 months in prison for sneaking nude photos and videos of several young women including Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf. This is not, by any means, an isolated case.
I have no illusions that hackers are slavering to catch sight of my naked body. But the wall behind my desk has a dry erase board and bulletin board areas that are usually covered in notes, drawings, diagrams, schedules, and schematics. Nothing classified, but often information that requires protection.
The machines that I saw hacked were all running Windows, but - according to the Mac Security Blog
, Apple computers are also vulnerable to camera hacking.
Yes, your microphone is vulnerable too. Depending on the machine, you can block some internal microphones using a dummy plug in the mic jack. For some laptops, physically disconnecting the microphone from the motherboard isn’t too difficult. I personally opt for the dummy plug. It’s not 100% certain, but few defensive measures are absolute.

I’m under no impression that covering your camera and using a dummy plug for your microphone will provide perfect security. Frankly, there’s no such thing. In my opinion, these are just a couple of simple and inexpensive precautions that narrow your window of vulnerability. Nothing more.

Alisha Talks,Updated 4y,Why do some people cover their laptop cameras with tape? Is it just paranoia?,"“If you don’t do as I say, I’ll upload every photo I have of you”. This was the email Cassidy Wolf received from her hacker.

Cassidy was confused. Only two photos of herself hung on her bedroom wall. She realized later that the hacker had been spying on her for over a year through her webcam.

Cassidy used to keep her laptop open on her bedroom floor. She would play music whilst studying, changing and going back and forth in the shower. The hacker watched everything.

Cassidy must have opened an email with a link, enabling him to place malicious software on her laptop. If she clicked on the link, this would have granted him full access to her computer.

The hacker was able to trace the keystrokes on Cassidy’s keyboard. This way, he learnt her passwords, saw the sites she was accessing, and accessed her webcam 24/7.[1]

The hacker posted pictures of Cassidy changing using various Facebook accounts, including her younger sister’s account.

The hacker was someone from her high school; somebody whom she passed in the hallway every day.

Asim Qureshi,6y,Is GoPro going bankrupt?,"GoPro was founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman. He’s still the CEO.

In 2005 it made a ‘reusable wrist camera’ which used 35mm film.

From there GoPro grew fast.

What GoPro did right was get into digital, specifically digital video, early, with users posting their videos on YouTube becoming a key marketing channel.

In 2014 GoPro raised US$430m valuing the company at US$3bn.

In 2015 revenues hit US$1.6bn, 3x its revenues from 3 years earlier. But profits had fallen from US$130m from a year earlier to US$36m.

By 2016 revenues plummeted to US$1.2bn and GoPro was staring at a US$420m loss.

And so market cap has collapsed from a peak of US$12bn in early 2014 to US$1.5bn today.

Where did things go wrong?

Most people that want a GoPro already have one, and it’s not worth upgrading to the latest models
Competition from cheaper products
GoPro believed its own hype and around 2014 invested too heavily expecting revenues to keep growing fast

Alex Cooper,Updated Nov 24,Why all my photographs of flying birds turn out to be under-exposed despite pushing to maximum ISO? Is my 300mm f/5.6 not sufficient for bird photography?,"Are you using exposure compensation?

If you’re photographing a bird in flight against a bright sky then your images are generally going to be underexposed unless you add some exposure compensation.

Why? Well, if you’re using the default metering mode (Matrix/Evaluative metering) then your camera analyses everything in frame based on whether it’s light or dark.

Unless you’re very close and the bird is filling the screen (unlikely at 300mm), it’s going to be a small portion of the overall image, whereas the bright sky is going to be dominating the image.

Your camera meter ‘wants’ to expose everything to a ‘middle grey’ tone between absolute white and black. So when you photograph a bird in front of a bright sky your camera ‘thinks’ the overall image is too bright and brings it all down, making the bird underexposed.

You can counter this by adding some exposure in-camera. If it’s a reasonably dark bird against a bright sky (either flying or perched) I generally add anywhere from +1 to +2 exposure compensation.

Often even this isn’t enough to properly expose the bird, but I’d rather err on the side of underexposing the bird since I shoot in RAW and I can still get detail out of the shadows.

If you go too far with the exposure compensation you might have a better-exposed bird in camera, but you’ve also massively overexposed the sky and you might have ‘blown’ the highlights, making it impossible to recover detail. (I.e. parts will just be a pure white.)

There is another metering mode called spot metering, which focuses on getting the metering right on a chosen area of the frame. This might sound good but I’ve not found it ideal for birds in flight, as the brightness of the scene can quickly change and it’s easy to blow the highlights.

Regardless, you shouldn’t need to be anywhere near maximum ISO to get a reasonably exposed bird in flight if it’s daytime and the sky is fairly bright. I only used an ISO of 800 for this red kite, even with quite a fast shutter speed (1/2000th) and some exposure compensation:

Image mine

If you’re not talking about birds against bright skies, then I’m not sure what the problem would be. Maybe too fast a shutter speed?

If you’re photographing birds in the evening and the scene is quite dark, then your camera isn’t going to be able to gather as much light. You say you have a high ISO and a (maximum, I assume) aperture of 5.6 so reducing the shutter speed is the only thing left to brighten the bird.

Image mine

I frequently try photographing owls in the evening which is tricky as my lens also has a maximum aperture of f5.6. But I took the above photo at f6.3 (and ISO 6400 - about as high as my camera can go and still get a decent photo), as I dropped the shutter speed a bit to 1/1250th.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/e18piw0uxlqf4ak5', 'title': 'Why all my photographs of flying birds turn out to be under-exposed despite pushing to maximum ISO?

Pradeep Reddy,Updated 6y,Is there any interesting thing accidentally caught on your camera?,"Here goes my first answer on Quora after silently reading through great answers and articles for more than a year.

It was a much awaited super moon day for a beginner photography enthusiast like me. After wandering in cold weather for about an hour in my neighborhood to find something interesting for foreground composition, I was disappointed. I wanted to take one final shot of just the moon before heading back home. I set up my tripod and right when I pressed the shutter, looking through the view finder I noticed something pass by very quickly through the frame. I was hoping, what ever it is better be interesting and get caught on my camera sensor.

Here is what it turned out to be.

At 250mm on a crop sensor, looking at the size of the aeroplane, it's very unlikely to get this composition in a planned shot as well. At least for me.

Alex Cooper,1y,What are some tips to improve my wildlife photography?,"It can be frustrating looking at professional wildlife photographers’ pictures and wondering how they got them to look like that.

Some of it is simply gear—they’re usually using telephoto or super telephoto
 lenses with a very wide aperture (low f-stop), and these range from a few thousand dollars to $10,000+.

But most of it is down to the skills and knowledge of how to use the equipment and choose the right conditions, get in the right position etc. There are some things that take a long time to learn, but there are plenty of simple changes anyone can make to improve their wildlife photography.

Here are a few of the main ones I’d suggest.

Lighting

One of, if not the most important aspects to a photo, and the thing most people don’t really consider.

Harsh, direct sunlight usually results in images that are way too contrasty—the shadows are too dark and the highlights are too bright. ‘Good weather’ (i.e. warm and sunny) isn’t necessarily good weather for photography.
Early morning and late afternoon/early evening are often the best times. The sun isn’t as high so the light is softer and more flattering. But overcast days can also be better than sunny ones, or you can make the most of diffused light coming through trees, etc.
Consider where you’re positioned in relation to the sun. If you’re photographing into the sun (i.e the subject is backlit) during the middle of the day, the subject is usually going to be underexposed and look more like a silhouette. But backlit shots in softer pre-sunset light can give a nice effect. Frontlit with softer light generally looks pretty good. And side-lighting can give some nice texture to an image.

Behaviour

Learn a little about your subject—what time of year you can see it, what habitat it prefers, what time of day it’s most active. Dawn and dusk are the best times for lots of animals, which is annoying if you like lie-ins.
I’ve learned a few more bird calls through spending time outside. If you know what’s making the sound you can decide whether it’s worth waiting for/following. Professionals know a lot more about their subjects and can probably identify otter shit from 50 yards or know the exact pitch of a bison fart. Start small.

Composition

The background is just as important as the subject, and if it’s terrible it can ruin an otherwise good photo.
If you want to blur out the background, your subject needs to be far enough away from whatever is behind it. (And you need to be close enough to your subject, too.)
Don’t just stand in one place. If there is an annoying branch/patch of bright sky/piece of bird poo ruining the image or obscuring your subject, take a couple of steps to one side and you might suddenly have a nice, uncluttered background.
Try and get as close as possible to eye level with your subject. Shooting down at an animal on the ground, or up at a bird high in a tree isn’t usually very flattering. If an animal is on the ground and you can lie down, then lie down. If not, crouch down. This can improve the background and also make viewers connect more with the subject. If the animal is above you, see whether you can e.g. walk uphill a bit, or wait for it to fly to a better perch.
Consider some basic composition stuff like the rule of thirds, leaving enough space around the subject, leading lines etc. You can always crop out elements you don’t like and/or make the picture more balanced by cutting out some unecessary foreground, sky, etc. Very bright or dark patches in the background can distract from your subject, too.

Here’s an example of getting closer to eye level.

And a shot where I didn’t/couldn’t:

You can see the stonechat (first pic) stands out a lot better from the background. The fieldfares below blend in more, and the background is a lot more distracting, because I was much further away and also standing up.

And here are two extremes when it comes to backgrounds, with two wren photographs I took.

Crap wren photo

The background is just too cluttered so the bird doesn’t stand out. The foliage behind is too close to the wren to blur out. There are various distractions taking your eyes away from the wren.

Decent wren photo

Various birds were perching on top of gorse bushes and singing in early spring. So I stood in front of the bushes waiting, and planning what I wanted the shot to look like. When the wren came, I moved around slightly trying to get other bushes in the background to give it some colour. These were far enough back to blur out nicely, so it adds to the photo without distracting from the subject.

Technical

Take the camera off auto mode and spend a bit of time learning about aperture, shutter speed, and ISO—AKA ‘The Exposure Triangle
.’
For wildlife photography, you’re generally going to want a wide aperture to help give a shallow depth of field (blur out the background and reduce distractions). This has the added benefit of letting more light in and allowing you to use a faster shutter speed. Speaking of which…
You also need a fast enough shutter speed to stop motion blur (your own hands shaking and/or the animal moving). For stationary animals I usually prefer at least 1/400th or 1/500th of a second, and more if there’s enough light. (If you have a tripod or are supporting the lens, you can go lower. When it gets darker I also go a bit lower but pictures can be less sharp.) Moving animals need an even faster shutter speed, and for e.g. birds in flight I mostly use at least 1/2000th.
You probably do need some kind of telephoto lens (300 mm+ or so I’d say) to get decent pictures of wildlife unless it’s incredibly large and/or tame, or you’re photographing small creatures like insects. Most animals are somewhat skittish, and it’s also good practice to respect the wildlife and not get close enough to make them uncomfortable. In some situations, getting too close can negatively impact the animals, e.g. scaring parents off the nest. It might be good to practise somewhere where the wildlife is more used to humans e.g squirrels in a park, birds on a visitor centre feeder, etc.

Those are a few things off the top of my head.

The sun isn’t as high so the light is softer and more flattering. But overcast days can also be better than sunny ones, or you can make the most of diffused light coming through trees, etc.\nConsider where you’re positioned in relation to the sun. If you’re photographing into the sun (i.e the subject is backlit) during the middle of the day, the subject is usually going to be underexposed and look more like a silhouette. But backlit shots in softer pre-sunset light can give a nice effect. Frontlit with softer light generally looks pretty good. And side-lighting can give some nice texture to an image.\n\nBehaviour\n\nLearn a little about your subject—what time of year you can see it, what habitat it prefers, what time of day it’s most active. Dawn and dusk are the best times for lots of animals, which is annoying if you like lie-ins.\nI’ve learned a few more bird calls through spending time outside.

Alex Cooper,1y,How dangerous can wildlife photography be?,"That really depends on where you live and what subjects you’re trying to photograph.

I’ve done most of my photography in the UK, where there aren’t any large carnivores, so I’ve never had to worry about going for a walk in the countryside or a hike in the forest.

I did have one relatively close call when photographing some fallow deer. I laid down a reasonable distance away from a stag, but it just kept walking closer and closer until it was little more than five or six metres away. It was rutting season too, so he didn’t look very happy.

I think he was more concerned with other stags, as when I slowly got up and backed away he didn’t follow me, but it was still a little nerve-racking being so close to a large animal.

Another time a curious calf started trotting towards me and mama cow followed with what I can only describe as hate in her bovine heart, so I had to leg it through a gate.

On the whole, though, the UK is one of the safer places to practice wildlife photography.

I’ve been in Australia the last couple of months, and despite the reputation that “everything wants to kill you” it really isn’t particularly dangerous, at least where I’ve been (mostly New South Wales and a little bit in Victoria). If you were to rank countries based on wildlife attacks Australia would be pretty far down the list, especially if we’re talking about land animals.

I’ve been hiking a lot and am yet to see a snake on this trip. (I’ve never seen a snake even when I lived in Sydney for two years, and only saw a non-venmous python once in Queensland.)

I’ve been here over winter, when most of the snakes are in brumation and a lot less active, but even in warmer weather, snakes just don’t attack people very often and most of the time they slither off before you even notice them. As long as they have an escape route, you’re fine.

Australia is another country without many large land predators, excluding the dingo, which I’ve never seen in the wild (and except on very rare occasions, doesn’t really pose a threat to an adult). Apart from a few places where they’ve been hand fed by tourists (stupid) they generally stay well away from humans.

Kangaroos are another species whose reputation is overblown. I’ve seen plenty and they’re some of the most placid animals I’ve encountered. The main threat they pose is by hopping in front of your car. Yes, the big males can look a bit intimidating but aggressiveness towards humans is unusual. (Often it’s triggered by the presence of dogs — they don’t like them for obvious reasons, as dingoes are a natural predator).

Wombats are quite ‘chonky’ and have a nasty bite, but are mostly placid too. Don’t try and hug them and you’ll be fine.

I saw an echidna yesterday. I guess if I’d tripped over and fallen face-first on it I might be in a bit of trouble, otherwise it’s fairly safe.

Wallabies?

Hmm, I wouldn’t have thought they’d pose a threat, but this one looks like it’s up to something.

As for other parts of the world? Obviously you’d have to take a few more precautions.

Bears are an obvious threat in North America; they don’t attack very often at all, but if you run across a starving one or a protective mama bear you might be in trouble. A well-known wildlife photographer was killed by bears
 in Alaska after photographing them for years.

I’m a rookie in terms of bear safety but there are rules with what you should do with your food when camping, and at a minimum you’d want to carry bear spray and/or be armed.

Moose are no joke, either.

Africa has a long list of capable-of-killing-you-if-you-look-at-it-funny wildlife. Besides the obvious like lions, crocodiles, and hippos, buffalo and elephants are also more dangerous than many people assume.

Still, if you’re in a safari vehicle (or even on a walking safari) with a guide, you’ll probably be fine. That said, there are some National Parks, like Mana Pools in Zimbabwe, where you can choose to walk around outside a vehicle, and that comes with obvious risks
.

Tim Chiappone,Updated 3y,What does a Hollywood film shoot really look like behind the camera?,"Hollywood has made huge advancements in technology such as CGI and the green screens often used for special effects in film shoots.

Here are 11 behind the camera photos from Hollywood.

Some of which are even pretty bizarre.

(1) Beauty And The Beast

Emma Watson deserves an Oscar nomination for keeping a straight face throughout the film shoot with Dan Stevens.

She even danced with him in his big padded suit.

(2) Game Of Thrones

An impressive scene of Jon climbing a huge ice wall in season three. The actual wall seemed vertical, however the ground is not that far.

(3) Life Of Pi

It kinda dampens one’s feeling to see stuff like this, nevertheless fantastic acting from Suraj Sharma, undeterred by the special effects.

(4) I Am Legend

In this scene Robert got attacked by a mutant dog, which was actually a bizarre man wearing a green morph suit.

(5) Space Jam

Michael Jordan acting with ""cartoon characters"" was not an easy feat.

(6) Game Of Thrones

Clarke Emilia's job wasn't made easy either with this “fabric wrapped around a stick” CGI. Could have been a little more intimidating.

(7) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Are those green hands some kinds of mythical creatures living inside the library.. still believing that the Harry Potter world of wizarding is a real place!

(8) Titanic

Seems a huge ocean liner was not really needed for this scene.

(9) Mad Max: Fury Road

Here CGI was used to add flames, dust, bigger explosions, etc. while most of the shots were practical effects.[1]

(10) The Avengers

Mark Ruffalo did his best again, having to switch roles consistently.

From playing a shy, awkward scientist to a 8- foot tall, 1400 pound monster who ends up with no short on.

(11) Boardwalk Empire

We have gone so far in the movie industry, that all it takes is a few strips of green screen to remodel an entire scene with amazing effects.

Christopher Tom,9mo,"For wildlife photography, what's the best value lens for the 300-600mm range?","The best value lens for the 300-600mm range in wildlife photography depends on a variety of factors, such as the type of wildlife, the terrain, and the photographer's skill level.

For the wildlife photographer with a wider budget, the Nikon AF-S 300mm f/4E PF ED VR lens is a great option.

Its low-light performance is superb, and the lens delivers an excellent level of sharpness for the money.

For the more budget-conscious photographer, the Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary lens is a great choice.

It offers good image quality and autofocus speed, and its build and image stabilization are also decent.

Ultimately, the best lens for a wildlife photographer comes down to personal preference, budget, and the type of wildlife they’re focusing on.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yw071gt4evsljhip', 'title': ""For wildlife photography, what's the best value lens for the 300-600mm range?"", 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The best value lens for the 300-600mm range in wildlife photography depends on a variety of factors, such as the type of wildlife, the terrain, and the photographer's skill level.\n\nFor the wildlife photographer with a wider budget, the Nikon AF-S 300mm f/4E PF ED VR lens is a great option.\n\nIts low-light performance is superb, and the lens delivers an excellent level of sharpness for the money.\n\nFor the more budget-conscious photographer, the Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary lens is a great choice.\n\nIt offers good image quality and autofocus speed, and its build and image stabilization are also decent.\n\nUltimately, the best lens for a wildlife photographer comes down to personal preference, budget, and the type of wildlife they’re focusing on."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1996375, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""The best value lens for the 300-600mm range in wildlife photography depends on a variety of factors, such as the type of wildlife, the terrain, and the photographer's skill level.\n\nFor the wildlife photographer with a wider budget, the Nikon AF-S 300mm f/4E PF ED VR lens is a great option.\n\nIts low-light performance is superb, and the lens delivers an excellent level of sharpness for the money.\n\nFor the more budget-conscious photographer, the Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary lens is a great choice.\n\nIt offers good image quality and autofocus speed, and its build and image stabilization are also decent.\n\nUltimately, the best lens for a wildlife photographer comes down to personal preference, budget, and the type of wildlife they’re focusing on."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0

Alan Hall,Updated 3y,Why do truckers often have dash cams?,"Very simple. If you get hit by a car, you will be lucky if they carry the minimum $15,000 liability insurance. After that, they are more than likely not to own a house or have much equity in it if they do.

On the other hand, commercial trucks must carry a minimum $1,000,000 of liability insurance and are often owned by big corporations with very deep pockets.

Trucks have a long stopping distance and can’t maneuver well, so it is very hard for them to avoid accidents caused by other drivers. This makes them prime targets for insurance fraud. A very common scam is to arrange a poor person to drive their car in front of your truck and then another guy, part of the scam, cuts in front of the poor person and forces them to slam on their brakes. You hit the poor person and they are injured. The scam attorney for the poor person sues you. The guy that cut the poor person off drives away. The sad thing is that the poor person gets very little of the money and is sometimes left with permanent injuries.

I had a lady cut in front of me and then slam on her brakes. She stuck her head out the window and was looking back at me when she hit the brakes. It was clearly deliberate. Fortunately, I managed to stop before hitting her (inches) but my load shifted and caused a lot of damage to my box. I followed her and when she parked, I blocked her car and called the police. When they showed up, the officer attacked me and threw me against a wall for no reason, breaking my phone. He then proceeded to repeatedly pull my arm up behind my back so hard it almost broke my arm.

Turns out the lady called the police herself and told them I was a crazy guy on drugs trying to kill her. They showed up for her call, not mine, and attacked me without asking questions. The officer then falsely claimed that I hit him and he was just defending himself. The lady said she saw me hit the officer. She got away, but I eventually got a letter of apology from the police chief for the whole affair. But a video of her slamming on her brakes would have put her in jail.

Very soon after, a guy passed me on the left shoulder on a freeway on-ramp and then cut directly in front of me before slamming on his brakes. I hit him. He called the police and claimed I slammed into him while he was stopped at the light. We were 50 yards behind the light, but he explained I drove backwards trying to get away and he followed me. He claimed he had serious neck and back pain. Fortunately, I had a GPS unit on the dash. I took it and put it under my seat, telling the guy it was a dashcam and I would wait until after he filed a claim before showing it to the judge so he would be guilty of giving false testimony and insurance fraud. He got nervous and never filed a claim against me.

I wasn’t going to wait for strike three.

Normal digital cameras (such as the one in your phone) capture Red, Green and Blue light…they are “RGB” cameras. This is good because the human eye has separate cone cells that look out for red, green and blue.

But Tesla seem to have opted to replace the green sensor with a white light sensor - that can see a broad range of colors…in monochrome.

This seems to be in order to allow the “white” sensor to pick up infra-red light for improved night vision.

But the consequence is that the cameras don’t directly measure the amount of green light.

Tesla seem to fix this in displays and stored images that people will want to see by subtracting the amount of red and blue light from the white sensor’s output in order to estimate the amount of green.

This kinda works - but if you ever look at the pictures from Tesla’s cameras, the color quality is often pretty terrible.

The one exception is the reversing camera - which is probably required by law to be RGB.

Another difference appears to be frame rate. Most digital cameras run at 60 frames per second - but that’s considerably slower than the update rate of the Tesla AI software. So the cameras on the car seem to be running at a much higher frame rate.

This is evident in things like store-front light displays and LED brake lights on some kinds of car which are actually flickering on and off at some very high speed…and when you watch those in-car videos - those kinds of light flicker violently due to the high frame rate of the video system.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/93nm0tvg7beij5xr', 'title': 'What cameras does Tesla use?', 'score': {'original': 0.9991, 'ai': 0.0009}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'They appear to be custom made - but they are a bit unusual.\n\nNormal digital cameras (such as the one in your phone) capture Red, Green and Blue light…they are “RGB” cameras.

Louis Stevens,9mo,"Why do photographers use smaller apertures, such as F8, for landscape photography?","Smaller apertures such as F8 are used in landscape photography to achieve a greater depth of field which brings more of the scene into focus.

This aperture also provides greater control over the exposure of the image and any bright spots in the scene can be managed more easily when F8 is used.

Additionally, F8 can be used to create a greater range of sharpness throughout the image, something which may be particularly desirable in landscape photos.

With the right combination of aperture and shutter speed, it is possible to create a sharp foreground and slightly blurred background that helps to make the subject stand out more.

Moreover, landscape photography usually requires accurate focusing through a smaller aperture to ensure that all elements in the image remain sharp.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/axigl8cupdy4nwr9', 'title': 'Why do photographers use smaller apertures, such as F8, for landscape photography?', 'score': {'original': 0.0032, 'ai': 0.9968}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Smaller apertures such as F8 are used in landscape photography to achieve a greater depth of field which brings more of the scene into focus.\n\nThis aperture also provides greater control over the exposure of the image and any bright spots in the scene can be managed more easily when F8 is used.\n\nAdditionally, F8 can be used to create a greater range of sharpness throughout the image, something which may be particularly desirable in landscape photos.\n\nWith the right combination of aperture and shutter speed, it is possible to create a sharp foreground and slightly blurred background that helps to make the subject stand out more.\n\nMoreover, landscape photography usually requires accurate focusing through a smaller aperture to ensure that all elements in the image remain sharp.', 'result': {'fake': 0.9968, 'real': 0.0032}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1996362, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Smaller apertures such as F8 are used in landscape photography to achieve a greater depth of field which brings more of the scene into focus.\n\nThis aperture also provides greater control over the exposure of the image and any bright spots in the scene can be managed more easily when F8 is used.\n\nAdditionally, F8 can be used to create a greater range of sharpness throughout the image, something which may be particularly desirable in landscape photos.\n\nWith the right combination of aperture and shutter speed, it is possible to create a sharp foreground and slightly blurred background that helps to make the subject stand out more.\n\nMoreover, landscape photography usually requires accurate focusing through a smaller aperture to ensure that all elements in the image remain sharp.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0032

Christopher Tom,08-Feb,Which camera is best for wildlife photography?,"While I'm no stranger to the world of photography, I must admit that I'm not easily impressed by claims of the best camera for any given type of photography.

That being said, when it comes to wildlife photography, there are certainly a few key features that any aspiring photographer should look for in a digital camera.

First and foremost, you'll want a camera with excellent autofocus capabilities.

Wildlife photography often requires quick reflexes and the ability to track moving subjects, so a camera that can lock onto a target and keep it in focus is essential.

You'll also want a camera with a high frame rate, as being able to capture multiple shots per second can mean the difference between getting the perfect shot and missing it entirely.

Of course, image quality is always important, and in this regard, a camera that can shoot in RAW format and has a high sensor resolution (ideally 24 megapixels or higher) will be your best bet.

And let's not forget about zoom capability - a good wildlife photography camera should have a powerful telephoto lens, ideally with a focal length of at least 300mm.

So, while I can't say for certain which camera is the absolute best for wildlife photography, I would recommend looking into models from reputable brands like Canon, Nikon, or Sony.

These companies have a long history of producing high-quality cameras with advanced features, and you really can't go wrong with any of them.

Just be prepared to invest in some high-quality lenses to go along with your camera, as they can be just as important (if not more so) than the camera body itself.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vncpgi9wejrxdl6f', 'title': 'Which camera is best for wildlife photography?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""While I'm no stranger to the world of photography, I must admit that I'm not easily impressed by claims of the best camera for any given type of photography.\n\nThat being said, when it comes to wildlife photography, there are certainly a few key features that any aspiring photographer should look for in a digital camera.\n\nFirst and foremost, you'll want a camera with excellent autofocus capabilities.\n\nWildlife photography often requires quick reflexes and the ability to track moving subjects, so a camera that can lock onto a target and keep it in focus is essential.\n\nYou'll also want a camera with a high frame rate, as being able to capture multiple shots per second can mean the difference between getting the perfect shot and missing it entirely.\n\nOf course, image quality is always important, and in this regard, a camera that can shoot in RAW format and has a high sensor resolution (ideally 24 megapixels or higher) will be your best bet.\n\nAnd let's not forget about zoom capability - a good wildlife photography camera should have a powerful telephoto lens, ideally with a focal length of at least 300mm.\n\nSo, while I can't say for certain which camera is the absolute best for wildlife photography, I would recommend looking into models from reputable brands like Canon, Nikon, or Sony.\n\nThese companies have a long history of producing high-quality cameras with advanced features, and you really can't go wrong with any of them.\n\nJust be prepared to invest in some high-quality lenses to go along with your camera, as they can be just as important (if not more so) than the camera body itself."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1996341, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""While I'm no stranger to the world of photography, I must admit that I'm not easily impressed by claims of the best camera for any given type of photography.\n\nThat being said, when it comes to wildlife photography, there are certainly a few key features that any aspiring photographer should look for in a digital camera.\n\nFirst and foremost, you'll want a camera with excellent autofocus capabilities.\n\nWildlife photography often requires quick reflexes and the ability to track moving subjects, so a camera that can lock onto a target and keep it in focus is essential.\n\nYou'll also want a camera with a high frame rate, as being able to capture multiple shots per second can mean the difference between getting the perfect shot and missing it entirely.\n\nOf course, image quality is always important, and in this regard, a camera that can shoot in RAW format and has a high sensor resolution (ideally 24 megapixels or higher) will be your best bet.\n\nAnd let's not forget about zoom capability - a good wildlife photography camera should have a powerful telephoto lens, ideally with a focal length of at least 300mm.\n\nSo, while I can't say for certain which camera is the absolute best for wildlife photography, I would recommend looking into models from reputable brands like Canon, Nikon, or Sony.\n\nThese companies have a long history of producing high-quality cameras with advanced features, and you really can't go wrong with any of them.\n\nJust be prepared to invest in some high-quality lenses to go along with your camera, as they can be just as important (if not more so) than the camera body itself."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0
Craig Good,7y,Why was the cinematography in WALL-E deliberately made to look like it was shot using real film cameras?,"Two main reasons.

Andrew wanted to make the film feel real, and specifically evoke the classic science fiction films of the late 80’s and early 90’s. The camera rigs we used were designed to emulate Panavision lenses of the period.

As for the operation, Andrew explained to me that he was worried about losing intimacy in a love story between two robots. The way the camera was operated subliminally put a camera operator (and focus puller) in the scene with the characters, providing a humanizing link.

I did the final camera operation on every shot in the film. The Layout Department and I used two camera grammar approaches:

On Earth the camera was mostly on sticks (as on a tripod mount, or maybe a dolly or crane) to constrain it in parallax, but with the virtual tripod head loose, and the operator “hunting” for each shot. There were a handful of SteadiCam style shots where appropriate.

In space the camera was always floating, SteadiCam style, so the parallax was never static. So it still felt hand operated, but had a floatier feel to it.

Yang,2y,How powerful are the cameras on modern spy satellites?,"One Trump's tweet probably confirmed that the resolution of American KH-11 spy satellite’s cameras can let American intelligences read license plate number through a spy satellite photo.

On 30 Aug 2019, President Trump posted a spy satellite photo in his tweet, mocking Iran's missiles and showing off American advanced spy satellite technology.

What's really shocking is how clear this photo is. In this photo, not only can we see the four lightning towers around the circular launch pad, but the length and angle of the shadow of the tower are very obvious, and we can even see the hollow structure of the launch pad itself.

What’s more unbelievable is that the photo is not enlarged through post-processing—because the doors of the rocket’s mobile launching and erecting device are clearly visible, and the “empowered by the State” written in Persian on the edge of the circular launch pad can be distinguished.

Let's not forget the photo we the public can seew was from Trump's tweet. Trump’s men printed this photo and took a picture of the printed spy satellite photo. It means that the original spy satellite photo is more clearer.

(Commercial satellites of Planet and MacArthur also took pictures of it)

Then I'll explain why this photo proves how powerful the cameras on spy satellite are. (The calculation below was originally from Marco Langbroek’s post to the SeeSat-L Internet forum. I'll try to explain his calculation in plain language)

First, the location of Imam Khomeini Spaceport determined this photo can only be taken by spy satellite not drones.

The United States is unable to send a drone flying a thousand miles, through Armenia, Azerbaijan and Iran, with a risk of being shot by Iran, especially when Iran just shot a RQ-4 in Persian Gulf a month before.

So the photo can only be taken by a spy satellite. And KH-11 type electro-optical surveillance satellite is able to take such a high-resolution picture.

Calculated according to the scale on Google Maps, the diameter of the circular launch pad where the accident occurred is about 60 meters, which occupies about 600 pixels in the Twitter photo, 60/600=0.1, so the resolution of the photo alone is 10 cm per pixel.

Like I wrote before, the resolution of the original photo can only be higher.

According to the light diffraction formula, and the visibility limit of the observable object caused by the natural diffraction when light propagates, plus parameters visible light wave band 500 nanometers and the lens diameter 2.4 meters, we can calculate that (1.22*5*10^-5)/240 is about 0.05 arc second.

Assume that the orbital height of the satellite is 250 kilometers(in fact it's probably higher), 0.05*250000/206265=0.06 (I'll add in reference explaining why 206265 is used here), the limited diffraction resolution of a 2.4-meter lens under vacuum is about 6 cm. And don't forget LEO is not real vaccum and the satellite is probably higher.

To sum up, the resolution of the photo is probably very close to the theoretical limit!!!

That's why I wrote that it can “let American intelligences read license plate number through a spy satellite photo” in the beginning.

Extremely high-resolution camera is not the only information we can get from this Trump's tweet.

This launch pad is located in 35.2346° N, 53.9210° E . The direction of the lightning ° at the north and south corners is 192.8 degrees. Thanks to Google Map.

If the launch pad is circular, and the azimuth difference between the north and south lightning towers is identified as 3.8°, meaning azimuth angle of the shooting satellite is 192.8+3.8=195.8°. The shooting angle of elevation can be calculated by sinh=b/a, a is 270 and b is 195 and sinh(195/270)=0.787, meaning elevation angle is about 45°.

And when we combine calculation results and location of launch pad, we will see it's USA-224 that took this high-resolution picture.

Why did I add all of these when a picture?itself can prove how powerful the high-resolution spy satellite camera is?

Because USA-224 is already not the most advanced spy satellite. It's believed that after the launch of Block-V KH-11 satellites like USA-290, USA-224 and the ability of it's camera is not so sensitive. So NRO would agree to post some information of this “dated” spy satellite. Just like America released photos of Soviet AC taken by Block-I KH-11 satellite when Block-II KH-11 satellites had served.

That's why we can see the phone in Trump's tweet. And it means that we the public still have no idea of howw powerful are the most advanced cameras of spy satellites.

We can only be sure that they will be more powerful than the high-resolution camera which took the photo of Iran's launch pad on 29 Aug 2019.

KH-11 satellite

KH-11 KENNEN - Wikipedia
The KH-11 KENNEN [1] [2] [3] [4] (later renamed CRYSTAL , [5] then Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System , and codenamed 1010 [6] : 82 and Key Hole [6] : 82 ) is a type of reconnaissance satellite first launched by the American National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in December 1976. Manufactured by Lockheed in Sunnyvale, California , the KH-11 was the first American spy satellite to use electro-optical digital imaging , and so offer real-time optical observations. [7] A conceptual drawing based upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) layout. A conceptual drawing based upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) layout with internal views. Later KH-11 satellites have been referred to by outside observers as KH-11B or KH-12, and by the names ""Advanced KENNEN"", ""Improved Crystal"" and ""Ikon"". Official budget documents refer to the latest generation of electro-optical satellites as Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System . [8] The Key Hole series was officially discontinued in favor of a random numbering scheme after repeated public references to KH-7 GAMBIT , KH-8 GAMBIT 3 , KH-9 HEXAGON , and KH-11 KENNEN satellites. [9] The capabilities of the KH-11 are highly classified, as are the images they produce. The satellites are believed to have been the source of some imagery of the Soviet Union and China made public in 1997; [ citation needed ] images of Sudan and Afghanistan made public in 1998 related to the response to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings ; [10] and a 2019 photo, provided by then President Donald Trump , [11] of a failed Iranian rocket launch. Program history and logistics edit The Film Read-Out KH-7 GAMBIT (FROG) served as NRO Program A's competitor to NRO Program B's initial electro-optical imagery (EOI) satellite. [12] After a precursor EOI study with the codeword Zoster, President Nixon on 23 September 1971 approved the development of an EOI satellite under the initial codeword Zaman. [13] In November 1971, this codeword was changed to Kennen, which is Middle English for ""to perceive"". [14] [15] Initial director of the ZAMAN/KENNEN Program Group was Charles R. ""Charlie"" Roth, who in Oct 1975 was succeeded by Rutledge P. (Hap) Hazzard. [16] Data is transmitted through a network of communications satellites ; the Satellite Data System (SDS). [5] [17] The initial ground station for the processing of the electro-optical imaging was a secret National Reconnaissance Office facility in Area 58 , later confirmed to be located in Fort Belvoir in Virginia . [18] [19] In 1999, NRO selected Boeing as the prime contractor for the Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) program, aimed at replacing the KH-11 satellites by a more cost effective constellation of smaller, and also more capable reconnaissance satellites. After the failure of the FIA in 2005, NRO ordered from Lockheed two additional legacy hardware KH-11s. [20] USA-224 , the first of these two, was launched in early 2011 two years ahead of the initial schedule estimate. [21] The Hubble Space Telescope integration at Lockheed

Engineering:USA-224 - HandWiki
Short description : US spy satellite USA-224 , also known as NROL-49 , is an American reconnaissance satellite . Launched in 2011 to replace the decade-old USA-161 satellite, it is the fifteenth KH-11 optical imaging satellite to reach orbit. Project history and cost After the Boeing -led Future Imagery Architecture program failed in 2005, the National Reconnaissance Office ordered two more KH-11s. Critics worried that each of these ""exquisite-class"" [2] satellites would cost more than the Navy's latest aircraft carrier ( US$6.35 billion in 2005, or about $8,310,000,000 today [3] ). [4] [5] Instead, USA-224–the first of these two–was completed by Lockheed $2 billion under the initial budget estimate and two years ahead of schedule. [6] Launch USA-224 was launched atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6 in California . The launch was conducted by United Launch Alliance , and was the first flight of a Delta IV Heavy from Vandenberg. [7] Liftoff occurred on 20 January 2011 at 21:10:30 UTC. [8] Upon reaching orbit, the satellite received the International Designator 2011-002A. [9] The satellite began operating 33 days after its predecessor, USA-161, stopped doing its primary mission. This coverage gap was much smaller than originally feared, thanks to USA-224's earlier-than-planned launch and operational changes to extend the lifetime of USA-161. [6] As the fifteenth KH-11 satellite to be launched, USA-224 is a member of one of the later block configurations occasionally identified as being a separate system . Details of its mission and orbit are classified, but amateur observers have tracked it in low Earth orbit . Shortly after launch it was in an orbit with a perigee of 251 kilometres (156 mi), an apogee of 1,023 kilometres (636 mi) and 97.9 degrees of inclination , typical for an operational KH-11 satellite. [10] By April it was 260 by 987 kilometres (162 by 613 mi) at 97.93 degrees. [11] Imaging of Safir launch preparation accident The photo believed to have been taken by USA-224 tweeted by President Trump in August 2019 On 30 August 2019, President Donald Trump tweeted a classified picture [12] from an intelligence briefing showing the aftermath of an accident that apparently occurred during launch preparations of a Safir rocket at the Imam Khomeini Spaceport a day earlier. [13] [14] [15] According to analysts, the photo is likely to have been taken by USA-224. [16] [17] The opinion is based on a close agreement between the estimated time when the photo was taken (based on the orientation of shadows cast by structures in the photo), and the location of the satellite at that same time, as estimated with tracking data maintained by the amateur satellite watching community.

why use 206265

Why do we use the value 206265 in the small angle formula?
Let $d$ be the distance, $D$ is the linear size, and $x$ the angular size. In the formula $$D = \frac{dx}{206 265}$$ what does this number mean?

Surveillance photos reveal apparent explosion on Iranian launch pad
This image, tweeted by President Trump on Friday, appears to come from a high-resolution camera on a U.S. government drone or satellite. It shows damage to an Iranian satellite launch pad. A day after commercial satellite images revealed a smoke plume over an Iranian launch pad, President Trump tweeted a remarkably high-resolution aerial photograph of the remote satellite launch facility Friday — apparently from a classified satellite or airborne drone — and denied U.S. involvement in the accident. “The United States of America was was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,” Trump tweeted. “I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.” The Safir is a two-stage Iranian satellite launcher, and the accident was the third time Iran has failed to place a satellite into orbit this year. Trump’s attachment to the tweet of a photograph showing a detailed aerial view of the launch drove imagery analysts and satellite experts into a frenzy. The image Trump tweeted appeared to be taken from a cell phone or other type of camera, showing a digital or printed rendering of a surveillance photograph captured from an intelligence-gathering drone or satellite. In either case, Trump’s disclosure appears to reveal new details about the U.S. government’s normally secret intelligence-gathering capabilities. U.S. presidents can declassify information at their own discretion. The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran. I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One. pic.twitter.com/z0iDj2L0Y3 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019 Within hours, analysts and amateur satellite trackers joined forces on social media and Internet forums to track down a possible source of the image Trump tweeted. Christiaan Triebert, a visual investigations journalist at the New York Times, deduced from shadows in the image that it was taken between 1:30 and 2:30 p.m. local time, probably on Thursday. Open-source orbital data compiled by amateur trackers indicated that a top secret U.S. government spy satellite flew over the Semnan launch site during that time, according to Michael Thompson, a graduate student at Purdue University studying astrodynamics and spacecraft navigation. Using public data, Thompson calculated that the satellite, officially designated USA-224, passed over the Iranian space center shortly after 2:10 p.m. local time Thursday. Marco Langbroek, an experienced tracker of satellite movements who lives in the Netherlands, confirmed that the USA-224 spacecraft was over the Semnan launch base around that time. In a post to the SeeSat-L Internet forum, where enthusiasts share their satellite sightings, Langbroek wrote the “angle from which the image seems to be taken … matches the

And don't forget LEO is not real vaccum and the satellite is probably higher.\n\nTo sum up, the resolution of the photo is probably very close to the theoretical limit!!!\n\nThat's why I wrote that it can “let American intelligences read license plate number through a spy satellite photo” in the beginning.\n\nExtremely high-resolution camera is not the only information we"", 'result': {'fake': 0.1015, 'real': 0.8985}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'can get from this Trump\'s tweet.\n\nThis launch pad is located in 35.2346° N, 53.9210° E .

[11] Imaging of Safir launch preparation accident The photo believed to have been taken by USA-224 tweeted by President Trump in August 2019 On 30 August 2019, President Donald Trump tweeted a classified picture [12] from an intelligence briefing showing the aftermath of an accident that apparently occurred during launch preparations of a Safir rocket at the Imam Khomeini Spaceport a day earlier. [13] [14] [15] According to analysts, the photo is likely to have been taken by USA-224. [16] [17] The opinion is based on a close agreement between the estimated time when the photo was taken (based on the orientation of shadows cast by structures in the photo), and the location of the satellite at that same time, as estimated with tracking data maintained by the amateur satellite watching community. [18] [19] [20] The off- nadir photograph stands out for its high-resolution (estimated by analysts to be 10\xa0cm or less per pixel), sharpness and lack of atmospheric distortion.

It shows damage to an Iranian satellite launch pad. A day after commercial satellite images revealed a smoke plume over an Iranian launch pad, President Trump tweeted a remarkably high-resolution aerial photograph of the remote satellite launch facility Friday — apparently from a classified satellite or airborne drone — and denied U.S. involvement in the accident. “The United States of America was\xa0was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,” Trump tweeted. “I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.” The Safir is a two-stage Iranian satellite launcher, and the accident was the third time Iran has failed to place a satellite into orbit this year. Trump’s attachment to the tweet of a photograph showing a detailed aerial view of the launch drove imagery analysts and satellite experts into a frenzy. The image Trump tweeted appeared to be taken from a cell phone or other type of camera, showing a digital or printed rendering of a surveillance photograph captured from an intelligence-gathering drone or satellite. In either case, Trump’s disclosure appears to reveal new details about the U.S. government’s normally secret intelligence-gathering capabilities.\xa0U.S. presidents can declassify information at their own discretion.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019 Within hours, analysts and amateur satellite trackers joined forces on social media and Internet forums to track down a possible source of the image Trump tweeted. Christiaan Triebert, a visual investigations journalist at the New York Times, deduced from shadows in the image that it was taken between 1:30 and 2:30 p.m. local time, probably on Thursday. Open-source orbital data compiled by amateur trackers indicated that a top secret U.S. government spy satellite flew over the Semnan launch site during that time, according to\xa0Michael Thompson, a graduate student at Purdue University studying astrodynamics and spacecraft navigation. Using public data, Thompson calculated that the satellite, officially designated USA-224, passed over the Iranian space center shortly after 2:10 p.m. local time Thursday.

Mark Shulmann,1y,Apollo 11 had a TV camera filming the EVA. Did the TV camera capture the LM's ascent from the Moon? I know the astronauts recorded the accent from inside the LM.,"There was no live video of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) ascent from the moon, and on Apollo 11 such video wouldn’t have been possible.

When the Apollo 11 crew departed, they left the TV camera on the moon, but there was no way for the TV camera to take any images. The TV camera didn’t have its own power supply, antenna, or transmitter — a cable between the TV camera and the LM enabled the camera to run off the LM power supply power, and to send the TV signal back to Earth using the transmitter and antenna on the ascent stage. In some of the photos of the camera on the moon, you can clearly see the cable from the TV camera back to the LM:

On later flights — Apollo 15, 16, and 17 — the crews left the TV camera mounted on the lunar rover, which enabled the TV camera to use the lunar rover’s power supply, transmitter, and antenna. On those flights we did get live video of the lunar liftoff.

In this photo, you can see the TV mounted on the front of the rover (left) and the dish antenna that could be pointed at Earth:

So OK, Apollo 11 couldn’t have left a TV camera on the moon to return live video, but how about transmitting live video from inside the cabin during ascent?

No, that wasn’t possible either. Sending a video signal across a quarter of a million miles required that a dish antenna be pointed directly at Earth. This was impossible from the LM during ascent.

During the Apollo program, crews were able to transmit videos at these times during a mission:

While coasting to/from the moon
While in orbit around the Earth or the moon
While on the surface of the moon

What these situations all have in common is that either the spacecraft or the ground was rock-steady, and it was possible to aim a dish antenna at Earth and have it remain pointed at Earth.

By contrast, there was no live video from the spacecraft during launch from Earth, or during lunar landing or ascent, because the spacecraft just wasn’t steady enough to keep a dish antenna pointed directly at the Earth.

You’re right that the descent and ascent were capture on film cameras during each mission by a 16mm camera called the DAC (data acquisition camera). Because of the obvious limitations of film, we weren’t able to see this footage until each crew returned and the film was processed.

Louis Stevens,29-Aug,Can you suggest a camera and lens for wildlife photography below the total of 1 lakh?,"Sure!

If you're looking for a camera and lens combo for wildlife photography under 1 lakh, let me tell you that nothing screams professional photographer more than capturing stunning wildlife shots without actually experiencing the thrill of being in the wild.

Who needs to get up close and personal with nature when you can just sit comfortably at home, right?

Now, onto your question.

I would highly recommend investing in a disposable camera from the 90s and pair it with a magnifying glass taken straight out of your grandmother's drawer.

Trust me, this combination will not only give you that vintage aesthetic but will also make those elusive creatures wonder if they've been transported back in time.

But hey, who am I to judge?

In all seriousness (or sarcasm), there are some great options within your budget range like the Nikon D5600 or Canon EOS Rebel T7i paired with a versatile telephoto lens like Tamron 70-300mm.

Happy shooting...

Christopher Tom,22-Jan,"If I want to buy a digital camera for wildlife photography, which one is the latest?","While I can certainly provide some guidance on choosing a digital camera for wildlife photography, I must clarify that I don't work for any specific company, including itraveledthere.io.

With that said, I'm happy to help!As for the latest camera for wildlife photography, it's important to note that there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this question.

The latest camera may not always be the best choice for your specific needs and budget.

However, some of the most highly-regarded cameras for wildlife photography currently on the market include the Nikon D500, Canon EOS 7D Mark II, and the Sony Alpha a9 II.

These cameras offer fast continuous shooting speeds, excellent autofocus capabilities, and robust build quality that can withstand the elements.

That being said, it's also worth considering the lens you'll be using for wildlife photography.

A high-quality telephoto lens is often just as important (if not more so) than the camera body itself.

Brands such as Nikon, Canon, and Sigma offer a range of telephoto lenses that can help you capture stunning wildlife images from a safe and respectful distance.

Does he look weak? I dare you tell that to him.

Jack Spratt,1y,What's something so bizarre that happened to you that you thought you were on candid camera?,"I’ll start with a bit of a back story first. When myself and my siblings were young kids my parents decided to buy us an electronic organ that had light up keys with the notes so we could learn to play a musical instrument. It was a lot of fun and had built in synthesizer beats and different sounds. The organ had the overall shape and size of a player piano. Fast forward many years and I am away at college in a town a few hours from home while my siblings either still lived at home or in apartments close by. While home on Christmas break my parents announced at a family gathering that they have decided to divorce. Over the next couple of weeks my dad moves into an apartment and my mom is still living at the house while it goes on the market. My next trip home is spring break and I arrive to find that my mom and dad created a list of furnishings and other family memorabilia that they did not want and my siblings and I could have what we wanted. My siblings already divided everything up amongst themselves leaving only an old color tv and the organ for me. I was not happy but I said what the heck and moved both items back to the apartment I shared with 2 roommates back at college. The organ soon became the life of many drunken college parties but as with most things the novelty wore off and the organ became something that just took up space. My roommates and I finally decided it had to go. The thing was in perfect working order so naturally we decided the best thing to do was donate it to the music department of the local small town school district. I look up the phone number for the local school district and make a call. The next 30 minutes turns into probably the most surreal set of phone conversations I ever had.

School District (SD): Hello this is SD how may I direct your call?

Me: Who do I need to talk to about donating an organ?

SD: A what?

Me: An organ. It is in great condition but I no longer have a use for it and it is just taking up space. I think the SD could find a use for it. “click” “dial tone”

SD: Hello the is SD how may I direct your call?

Me: We just got disconnected. Who in your district can I talk.. “click” “dial tone”

I am thinking what the hell. How rude. I call back again and this time somebody else answers.

SD: Hello this is SD how may I direct your call?

Me: I keep getting disconnected. I just want to know who I need to talk to about donating an organ.

SD: Why do you think our SD would want a donated organ? That seems strange.

Me: Because I thought that students could use it to learn and it would save the district from having to buy one.

SD: Please stop calling and wasting our time. “click” “dial tone”

What the hell!! I am now a bit confused why they wouldn’t want a perfectly good organ. I am determined to get this done otherwise the thing is going in the trash. So I call again and get a third voice from the SD answering.

SD: Hello this is SD how may I direct your call?

Me: Look I am just trying to donate an organ to your music department why the hell do you guys keep hanging up on me. It’s rude.

SD: What do you mean we’re rude? You are the one trying to donate an organ to a school district.

Then it hits me. I am the only one in the conversation that knows what I am talking about.

Me: Listen. I am talking about a musical instrument. You ever heard of a church organ?

SD: yyesss.

Me: I have a musical instrument called an organ that I want to donate.

SD: Oh, why didn’t you say so. I’ll connect you to the head of our music education department.

About 2 days later a truck from the school district with a couple of burly guys shows up at my apartment and carts of the organ to the nearby elementary school. About 1 month later I got invited to visit the 5th grade music class and listen to a couple of arrangements played by the students that included the organ.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/uwl0gjpkc5zbni8a', 'title': ""What's something so bizarre that happened to you that you thought you were on candid camera?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I’ll start with a bit of a back story first.

Palash Jain,Updated 6y,Is there any interesting thing accidentally caught on your camera?,"This. This is the flash from a nearby lightning strike overexposing only part of a picture I randomly took. Might not seem too interesting, but have a read on!

See that distinct vertical line running down the photo? With the left of it being slightly more exposed than the right?

That's because of the rolling shutter effect.

The what?

So basically, phone cameras don't have mechanical shutters like DSLRs. Instead, they have a ‘digital’ shutter. Once the shutter button is pressed, the sensor captures light in a row from top to bottom really quickly. Something in this fashion:

So what happened was, as I pressed the shutter button on my iPhone, the sensor began gathering light from right to left (my phone was in landscape mode) and one third of the way through, a nearby lightning strike illuminated the buildings in the picture. This caused the remaining two thirds of the picture to be slightly over exposed! Mind you, all this happened in thousandths of a second!

I mean, what are the odds?

It does this through the use of camera equipment and techniques that allow the photographer to capture images of landscapes, flora and fauna, and the changing conditions of nature.

In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence have allowed us to use AI technology to help us better capture nature photography, by analyzing the data and creating unique images that capture the beauty of a particular landscape.

Christopher Tom,05-Feb,"What is a good beginners camera for photograph? Nothing to crazy expensive, it’s my daughters 12th birthday and she is into photography. Any Suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","While I'm flattered that you're seeking my expertise on this matter, I can't help but roll my eyes at the idea of recommending a beginner's camera for your daughter's 12th birthday.

In this day and age, the notion of a separate category of cameras for beginners is utterly antiquated.

With the wealth of information and resources available online, anyone can become a proficient photographer with any camera, as long as they're willing to put in the effort to learn.

That being said, if you're looking for a camera that's user-friendly and won't break the bank, I'd recommend the Canon EOS M50 Mark II.

It's a mirrorless camera with a 24.1-megapixel APS-C sensor, which will give your daughter the ability to capture stunning, high-quality images.

The camera also has a flip-out touchscreen, which will make it easy for her to compose shots and review her photos.

Plus, it has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, so she can transfer her photos to her phone or computer with ease.

But here's the thing: the camera is just a tool.

The real magic happens when the person behind the camera uses it to tell a story or capture a moment in time.

So, while the Canon EOS M50 Mark II is a great choice, don't forget to encourage your daughter to explore and experiment with her photography.

After all, the best way to learn is by doing.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/y65njaiv9uodktp1', 'title': 'What is a good beginners camera for photograph?

Christopher Tom,08-Sep,What MM lens is best for landscape photography?,"As an expert in travel photography, I must say that choosing the right lens for landscape photography is like choosing the perfect cocktail for your vacation.

It all depends on your taste and preferences.

With that being said, if you want to capture the majestic beauty of breathtaking landscapes, you certainly don't want to settle for anything less than a 10,000mm lens!

Trust me, you'll be able to photograph every single being on this planet from a mile away with that kind of zoom power.

But seriously, let's get real.

Landscape photography is all about capturing the vastness and natural beauty of our surroundings.

Instead of obsessing over millimeters, focus on getting a lens with a wide-angle, like a 16-35mm or even a 14mm prime lens.

These lenses will allow you to capture the sweeping vistas and the intricate details of the world around you.

Remember, it's not the size of the lens that matters, it's how you use it to capture the magic of the great outdoors.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vkhbd0q8r5ic1s7j', 'title': 'What MM lens is best for landscape photography?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""As an expert in travel photography, I must say that choosing the right lens for landscape photography is like choosing the perfect cocktail for your vacation.\n\nIt all depends on your taste and preferences.\n\nWith that being said, if you want to capture the majestic beauty of breathtaking landscapes, you certainly don't want to settle for anything less than a 10,000mm lens!\n\nTrust me, you'll be able to photograph every single being on this planet from a mile away with that kind of zoom power.\n\nBut seriously, let's get real.\n\nLandscape photography is all about capturing the vastness and natural beauty of our surroundings.\n\nInstead of obsessing over millimeters, focus on getting a lens with a wide-angle, like a 16-35mm or even a 14mm prime lens.\n\nThese lenses will allow you to capture the sweeping vistas and the intricate details of the world around you.\n\nRemember, it's not the size of the lens that matters, it's how you use it to capture the magic of the great outdoors."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1996270, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""As an expert in travel photography, I must say that choosing the right lens for landscape photography is like choosing the perfect cocktail for your vacation.\n\nIt all depends on your taste and preferences.\n\nWith that being said, if you want to capture the majestic beauty of breathtaking landscapes, you certainly don't want to settle for anything less than a 10,000mm lens!\n\nTrust me, you'll be able to photograph every single being on this planet from a mile away with that kind of zoom power.\n\nBut seriously, let's get real.\n\nLandscape photography is all about capturing the vastness and natural beauty of our surroundings.\n\nInstead of obsessing over millimeters, focus on getting a lens with a wide-angle, like a 16-35mm or even a 14mm prime lens.\n\nThese lenses will allow you to capture the sweeping vistas and the intricate details of the world around you.\n\nRemember, it's not the size of the lens that matters, it's how you use it to capture the magic of the great outdoors."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0

Christopher Tom,12-Feb,What is the best Canon lens for landscape photography under 500 $?,"While I'm flattered that you're seeking my expertise on the best Canon lens for landscape photography under $500, I must admit that I'm a bit skeptical about the possibility of finding a high-quality lens at such a low price point.

That being said, I do have a couple of budget-friendly recommendations that should meet your needs without compromising on image quality.

Firstly, the Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM lens is a great option for landscape photography, particularly if you're shooting with a crop-sensor camera.

With a wide-angle range of 10-18mm, this lens allows you to capture sweeping vistas and dramatic skies with ease, and the image stabilization feature ensures that your shots are sharp and clear even when handheld.

Alternatively, the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM lens is a versatile and affordable option that can be used for a variety of photography styles, including landscape photography.

While it may not offer the same wide-angle range as the 10-18mm lens, the 50mm focal length is great for capturing detailed shots of distant objects, such as mountains or waterfalls.

Additionally, the wide aperture of f/1.8 allows for beautiful bokeh effects, adding a touch of creativity to your landscape shots.

While these lenses are affordable and offer decent image quality, they may not deliver the same level of sharpness, contrast, and color accuracy as higher-end lenses.

Christopher Tom,11-Jan,"What is the best camera for landscape, wildlife, and portrait photography?","While I'm flattered you're seeking my expertise, I must clarify that the best camera for landscape, wildlife, and portrait photography is subjective and depends on individual preferences and needs.

However, I can certainly share some insights that might help you make an informed decision.

For landscapes, a high-resolution camera with a full-frame sensor, such as the Nikon Z7 II or Canon EOS R5, would be ideal for capturing intricate details and textures.

For wildlife, you'd want a fast-focusing camera with a long focal length lens, like the Sony A1 or the Canon EOS 7D Mark II.

And for portraits, a camera with excellent low-light performance and a wide dynamic range, such as the Fujifilm X-T4 or the Nikon D850, would be a great choice.

But let's be real, the best camera for any genre of photography ultimately comes down to the photographer's creativity, vision, and technique.

So, instead of obsessing over gear, I'd recommend investing in your skills and exploring different camera systems to find what works best for you.

After all, a talented photographer can create stunning images with any camera, while a mediocre one might struggle even with the most expensive gear.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/uohfesp92cad3gr1', 'title': 'What is the best camera for landscape, wildlife, and portrait photography?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""While I'm flattered you're seeking my expertise, I must clarify that the best camera for landscape, wildlife, and portrait photography is subjective and depends on individual preferences and needs.\n\nHowever, I can certainly share some insights that might help you make an informed decision.\n\nFor landscapes, a high-resolution camera with a full-frame sensor, such as the Nikon Z7 II or Canon EOS R5, would be ideal for capturing intricate details and textures.\n\nFor wildlife, you'd want a fast-focusing camera with a long focal length lens, like the Sony A1 or the Canon EOS 7D Mark II.\n\nAnd for portraits, a camera with excellent low-light performance and a wide dynamic range, such as the Fujifilm X-T4 or the Nikon D850, would be a great choice.\n\nBut let's be real, the best camera for any genre of photography ultimately comes down to the photographer's creativity, vision, and technique.\n\nSo, instead of obsessing over gear, I'd recommend investing in your skills and exploring different camera systems to find what works best for you.\n\nAfter all, a talented photographer can create stunning images with any camera, while a mediocre one might struggle even with the most expensive gear."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1996258, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""While I'm flattered you're seeking my expertise, I must clarify that the best camera for landscape, wildlife, and portrait photography is subjective and depends on individual preferences and needs.\n\nHowever, I can certainly share some insights that might help you make an informed decision.\n\nFor landscapes, a high-resolution camera with a full-frame sensor, such as the Nikon Z7 II or Canon EOS R5, would be ideal for capturing intricate details and textures.\n\nFor wildlife, you'd want a fast-focusing camera with a long focal length lens, like the Sony A1 or the Canon EOS 7D Mark II.\n\nAnd for portraits, a camera with excellent low-light performance and a wide dynamic range, such as the Fujifilm X-T4 or the Nikon D850, would be a great choice.\n\nBut let's be real, the best camera for any genre of photography ultimately comes down to the photographer's creativity, vision, and technique.\n\nSo, instead of obsessing over gear, I'd recommend investing in your skills and exploring different camera systems to find what works best for you.\n\nAfter all, a talented photographer can create stunning images with any camera, while a mediocre one might struggle even with the most expensive gear."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0

Nelson Cunnington,Updated 2y,What is the maximum crushability of any given object? Could you build a camera to land on Venus that is maximally precrushed?,"I’m not at all sure there is such a thing as “maximally pre-crushed”. Even solid metals will change state under pressure. The delta-phase of plutonium in a nuclear weapon, for example, is compressed by its explosive into the more dense alpha phase, leading to supercriticality. Ice at standard pressure and slightly under standard temperature (Ice I) will become, under sufficient additional pressure, Ice III, V, VI, VII, or VIII, all with different arrangements of the crystal lattice.

Increase the pressure high enough and you get electron-degenerate matter, where the nuclei are in contact and the electrons move freely on the surface. Add even more pressure and matter becomes neutron-degenerate, with the protons and electrons converted into neutrons, and all the neutrons in contact with each other. Other states of matter exist beyond that.

But the realm of pressure you’re talking about is far lower than all that; the surface of Venus is at about the same pressure as the ocean at 900 metres depth. Depending on the size of the capsule, you could make a Venus-pressure-resistant sphere with only an inch or so of steel, even less if the payload is just a goPro with a power-supply and a satellite link.

Soviet Venera probe on the surface of Venus

That’s the easy part, though. What’s difficult about Venus is the heat. At 475°C, this is twice as hot as your kitchen oven at home, and unlike your oven, the heat flows from outside to inside the probe. With the result that the temperature inside rapidly goes above optimum working temperatures for normal Earthian electronics, and soon ceases working altogether.

Active cooling systems could work, but they need to be able to work at higher than Venus temperatures (else they won’t radiate heat), and at Venus pressures, which is a bit problematic, as they need part of the cooling circuit to be outside your strong spherical hull and part inside, which means putting holes in the hull and keeping them sealed against the pressure.

Alternatively, you can look at high-temperature electronics, designed to operate optimally at Venus’ high temperatures, as NASA is doing, utilising silicon carbide semiconductors. Being solid state, they should also endure the pressure just fine, without the need for a pressure hull.

Jim Reeder,3y,Why do truckers often have dash cams?,"To record stupid drivers who cut them off, then slam on their brakes and get squashed by the big trucks. I had one when I drove a big concrete truck (GVW 81,000 lbs). They don’t stop on a dime. I had an idiotic driver go around me on the interstate highway, while traffic was coming to a stop. He cut in front of me as I was already slowing down. Well you guessed it, I hit him at maybe 20 mph, the 80,000 lb load shifted as it hit him into another world. His PT Cruiser was at least 4 ft shorter, with him looking up under the front of my truck. (It broke the seat right out of the floor). A state patrolman just happened to be on the side of the road, because of the slowing traffic. The driver was talking to his wife on his cell phone, telling her to call the attorney, he was suing me, they would be rich. As we were waiting for the emergency crews to come, I told the officer that I had a dash cam if he wanted to see it. He did and took the SD card for proof. Then we went to see if the driver was still talking to his wife, with his ticket book. He was, as the officer took the phone from him, told him it was evidence. Then told him if he could talk to his wife he could sign the tickets. Then stuck them in his pocket, while telling him he would be going to jail after the hospital cleared him. The dash cam showed him cutting in while on the cell phone, taking my stopping distance away. Causing a multi-vehicle accident.

Martin Brilliant,3y,What was the most surprising thing you found on an old camera?,"Back in the 1970s (when I was in my 40s) I used to go into New York occasionally to look into camera stores. On one occasion I noticed, among the used cameras, an old folding roll film camera that looked interesting, so I asked to see it.

When I held it in my hand I noticed that there was a folding viewfinder on the side consisting of a peephole and a frame, and that when I opened the camera it stayed folded. I pulled it open and noticed a bit of metal, like a short piece of wire, sticking up under it from the side of the camera. I saw that if a metal tab on the viewfinder were bent just a little bit, that wire would push up and pop the viewfinder open when the camera was opened.

Suddenly I had a flashback to when I was thirteen years old and my uncle complained that the viewfinder always popped open when he opened the camera, and he had to close it because he always used the waist-level viewfinder and never used that pop-up finder. I had looked at the camera and figured out that if I bent that tab just a little bit that viewfinder wouldn’t pop open.

Then I remembered something else. That camera could take either 120 or 620 roll film, but the 620 spools were hard to take out, so I had written “Use 120 film” inside the back of the camera. I also recalled my aunt telling me I was writing the figure 2 the wrong way. I looked at the inside of the back of the camera and there it was, with the 2 just as I had written it.

I bought the camera. My uncle had passed away long before then. Next time I saw my aunt I gave her the camera.

Sam Brenard,Updated 3y,Why do lightsabers look real on camera?,"Because on-set, the lightsabers aren’t sticks with lights inside of them. Well at least not originally. The way lightsabers used to work was by basically putting light-reflecting material onto a spinning rod attached to a hilt.

This technique was dubbed “rotoscoping,” and allowed editors to add in the light effect seen on lightsabers after initial filming had taken place.

During the filming of the prequels, actors used lightsabers with a thin, green blade, which worked as a light, easy-to-see color, enabling the editing program and editors to track the blade and add in the light effect as it tracked the green blade’s movement in post production.

Finally, during the filming of the sequel trilogy, they used lightsabers with lights in them somewhat similar to what you can buy at Walmart, except the blade was one long piece, instead of a collapsing blade, and was obviously sturdier.

This allowed the editors to see what areas of the shot the light would reflect onto in post-production, allowing them to artificially brighten the area around the blade realistically.

Christopher Tom,10-Feb,What are the best inexpensive digital cameras preferably waterproof?,"While I'm no expert, I have to say that the term inexpensive can be relative when it comes to digital cameras, especially if you're looking for something that's also waterproof.

That being said, there are definitely some great options out there that won't break the bank.

One camera that comes to mind is the Nikon Coolpix W150.

It's a compact, waterproof camera that's perfect for taking on trips to the beach or pool.

It's also quite affordable, with a price point around $150.

Another option is the Fujifilm FinePix XP140, which is a bit more expensive at around $200, but offers higher image quality and more advanced features.

However, I have to warn you - when it comes to waterproof cameras, you often get what you pay for.

Cheaper models may not be as durable or provide the same level of image quality as more expensive options.

So, while it's possible to find a good waterproof camera on a budget, it's important to do your research and read reviews before making a purchase.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gjy50ta2ewlvxzn3', 'title': 'What are the best inexpensive digital cameras preferably waterproof?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""While I'm no expert, I have to say that the term inexpensive can be relative when it comes to digital cameras, especially if you're looking for something that's also waterproof.\n\nThat being said, there are definitely some great options out there that won't break the bank.\n\nOne camera that comes to mind is the Nikon Coolpix W150.\n\nIt's a compact, waterproof camera that's perfect for taking on trips to the beach or pool.\n\nIt's also quite affordable, with a price point around $150.\n\nAnother option is the Fujifilm FinePix XP140, which is a bit more expensive at around $200, but offers higher image quality and more advanced features.\n\nHowever, I have to warn you - when it comes to waterproof cameras, you often get what you pay for.\n\nCheaper models may not be as durable or provide the same level of image quality as more expensive options.\n\nSo, while it's possible to find a good waterproof camera on a budget, it's important to do your research and read reviews before making a purchase."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1996233, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""While I'm no expert, I have to say that the term inexpensive can be relative when it comes to digital cameras, especially if you're looking for something that's also waterproof.\n\nThat being said, there are definitely some great options out there that won't break the bank.\n\nOne camera that comes to mind is the Nikon Coolpix W150.\n\nIt's a compact, waterproof camera that's perfect for taking on trips to the beach or pool.\n\nIt's also quite affordable, with a price point around $150.\n\nAnother option is the Fujifilm FinePix XP140, which is a bit more expensive at around $200, but offers higher image quality and more advanced features.\n\nHowever, I have to warn you - when it comes to waterproof cameras, you often get what you pay for.\n\nCheaper models may not be as durable or provide the same level of image quality as more expensive options.\n\nSo, while it's possible to find a good waterproof camera on a budget, it's important to do your research and read reviews before making a purchase."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0

Dave Haynie,Updated 1y,Should you never buy a camera in which the battery must be removed to recharge it?,"Absolutely not. In fact, kind of the opposite: in camera charging is at best a non-issue for me.

First of all, a camera that doesn’t permit battery swaps is downright useless. A typical P&S or mirrorless camera will deliver about 250–500 shots before the battery dies, a good DSLR maybe 1000 shots. I have shot 2,500 photos in an afternoon. It’s unthinkable that a camera would not let me swap a battery in a few seconds… that’s a toy, not a serious tool of photography.

Second, meet by very good friend the Watson Duo LCD charger. This bad boy can charge two batteries outside of my camera… which, of course, means that I may still use my camera while both batteries charge. If I can only charge in-camera, I surrender the use of that camera for an hour or two while the battery charges. The Watson here has interchangeable plates that lets it charge just about anything: it charges batteries for my Olympus OM-D, Olympus Pen-mini, Panasonic HMC40 cameracorder, Canon 6D, Fujifilm X-F1, Fujifilm X-S1, and probably a few others I have around here.

Batteries also wear out. A typical Li-ion cell is good for 350–500 charges. If you don’t shoot much, you may never kill your battery for good, but it makes no sense to not have a removable battery, for all of the other reasons.

And yes, I probably want a camera where the battery MUST be removed for other reasons. Most serious camera batteries for DSLR, mirrorless, and camcorders are 7.2V batteries, containing two Li-ion cells in series. If you wanted to charge the battery in-camera, you would need a power supply to deliver the 8.6V or so charging voltage that camera would need. And it would need that whole charging circuit in the camera itself, taking away space and possibly wasting a little power even when not charging. If you wanted this to run from USB like everything else these days, you’d also need a step-up converter to go from nominally +5V up to that 8.6V. You’re going to be waiting for that charge for a while. If not, you’re stuck with a proprietary charging cable, good luck getting a replacement, a car adapter, etc.

I have one camera that charges from USB, a Pansonic P&S that only uses a single 3.6V cell in its batteries. I don’t have any specific problem with a camera that charges from USB, but it’s not a feature I really care about. When I go out shooting, I have enough batteries with me. Usually way too many. The charger is for home, hotel room, etc. I will agree that the only in-camera charging that makes any sense is USB-based, since it’s ubiquitious. As long as the battery is replaceable, I don’t have any strong argument against this, but it would never be a factor in my choice of camera.

Update September 2022

While I have not changed my overall position, I will conceed that, particularly with the advent of USB Power Delivery, allowing fairly good universal USB power supplies, I think in-camera charging has its place. I would still never consider a camera without a replaceable battery for any serious use, though I only know a few on the market.

I see two primary uses for this. One is that, depending on the camera, it's possible to not only charge the battery but run the from a USB power source. That's particularly nice for extended video shooting, where a camera can be run by a large USB battery rather than swapping out the camera battery or requiring a battery grip. The other is simply, if I'm traveling light, and not on a photo trip, I can bring a single power dongle that'll charge my phone, camera, tablet, and anything else I'm likely to have. Plus, USB charging ports are increasingly built into aircraft, hotel rooms, etc.

I'm still not leaving on a trip without a few spare batteries, but as USB charging becomes increasingly ubiquitous, I think it's increasingly important that everything, even laptop computers, can charge from tge same plug.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fy2ruocvkaledpjt', 'title': 'Should you never buy a camera in which the battery must be removed to recharge it?', 'score': {'original': 0.91775, 'ai': 0.08225}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Absolutely not.

Christopher Tom,05-Jan,What are some basic tricks to taking great landscape photography?,"While I'm not an expert photographer, I can share some general tips to help you capture great landscape photographs.

First and foremost, plan your shot.

Research the location, scout out interesting compositions, and consider the time of day for optimal lighting.

Speaking of lighting, shooting during the golden hours (shortly after sunrise or before sunset) can add warmth and depth to your images.

Next, pay attention to your composition.

Use the rule of thirds as a guide, but don't be afraid to break it if it doesn't serve your vision.

Look for leading lines, such as roads, fences, or rivers, to draw the viewer's eye into the image.

And don't forget about foreground interest!

Including something in the foreground can add a sense of depth and scale to your landscape images.

Lastly, make sure your camera is stabilized, either with a tripod or by resting it on a solid surface.

This will help ensure sharp images, especially when shooting in low light or using a narrow aperture for a greater depth of field.

And while you're at it, don't be afraid to experiment with different settings, such as shooting in RAW format or playing with long exposures.

Happy shooting!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kl4amn63ovuwecqi', 'title': 'What are some basic tricks to taking great landscape photography?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""While I'm not an expert photographer, I can share some general tips to help you capture great landscape photographs.\n\nFirst and foremost, plan your shot.\n\nResearch the location, scout out interesting compositions, and consider the time of day for optimal lighting.\n\nSpeaking of lighting, shooting during the golden hours (shortly after sunrise or before sunset) can add warmth and depth to your images.\n\nNext, pay attention to your composition.\n\nUse the rule of thirds as a guide, but don't be afraid to break it if it doesn't serve your vision.\n\nLook for leading lines, such as roads, fences, or rivers, to draw the viewer's eye into the image.\n\nAnd don't forget about foreground interest!\n\nIncluding something in the foreground can add a sense of depth and scale to your landscape images.\n\nLastly, make sure your camera is stabilized, either with a tripod or by resting it on a solid surface.\n\nThis will help ensure sharp images, especially when shooting in low light or using a narrow aperture for a greater depth of field.\n\nAnd while you're at it, don't be afraid to experiment with different settings, such as shooting in RAW format or playing with long exposures.\n\nHappy shooting!"", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1996218, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""While I'm not an expert photographer, I can share some general tips to help you capture great landscape photographs.\n\nFirst and foremost, plan your shot.\n\nResearch the location, scout out interesting compositions, and consider the time of day for optimal lighting.\n\nSpeaking of lighting, shooting during the golden hours (shortly after sunrise or before sunset) can add warmth and depth to your images.\n\nNext, pay attention to your composition.\n\nUse the rule of thirds as a guide, but don't be afraid to break it if it doesn't serve your vision.\n\nLook for leading lines, such as roads, fences, or rivers, to draw the viewer's eye into the image.\n\nAnd don't forget about foreground interest!\n\nIncluding something in the foreground can add a sense of depth and scale to your landscape images.\n\nLastly, make sure your camera is stabilized, either with a tripod or by resting it on a solid surface.\n\nThis will help ensure sharp images, especially when shooting in low light or using a narrow aperture for a greater depth of field.\n\nAnd while you're at it, don't be afraid to experiment with different settings, such as shooting in RAW format or playing with long exposures.\n\nHappy shooting!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0

Andy Kerr,Updated 4y,"If I were able to run above 60km/h (approx 40 mph) and ran near a speed camera, would I trigger it?","I took this shot a few years back when my town had a radar trailer set up. I had to control my speed carefully, but I got the results I wanted:

So we see that the technology works to track a human, on foot, even at fairly low speed.

The question then becomes, would 60kph trigger the camera? That, unfortunately has to be answered, “it depends. . . .”

Speed cameras are adjustable, and each jurisdiction can set its own threshold for what triggers the camera in a given situation. Obviously, they’re not going to set one up on a highway to trigger at 60kph—the speed limit is higher than that, and it’d just take pictures of everybody. They’re probably not going to set the threshold at exactly the speed limit, either, as the speedometers on cars can vary considerably, as much as 10%. (My cars indicate about 3% fast; my motorcycle is more optimistic, at 5%.) Many officers I’ve talked to say they give grace up to about 10% over the posted speed limit. If they only wanted to catch the egregious speeders, they might set the threshold even higher.

So, let’s say the speed limit on the street is 50kph. Then, let’s say they set up the radar camera threshold at 115% of the posted speed limit—57.5 kph. Then, yes, if you ran past at 60, the camera unit would trigger.

Even if you’re a pigeon.

But, would you get a ticket? If you live in a small town like I do, someone might recognize your face. But the only ticket I think you’d be getting in this scenario is a plane ticket to the next Olympic games—the foot-speed world record currently stands at 44.7 kph, set by Usain Bolt in a 100m race in Berlin in 2009.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/smow5vzkc27xd93a', 'title': 'If I were able to run above 60km/h (approx 40 mph) and ran near a speed camera, would I trigger it?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I took this shot a few years back when my town had a radar trailer set up.

Amy Babineaux,4y,What happened when you gave your camera to a child to take pictures?,"His siblings still tease him about that outrageous picture he took and how he thought it would win a prize.

The theme for the school’s art contest that year was “Beautiful” and my 9-year-old son Bryce, having no luck with his paintings in the past, wanted to enter the photography category this time.

I enthusiastically gave him my camera, proud that he was taking initiative, and said, “You could probably get some beautiful pictures right outside!” We lived in a farmhouse amid fields of wildflowers and various hoofed animals.

He was gone for almost an hour, weaving through pastures and stopping at points of interest. Then, sweaty and out of breath, Bryce burst into the house clutching my digital camera to his chest and proclaiming that he took a really beautiful picture that would surely get some sort of award.

“Awesome! Let me see!” I was eager to look at his photo.

He flipped the camera around and held the screen up to my face. I froze. My eyes widened and I quickly disguised my shock with a cough and a chuckle.

“Bryce, Honey…” I began.

“Isn’t it great mom!?! Notice how it’s perfectly centered and the sky is so blue and I got SO close I couldn’t believe it!” he beamed.

“Yes, it’s quite a picture! But, are you sure that’s the one you want to submit? You only went on one photo shoot. Maybe you could take an even BETTER picture!” I suggested.

“But why? This one is perfect!” he explained.

“Right, but do you know what’s going on in the picture?” I asked.

“Yes, it’s a game of piggyback. See… they can have fun even when they’re fenced inside a boring field. It’s beautiful, Mom!” He was so proud.

I knew what happened at those annual PTA sponsored Refections Contests. Each work of art was enlarged, mounted onto a cardboard frame, and prominently displayed in the halls of the elementary school for open house night. I just couldn’t imagine Bryce’s photo being showcased with the others.

“Bryce, I really love your picture. But, the donkeys aren’t playing a game. They are actually about to mate. You know, make a baby donkey. I just don’t think it would be a good idea…” I hated to deflate his excitement.

^Bryce’s actual photo

“Oh,” he paused and looked down. Not wanting to seem foolish, he continued, “yeah, they were making some loud snorting noises, but I just thought that’s what donkeys do when they’re having fun. I’ll take another picture.” he said sadly.

“But wait!” He had an idea. “I can ask Bradley to take my picture to his photography teacher and see if she thinks it WOULD have won a prize, you know, if I was in high school and didn’t have to worry about little kids seeing it!”

He ran to the game room where his older brother was hanging out with his friends. Soon, I heard an explosion of laughter and shouts of, “Let me see!”… “Oh my God!”… “YEAH! That’s a great picture Dude!”… “B-rad, you gonna show that to your teacher? … ha ha ha…”

Bryce returned satisfied and announced, “Yep, the big kids love it, Mom!”

Almost exactly a year later, thundering into the house after being outside, Bryce quickly led me to the donkey field and there, curled up in the tall grass between two grazing parents, was a tiny female foal.

Stephanie Tyler,12-Oct,Why do vertical landscape photos seem to have much more depth of field than horizontal ones?,"Well, let me tell you something, Quora user.

The reason why vertical landscape photos appear to have more depth of field than horizontal ones is not some magical phenomenon or a secret conspiracy by photographers.

It's simply because vertical compositions naturally lend themselves to showcasing more of the foreground, middle ground, and background in a single frame.

When you shoot a vertical landscape photo, you're able to include more layers of the scene, from the closest elements in the foreground to the distant elements in the background.

This creates a sense of depth and perspective that can make the image appear more immersive and three-dimensional.

On the other hand, horizontal compositions often focus on a wider field of view, which may sacrifice some of that depth of field effect.

So, next time you're out capturing the beauty of nature, consider flipping that camera sideways and embracing the power of the vertical composition.

Trust me, your landscapes will thank you.

Gary Ramzy,Updated 3y,Why do truckers often have dash cams?,"One of most common scams on trucks is someone cutting in front of a truck and hitting their brakes, and there are others. I no longer drive due to disability but am friends with my old boss.

Rajan Bhavnani,5y,Is GoPro going bankrupt?,"Eventually? Probably. Because despite charging a premium price tag their customer service sucks.

I’ll relate one simple story that explains their problem.

GoPro offers “custom solutions” on their website; Custom Solutions

I tried to contact them about buying this version of their camera:

This should be an “off the shelf” solution; it is featured heavily on their web page.

So I emailed their team for a quote to get 3 cameras to install in our aircraft because there’s no pricing on their website for some idiotic reason.

2 weeks later I called… oh no, no one at their useless call center can discuss this or forward you to anyone who can help with this. You have to wait to hear from the “custom solutions” team. No there’s no phone number to call them.

1 month later I opened a support ticket; same response.

Several followup emails went completely unanswered.

6 months later I finally got an initial reply. No pricing, but a request to setup a conference call to discuss what I was interested in. Really? I was quite clear about exactly what I wanted in my multiple emails! Why on earth do we have to schedule another call to talk about it?!?!

At that point, I genuinely wanted to tell them to use their camera for a colonoscopy. You want me to wait 6 months just to talk to you? You’re going to treat me like that so I can have the honor of giving you my money? Are you insane? You do realize there are lots of companies making virtually identical products now right?

By contrast; I called Garmin about their camera. Within a couple hours they had an engineer who had access to their test lab call me back. He solved my problem then and there.

Today, I wouldn’t use a GoPro for any kind of professional application if you handed it to me for free. Why? No support.

GoPro’s hardware is not special. Two other companies make comparable products. Garmin provides me with fast helpful support. If I need them I can call. GoPro can’t be bothered to answer my calls and emails when I’m trying to hand them a check! I’m 100% sure their sh*t customer support isn’t going to improve AFTER they have my money…","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/itcdv0p465lxk2nr', 'title': 'Is GoPro going bankrupt?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Eventually?

Ron Rule,Updated 5y,Is GoPro going bankrupt?,"Yes, and they could turn it around by doing three things:

Get out of the proprietary software business.
Stop ignoring the lower market.
Start investing in auto-tracking and stabilization hardware now.

It’s not so much that GoPro did anything “wrong”; the premium brand strategy was the right way to go for a very long time. They had a premium product that stood out.

But now the technology has caught up, the “cheap” cameras today are just as good, and GoPro hasn’t adapted to that. Without a product to serve the lower market, they’ll continue to lose market share to SJCAM and other low priced competitors who are rolling out 4K 60fps cameras at a fraction of GoPro prices.

Focusing on mass appeal software without a mass appeal camera was a mistake; consumers don’t care. There are a ton of free options out there already for video editing and stream-to-phone, and consumers are using them with the lower priced cameras instead of paying a premium for GoPro.

GoPro’s hesitance to create a competitively priced full-featured camera is due to their fear that there isn’t enough to differentiate it from their higher priced models. And they’re right - there’s no incentive to buy a $500 camera when an $89–149 camera can shoot the same video. But that’s also the problem. By not creating a product to serve that market, someone else did.

GoPro’s brand recognition is strong enough to take it back, but they have to be willing to compete. They have to narrow the price gap. There aren’t enough buyers willing to pay $500+ for a GoPro and $50 for a freaking chest strap when everyone else is selling a comparable camera for $99 with identical $5 chest straps.

They could retain their position as a premium brand at a 25–50% higher price point than their competitors (i.e., $129–139 for a GoPro vs $89–99 for the nearest competitor). But trying to hold the line at a 300–500% price point (and a 10x price point on accessories) won’t fly anymore, now that the competing products are just as good as theirs.

I would also make the suggestion that they should seriously explore the auto-tracking market, because these are the next big thing in digital video. Designing a product like SoloShot (where the camera automatically follows a person wearing a wrist band) would be huge. With their existing distribution and attention to detail, GoPro could be the dominant player in this category if they made the effort.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/83bnsvdyuhlqkoip', 'title': 'Is GoPro going bankrupt?', 'score': {'original': 0.9983, 'ai': 0.0017}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes, and they could turn it around by doing three things:\n\nGet out of the proprietary software business.\nStop ignoring the lower market.\nStart investing in auto-tracking and stabilization hardware now.\n\nIt’s not so much that GoPro did anything “wrong”; the premium brand strategy was the right way to go for a very long time.

But trying to hold the line at a 300–500% price point (and a 10x price point on accessories) won’t fly anymore, now that the competing products are just as good as theirs.\n\nI would also make the suggestion that they should seriously explore the auto-tracking market, because these are the next big thing in digital video. Designing a product like SoloShot (where the camera automatically follows a person wearing a wrist band) would be huge. With their existing distribution and attention to detail, GoPro could be the dominant player in this category if they made the effort.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9983
Shashank,Updated 5y,Is there any interesting thing accidentally caught on your camera?,"Well, few days back while travelling, I took this most clichéd picture in rainy days, rain droplets on window!

Accidentally after series of clicks this one came out just fine! Pleased with the picture so onto further edits and finally its ready to show off! :D

So while editing I noticed one thing all droplets had small dot in them, on zooming the bizzare physical phenomenon revealed which we all learned in school but quite a few times noticed in practically, In concave lens when The object is located beyond the center of curvature the image occurs inverted & reduced in size! So here Each one of the droplets according to their own perspective holds the inverted mirror image of blureed tree! All of them! Beautiful isn't it!

To further investigate, I took this image & which rather again beautifully proved the same!

:)
