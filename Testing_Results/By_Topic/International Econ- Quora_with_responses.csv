Vijayraj Kamat,Updated 4y,"If a ten-year-old asks me why a US dollar costs 60 INR, how should I explain it? How do we determine the currency trade values? Why has the INR sunk this much?","Something in line with the following conversation should help in explaining the concept to him. :)

Y: You, C: Child

Ask the 10-year-old: ""If you had only 10-rupee notes, and wanted to buy a chocolate of Rs. 20, what would you do?""

Child will say - ""Give the shopkeeper 2 notes""

Y: ""Let's go to another shop. What would you do if a better chocolate costs Rs. 50 there?""

C: ""I will give shopkeeper 5 notes""

Y: ""Good, There's another shop called XYZ which sells the best chocolate at Rs. 500 and accepts nothing but Rs. 100 notes. It is indeed an awesome chocolate that you will really like. What would you do then?""

C: ""Give him 5 notes""

Y: ""Remember, the shopkeeper accepts only Rs. 100 notes?'""

C: ""But I will give him the same amount of money!!""

Y: ""But he uses a different system, he runs his shop only on 100-rupee notes. But you have only 10-rupee notes. Are they of any value if you want to do business with the shop?""

C: ""No. I might have to take 5*100-rupee notes from someone and give them 50 notes in return""

Y: ""Good!! Let us say a man is standing outside the shop offering 100-rupee notes in exchange for 10-rupee notes.. Then?""

C: ""Wow!! I will give 50 notes to him, and take 5*100-rupee notes""

Y: What if the person says 'Everybody seems to like the chocolate here. Everybody wants 100-rupee notes. I want 60 notes for 5*100 notes'?

Now C starts thinking.

Y: ""You really want the chocolate. Meanwhile another person comes and tries to buy his 100-rupee notes. If you do not buy his notes quickly - he might ask for even more notes, because many people want to buy his notes""

Y: ""Did the value of the chocolate change?""

C: ""No""

Y: ""Did you have less money?""

C: ""No""

Y: ""Then what was the problem?""

C: ""The shopkeeper wants only 100-rupee notes!!! :( ""

Y: ""But finally did you end up paying more than 500 rupees for a 500-rupee chocolate?""

C: ""yes!!! :(""

Y: ""Why? The chocolate price never changed!""

C: ""The chocolate price remained the same. But the price of the 100-rupee note was more!!! :( ""

Y: ""That is what happens. The shop is USA. Let's call the 100-rupee note as the Dollar. Other shops are India. They accept your 10-rupee note. The 'value' lies in the thing. Money is just a medium of exchange. So its value comes from its 'level of acceptance' by people. The chocolate is the same value, but is available only in USA. If you want to do business with him, you need to give him whatever note he wants. He accepts only Dollars. Your-10 rupee note has no value - although you can have as many as you want. So you have to go to somebody who has dollars. When you buy the dollar, the price depends on how high the demand for the dollar is. It has nothing to do with the actual value of the chocolate you are buying. What happens if more and more people want the dollar?""

C: ""I will have to pay more and more rupees for the same dollar"" (Exchange rate)

You end with: ""So when we say $1 is equal to INR 60, it means that everybody wants to buy dollars. Actually, if you want to do business with any FOREIGN country, the rule is that you should use dollars. So the price has become very high. You have to pay 60 rupees to buy just 1 dollar.""

This will explain the exchange rate, forex trading and the dollar standard concepts. But the curiosity might continue....

C: ""OK, but why should everybody use the dollar? What if somebody is OK to take my 10-rupee note?""

Y: ""Then ugly things happen. You will understand only when you grow up""

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,Updated 6y,What exactly happened to the Indian economy in 1991 in layman's terms? What is liberalization? How did it affect the Indian Economy? What is the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the world economy?,"1. Most countries in the world depend on the global economy for a wide variety of things. For India, we depend on West Asia for our oil, South Africa for our gold, US for our technology, South east Asia for vegetable oil etc. To buy these items from the world market, we need US dollars - the global currency of trade. The only way to earn dollars is by selling enough of our stuff in the global economy (exports).

Since 1960s, India depended on the Soviet Union for our exports - as we failed to develop good economic relationships with the US and Western Europe. It was a good going for a while (India and the Soviets) until the proverbial sh*t started to hit the fan. In late 1980s, Soviet Union started to crack and by 1991 they were split into 15 nations (Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, etc). Now, India had a major problem because our primary buyer was in turmoil. Exports were down significantly. Dissolution of the Soviet Union

2. Meanwhile, there was this guy Saddam Hussein who had his misadventure into Kuwait in 1990. This led US to war with Iraq in early 1991. Oil fields started to burn and ships found it hard to reach Persian gulf. Iraq and Kuwait were our big suppliers of oil. The war led to destruction of our oil imports and the prices shot up substantially - doubling in a few months. Gulf War
 and 1990 oil price shock
.

3. In the late 1980s India's political system was imploding. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was involved in a series of troubles - Bofors scandal
, IPKF misadventure, 
Shah Bano case
 that eventually led to his ousting in 1989. What followed were two more terrible leaders who were as unstable as they were incompetent. This had a huge effect on Indian economy that was totally forgotten in the political crisis. In 1991 this stop-gap government crashed. Until Narasimha Rao was sworn as Prime Minister in 1991, Indian economy was left in gross neglect.

-------------------------------------
Thus, 1991 was the year of perfect storm. This triple crisis brought India on its knees. On one end, our primary buyer was gone. On the other hand, our primary sellers were in war. In the middle, our production was effectively stopped by political crisis. We were running out of dollars to buy essential items like crude oil and food from the rest of the world. This is termed a ""Balance of Payments Crisis"" - meaning India was not able to balance its accounts - exports were significantly less than imports.

Since, we didn't have many dollars, we went and begged the IMF - the pawn shop of the world. They asked us to pledge our gold reserves in return for the interim loan of $3.9 billion (a huge sum for India then) just as the neighborhood moneylenders ask for our gold when we want an emergency loan. We took 67 tons of our gold in two planes - one to London and other to Switzerland to get this assistance. India's story of the crisis

'A fiscal stimulus is needed'

India had to physically move the gold stock out of India, abroad. I'm informed, by very, very reliable sources, that the van taking the gold to the airport broke down, and there was total panic.

--------------------------------------------------------

India began its ""liberalization"" when Rao became our Prime Minister on 21st June 1991. Essentially it was the undoing of some of the idiotic policies that Nehru and his family put in place in our country (sorry, can't resist a dig at Nehru). Licence Raj

We did away with many of the import restrictions. Until 1991, we imposed a 400% customs duty on many products. Industries had to beg to get an essential ingredient imported. By 1991, the duties on many products were reduced substantially. This brought new growth in our industries.
Import licensing was abolished. Until 1991, you need a license to import anything and this license was very hard to get.
Government did away with the production licensing in many industries. Until 1991, you needed government's permission in what to produce and how much to produce. In one stroke, the restriction was removed in many industries.
Rao put domestic economic back on track with two stars - Montek Singh and Manmohan Singh. Huge spur was given to our local industries. Stock market rules were relaxed.
Manmohan abolished ""gold smuggling"" (remember 1980s Bollywood movies?) in one go. He effectively allowed Indian expats to bring back 5 kilos of gold with them with no duty. Now, nobody had a reason to smuggle gold & electronics.
Singh and Rao allowed foreign investors to come. Until then India was living in the paranoia of East India company. Many sectors were opened for foreign investment and collaboration. Now, companies like Coke and Nike could come in. Suddenly, Bombay Stock Exchange found a life.
Government started selling some of its businesses to the private sector. This brought cash and new round of efficiency.

In short, liberalization in India's context meant a return of the common sense that was hard to find in our economic circles since 1947. We just removed some of the rules. There is still a long way to go.

Among the blocked properties were 14 luxurious apartments in the capital city Prague and shares in the Czech companies registered to Rostislav Zorikov, Obnosov’s son-in-law, in the total value of 100 million korunas.

Obnosov needs to double down on stealing from military budget that has tripled this year to compensate for the losses.

Sergey Shoigu was accompanied by the governor of Moscow region Andrei Vorobiov, his old partner in crime. Together they were robbing Krasnodar region blind before relocating to more lucrative opportunities of Moscow.

It is here that Sergey Vorobiov and former head of PMC Wagner Yevgeny “Putin’s Chef” Prigozhin had monopoly on providing lunches to kindergartens and schools that resulted in hospitalization of hundreds of kids with stomach infections.

Boris Obnosov spoke with Sergey Shoigu on a project to create a highly mobile MLRS equipped with guided missiles with improved precision and guided interspecific gliding ammunition.

The camouflage tarp fell off the interspecific missile as it’s being rolled in for show and tell time.

Three professional thieves took a tour of a Potemkin military workshop that Obnosov has organized for them as a coverup for some serious moolah embezzlement.

Workers in gray overalls of exactly the same age and height spotting the same crewcuts pretended to work behind desks with stacked up drawers.

Missiles with red nose cones are impressive, but look at that one on the right - the mock red nose dipped.

“This is our most highly technological and sophisticated part of the project,” the young man in a doctor lab coat explained.

Using a highly precise tool - human eye, a young worker is scribbling something on a misguided missile with a pen.

With GLONASS navigation system not working, how’s the missile gonna find its target?

Easy. The young man man is writing down the address in Ukraine!

Inside the super duper secret missile are microchips from washing machines and internet cables. It’s so secret that the insides are shown on Zvezda Channel News performed by a (FSO) federal security guard.

Why “News” is in English? Aren’t they supposed to be fighting Anglo-Saxons? Oh, don’t be silly, they are not - just using Ukraine war as an opportunity to steal.

Another highly sophisticated and precise part of the missile mounted on a wooden block. No robots. No tool machinery. Everything is done by manicured fingers without callouses that haven’t had a day of physical labor in their life unless you count paper pushing as one .

The televised farce is wrapped up in front of a FSO guard/actor with pliers, scotch tape and a blue tray like he’s an electrician working on your socket.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/y538zmusi0xbtqjc', 'title': ""How does Russia's military rely on the country's economy?"", 'score': {'original': 0.4999, 'ai': 0.5001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Numerous barbarians desired to live in Rome while actively trying hard to destroy Roman Empire.

Vote for politicians who will work for everyone once they are in office. Not just for their traditional identity group - religion, caste, tribe, language, region, whatever. This will mean lower focus on divisive traditional identity issues, and more on economic growth.

Get yourself the best education possible. You are no longer limited to your local teachers. The internet is at your command. Use it.

Misha Firer,Feb 15,Why has Russia always been poor?,"A Russian man’s flower bouquet to assist him in his noble mission to destroy American Hegemony: a camouflage wrapper with symbolic nuts and a bottle of American Coca Cola.

Putin’s regime started off in 2000 with false flag terrorist attack against civilians in Moscow to justify launching another war in Chechnya. It rapidly spiraled into real terrorist attacks creating a vicious cycle.

External terrorism became the internal terrorization of the critics of the regime and un-controlled opposition.

Putin has built Terrorist Dystopia, in which social degradation spread like cancer tumor: branches of power lost independence, corruption became the norm, institution of marriage and birthrates collapsed.

In professional activities all the rules and norms have been thrown out of the window along with its critics, brain drain accelerated. There’s a shortage of personnel while management costs of unproductive workforce is only increasing.

In this winter, millions of people have been left without central heating and electricity as a cascade of accidents spread across the country.

The most corrupt and sycophant individuals became the leaders everywhere from public schools to regional legislature.

There are no journalists left, only propagandists. Labor productivity fell as bosses are not held accountable. They don’t care to make employees work hard as they are paid pennies and can’t be promoted because all the top spots are taken by the inner circle appointees leaving them unmotivated.

Every evening I watch a stampede of Russian Railways office plankton at 6pm from the glass office building running across the road on red light risking their lives to put the distance faster between the hated job and the metro station.

The Russian made Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft is preparing for an emergency landing at Sheremetyevo Airport. The aircraft took off from Moscow heading to St. Petersburg, an hour away. According to the source, one of the plane's engines failed.

The number of the employees of this state corporation has tripled since the collapse of the Soviet Union and revenues come from ticket sales that cost as much as flight tickets and transportation of natural resources overseas using the old Soviet rail tracks. No new lines have been built.

Putin decided to follow in the footsteps of Nazi Germany and when the society started to get torn apart and internal terror couldn’t cope with it, he relieved tensions through external expansion.

Rebranded McDonald’s called “Tasty and Period” continues to get new equipment and support from McDonald's in neighbor country Kazakstan. Russia can’t run a fast food chain on its own without a supervision and its own technologies.

Putin ordered to create organization of the patriotic competition for mentors “To be, not to seem!”

The phrase “To be, not to seem!” (Mehr sein als scheinen) was the slogan of political schools in Nazi Germany, where they trained leadership for the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) and the SS - the party's paramilitary units. When World War II began, many school graduates joined the SS and Wehrmacht.

Putin is witlessly creating Nazism in Russia under the guise of anti-Nazi fight.

Border city of Belgorod has become a shooting range for the Ukrainian Army bombardments. Special Military Operation has nothing to do with securing borders and making Russia safer. If anything, it made Russia much less safe than ever before.

Russia is world’s largest country and second least densely populated and yet Putin sacrifices the remaining workforce and economy to enlarge it through a war of conquest.

Pouring asphalt into water and spreading it with a shovel. Patent pending: 384949.

As a KGB agent, Putin knows only one social mechanism available to him - terror.

His utopian promises about great achievements that will be done in some distant future is a relic of the Bolshevik pseudo-religious doctrine that sold future to the uneducated peasants because they lagged far behind the Western civilization in the present.

Putin does not have a plan for post-war Russia. Even if he were to occupy all of Ukraine and defeat American hegemony, his country lacks workforce, technologies and a clear vision of the future to take the global lead.

As such, Russia’s future is to be China’s vassal for many decades if not centuries to come. This is Putin’s real legacy. Not economy or Ukraine.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mdwqi051gpk3e87h', 'title': 'Why has Russia always been poor?', 'score': {'original': 0.9501, 'ai': 0.0499}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""A Russian man’s flower bouquet to assist him in his noble mission to destroy American Hegemony: a camouflage wrapper with symbolic nuts and a bottle of American Coca Cola.\n\nPutin’s regime started off in 2000 with false flag terrorist attack against civilians in Moscow to justify launching another war in Chechnya.

Misha Firer,Sep 17,Why does it seem that most countries have a better economic situation than Russia’s?,"Russia has redirected commercial activities from Europe to China, but there are a number of insurmountable obstacles to this economic partnership.

The fundamental one is that, unlike America and Europe, Russia does not have its own technologies, machinery, or factory equipment to design and manufacture consumer goods, from electronic wristwatches to passenger vehicles.

In the past two decades, Russians have been counting money and buying stuff produced by transnational corporations rather than investing in research and development and creating their own technologies. The reckoning is just around the corner.

There lies a chasm between the dependence of America on China, and that of Russia. Mexico has become America’s largest trading partner and the new iPhone is Made in India. America is actively decoupling from China, while Russia is doing exactly the opposite - becoming more dependent on China by the day.

For example, all the new vehicles that are hitting roads (built with German equipment) in Russia are now Chinese. They’re planning to open a Chery auto factory in St. Petersburg taking advantage of the departed South Korean Hyundai. Like their Western counterparts in the past, the Chinese will not share technologies with the Russians. The local workforce will attach doors and screw the screws, but all the engineers will be Chinese.

On their own, Russia cannot substitute departed Western brands - only China can do it with the technologies they “borrowed” from the West. Anything more complicated than off-brand shampoo or plastic cups is beyond Russia’s capabilities.

Public officials can pretend for all they like that the former Renault-Nissan factory in Moscow now produces the “Moskvich” car brand associated with the mass-produced Opel copycats in the Soviet Union, it is still JAC JS4 SUV, and it’s as Russian as the Peking duck.

The second issue is logistics. There are potted roads with one lane each way and far fewer railway tracks in Siberia than in the European part of Russia.

As a consequence, freight trains with timber, coal, and other raw materials headed across eleven time zones are stuck for days and weeks waiting in line for their turn to pass through. The situation is exacerbated by trains with military equipment headed to bring military equipment from storage facilities in the Far East. They’re given top priority and regardless of the cargo or urgency, you gotta wait.

Pyotr Tolstoy, a run-of-the-mill yes-man official who vocalizes Krelin’s radical thoughts stated that Russia should quit the United Nations because they don’t allow clear-cutting forests around Lake Baikal.

What a bad, bad organization - they don’t wanna let Russia destroy itself. But the underlying reasoning is simple - instead of bringing timber from the northwest, it’s far easier to clear-cut the remaining woods along China’s border to ease transportation costs.

China is in no rush to jump in to build infrastructure projects in Siberia and open up shops in Russia to produce consumer goods of the departed Western brands as they’re in bad economic shape and fear that sanctions from America might completely crush their economy.

The future, however, is crystal clear - if Russia doesn’t manage to patch up relationships with the West, which right now appears unlikely, China will fill in the vacuum and Russia will become a raw materials appendage to the Red Dragon.

Putin started war in Ukraine because he believed that the West didn’t treat Russia with respect but what he and his compatriots gonna discover at the end of the road is that China treats Russia with a greater contempt.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0lt7c6afh8jiozu9', 'title': 'Why does it seem that most countries have a better economic situation than Russia’s?', 'score': {'original': 0.49495, 'ai': 0.50505}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Russia has redirected commercial activities from Europe to China, but there are a number of insurmountable obstacles to this economic partnership.\n\nThe fundamental one is that, unlike America and Europe, Russia does not have its own technologies, machinery, or factory equipment to design and manufacture consumer goods, from electronic wristwatches to passenger vehicles.\n\nIn the past two decades, Russians have been counting money and buying stuff produced by transnational corporations rather than investing in research and development and creating their own technologies.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,4y,Is the rule of the BJP good for the Indian economy?,"In terms of economy BJP has increasingly turned socialist and has thus become an average — like the previous governments, rather than hitting the ball out of the park. The first budget of Modi 2.0 has been quite disappointing. While their social schemes have been quite good, these welfare schemes have to be paid by the large businesses. And the government has not been paying attention to them.

I get that we need to build toilets and give out LPG cylinders. But, is that an excuse for not speeding up the economic reforms and unlock key investments? When are we going to bring key major foreign investments in retail, aviation, agriculture and other key sectors?

With the opposition decimated, this is the best time to bring bold new reforms. I expected the victorious Modi in second term to bring out the long awaited reforms that unshackled China in the 1980s. It is one thing to engage in welfare politics before the elections, but now that it is won and no major state elections are near, what is the excuse for going slow?

There has not been big bang reforms and economic reforms are getting as bad as past Congress governments. Even basic things like selling Air India and BSNL is taking far too long.

The NPA mess that UPA 1 created are yet to be cleaned off. There is no nationwide urgency to clean the banks and no public recognition of the dire crisis.

There are no big reforms in land and labour — two chains that shackle Indian businesses. There is no big push for exports — although we make in India, we have never seen any benefit to that. There are no new cities built — the smart cities have neither been smart nor been cities.

We expected the former Gujarat CM to replicate his magic at the centre. Rather it is increasingly looking like Congress [just more efficient & less corrupt] — more on welfare politics and less on capitalism.

Let Amit Shah keep working on his realpolitik, but Modi needs to come out and go big bang on issues of real substance. That is the only way to make history.

If you are hitting singles when the asking rate needs boundaries, public is going to be angered. Both in cricket and politics, our idols are not going to be spared. If you don’t take right kind of risks at the right time, you risk losing everything. Just as Dhoni [who cleared the team of old timers when he took over] found out, BJP has to realise that the same forces that sent them up, can also bring them down. Ultimately most of us BJP supporters are more loyal to the country than to the party and will have to make hard choices if things don’t improve soon.

It is not a sin being a suit boot sarkar and unleash the pent up market forces. That is the only way to become a $5 trillion economy in the near future.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cujt1bxmwofsga3l', 'title': 'Is the rule of the BJP good for the Indian economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In terms of economy BJP has increasingly turned socialist and has thus become an average — like the previous governments, rather than hitting the ball out of the park.

Misha Firer,11mo,What is the current state of Russia's economy? How do you think it will look like in a couple decades from now?,"In a famous Russian joke, father comes home and tells his son that price of vodka has gone up.

“Dad,” son says hopefully. “Does it mean that you gonna drink less booze?”

“No, son. It means you gonna eat less food.”

Schoolchildren in Bashkiria complained to their parents that school lunch portion sizes have shrunk.

Like the son from the vodka joke, Western leaders naively thought that if Putin gets less money from oil and gas he’s gonna stop war in Ukraine, but all it achieved is that Russian children eat less so that he could carry on.

Andrei Safronov, neurologist, PhD in medical science, born and raised in Vladimir took the midnight train going to not anywhere but warfront in Ukraine where he was promptly killed.

Special military operation has a resounding success

In Vladimir there’s one neurologist less.

Yevgeny “Murder Incorporated” Prigozhin , chief of private army Wagner, pays convicts to die for him near Artemovsk in Donbas.

A proper name of the location as Artemis is Greek goddess of wild animals, a state to which Prigozhin has reduced over 50,000 human beings.

Daniel Zyuev is a lucky one - the remains of his body were dumped into a rectangular-shaped rainwater-filled hole in the ground in an open field of the Kuban. His family will enjoy coffin money while it lasts.

Prigozhin was forbidden from drafting more convicts for suicide missions, and he moved on to inmates of insane asylum .

A person willing to die for five million rubles doesn’t need to have a medical report from his psychiatrist nor any medical examinations.

Everywhere you turn, it’s murder incorporated.

Why is Putin’s cronies are still bothering with pretense that they are fighting phantom Nazis when they’re in fact actively cosplaying Nazis (minus German rigor and discipline)?

Putler Youth organisation shows more promise than public officials . Schoolgirls can assemble assault rifles in thirty seconds .

And assemble meat grinders for the special military operation .

Say what you like but 1) Russian Nazis are not communists b) have a good sense of humor.

BREAKING NEWS. Rapper Ptakha was killed in Donbas where he was giving a concert to servicemen.

Ptakha used to beat up his wife for sleeping with other men while he was sleeping with other women and his daughter for being overweight and a tomboy.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,1y,"Given the current social disturbance in India, how well is it positioned in the future to be an economic superpower?","What “social disturbance” are we talking here? There are over a dozen wars happening in places ranging from Ukraine to Yemen and Ethiopia. Nearly 8000 people died due to Mexican drug cartels last year alone. In the past 4 months alone there were 7 major bombings in Pakistan’s cities. Sri Lanka went bankrupt and its PM’s house in set on fire. There are huge cases of terrorism & mass shooting in places ranging from New Zealand to Europe, while these would be a daily thing in the US.

In a nation of 1.4 billion people, 2 guys getting injured from a random violence in a corner is nothing comparable. Is this the standard of “disturbance”?

Even at the heights of farm protests in India last year, look at India’s protest map relative to what is happening in Europe and elsewhere (and this is not even adjusting for population. The map below didn’t track US (where BLM caused a massive social unrest) which would have put the world’s biggest circle there.

Terror attacks at the historical lowest in India at this point and so are major riots. From northeast to naxal attacks to Kashmir stone throwings and bombings, everything is close to the lowest point in the past 2 decades.

Here is data from South Asia terror portal.

By every metric of social disturbance — wars, riots, terror attacks, shootings, protests — India is experiencing a remarkable level of peace both relative to other parts of the world and our own past.

Now, coming to the economy, it is on a very strong footing now. With major reforms in finance, transportation, energy and retail that is happening, it is hard not to recognise India as the fastest growing major economy now. Even a stridently anti-Indian magazine like Economist had to bite the bullet and say this in their today’s magazine.

Mr Modi’s government has also got a lot right.

IMF thinks India will fare better than most other major economies in 2022
IMF expects a severe setback to the global economic recovery from the Russia-Ukraine war.

A key place to look at the economy is the health of the largest bank in India. Here is the latest news:

There are big changes that impact the long term:

India’s the world’s 3rd biggest in solar power now. We will have the cheapest power and an energy independence we never had before.
There is a big drop in fertility rates 
among all communities in India and this point to a population that will stabilize soon and even drop slightly — a good thing. With fewer kids now, we can educate them better and provide them with better health so that they can become great citizens in 20 years.
India is adding 50km of national highways every day
! This is a world record. All these roads would lead to better movement of goods as well as spread growth from a few cities. People can now stay far from the cities and still benefit — this is a massive change.
There is a massive electrification happening. The largest transportation system — railways — will be completely electric soon. Most autorickshaws and bikes are converting to EV. Despite the hiccups with battery fires, these will bring lasting changes to Indian transportation system. From solar power to electric vehicles, India will attain a level of energy independence besides causing a major economic growth in the sectors.
India has one of the most sophisticated fintech systems now enabling movement of money from one person to another in the lowest friction. 40% of the world’s
 digital payments happened in India.
There is a big rewiring of welfare distribution
 happening. Last year nearly $100 billion was directly wired to the bank accounts of the poorest Indians, leading many to cope up with the pandemic.
There is a massive expansion of Internet connectivity to the point that rural Internet users outnumber the urban internet users
. There are more than 646 million active Internet users — more than Europe’s and thrice as much as the US. When combined with the digital payments, direct benefits transfer, virtual education etc this is causing a major change in the rural economy.
India is now the world’s 3rd largest startup ecosystem — many of them are digitizing the economy to make use of the massively rising rural Internet users.

Short term — these are things happening (May 2022):

Despite all the oil price rises, India’s inflation is lower than that of the US (7.7% vs 8.3%) and comparable to EU now. This is a massive change. There was never a time when India had a lower inflation than the developed nations.
Manufacturing is in expanding with PMI showing healthy level.
Bank non-performing assets (bad loans) are dropping substantially. It is about the half the levels of where it was 4 years ago. This has enabled them to grow their loans
 substantially — essential for industries to borrow and expand.
Monsoon is expected to come earlier
 than expected, boosting farm production.
The drop in GDP due to COVID is now over. By end of 2022, GDP in dollar terms is expected to be 25% higher than that in 2019. Not perfect, but the 2 years have been brutal for every economy.

Tax collection of all types is at a record high and much higher than budgeted despite not increasing any tax rates.

Tax collections soar to record Rs 27.07 lakh crore in FY22
Gross tax collection of Rs 27.07 lakh crore during April 2021 to March 2022 compares with budget estimate of Rs 22.17 lakh crore, he told reporters here. Direct taxes, which comprise income tax paid by individuals and corporate tax, came in at Rs 14.10 lakh crore -- Rs 3.02 lakh crore higher than the budget estimate.

The case for India becoming an economic superpower:

Over the past few decades India has improved its security and avoided wars & other major disturbance. When you think of Europe, you worry about Russia and its expansion, bringing a NATO-Russia war as a possibility. You think of US and worry about its tensions with the other 2 superpowers. Europe is also facing the big uncertainty of immigration and their assimilation. East Asia is rapidly ageing. Latin America is still caught up in huge gang wars — as cartel violence in Mexico and other countries have increased. India has no such fundamental challenge.

We are just short distance from having Internet connectivity for every Indian. A massive startup ecosystem is ensuring that rural India benefits from this connectivity that is going impact every part of their life — how they study, work, get entertainment and get healthcare. With rapidly expanding roadways, railways, subsidized housing, toilets etc and other infrastructure they are going to see fundamental things change about their life.

As the clean energy — solar and wind — expand big there energy gaps get sorted out. India has now reached a point where nearly every Indian home has power and cooking gas. Soon every Indian home will have an electric vehicle (bike) that they will charge with this new solar output and run on this new road. People are going to move like never before. There is welfare that is directly reaching the bank accounts of the poorest and now nearly ever Indian home has a bank account. This cuts a huge level of corruption.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h0wxn2p9lfaue8qr', 'title': 'Given the current social disturbance in India, how well is it positioned in the future to be an economic superpower?', 'score': {'original': 0.48876666666667, 'ai': 0.51123333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'What “social disturbance” are we talking here?

Misha Firer,6mo,What are the consequences of Russia destroying its own economy?,"Vot a zhitshow: letters of the sacred anti-Nazi military operation in Ukraine are painted in brown on the side wall and the door of an outhouse in a Russian village.

On July 27th, “Russia is Africa” summit kickstarted in St. Petersburg finally resolving the long-time dilemma whether Russia is in Asia or Europe.

“There’s enormous mutual attraction between Africa and Russia,” said Oleg Ozerov, a Special Requests Ambassador aka “errand boy” in the Ministry of Interference in Foreign Affairs.

Two-thirds of African leaders declined the invitation to attend Russia is Africa summit in the prostitution capital of Europe featuring a concert of the rock star President Putin, a vocalist of The Tsar.

Putin will perform We Will Nuke You, Radio Hague, Fat Bottomed Generals, The Shitshow Must Go On, Crooks Will Be Crooks, Luciferian Rhapsody, We Are the Losers of the World, and Under Pressure From Sanctions hit songs.

That’s right, 38 out of 54 countries didn’t send their heads of states.

10 African countries will be represented by prime ministers rather than presidents. 17 countries will be represented by either vice-premiers or ministers. 5 states are represented by ambassadors.

Four years ago, at the first summit in Sochi, Putin promised African countries a twofold increase in trade, up to $40 billion.

Four year later, the volume of trade did not increase, but decreased to 18 billion dollars. Russia accounts for only one percent of foreign investment in Africa, less that the investment of the island of Mauritius.

The Russian Academy of Sciences asked Putin to bring in more migrants from Africa because of the record low birth rate in the country.

“We have very few Russians of African descent, the African diaspora is only about 40,000 people!” academicians erupted in righteous indignation.

Subramaniam Duraisamy,2y,Will Uttar Pradesh ever overtake Tamil Nadu in terms of GDP or GDP per capita?,"In terms of GDP yes.

In terms of per capita income- it will take a long time.

GDP is a macro economic measure of economic output of a region. Say I set up a new packaging unit in my area and employ only 15 people. I actually increase the economic output of my area. If I develop that unit into a large factory and employ 1500 people, I contribute in a major way and increase the per capita income of 1500 people in my area. That is the major difference between GDP and per-capita levels.

Right now- there has been a lot of news in GDP of Uttar Pradesh and development activities of expressways, factories and new airports. All this increases the economic output.

However in terms of per-capita incomes, Uttar Pradesh has a long way to go

Uttar Pradesh seems to be following a top-heavy approach of investing in infrastructure, factories and large scale employment generation and allowing the wealth to trickle down.

Tamil Nadu followed a mix of both top-down and bottom-up approaches of pushing the wealth down and invest in small scale and MSMEs.

A good metric to judge the standard of living is MPCE or the number of assets owned by people. This is how it looks in the SDG report

In UP- 12% of people are deprived or not having any value generating assets, whereas in Tamil Nadu its only 3%.

I am not saying UP wont develop at all, but right now the journey has only started and its a long way. There is one big advantage which UP has that TN does not- and that is workforce. Tamil Nadu’s local labour is very expensive and we have to look for people from outside for our MSMEs. Uttar Pradesh does not have this problem. How well the UP government channelize this workforce remains to be seen","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qhxtzvmcwu251dep', 'title': 'Will Uttar Pradesh ever overtake Tamil Nadu in terms of GDP or GDP per capita?', 'score': {'original': 0.8993, 'ai': 0.1007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In terms of GDP yes.\n\nIn terms of per capita income- it will take a long time.\n\nGDP is a macro economic measure of economic output of a region.

Misha Firer,8mo,What is the reason behind supporting capitalism?,"Presenting ineffably brutalsky Tsar Curb. Last year sidewalk curbs thrown out because already all embezzled funds have been spent on Dubaisk condo apartments and Romanian second passports.

Coming to street near you if you live in Moscovia. Is big and heavy because dodgy oil tanker fleet make many money that need good old laundering.

When I young, Slav squat did Gopniks. Flat feet pros these days are all Central Asian migrant workers who help former gopniks launder money. They keep street chairless tradition alive. Respect!

Moscow is big construction and roadwork. Is last call to embezzle last call to embezzle more funds ! please proceed to your chosen construction zone immediately before registration closed and Putin is flushed down toilet with his vatnik army and oligarchs take off in their jets!

Waaaaaaaah, I’d trade Crimea and Donbas for a discounted pair of Adidas shoes.

Soviet traffic police watchtower nicknamed glass. Because made of glass to see traffic. Watching traffic go by was popular activity because what if Western spy in some passenger vehicle and kgb must be alerted? There three glass artifacts survive but because no tourists except Chinese I showed you.

Nearby, on Leninsky Prospekt, there is art object: a nuclear button inside an ice cube. Inscription printed: “Patience of Russia.”

It’s all grand - a nuclear button in the center of Moscow and patience is running thin in summer heat and if lose war we press red button because better destroy all the life on the planet than not to celebrate Victory Day next May 9.

However, I think the message is misconstrued. For good representation of Russia’s patience the art object must be installed in the coldest winter spell.

Let me tell you about Russia’s patience , all right? Russians are so patient, their favorite family activity is to watch wallpaper peel and they spend so much time on toilet, they finish War and Peace in one go.

Russians are so patient they install one elevator in a 25 story residential blocks and take stairs when the line gets too long not because waiting time is 2 hours but to be nice to the neighbors.

Russians are so patient when they get ill they don’t visit a doctor because they don’t need to be in a hospital they already patient.

This is world record of number of aircraft in the skies simultaneously. It looks like planes are everywhere except Greenland, Ukraine and Russia.

But if in Greenland only polar bears live and war in Ukraine, then what excuse for Russia?

Maybe because no people live in Russia and census are bogus? Or no people can afford to fly? Or no more airplanes left because of sanctions?

Worse thing happens when your airplane that transitions through Russia gets out of order. How you survive in wilderness and how can they fix your plane when this global superpower doesn’t have any planes themselves except oligarchs?

About 250 foreigners were on board of Boeing 777 flying from Delhi to San Francisco when the aircraft lost its right engine and had to make emergency landing in Russian Far North. More specifically in Kolyma.

For those of you who don’t know…

Kolyma is notorious region for Gulag concentration labor camps. What a living nightmare. Would passengers be immediately forced to work in inhumane conditions for glorious Putinostan and most die in the first year from diseases, famine and warden’s axe?

It is not the synopsis of American horror movie, but really happened, no forced labor but Russian hospitality which consists of placing everyone in a school gym on mattresses.

Why residents didn’t adopt-a-passenger scheme and maybe charge a little money? Because suspicious of foreigners of course!

But what about hotels, you ask? There’s only one in Magadan - for business class passengers.

Welcome to Russian gym, foreigners! In a city of 100,000 people that’s the only place they could find to accommodate 300 tourists.

You can play basketball while waiting for another plane from India - we already confiscated your plane to cannabilize because we don’t have Boeing aircraft spare parts and sent out sharpas to the tundra to retreat your right engine needed on Moscow - Sochi H349 flight!

Swedish game company Alga Games created a game Finanssi (“Finance”) already in the 1960s. They added in stocks, shares, obligations, taxation, boom-bust cycles and other stuff (like hostile takeovers) in Monopoly, and the result has been a true classic.

There are three ways to win:

Agree some pre-defined victory condition
Drive other players into bankruptcy

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,Updated 11y,"Why is gold considered so precious and why does it have such high prices, and what satisfaction do people derive from this ‘precious’ metal?","Copying from my other answer Dr. Balaji Viswanathan (பாலாஜி விஸ்வநாதன்)'s answer to How did gold become the historical standard store of value?

World needs some currency system to handle trade. It can be anything (stones, metals, water, food, etc.). So, why gold? Gold was used by almost all the major civilizations in the world. Can the whole world be crazy for 1000s of years? Here is why gold is golden:





It is extremely dense. Meaning it is easier to carry & handle than a sack of rice or a barrel of oil. In fact, anybody could put their entire family's wealth in a small bag and carry away (in times of crisis, disaster or migration).

It is quite inert and doesn't corrode. Meaning it doesn't lose value. Thus, generations could hand over their gold to their next ones. Can you do that with paper or iron? Can your grandma give her savings in some crumbled notes to you (that her great grandmother gave)? Unless you are a philatelist or history students, those notes will have no worth to you.
It is very easy to test purity anywhere in the world at almost zero cost. How easy is it to test a foreign counterfeit note? How easy is it to value land or diamonds?
The supply of gold is stable across centuries. Very unlikely to produce new mines any time soon. How easy is to print currency & debase value? How likely is to find a newer mine for another metal? No government can cheekily steal your saving's value by increasing production.
Gold has only one grade and thus single pricing. Meaning it is very liquid. If you were to trade in diamonds or oil, you have to deal with myriad range of grades & quality. Can you get the same value for your diamond ring if you were to sell it now at the price you bought it?
Gold is recognized all over the world. This means flexibility and trust. No other material is this recognized across the world. Will your Yuans or Rupees or Reals work this way?
Unlike silver or platinum, gold has very little industrial use (only about 100t annually is used in industries such as semiconductors).

Bharat Chandani,4y,"If the economy is really in a slowdown, why can't I see it?","Because you haven't seen it from the perspective of the manufacturing industries. I keep visiting the ceramic tiles and sanitary ware industry in Morbi (the town which supplies more than 80% of tiles in India, it’s my current posting) and most of the industrialist here are willing to sell down their plant even by taking some loss.

Reason : domestic market is down and they dont have sufficient funds even for day to day working of their industry.

If ceramic tiles industry is under distress that means that real estate must be in distress too, as they are their main buyers. And if real estate is in distress that means that Steel, Cement sectors must also be distress, you know the reason why. And if cement and steel industry is in distress that means that coal sector which supplies mainly to cement, steel and power industry must be in distress. And if ceramic, coal, cement, steel industries are in distress that means there allied industry i.e. packaging, transportation, power sector must be in distress. And if all of them are in distress that simply means the people working in these industries might not be able to afford luxury hence automobiles, garment sector and real estate sector is in distress.

So you can see that a complete wheel of economy has stopped primarily due to demonetization ( because most of the funds flowing in India's real estate was black money and demonetization stopped that to a large extent.) What govt really needs is to start this wheel again, if not through domestic consumption than atleast by promoting exports.

Shubham,Updated 6y,Is the Japanese loan for India's bullet train a rip off?,"The funny thing with statistics is that anyone can manipulate the data to convince others.

The article says “Today Re 1 buys 1.72 yen, ten years ago Re 1 could buy 2.80 yen”. That’s true. What it doesn’t mention is that in June 2012, ₹1 could buy 1.39 yen only.

Here is the chart of INR-JPY conversion for last 10 years:

And here it is for the last 5 years:

So for last 5 years, INR has actually been appreciating against JPY.

How is it possible? See the inflation chart below:

India’s inflation under UPA rule reached as high as 12% in 2013. Raghuram Rajan did an incredible job in lowering India’s inflation. And Modi govt is doing a commendable job of maintaining the inflation rate around 3%.

Here’s Japanese inflation rate in last 5 years for you:

Now I am no economist, so its on you how to predict the future INR-JPY exchange rate.

“By the time the loan is repaid in 50 years, India would have shelled out Rs 300,000 crores at least, or even more, depending on how quickly the loan is extinguished.” Even if all hell breaks loose and the above statement comes true, this wouldn't have any major impact on Indian economy. This article totally overlooks the growth of Indian Economy in the next 50 years.

India’s GDP is projected to be $28 Trillion in 2050, more than 10 times of $2.5 Trillion in 2017.

How much do you think it would affect India’s economy to repay $19 Billion (in current value) in installments?

Economy growth rate, inflation rate, exchange rate; all will go up and down in cycles as they have been doing in the past. There is no need to hit the panic button which is the intention of this article.

One thing I do not understand is why these economists always single out the Japanese investment in bullet train project and estimate it to be a heavy burden for India. Japan has invested heavily in many projects in India namely, Delhi Metro, Chennai Metro, Mumbai Metro, Kochi Metro, Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), many connectivity projects in Northeast, and more. Why not write about the other investments and call them a big burden for India too? Won’t those loans get affected by exchange rates?

Naveen Subramanian,1y,What is it that leads countries to prosperity or poverty?,"Something simple as “Pincode” can make a difference. US have structured pin codes (address), developing countries like India lack structured Pincode. That makes a huge difference in our economic activities. Sample of 4 different ways an address is written for a single address in India

Comparitively, in the US the location of address is readily available, easy to locate.

In India, its very hard to locate an address despite having a proper Pincode, because it’s unstructured. Indian Pincode roughly covers 5km radius. This is why we go with “landmark” for an address that is unstructured. This landmark-based address is inconsistent, infrequent, and often incomplete. Remember standing outside your home - directing the delivery guy to reach your place despite him having your address?? - That’s what we’re discussing here.

Despite all the additional information you provide, it takes extra 15 mins for something to reach. This inability to provide proper address affects us in many ways-

Emergency services are unable to reach on time,
Govt policies are implemented inadequately,
Small businesses find it tough to scale it up, economic activity is slower

Most of the govt policies, and schemes are implemented based on population count in an area, and that’s based on address proof like a Ration card - ex : PDS. In developed states, this PDS scheme works fine, in Bihar or Jharkhand PDS is not reaching the poor because the Pincode itself is wrong Yes, 30% of indian pin codes are written wrongly. .

Despite being a metropolitian- Chennai has 444 unrecognized slums without proper pin codes. In US structured addresses lead to relatively accurate geocoding and consequently the last mile cost is about 10–12% of the total cost, in India, it’s 30%. The extra cost comes from the long time that a driver takes in locating an address- stopping multiple times to either call the recipient or ask someone on the road for directions and additional driving in search of the correct location.

Online delivery startups fail to address this issue - one delivery guy rides 20km while the other rides 100 km on average and that hinders productivity and supply on time. Most startups end up in a loss.

This absence of structured pincode reflects in several ways

Govt is unable to verify identity on time - reflects as poor planning and implementation
Increases informal unstructured economy with no social security - many end up getting poorly paid resulting in poverty
Due to improper addresses, many can’t get access to bank loans and other credit facilities - hinders economic growth
It increases cash handling in the economy leading to corruption and hoarding
Complexity in accessing a business turnover and scaling.

Whether it’s job interview or loan application, you have to provide any these set of documents - proof of identity, address, age and income, educational qualifications, employment verification document and bank statements. The verification of these documents are automated. 30% of your application face difficulties in getting processed or gets rejected by AI because

Address is different , spelling is different , door number is different, building name is different, road name is different, the locality is different - All these are minor mistakes but makes a huge difference while processing information. Most of this processing happens in outsourced centers located 100 miles away, who has no idea which is correct or wrong. In other words, just 4 different sources of official address verification documents can produce over 50 combinations.

This results in delayed approval - you lose job, your loan gets delayed increasing project cost, and you end up paying more or earning less.

On a national level - the impact is huge

Answering the original question - What is it that leads countries to prosperity or poverty?

For developing economies - the quickly discoverable address is very important to reduce spending and loss.

This is just not a matter of convenience - but related to improving livelihood and income of generic population.

The lack of a good addressing system costs India at least $10–14B a year, or about 0.5% of its annual GDP - Let that sink in !!!

Luise,1y,What are new ways to exploit people in low-wage countries?,"Click farms.

These are places, mostly in Asia, where workers ""work"" on hundreds of cell phones at the same time for a pittance.

Their boss is a click farmer or click farm master.

The employees run videos on the target websites, sign up for newsletters and distribute likes.

They create fake traffic on websites, so to speak.

Customers of these websites then believe that their advertising is well placed there.

You can hardly notice the fraud, because the click farm workers seem to behave like normal users.

These likes generated here are quite different from those generated by bots.

Facebook and other tech giants are now trying to filter out users who like too many websites in too short a time.

By the time this works properly, there is bound to be the next scam.

Ashok Rathor,4y,Which country has the highest potential for economic growth currently?,"The Indian economy will see robust GDP growth of 7.3% in 2018-19 and 7.5% for the next two as “factors holding back growth in India fade"", the World Bank has forecast, allowing the country to retain the tag as the world’s fastest-growing major emerging economy.

“India’s economy (today) is robust, resilient and has potential to deliver sustained growth,"" Ayhan Kose, Director of the Development Prospects Group at the World Bank, told PTI. Growth in India is projected to advance 7.3% in FY 2018-19 (1 April 2018-31 March 2019) and 7.5% in FY 2019-20, reflecting robust private consumption and strengthening investment, the bank said in its June 2018 edition of the Global Economic Prospect report.

The report, released on Wednesday, is the global lender’s flagship publication on the state of the world economy. It said that growth in South Asia is projected to strengthen to 6.9% in 2018 and to 7.1% in 2019, mainly as “factors holding back growth in India fade.""

Previously international lenders have said the demonetization and the initial hiccups in the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) had impacted India’s growth. India retains the tag of the fastest growing country among the world’s major emerging economies, Kose said.

India’s growth projections remain unchanged since its January 2018 forecast. China is expected to slow down slightly from 6.9% in 2017 to 6.5% in 2018, 6.3% in 2019 and 6.2% in 2020, it said. India’s growth potential is about 7%, and it is currently growing at a pace above its potential, he said, attributing it to the major economic reforms and fiscal measures undertaken by the government.

“India is doing well. Growth is being robust. Investment growth remains high. Consumption remains strong. All in all these numbers are encouraging,"" Kose said, referring to the World Bank report on India’s growth rate figures.

“And India is the fastest growing economy in major emerging markets,"" he said. Noting that India’s growth prospects are strong, the official said the potential growth rate of India is around seven percent. “However, you look at it, India is in a very strong position,"" he said.

“In terms of economic growth, the fact that India is able to deliver a robust consumption growth, robust investment... All these are good news. The big issue is now that India has a potential to sustain this growth and we are optimistic about India to realise that potential,"" Kose said.

Seeking an increasing female labour force participation, he said on the productivity side India has room for improvement in secondary education completion rates. Noting that there are risks that all emerging market economies are facing because of global economic developments, he said, for example the disorderly tightening of global financial conditions could have implications for emerging market economies.

“There is trade tensions out there. These tensions have been escalating in recent weeks. These have implications for growth prospects as well,"" he said. Like other oil importers, India is also facing a higher oil prices, he said.

In its latest report, the bank said in India, investment growth has firmed recently, as the effects of temporary factors wane. It said that growth in South Asia is projected to accelerate to 6.9% in 2018, mainly reflecting strengthening domestic demand in India as temporary policy-driven disruptions fade.

Elsewhere in the region, ongoing recoveries in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are expected to be accompanied by moderating activity in Afghanistan, Bhutan and Maldives, the World Bank said.

“Over the medium term, growth is expected to remain strong and reach 7.2 per cent by 2020 amid robust domestic demand. Downside risks continue to predominate. They include the possibility of fiscal slippages, delays in reforms to resolve financial vulnerabilities and improve the health of regional banking systems, and a faster-than-expected tightening in global financing conditions,"" the report said.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/x3n4cr71ulhs8bi6', 'title': 'Which country has the highest potential for economic growth currently?', 'score': {'original': 0.60355, 'ai': 0.39645}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The Indian economy will see robust GDP growth of 7.3% in 2018-19 and 7.5% for the next two as “factors holding back growth in India fade"", the World Bank has forecast, allowing the country to retain the tag as the world’s fastest-growing major emerging economy.\n\n“India’s economy (today) is robust, resilient and has potential to deliver sustained growth,"" Ayhan Kose, Director of the Development Prospects Group at the World Bank, told PTI.

Jay Bazzinotti,Updated 1y,What are some examples of fraud collapsing an economy?,"In 1807 in Boston, a man named Andrew Dexter Jr decided to build what was then a new concept: the indoor stock exchange. Up until then, merchants would gather under a big tree near what is now Quincy Market on Boston Harbor and make deals for goods such as meat and fruits and salt and firewood. It was often an inconvenience for merchants to stand under this tree and bicker in any weather. So Dexter, being civic minded, decided to create a stock market building in Boston. He wanted to pattern if after Lloyds of London, in a fashion. Lloyds was the pre-eminent maritime insurance firm, but it got its start as a coffee house on the docks where ship captains met to get a meal and make deals. Dexter wanted that on a grander scale.

So Dexter proposed to build the largest business office in the United State, the Boston Coffee and Tea Exchange, right next to the Old State House (which still exists today). Even by today’s standards, the building was to be enormous. It would be nine stories high; it would have a wide open bottom floor with a gigantic coffee and tea bar as well as a beer bar, with special tables where businessmen could put their large ledgers and also provided all the available newspapers from all over the world, brought in by ship captains, as well as the local rags (they were called “rags” because paper was made from rags in those days. The ability to make paper from wood wouldn’t be discovered for another 25 years or so).

The problem was that Dexter couldn’t raise the capital to build his building.

Not one to be discouraged, Dexter thought up an ingenious plan to get money. At the time, the US had no central banking system. Every bank printed up its own paper money, backed by the gold in its vaults. (The first paper money in America was made by Paul Revere in Boston). It was easy for people to take their paper money to a bank and redeem it for gold if they wanted to, but paper money was lighter, easier to store and less prone to robbery than gold so it was an accepted medium of exchange.

Now, in those days, people would come from other parts of the country with money from some never-heard-of bank like the Central Bank of Michigan for example. People were wary about the existence of the gold in these banks because they simply couldn’t check that the gold was there. So what they did was for every dollar of some strange bank, they only gave 80 cents purchasing power. This way, they would hedge their bets if the money was bad. The system had worked for many years and was well accepted. The people who came from out of town grumbled about the loss of purchasing power of their money, but they had little choice.

Dexter went out and started buying banks far away from Boston. In fact, one of his purchases was the Central Bank of Michigan. In 1807, Michigan was almost as far away as the moon. Just getting to NYC by land took over a month on the bad roads of the time. (We have the surviving journal of a brave woman who made the attempt with a guide and all the adventures she experienced, from Indian attacks, to religious hysteria in some towns where they wanted to hang her for being an uppity woman traveling to New York, to people who actually allowed the Black slaves to eat at the same table as them). So Dexter knew that it would be hard for people to go to Michigan to check on the gold in the bank, and he immediately started printing bank notes from the bank and using them to buy property and labor and so on to build his Coffee and Tea Exchange. However, he couldn’t raise enough money so he started buying banks in Western Massachusetts, which was still the outback (It’s STILL the outback today, very rural, it’s like going to another country out there). And then he bought almost all the banks in Rhode Island. Eventually, he raised something like 800,000 dollars. It’s hard to rectify the value of money from those times to today, but that amount of money would be worth almost 200 million dollars today.

Dexter was a fraudster but he was not a conman. He built the building he promised, a massive edifice that blocked out the sun and created canyons in the otherwise low-rise town of Boston (Boston didn’t become a city until 1822 under Josiah Quincy, the most honest political leader in history). The building was outfit with the best of everything; the offices were plush and included every amenity. The building even included its own beer brewery in the basement. It had everything it needed to be a success.

It flopped.

There were many reasons for the building to fail. The merchants simply weren’t ready to change to new ideas. Instead of gathering by the warm fires of the business lobby and making deals around a hot cup of coffee or tea, they continued to stand under the massive oak tree by the waterfront and make deals. And no one rented the plush offices in the nine story building, either. The reason was because it took nine flights of stairs to get to the top. Otis wouldn’t invent the elevator until 1857. Additionally, the rooms were cold because the patrons were required to pay for their own firewood and carrying firewood up nine stories was a grueling undertaking. There were servants paid to do this and it was a never ending task, carrying the firewood up and the ashes down. The mechanical dumbwaiter wouldn’t be invented until 1877. And finally, the “jakes” as the restroom was called, only extended to the fourth floor and dumped waste into a shaft on the outside of the building where it was mucked out at the bottom. If you were on higher floors, you had to run down five flights to relieve or yourself - or dump the commode out the window (which was actually quite common back then and the reason women carried parasols).

The building failed.

And when it failed, all the laborers and servicmen and workers wanted their money. And the rumor started that Dexter, who had been spreading massive amounts of currency from far away banks actually had no money. So a Boston newspaper, in a daring act of investigation (which was new for them in those days but then there would be no police in Boston until 1835) sent a rider to Providence to redeem his paper money for gold.

Sadly, there was no gold.

An immediate investigation was ordered. It turned out that the total amount of gold in all of Dexter’s banks amounted to about 50 dollars. He used 50 dollars to leverage 800,000 dollars. No one got paid.

Dexter was a well-meaning fraudster but he wasn’t stupid. Before it became well known what he had done, he had his wife and children and his furniture loaded onto a ship and he sailed to Nova Scotia where he was free from extradition. Meanwhile, in Boston, all hell was breaking loose because of the huge amount of worthless paper money floating around. Not only was Dexter’s money now worthless and the brickmakers and carpenters and fensters and firewood suppliers and so on all lost their savings, but as a result, no one would accept the “good” currency from any other bank. No one wanted paper money at all. The entire banking system of New England ground to a halt. Businesses collapsed; people lost their homes and businesses. Livelihoods were ruined. Commerce came to a standstill because no one knew if they could trust the currency. Suddenly, people went back to using gold and English pounds sterling. In fact, English Pounds were the currency of record until 1853 when it was finally outlawed as legal tender. The entire banking system was crushed - but it did not change.

Without a central bank, America had to continue to trust in paper money printed by banks with the hope they had the backing for it. It wasn’t until Abraham Lincoln took over the banking system that a Federal note was issued and it wasn’t until 1995 that those old bank notes were finally eliminated as legal tender.

As for Dexter? While in Nova Scotia, he discovered he had inherited a piece of worthless scrub land in Alabama. He moved his family there and founded the city of Montgomery and is considered a hero. He has statues and there are streets and schools named after him.

And as for the Coffee and Tea Exchange? After Dexter absconded, the town of Boston seized the building. It was abandoned for a time but then someone suggested it be operated at least partially to make up for the losses. The bottom floors were open for business and it became a successful bar - until a fire tender accidentally set the building on fire tending one of the dozens of fireplaces. The fire department, such as it was, was completely unable to address the magnitude of the fire of such a building. Their ladders didn’t extend beyond the first story; their hoses were like garden hoses today. They stood back and let the building burn to the ground. It burned for three days. The only fatality was a young boy looting the building who fell through the burned out floor into a vat of boiling beer that had been brewing in the basement. The burned out foundation sat for years until the Suffolk County Courthouse was built on the site, an ugly building that still sits there today.

But in its time, Dexter destroyed the entire economy of New England and sowed nationwide distrust in the banking system that lasted for nearly 50 years.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/h9aydqu2p0f4mnrt', 'title': 'What are some examples of fraud collapsing an economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.56765, 'ai': 0.43235}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In 1807 in Boston, a man named Andrew Dexter Jr decided to build what was then a new concept: the indoor stock exchange.

Kendra Morgan,10mo,How do I travel economically?,"Travelling is an art – and an affordable one, too.

To get the most out of your trip while keeping your budget intact, you should start by doing your homework.

Figure out the destinations and times of year that provide the best bang for your buck.

The more you research travel costs and compare prices, the better value you can get.

The internet will be your friend, so find websites and blogs that offer up-to-date and reliable advice; look for special deals, coupons and partnerships that can save you money.

Once you’re ready to book your flight or accommodation, be sure to plan in advance and always keep an eye out for discounts.

Travel in the off-season, when prices are usually lower.

Look out for airline and hotel loyalty programs as well – frequent flyers, for example, often receive various discounts and privileges.

You can also save money by limiting the amount of luggage you’re carrying; if possible, travel with only a carry-on or backpack.

Lastly, consider the use of public transportation, as well as arranging day trips on your own to save money.

With some preparation, planning, and perspicacity, traveling economically can be a rewarding experience!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5wzj0s6t2in31meu', 'title': 'How do I travel economically?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Travelling is an art – and an affordable one, too.\n\nTo get the most out of your trip while keeping your budget intact, you should start by doing your homework.\n\nFigure out the destinations and times of year that provide the best bang for your buck.\n\nThe more you research travel costs and compare prices, the better value you can get.\n\nThe internet will be your friend, so find websites and blogs that offer up-to-date and reliable advice; look for special deals, coupons and partnerships that can save you money.\n\nOnce you’re ready to book your flight or accommodation, be sure to plan in advance and always keep an eye out for discounts.\n\nTravel in the off-season, when prices are usually lower.\n\nLook out for airline and hotel loyalty programs as well – frequent flyers, for example, often receive various discounts and privileges.\n\nYou can also save money by limiting the amount of luggage you’re carrying; if possible, travel with only a carry-on or backpack.\n\nLastly, consider the use of public transportation, as well as arranging day trips on your own to save money.\n\nWith some preparation, planning, and perspicacity, traveling economically can be a rewarding experience!', 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1976475, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Travelling is an art – and an affordable one, too.\n\nTo get the most out of your trip while keeping your budget intact, you should start by doing your homework.\n\nFigure out the destinations and times of year that provide the best bang for your buck.\n\nThe more you research travel costs and compare prices, the better value you can get.\n\nThe internet will be your friend, so find websites and blogs that offer up-to-date and reliable advice; look for special deals, coupons and partnerships that can save you money.\n\nOnce you’re ready to book your flight or accommodation, be sure to plan in advance and always keep an eye out for discounts.\n\nTravel in the off-season, when prices are usually lower.\n\nLook out for airline and hotel loyalty programs as well – frequent flyers, for example, often receive various discounts and privileges.\n\nYou can also save money by limiting the amount of luggage you’re carrying; if possible, travel with only a carry-on or backpack.\n\nLastly, consider the use of public transportation, as well as arranging day trips on your own to save money.\n\nWith some preparation, planning, and perspicacity, traveling economically can be a rewarding experience!', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Misha Firer,1y,What are some ways Russia has hurt its economy?,"Tank Armor Factory in Chita has increased repairs many times. It will be the flaghsip of manufacturing in Zabaykal Krai, a region in Siberia just north of Mongolia and China.

State Duma deputy Andrei Gurulev conducted “inspection landing.” Name related to army no coincidence. Andrei Gurulev is a retarded, sorry, retired general.

When was colonel, he court-martialled for making army conscripts build and fit out his country house. One handsome teenage soldier overstayed his army service at Gurulev’s dacha and was released two and a half years after kidnap. Charges drop. Connections!

Factory workers have new heads for hammers after increase in military budget to 100 billion dollars. Workers work in three shifts pay good if not like can be volunteer to fight in the tank he repaired. All for the front all for the victory!

Icons fitted to protect tank from Javelin missiles and armed drones while swastikas use to cosplay Nazis for more additional luck.

Vitaly Antsitov, chief engineer tank armour repair factory, flagship of manufacturing in Zabaikal Krai stands proudly next to T-62.

Andrei Gurulev was pleased with inspection landing but expressed concern there’re no young men in the factory.

Vijay Kumar,7y,Why did the Indian Prime Minister Modi sanction a one billion dollar loan to Nepal during his recent visit? Shouldn't the money be spent on India first? How does this benefit India?,"Let me explain you this logic with this simple story.

You have paan shop where paan is sold for 10 rupees. However it is run by a friend of yours who is a paanwala who has rented the paan shop from you. The way it works is that he sits in the shop the whole day, makes and sells paans and he gives you 30% of the profit (as rent).

One day, you see a daily wage laborer who is returning home from a hard day’s work at the mill. He wish to have a paan, but however, he does not have 10 rupees. His mouths waters as he walks past the paan shop in utter disappointment. You know that he can pay 10 rupees in installments of 1 rupee per day for 10 days, but he can not afford 10 rupees today. You explain your friend (paan-wala) about letting them have paan today and taking 1 rupee from them everyday for the next 10 days. Your friend says that he is not used to lending money, that its is not safe lending money to people from whom he can not extract back easily. Moreover, he does not want to take the head ache of asking for money back from random people.

So notice here, that both parties are at loss. The laborer really wish to eat paan but is unable to afford 10 rupees at any given time. Your friend is also losing out on business that he would have got if the laborer bought that paan.

So you intervene. You have 10 rupees extra with you which you lend to the laborer. You tell him that he can return it in installments of 1 rupee each day on condition that he will use it only for buying something from your friend’s shop and can not spend it elsewhere. Overjoyed, the laborer uses that 10 rupees to buy a paan. The laborer is happy to eat paan, your best paan-wala friend is happy because he has one more sale. You are happy because from the profit of selling that one paan, you will be getting 30% of profit. win-win-win situation for everybody.

This is exactly what goes on when one country lends money to another.

Mats Andersson,1y,"Will Russia default on its foreign debts, and what will be the consequences of that default?","The major credit rating institutes have downgraded Russia to “C” and warned that a default is imminent.

They know lots of stuff that we don’t.

They might be wrong.

A sovereign default is a messy affair at the best of times. This isn’t the best of times. It is not likely to be a structured default, like most sovereign defaults since WWII—it might be hard for them to persuade IMF to grant a loan, and even if they did, IMF loans usually come with strict demands, like “end corruption”.

We’re probably talking about a return to 1991, with private enterprise collapsing and the state jobs being unable to pay salaries, rampant inflation (which actually helps with the debt somewhat, so the government might not want to act), possibly bank runs with banks collapsing; looking at what happened in Greece, with EU bailouts, we might talk about unemployment reaching 30–35%, inflation just under the level of hyperinflation—say 25% per month—and no chance of the usual lifeline, increased tourism. Longer term, who will ever lend Russia money again, at any interest rate?

In the end, I expect that Russia will have to go to the Lender of Last Resort: there’s only one economy which has the power and (possibly) will to bail them out. Their help is likely to come at a hefty price.

Alex Mann,2y,What are some examples of fraud collapsing an economy?,"Well, there are lots of examples but my favorite isn’t from the US or even this century. It’s the South Sea Bubble.

So the exchequer of England, Robert Harley, needs to raise some capital and quick. As head of the treasury (basically) he needs to do a bang-up job for both his political career and his political partners. Problem is, England is broke.

How broke? About 9–10 million pounds in debt. That may not seem like a ton but this the early 1700s.

So Harley turns to a man named John Blunt- a “creative” economic mind who has some ideas. Prior to this Blunt had cooked up a scheme involving Irish land sales, stock in his sword-making company, and IOUs paid to the army. Blunt gave the government a nice loan out of his profits which made him friends and thus brought him to the attention of Harley.

Harley and Blunt decide to create a company- a new shining company for everyone to invest in. The biggest company in town at the time was the “Honorable East India Trade Company” so Blunt and Harley created the “South Sea Company”.

They promised the company would be like the East India Company, just in the South Sea.

The key here is this- they offered shares of the company in exchange for government debt. So that 9 million pounds the British Government owed could be swapped for shares in this new company.

Soon all the debt was in the hands of The South Sea Company. That means interest payments on the debt were paid to The South Sea Company. Make sense?

So the South Sea Company is now getting steady income without doing anything actually real. Soon the South Sea Company starts selling shares to citizens who are enraptured with this new company.

Here is the problem- there was no profit coming from the South Sea. In fact, the South Seas were almost entirely Spanish and the British were at war with Spain. So while Blunt and Harley advertised the South Sea Company like a new East India Company- it was mostly a bank.

Before long the entire nation had invested in South Seas. The demand for stock meant the price soared and Blunt would offer incredible terms on anyone looking to buy stock. He would even loan people money to buy stock.

The Company was eventually valued at 300 million pounds- which was a sizeable chunk of the British Economy. It would be like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Walmart rolled into one time 10 if it existed today.

Again the problem here is that the South Sea Company wasn’t making a profit- there was no “company” to speak of. The

Eventually, the bottom fell out. The price got so high, it freaked everyone out. Many people started selling and that was that. There was no money to pay them of course which caused a panic. This caused to stock price to plummet to worthless.

In 1 week the stock went from 1000 pounds a share to 150 pounds a share. Then in another week, the stock was worth nothing.

The entire nation of England- from the King to the peasants- had invested HEAVILY in South Sea and they were all ruined. It was an economic collapse on a scale the Great Depression but perhaps even worse.

The good news is that we all learned a lesson about fraud in investing and how rampant market speculation can cause economic disasters.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3tylr2xwebuc5z9n', 'title': 'What are some examples of fraud collapsing an economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.46865, 'ai': 0.53135}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Well, there are lots of examples but my favorite isn’t from the US or even this century.

Siva Kumar Bachoti,Updated 1y,"At a time when Sri Lanka is in the midst of an economic crisis, Did India buy cheap fuel from Russia and give it to Sri Lanka at a higher price through the IOC?","How do you know India is selling oil to Sri Lanka at a higher price? Sri Lanka can as well buy it straight from Russia. Why they can’t? Remember: no country is lifting its little finger to help SL, not even China. India does and yet Sri Lankans badmouth India?

India is not obliged to help out all countries in distress. That, Sri Lankans should bear in mind. If their country is in bad shape, India is not responsible for that. Sri Lankans should hold their rulers by collar, but not badmouth India for the sin of helping them out.

Oil doesn’t fly out of air. India has to pay for transport and also insurance. Very few shipping companies are ready to move cargo out of Russia for the fear of USA sanctions. Whoever is willing, is asking much more than usual. Insurers are demanding very high premium.

Finally, India is buying just a pittance, 2 million barrels. We can use it ourselves. I see no reason why India should give it to Sri Lanka even at cost price. India buys, faces USA’s anger and then gives it Sri Lanka? Why we should?

There is a word in English, called gratitude.

Just FYI, India has already given 1.5b USD, will give some more in kind (but not certainly in cash).

How Sri Lanka economy got destroyed and who is responsible for that?

A nice pair of brothers if there is one!

The price you pay for living beyond your means

Per latest reports, Sri Lanka has just under $2 billion is cash (enough to buy essentials just for a few weeks) but it must service external debt to the tune of $7 billion (just interest). The total debt is $51 billion. How it can pay that immediately due interest tranche? It can not!

Just think: if annual interest on $51b comes to $7b, what is the interest rate? Should a government borrow so recklessly? Should a country that depends largely on tourism for foreign exchange and must import most essential goods, borrow so much?

So they took the obvious route - declared insolvent. They clearly told, “We are defaulting on the outstanding loans”. Note, they want to put “IP” for the entire $51 b. Who is losing? About $5b to China, Japan and India in that order. A good part of cash loan came from Japan, India mostly gives in goods & services. The private borrowing is in the form of international sovereign bonds and similar instruments.

Sri Lanka had been borrowing heavily from institutional lenders. What the government did with the dough? The Brothers used that money to meet their poll promises. They liberally cut taxes, abolished GST on many goods, gave tax holiday to IT and other industries. To top it all, they used the money not on capital expenditure that should generate regular income, they just spent it.

They had the choice to go to the IMF on more than one occasion but did not. Their reluctance was, IMF would lay very strict conditions like raising taxes, cutting subsidies, cutting down spending on freebies & doles, lowering income tax slabs and the like. These measures would defeat the Brothers’ populist policies (designed to bring them back to power once again in 2025). So they repeatedly went to private institutions instead, raising the servicing burden. Now they will go to IMF but IMF’s conditions would be extremely difficult to implement, what with the horrible situation they have on their hands!

This recklessness would have been under wraps for some more years but for the 3 events as I explained below: terrorist attacks that put off tourists & their dollars, COVID and senseless SUDDEN shift to non-synthetic i.e. organic fertilizers.

Siva Kumar Bachoti's answer to How did Sri Lanka become bankrupt?

Now they want to pay in Sri Lanka rupees “if the lenders like it”. Who wants worthless paper? This being the case, even India should think twice about continue to supply essential commodities like oil, rice, pulses, milk powder, paper, cooking oil and medicines. OR India should be mentally prepared to forget it.

Their government begs help. Say, a foolish bunch of politicians make a mess of their country and the world is obliged to bail them out only to repeat the exercise again & again in future?

Say India bails them out. So? They will go back to sleep in China bed.

The ways of the Rajapaksha Family

Sri Lanka national carrier was set up in collaboration with the Emirates. It had been running nicely, always in profits, till sometime in 2008.

One fateful day, Mahinda Rajapakhsa family, who had been holidaying in London, wanted to return home by a certain SL Airlines flight. They were told, the flight was full, in fact overbooked. The Family insisted, they demanded some confirmed passengers be “bumped up” to make place for the Family. The Airlines refused. How they managed to reach Colombo is besides the point.

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakhsa was livid with anger. He cancelled the Emirates partnership at a stroke and made his brother-in-law Nishantha Wickramasinghe, the chairman of SL Airlines.

Under his beautiful leadership the Airlines managed to make an accumulated loss of $1.7 billion till date. Add to that an outstanding $1.4 billion owed to Emirates. This one incident shows, the Family treated the country as their personal property. They did not behave as its custodians.

When The Family bedded with the Chinese, Sri Lankans did not mind. When The Family finally had to give away Hambantota to the Chinese, Sri Lankans did not mind. When The Family were systematically destroyed economy, Sri Lankans did not mind.

Now it is India’s fault! Great job, my Sri Lankan brothers & sisters! Thanks a ton for blaming us for whatever help we are doing!

UPDATE 19/5/22

There is a ship carrying petrol waiting at port, waiting since Mar/28. The shipping company refuses to release the stuff unless Sri Lanka govt pay up $53 million for this shipment plus $53 million for a previous shipment given on credit.

Now: imagine if India had said that, how much of venom SL would have spat on India.

Frank Gardner,4y,Is it a good idea to cause deflation in currency?,"It has often been a paradox that the worse an economy turns down, the higher the currency rises. Cheer up – it is a bell curve. If the currency goes TOO FAR and the economy has no hope of survival, then it reverses and collapses into dust through the process of a Phase Transition. This is the Paradox of Fundamental Analysis where people try to craft these single one dimensional explanations of the world. It does not matter what we are talking about interest rates, currency values, inflation, or deflation – it is all the same type of movement.

Before i continue, let me introduce you to a platform i discovered where you can sell your Bitcoin and other top Cryptocurrencies at the exact rate in dollars any where in the world. The website is IBUYCRYPTO (www.ibuycrypto.store). It is safe and secure. The interesting part of it is that, you don’t have to drop your vital informations before you sell to them. You sell and get your money directly sent to your bank account immediately your deposit is confirmed. You can also sell and request the money is sent to someone else. Thank me later after using this platform.

Part of the RISE IN A CURRENCY during a decline is the rise in the currency value is the shift from PRIVATE to PUBLIC confidence during a decline in the ECM even on the short 8.6 year business cycle waves. This is called often the FLIGHT TO QUALITY where people want cash and dump assets. This is why the stock market crashes or whatever the sector is that absorbed the cash.

No matter what economy we look at, the currency will RISE during the economic decline driven domestically by this flight to quality. The US dollar rose to record highs during the Great Depression. This helps to turn the economy down as exports collapse as well. During the 1930s, this sparked the Age of Protectionism.

The dollar rose sharply into 1985 from its low going into 1980. The steep deflationary recession drove the dollar to its highest point and as you can see our index demonstrates that the trend is not complete. Keep in mind that the coming dollar rally will unfold mostly after 2015.75 and the US economy turns down.

The collapse in the dollar against the Japanese yen came as part of the burst in the Japanese bubble that began from the December 1989 high. The rise in the yen was consistent with what I am describing, albeit people find this a paradox and expect the currency to decline with the economy.

That portion of the trend unfolds when you cross the bell curve and head down. The British pound was the reserve currency of the world up until 1914. Thereafter, Britain entered the downside of the Bell Curve and this was driven by debt expansion.

When Britain entered World War I, its debt ration exploded and Britain began the collapse of its currency at that point on a sustained basis.

We can see the decline in interest rates into the 1900 period. Thereafter, we see a trend with rising rates.

This is what we will see with the Euro as it completes its deflationary rally that will push Europe over the edge. Their exports will drop and tax rates will rise further.

The early stages of the deflation are marked by the flight to quality and this will give way when the economy becomes unsustainable due to the high value of the currency.

M Jawahar Reddy,3y,What exactly happened to the Indian economy in 1991 in layman's terms? What is liberalization? How did it affect the Indian Economy? What is the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the world economy?,"1991 was a landmark year for India, with economic reforms.

MARCH 1991:

Growing fiscal imbalances over the 1980s, Licence-Permit Raj, spiraling oil prices due to Gulf War - India is facing its worst economic crisis since Independence.

Foreign Exchange reserves were at 2,500 crores only, for just three weeks of imports (to compare in 2020, India’s Forex reserves are over 40 lakh crores). Sovereign credit rating was downgraded. Debt was unbelievably high with external debt of 23% and internal public debt of 55% of the GDP.

To tackle the crisis, finance ministry and RBI officials reached the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC, asking for a loan. While they are negotiating, news from India arrives - Rajiv Gandhi had withdrawn support to the Chandra Sekhar’s government. On hearing the news, the IMF officials asked - “Sir, whose government are you representing?”

With no reforms or budget or even a stable government insight, the 1991 Lok Sabha elections were called.

21st May 1991, Sriperumbudur:

Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is campaigning for the general elections. Suddenly, an explosion fills the air. Rajiv Gandhi, a front-runner for the upcoming elections is assassinated by a suicide bomber affiliated to LTTE.

Now, along with the economic crisis, India faces a political one too.

20th June 1991:

India has a new Prime Minister, PV Narasimha Rao, but there's no time for celebration. India’s economy is on a ventilator. Narasimha Rao meets Cabinet Secretary, Naresh Chandra. The new Prime Minister asks, “Is the economic situation that bad?”. “No sir. It's much worse” is Naresh Chandra’s reply.

The next day, Former RBI Governor and Finance Secretary Manmohan Singh is expecting friends over for lunch. At the last minute, his friends receive a phone call, “Something has come up.” they're told and the lunch is postponed. Later in the day, Singh’s friends receive a surprise. Their friend, a mild-mannered economist, is now India’s Finance Minister.

25th June 1991:

Manmohan Singh holds his first press conference as the new Finance Minister and talks about the government’s next steps on economic policy. The battle to save India’s economy is on.

In the month and the following, the government goes in fire-fighting mode taking a bunch of steps to strengthen India’s economy.

Devaluing the Indian Rupee. But the crisis is so severe, it's done in two rounds, first by 9% and then by 11%.
Then, the Minister of State for Commerce, P Chidambaram, announces the new trade policy. Under this policy, quotas are removed and exports are made easier.
47 tonnes of gold is transported to Bank of England enabling India to borrow about 400 Million Dollars.
PJ Kurien, the Minister of State for Industry, announces the new Industrial policy. Under the policy, the industries reserved for public sector are reduced from 17 to only eight.

India’s License Raj Era is officially over.

24th July 1991:

Manmohan Singh presents the Union Budget. During his speech, India changes. Fiscal deficit is curbed. FDI is welcomed. Domestic market is free. Manmohan Singh ends his speech by saying ‘”… Victor Hugo once said: No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come. I suggest to this August House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea.

Ian Tan,Updated 3y,What would happen to the US and world economy if the Fed printed $330 billion dollars and gave $1 billion to every American citizen?,"Have you ever played Monopoly with a cheater?

Suppose you’re playing Monopoly with, say, five other guys.

Joe, Moe, Bob, Jack, Jill, and you are sitting on a round table, playing Monopoly.

Moe offers to be the banker, and sits right next to the cash register. Unbeknownst to any of you, however, he has been skimming from the cash register! And in a few short rounds, he managed to amass himself a fortune of over $12,000, whereas everyone else has around $2000 in cash and property.

At first, nothing really happens. People buy the properties they land on, and the game goes like any other game.

But then Moe, the cheater, and being the smart businessman he is, makes a deal with Bob. He offers to buy out two of his properties for $2000. Bob, of course, takes the deal as $2000 is around 4x what he paid for the properties.

Moe proceeds to make the same deal with Joe. Joe takes a little bit more convincing, and they finally settle for $3000.

Bob and Joe now have no properties and lots of cash. Bob and Joe’s wealth is primarily tied up in cash.

Jill, on the other hand, decides to keep her properties. She has very little in cash and barely survives the rounds. She does, however, own all the orange and pink properties, and her portfolio expands constantly. Jill’s wealth is tied up in property.

You and Jack, however, have played Monopoly before and know not to take a deal too early in the game. You two hold out and your wealth remains the same. You and Jack have 50% of wealth in property and 50% in cash.

Of course, Moe is absolutely determined to win! And with around $7000 in cash alone, he has no problem buying his way to victory.

Suddenly, Jack goes bankrupt. His money goes back to the bank, but his properties are up for auction.

Unsurprisingly, Moe completely outbids you, Jill, Bob, and Joe! He paid $1000 for two light blue properties, which were originally only worth $250!

Bob, who holds $2000 in wealth, now has the equivalent buying power of $500 before Moe skimmed the cash register.

Jill, whose wealth is tied up in property, now sees her monetary wealth increase by 4x (the inverse of a 75% reduction) should she choose to sell her properties.

For you, your properties are worth 4x more money while your money sees 75% less buying power.

So, what does this mean?

Any increase in the monetary supply is considered taxation on existing holders of cash
Pumping money into the monetary supply increases the monetary wealth of those holding non-cash instruments such as stocks, gold, real estate, cryptocurrency, etc
The $1b per person would not have any meaningful change for those whose wealth is tied up in cash (usually working or lower middle class)
The increased supply of the United States dollar would result in its depreciation against other currencies, the effect of which is a story for another time

I will ignore the fact that $330 billion dollars is only enough to give $1 billion dollars to 330 Americans. I am aware of the math error in the question and I am answering based on the assumption the asker meant an increase in USD supply of 330 quadrillion dollars.

Due to complaints, I will expand on what happens if the USD depreciates by a lot:

Other countries with significant reserve holdings in US dollars will see their holdings wiped in buying power
People who invested in plain USD will see their savings reduced in value
The cash value of the stock market will go up, but the actual value will remain the same, if not lower
Countries that export to the United States will be less competitive than domestic manufacturers in the short run
Firms in the United States that export will have an advantage in the short run
The fact that 90% of international transactions are conducted in USD will change — as a result,
United States’ financial soft power will be reduced in the long run
US tariffs and sanctions will be less effective
Foreign banks will give less of a shit about what Uncle Sam has to say
Say goodbye to America’s exorbitant privilege

Manisha,2y,What should be paid attention to for the development of the Indian economy?,"6 things :-

Prioritise manufacturing

It's been too long now and we've avoided talking about this. The problem is government yes, but even bigger problem is the people. We don't support anyone who wanted to start a business. Parents want their daughters to marry either a govt employee or a white/gold collar employee. Nobody cares about the blue collar sector and we can't produce one damn thing without them. Physical manufacturing is very important. It's what made China, China! That's where we have failed, spectacularly.

Relaunch Indian tourism

Forts, palaces, museums, beaches, corals, adventure sports, mountains, rivers, zoos, temples, statues, deserts, snow, trekking, forests, animals, shopping, spiritual tour, honeymoon, post retirement, children's holidays…

India has EVERYTHING (may be except Aurora but you know what I mean).

Is India tapping this huge market potential? What's the condition of Amer fort? Do you know the travel situation of Andaman islands!?

People come here, “make do” with what's available and leave.

I realised this problem when I visited Europe! They've even turned their tragedies into tourist hotspots and we don't have a single weekend show in Bundi Fort.

India needs responsible tourism and she needs it now.

I'm really furious over this one. I mean there are Spanish Steps in Italy. What are they? Steps!! Yes Trevi Fountain is good but Steps!?

For the love of all that is beautiful in this country, please Government look at this sector!!

Provide last mile connectivity

I see the work is in progress but oh dear the buses & trains and in general any kind of transport in rural India are in a sorry state of existence. This also leads to costly logistics and disconnect of rural & urban centres! Roads, railway lines and air routes are not the only things that connect the country. We need water, hospitality, medical facilities, markets, police stations, etc in remote areas too. Do we have that? At least till 5 years ago, I can name places where even a tea stall was a rarity. I just needed to drink some water. Had to wait hours before I could have a sip of clean drinking water. These issues are a blot on India's physical structure. This is a part of development that this country needs, badly…

Encourage privatisation

I'm about to use a bad word, sorry 🤫 PROFIT.

The way this one word is made the devil is beyond any sane human being's understanding. You don't earn? You don't eat. As simple as that. Profit is a step ahead, as you know.

Privatise certain sections of businesses that govt is holding in its tight grip! Are you telling me cleaning department of railway stations is a core sector job that govt should handle? When was the last time you visited a Nagar Nigam office?. The dilapidated condition of govt offices, businesses etc is worrying.

Physical appeal of a workplace is very much important to keep the enthusiasm of employees on top. One of the tricks of positive motivation? May be. They gave maintenance of Red Fort to Dalmia, right? ASI isn't doing anything to conserve the place. Dalmia should even restore the place & earn with it! Jaipur Airport maintenance has gone to Adani? What's the problem with this? Only core sector should be with govt, everything else should be open for competition. Allow me to charge for maintaining Mandava Fort and you'll see it in Padharo Mhare Des ads next year! Yeah, I can do wonders with it. But nah…

Reform Farm Sector

Well the govt tried but we love to be pauper, we love the suffering and we love the suicides that come with it. No govt for the next few decades will touch this topic with a ten foot pole. Thank your stars there wasn't any social media during 1991 NEP, else we'd see a couple riots against LPG Reforms also…

Rather than negotiating the problem areas, what we saw was blackmail & arm twisting. But that's okay. End customer was not directly suffering. Farmers were.

You know what politics is like? When in 1970s Late Mrs Indira Gandhi requested wheat from US, she was protested against here. Our politicians were ready to let our people die of hunger than swollow humiliation & feed us. She did. She fed us. She bent the knee and her people lived.

The same thing happened this time, only violently.

I'd say it again. Primary Sector of Indian economy needs urgent reforms & it needs to be done now. We're already three decades late…

We have romanticised poverty and hate the rich. I don't know who's at fault but throw this thought away NOW.

Invest in Human Resources

We all complain about brain drain. Ever thought why it happens? No don't bring in reservation here. Every welfare state of the world does it in some form or the other.

The problem is we don't give paid opportunities to our brains. We are improving business friendliness (still a lot to be done but I'm appreciating whatever has been done till now) yes but we need to provide money for those who can do wonders but are not business minded. Still confused?

Let's take an example:

Imagine Mr A gets admission in Harvard B School or London School of Economics or Cambridge Law. He'll need millions to get that course done.Every year thousands get the chance to study in top education hubs of the world. What does India do with it? Nothing. They go there, study there and get a job there. And we complain of brain drain. Now I think GoI should invest in these people and provide them money, not only to study there but also give them incentive that whatever first placement or job offer you get, you do that in India and the tax payer will fund you. NASA? Why don't you try ISRO and we'll pay what NASA offered to pay you. I understand this may not cover all sectors but in few, where we really need sharp brains, this can work. Innovation, science & tech, agriculture, software industry etc can make use of this. I don't see any other reason for them to stay back. My brother didn't come back for over a decade, and he went to Stockholm School of Economics. Why? He got the perfect job, perfect pay, perfect place to live! Why would he come back? At least I got to visit Zurich & Prague when he was there. If he had had an offer from Govt of India to work with SBI or RBI with a pay at par with what he was offered right after college he'd be here. It's not my words, it's his…

Alps,Updated 7y,How would you explain the 2008 financial crisis to a teenager?,"Remember the childhood game of Pass The Parcel (or Pass The Pillow)?

(Image source: wikihow)

The 2008 financial crisis was just a pass the parcel game, the only difference being that the parcel was a financial time bomb that would take everyone down once it exploded. And that is exactly what happened.

So, who were the participants in this game?

The general public (the innocent entity in the game, oblivious to the perils involved)
The banks (your local, boring commercial banks)
The investment banks - Merrill Lynch
, Lehman Brothers
 and others
The investment companies (another largely innocent entity in the game)
The insurance companies - American International Group 
(AIG) and others

What role does each of this entity normally play in an economy?

The general public deposit their savings in the banks and borrow from the banks. They also invest money in the products sold by the investment companies (Mutual Funds, Hedge Funds, Pension Plans, etc) and buy insurance from insurance companies.
The banks accept deposits and give away loans (home loans, car loans, personal loans, corporate loans, etc).
The investment companies pool money from investors (the public and the corporate houses) through their products (Mutual Funds, Hedge Funds, Pension Plans, etc), invest that money in the financial market (shares, bonds, etc) and share the yield with their investors.
The investment bankers link the investment companies to the banks and other corporate houses.
Insurance companies insures anyone who wants to insure something, in return for a premium.

When acting individually and under strict regulations, these entities are pretty harmless, or in fact, quite useful for the growth of the economy. But in the early 2000s they began this dirty game of theirs that ultimately threw the entire global economy into disarray.

What was the “game”? How did it all begin?

House Loans.

The game was all about housing loans. Under normal circumstances, a family that desires to buy a new house approaches a commercial bank for a loan. The bank verifies the application, sees if the family has the capacity to repay and a clear past record, and sanctions the loan (a.k.a mortgage) The family repays the loan over a period of time and if it fails to repay, the bank acquires the mortgaged house and the family is kicked out. The bank sells/auctions the house and recovers its dues.

So far so good.

But in the early 2000s, the investment banks and the investment companies were sitting on a huge pile of idle cash. The economy was dull and they had few opportunities to make big money. But the mainstream commercial banks were doing pretty fine, ‘coz the housing market is never really down (houses are always needed man!). The investment bankers thought why not join the banks in the real estate world and make use of their idle money to make…errr...more money!

The investment banks asked the commercial banks to sell them their mortgage loans.

Now why would banks “sell their loans” to someone?

Suppose, a mortgage loan is worth $500,000 with 10% simple interest to be paid over 10 years. Thus, at the end of 10 years, the bank gets $550,00 from the borrower. The investment banker instead offers that the bank transfer (or “sell”) this mortgage loan to the investment bank for, say, $530,000.

Why would the bank sell the mortgage at $530,000 to the investment bank when it is supposed to get $550,000 from the borrower himself?

There is something called the time value of money. ‘$530,000 right now’ is a lot better than ‘$550,000 after 10 years’. It is, therefore, in the interest of the bank to accept the investment banker’s offer, which it eventually does.

So the mortgage gets transferred to the investment bank. It's now the investment bank that recieves regular payments (loan repayment) from the home owners (i.e borrowers), or acquires the house in case of a default.

Now we come to the next player - the investment companies, that were sitting on a pile of idle cash too and were looking for investment avenues as well. As mentioned earlier, the job of the investment bankers is to link the investment companies to investment opportunities. The investment bankers called up the investment companies -

Invsmt Banker: “Hey bro, we have some new investment opportunities, wanna try them?”

Invsmt Co.: “Sure, why not? What are they?”

Invsmt Banker: “They are called…ummmmm… Collateralized Debt Obligations”

Invsmt Co.: “Colled…..what? Never heard of them”

Invsmt Banker: “Collateralized Debt Obligation.. They are cool man, just try them”

Invsmt Co.: “Are the returns good enough and the investment safe?”

Invsmt Banker: “Of course bro, they have got AAA ratings”

Investment Co.: “Great! Send them over then”

*end of conversation*

And with this, the investment bankers passed on their mortgage loans to the investment companies in the guise of the fancy sounding thing called Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDOs).

The dirty game begins here.

To keep making more and more money, the investment banks need more and more mortgage loans and for that, the commercial banks need to give away more and more home loans. But there is an obvious limit to the number of well-to-do citizens in an economy who can be extended a loan. You cannot lend to anyone and everyone, lest they default. But the commercial banks thought, “Hey, why do we care? Once we sanction a loan we pass it on to the investment banks. It becomes their headache thereafter”. Even the investment banks would think on similar lines (“We anyway gonna pass the mortgage to the investment companies as CDOs, so why bother?”).

With this, started the phenomenon of SUB-PRIME LENDING i.e giving away loans to “sub prime” customers (customers who didn't really have the ability and/or the will to repay the loan).

And if that was not enough, even the insurance companies (our 5th player) jumped into the muck.

They introduced a new insurance product with, again, a fancy name - Credit Default Swap (CDS). But these were less of an insurance product and more of a betting instrument. Just like you put a bet on a horse in a derby race or on a team in a football match, CDS were tools to allow you to bet on home owners (borrowers). You think Mr. Donald has no capacity to repay the loan upon which he bought that new house recently? You just bet on this via CDS. If Mr. Donald ultimately fails to repay his loan, you win the bet?

Appalling, isn't it? But there's more to come….

Soon, the investment bankers themselves became the biggest betters! They started betting against home owners; those home owners whose mortgage they were themselves holding!! Which means, they knew that the mortgages that they are holding are risky and low-worth. But why would they care? They were ultimately passing those mortgages on to the investment companies as Collateralized Debt Obligations!

The bomb was up and ticking.

(Pardon the crude look of the doodle. I did not have access to fancier tools)

By 2008, home owners started defaulting enmasse. The betters were winning and the betting company (actually the insurance company) losing. The American International Group (AIG), the biggest insurance company involved in this, was on the verge of collapse in August 2008. It had to be rescued by the US government. [U.S. to Take Over AIG in $85 Billion Bailout
]. The general public that had bought other insurance products from AIG suffered too.

With home owners defaulting in bulk, the mortgages held by investment banks and CDOs held by investment companies became worthless. On September 15, 2008, investment bank Lehman Brothers crashes and so does the stock market [Crash! Shares tumble as Lehman Brothers collapses and fears grow]
. And the Domino effect
 took down with it the entire global economy.........

How did it all begin?\n\nHouse Loans.\n\nThe game was all about housing loans. Under normal circumstances, a family that desires to buy a new house approaches a commercial bank for a loan. The bank verifies the application, sees if the family has the capacity to repay and a clear past record, and sanctions the loan (a.k.a mortgage) The family repays the loan over a period of time and if it fails to repay, the bank acquires the mortgaged house and the family is kicked out. The bank sells/auctions the house and recovers its dues.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nBut in the early 2000s, the investment banks and the investment companies were sitting on a huge pile of idle cash. The economy was dull and they had few opportunities to make big money. But the mainstream commercial banks were doing pretty fine, ‘coz the housing market is never really down (houses are always needed man!). The investment bankers thought why not join the banks in the real estate world and make use of their idle money to make…errr...more money!\n\nThe investment banks asked the commercial banks to sell them their mortgage loans.\n\nNow why would banks “sell their loans” to someone?\n\nSuppose, a mortgage loan is worth $500,000 with 10% simple interest to be paid over 10 years. Thus, at the end of 10 years, the bank gets $550,00 from the borrower. The investment banker instead offers that the bank transfer (or “sell”) this mortgage loan to the investment bank for, say, $530,000.\n\nWhy would the bank sell the mortgage at $530,000 to the investment bank when it is supposed to get $550,000 from the borrower himself?\n\nThere is something called the time value of money. ‘$530,000 right now’ is a lot better than ‘$550,000 after 10 years’. It is, therefore, in the interest of the bank to accept the investment banker’s offer, which it eventually does.\n\nSo the mortgage gets transferred to the investment bank. It's now the investment bank that recieves regular payments (loan repayment) from the home owners (i.e borrowers), or acquires the house in case of a default.\n\nNow we come to the next player - the investment companies, that were sitting on a pile of idle cash too and were looking for investment avenues as well. As mentioned earlier, the job of the investment bankers is to link the investment companies to investment opportunities. The investment bankers called up the investment companies -\n\nInvsmt Banker: “Hey bro, we have some new investment opportunities, wanna try them?”\n\nInvsmt Co.: “Sure, why not? What are they?”\n\nInvsmt Banker: “They are called…ummmmm… Collateralized Debt Obligations”\n\nInvsmt Co.: “Colled…..what? Never heard of them”\n\nInvsmt Banker: “Collateralized Debt Obligation.. They are cool man, just try them”\n\nInvsmt Co.: “Are the returns good enough and the investment safe?”\n\nInvsmt Banker: “Of course bro, they have got AAA ratings”\n\nInvestment Co.: “Great! Send them over then”\n\n*end of conversation*\n\nAnd with this, the investment bankers passed on their mortgage loans to the investment companies in the guise of the fancy sounding thing called Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDOs).\n\nThe dirty game begins here.\n\nTo keep making more and more money, the investment banks need more and more mortgage loans and for that, the commercial banks need to give away more and more home loans. But there is an obvious limit to the number of well-to-do citizens in an economy who can be extended a loan. You cannot lend to anyone and everyone, lest they default. But the commercial banks thought, “Hey, why do we care? Once we sanction a loan we pass it on to the investment banks. It becomes their headache thereafter”. Even the investment banks would think on similar lines (“We anyway gonna pass the mortgage to the investment companies as CDOs, so why bother?”).\n\nWith this, started the phenomenon of SUB-PRIME LENDING i.e giving away loans to “sub prime” customers (customers who didn't really have the ability and/or the will to repay the loan).\n\nAnd if that was not enough, even the insurance companies (our 5th player) jumped into the muck.\n\nThey introduced a new insurance product with, again, a fancy name - Credit Default Swap (CDS). But these were less of an insurance product and more of a betting instrument. Just like you put a bet on a horse in a derby race or on a team in a football match, CDS were tools to allow you to bet on home owners (borrowers). You think Mr. Donald has no capacity to repay the loan upon which he bought that new house recently? You just bet on this via CDS. If Mr. Donald ultimately fails to repay his loan, you win the bet?\n\nAppalling, isn't it? But there's more to come….\n\nSoon, the investment bankers themselves became the biggest betters! They started betting against home owners; those home owners whose mortgage they were themselves holding!! Which means, they knew that the mortgages that they are holding are risky and low-worth. But why would they care? They were ultimately passing those mortgages on to the investment companies as Collateralized Debt Obligations!\n\nThe bomb was up and ticking.\n\n(Pardon the crude look of the doodle. I did not have access to fancier tools)\n\nBy 2008, home owners started defaulting enmasse. The betters were winning and the betting company (actually the insurance company) losing. The American International Group (AIG), the biggest insurance company involved in this, was on the verge of collapse in August 2008. It had to be rescued by the US government. [U.S. to Take Over AIG in $85 Billion Bailout\n]. The general public that had bought other insurance products from AIG suffered too.\n\nWith home owners defaulting in bulk, the mortgages held by investment banks and CDOs held by investment companies became worthless. On September 15, 2008, investment bank Lehman Brothers crashes and so does the stock market [Crash! Shares tumble as Lehman Brothers collapses and fears grow]\n. And the Domino effect\n took down with it the entire global economy.........\n\n(Image source: wikispace)"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.71883333333333
Tomaž Vargazon,Jan 15,How is the Russian economy doing so well despite everything?,"So well, huh?

Omsk, Russia

Omsk is an important city in Siberia, with over a million people it’s a major regional center and would be an important city pretty much anywhere on Earth. Just last week it suffered a major power outage, alongside several other cities - Yekatrinburg (third largest city in Russia) and St.Petersburg were the most notable. It’s not just power either, heating too went out for several hours over large parts of the country.

If Russia is facing power cuts in major cities I dread to think what the economically depressed areas look like. Omsk is relatively prosperous by Russian standards, although you probably could be fooled by the image above. Both are true by the way, it’s just that Russian standards are a bit more modest than what you’re used to.

For years, decades even, Russia cut down on infrastructure spending and maintenence, focusing only on corrective work where and when it was needed. This kind of works for a while if no stress is added to the system. In the long run it’s actually more expensive than preventative maintenence, but you can run an infrastructure that way for quite a while, especially if there are no sudden shocks to the system.

This winter Russia faced two shocks. One is the war, which soaked up funds for basically everything, plus a normal Russian winter. Last year they made do with an unusually warm winter, this year they’re getting the usual kind and their infrastructure, with just a year of neglect, is on the verge of collapse. It gets worse.

In order to keep the war going the Kremlin ordered budget cuts across the board. Law enforcement and mlitary get the funding, everything else will be cut by 10% or more, usually more. Because there are presidential elections this March, they will have to spend extra money on making sure the state of collapse isn’t too visible for the first three to four months of the year. This means they will spend more funds than allocated, leaving even less for the summer and the inevitable next winter, with even more secondary damage and even higher costs of repair, at a fraction of the budget.

Russians should enjoy this winter, being without heating at -25°C. Having enough potatoes and cabbage is as good as it gets for a while.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xsg1or7ymipkd29e', 'title': 'How is the Russian economy doing so well despite everything?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'So well, huh?\n\nOmsk, Russia\n\nOmsk is an important city in Siberia, with over a million people it’s a major regional center and would be an important city pretty much anywhere on Earth.

Rajveer Singh,5y,Can you explain me the economy of India?,"India is one of the largest, if not the largest economy in the world. It is predicted to be the second largest economy in the world by 2050. So, what contributes to the Indian economy? To answer this, we need to divide India’s economy into three parts and study the sectors of Indian economy in detail. We will also discuss the problems faced by each sector and solutions to these sectors respectively.

Sources of Income

Baluta System

Gross Domestic Product GDP

Indian Economy

They are three sectors in the Indian economy, they are; primary economy, secondary economy, and tertiary economy. In terms of operations, the Indian economy is divided into organized and unorganized. While for ownership, it is divided into the public sector and the private sector. But today, we are only going to talk about the sectors of Indian economy and what consists of these sectors.

Sectors of the Indian Economy

Primary Sector

The primary sector in India is the sector which is largely dependant on the availability of natural resources in order to manufacture the goods and also to execute various processes. The services in this sector are entirely dependant on the availability of the natural resources in order to keep the day-to-day operations running.

As we have the clear idea of this sector is, the best example to discuss in this sector is the agriculture sector. The other examples in this sector include fishing and forestry, but agriculture accounts for the largest in this sector.

One of the major problem that this sector faces is the underemployment and the disguised employment. Underemployment accounts for the workers not working to the best of their capabilities while the latter accounts for the workers not working to their true potential.

As a solution to the problems, the state, as well as the national government, can increase the funds for the irrigation facilities and provide loans for buying high-quality seeds and fertilizers.

Secondary Sector

The economy in the sector is dependent on the natural ingredients which are used to create the services and products offered and which at the end are used for consumption. In terms of value added to the products and services, this sector is the best sector. The major examples that fall under this category are transportation and manufacturing.

Both these sectors end product is the consumption by the people. This sector is responsible for the employment of almost 14 percent of the entire workforce currently working in India. The secondary sector also contributes to almost 28 percent of the share of GDP. This sector is the backbone of Indian economy and there are more development and growth in the near future.

Tertiary Sector

This sector contributes the largest in terms of share in GDP in India. The sector is also the service sector and is important when you consider the development of the other two sectors. Like the previous sector, this sector also adds the value to the products. This sector is responsible for employing 23 percentage of the workforce out of the total workforce currently working in India.

The example of this sector is all service sectors which IT services, consulting, etc. This sector contributes to almost 59 percent of the total share of GDP. The main problem that this sector is that the jobs which involve lower salaries do not attract much employment. And this remains the future dilemma as India is looking for double-digit growth in the near future.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jemq371udo2ak6g9', 'title': 'Can you explain me the economy of India?', 'score': {'original': 0.9944, 'ai': 0.0056}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'India is one of the largest, if not the largest economy in the world.

Shunpike Productions,1y,What will be the cause of the next financial crisis?,"The cause will be a combination of historic income and wealth inequality combined with systemic dysfunction in the financial system. There is, I think, a fairly reliable way to predict when it likely will happen based on historical patterns.

During the period after which Andrew Jackson destroyed the Second Bank of the United States in the 1830s and the passage of Glass-Steagall in 1933, a hundred year period in which banking and speculative activity was largely unregulated at the federal level in the US, there were boom bust cycles in the US every 15 to 20 years, beginning in 1837, followed by 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907 and 1929–1931. Each had their own specific causes and results. The worst of these was the 1929–1931 catastrophe which brought down the entire world monetary system, dethroned pound sterling as the prohibitive reserve currency and ushered in a period of chaos not resolved until the Bretton Woods system in 1944 enthroned the US dollar as the default world reserve currency. The severity of the 1929–31 crisis was due to the implosion of the circular debt structure related to WWI reparations and war debt, and its breakdown after the US stock market crash in 1929 and the Weimar German sovereign default in July 1931 which produced a run on the British pound, and later a run on the US dollar gold reserves by speculators.

There was no systemic financial crash between 1933 and 2008. There were recessions and containable problems, but no world or widespread financial crash. Beginning in the 1980s and culminating in the passage of Gramm, Leach, Bliley and the so-called Commodity Futures “Modernization” Act in 2000, most of the regulations on banking and financial speculation that had prevented or estopped this historic cycle pattern have been repealed. This occurred during a period of dramatically increasing wealth and income inequality which the financial deregulation helped exacerbate, but which was also caused by simultaneously occurring changes to tax, trade and labor laws and policies that promoted such inequality. It took just 8 years from 2000, when the deregulation was completed, for the world financial system to be brought down in a systemic crash that, without the massive monetization of debt by the central banks, would have produced a world depression worse than that produced by the 1929–31 collapse.

No adequate regulation of either finance or speculation has yet been enacted to prevent another repeat of the historic cycle. Income and wealth inequality is at historically high levels, speculation and asset bubbles still rampant, and a host of “opaque” financial instruments continue to be created and promoted that hide toxic debt, such as the tranche opportunities to hide zombie corporate debt. In addition, there are now emerging dysfunctions in trade, supply chains, and environmental issues that roughly mirror the problems during the 20th century interwar period.

The next world systemic crisis, based on historical patterns, is likely to occur between 2025 and 2030. It will likely involve a systemic crisis not in just maintaining and servicing private debt, but public debt as well given the high levels of both, and increasing sovereign debt instabilities. It will be made worse if another round of massive tax cuts on unearned income are enacted at the onset of a normal recession (which is likely before 2025) and such tax cuts will cause a significant run up in sovereign debt at a time of economic contraction and perhaps trigger a final speculative bubble before the system unravels at or near the end of the 2020s. When you combine this with likely climate problems occurring at the same time that will negatively impact global economic activity, you might have something akin the the Great Depression phenomenon and the Dust Bowl.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qpge5a7hwsbdomln', 'title': 'What will be the cause of the next financial crisis?', 'score': {'original': 0.8005, 'ai': 0.1995}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The cause will be a combination of historic income and wealth inequality combined with systemic dysfunction in the financial system.

The severity of the 1929–31 crisis was due to the implosion of the circular debt structure related to WWI reparations and war debt, and its breakdown after the US stock market crash in 1929 and the Weimar German sovereign default in July 1931 which produced a run on the British pound, and later a run on the US dollar gold reserves by speculators.\n\nThere was no systemic financial crash between 1933 and 2008. There were recessions and containable problems, but no world or widespread financial crash. Beginning in the 1980s and culminating in the passage of Gramm, Leach, Bliley and the so-called Commodity Futures “Modernization” Act in 2000, most of the regulations on banking and financial speculation that had prevented or estopped this historic cycle pattern have been repealed. This occurred during a period of dramatically increasing wealth and income inequality which the financial deregulation helped exacerbate, but which was also caused by simultaneously occurring changes to tax, trade and labor laws and policies that promoted such inequality. It took just 8 years from 2000, when the deregulation was completed, for the world financial system to be brought down in a systemic crash that, without the massive monetization of debt by the central banks, would have produced a world depression worse than that produced by the 1929–31 collapse.\n\nNo adequate regulation of either finance or speculation has yet been enacted to prevent another repeat of the historic cycle. Income and wealth inequality is at historically high levels, speculation and asset bubbles still rampant, and a host of “opaque” financial instruments continue to be created and promoted that hide toxic debt, such as the tranche opportunities to hide zombie corporate debt. In addition, there are now emerging dysfunctions in trade, supply chains, and environmental issues that roughly mirror the problems during the 20th century interwar period.\n\nThe next world systemic crisis, based on historical patterns, is likely to occur between 2025 and 2030. It will likely involve a systemic crisis not in just maintaining and servicing private debt, but public debt as well given the high levels of both, and increasing sovereign debt instabilities. It will be made worse if another round of massive tax cuts on unearned income are enacted at the onset of a normal recession (which is likely before 2025) and such tax cuts will cause a significant run up in sovereign debt at a time of economic contraction and perhaps trigger a final speculative bubble before the system unravels at or near the end of the 2020s. When you combine this with likely climate problems occurring at the same time that will negatively impact global economic activity, you might have something akin the the Great Depression phenomenon and the Dust Bowl.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.8005

Ron Rule,5y,"How is money lost? After the 2008 crisis, it was said that the world lost trillions of dollars. But since money (wealth) cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred, then where did all the money go?","Think of a stock the way you would think of a house.

Much like a house, a stock is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. If you buy a house today for $250,000 and sell it five years later to someone else for $350,000, then it’s easy to see that you made $100k.

Sometimes this goes the other way too. If five years later the housing market takes a downward turn and you end up selling it for $150,000, then that’s a $100,000 loss.

Those are real material losses that are easy to understand. But what happens when you don’t sell? If you paid $250k for your house, but now it’s worth $150k, technically you haven’t lost anything yet - at least not in terms of actual dollars. But you did lose value. If you had to sell your house, you couldn’t get what you paid for it.

And that’s what happened with the stock market. If you spent $250,000 buying stocks, and the value of those stocks went up to $350,000, every time you logged into your brokerage account you would see $350,000 on the screen. That’s what they’re worth - that’s the number you could sell them for right now if you wanted to.

But if the market tanks, the next day you might be looking at a screen that shows the value of your stocks is only $150,000.

Dima Vorobiev,Updated 4y,"Do you agree with Goebbels? He said that propaganda is best when it appeals to straightforward emotion: fear, suspicion, anger, culminating with ""we're winning"". Which modern politicians have learned to use this style in their political speeches?","Goebbels, just like Hitler, Mussolini and Marxists, only verbalized what those at the top had known and practiced since the dawn of time.

Pareto rules

Most of the time, political nation functions almost entirely on the top 5–15% level: party activists, top- and middle-level bureaucrats, businessmen, executives, criminal bosses etc. These need to calculate the consequences of their actions, so they communicate with each other on the rational level.

Rational bunch

These top groups often find each other at loggerheads. This is why their narratives are not only rational, but also extol “common values”. These values is just a flourished reminder that they all sit in the same boat and can go down all together if they fail to cooperate.

Inflection points

From time to time, they get locked in a zero-sum game. It all becomes a mad race to bottom, where the dirtiest one wins in the end. Almost always, this happens when the pie they have to share shrinks drastically. Then, it’s simply not enough for everyone who plays the game.

This is when someone in the top 5–15% always gets the idea to drag the remaining 85–95% into the game.

Cue in the clueless

The broad masses of population don’t think in rational terms.

Their education, level of knowledge and IQ can’t absorb the complexity of high-level politics.
They form an impeneterable tangle of interest groups and preferences, from largest to tiniest ones. If the “sophisticated” top guys fail to harmonize their interest, no AI manages to sort out the rationale of these ones—so insanely diverse they are.
They don’t have their own “walking brains” who do organization and propaganda for them. Those who can do that float into the top 5–15% crust, and operate there.

(This is where Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels came ahead of everyone else in the era of mass politics. You may blame their vanguard thinking for brutality and cynicism. But you must acknowledge the honesty.)

Emotional bunch

Here’s the explanation why anyone who wants to drag the mass of the populace into active politics must talk to feelings. Simple charisma and glib talk are not enough. These politicians must think in the terms of “Bad-Glad-Sad-Mad”.

Trump and AOC showed themselves exceptionally good at that. Their reach is greatly amplified by social media.

Below, a piece of art by a Russian radical nationalist, called “Retribution” that shows the level where players of mass politics operate. An apparition that combines the canonic traits of “Motherland
” (facial features) and “Angel of the abyss
” (clothes and lethal abilities) sheds a torrent of bombs on panicked enemies of Russia.

This was created in 2015. The motif expresses the mad feeling of a large part of Russians at the blatant inequality and lawlessness of Putinist rule, the triumph of the Crimean annexation and the awe at the show of Russia’s armed strength in Syria—all fused in one nonsensical, but very angry scene of apocalyptic revenge.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/grs0m3khayxtid2b', 'title': 'Do you agree with Goebbels?

Subramaniam Duraisamy,1y,What happens in a jobless growth economy? Is India going through this phase currently?,"Thanks for A2A Sai Dileep. There are two ways to answer the question.

The first way is to include random images of India, China, Japan, Biden, Zelenskyy and then say democracy bad, Modi bad, Stalin bad…and gain 2500 upvotes in 2 hours, and experience a new found rush of dopamine. That is what data challenged ignoramuses do.
The second way is to look at data critically, understand what jobless growth is all about and lay forward a holistic perspective. The downside is my answer might get less than 100 upvotes, but upside gives me and (hopefully you) a satisfaction of learning something.

Jobless growth is a phenomenon where the economy revives without any substantial rise in income levels. Lets say there is a factory that can produce 100 mobile phones in one day and employing 100 workers. If the factory owner finds there is a way to save 20% of manpower costs and double the production, he will go for it. So the factory produces 200 mobile phones per day, but with 80 people.

Theoretically the “economic output” of the factory has improved, but they laid off 20 people. In a way- automation and better efficiency has caused “jobless growth” in the factory.

This is what happens in large nations, albeit in a complex manner. As the economy grows past the agricultural driven and leapfrogs into industry and service, businesses find it easier to produce more with less people. A growing economy always has some level of joblessness. There are three types of unemployment

Frictional unemployment: When people leave a job for many reasons [birthing a child, higher studies, starting their own business].
Structural unemployment: Caused by changes in technology, market trends. Millions of sternos and typist jobs of last century are now obsolete. These happen due to the results of innovation.
Cyclical Unemployment: Which is caused by external factors like COVID, recession, wars or due to sudden changes. This is the natural cycle of any economy. However the governments and economists can only guard against this type of unemployment.

We can never eliminate frictional unemployment since they are voluntary. We can never eliminate structural unemployment because they are a result of innovation.

In India, we have a combination of all three types of unemployment. Due to COVID and war the US economy is heading towards recession, which can impact jobs in service and finance sector of India and South East Asia. This is the cyclical unemployment we are talking about. A Bloomberg report shows the chance of recession and job cuts in US and India by 2023 is 30% likely. US Recession Odds Within the Next Year Now 30%, Survey Shows

However in India we have a set of challenges in measuring unemployment and income levels itself.

A large chunk of people are still employed in agricultural, who are pretty much exempt from coming under the formal economy and paying income taxes. Since this large demographic is exempt from paying income taxes, the unemployment numbers are far understated.
If we look at the formal sector, the number of employees filing taxes are too low. As of July 31, only 5 crore people have filed IT returns, which means we can safely assume these 5 Crore people are “employed” in a job. But we know how screwed the data collection mechanism is when it comes to measuring income levels. ITR filing deadline today, over 5 crore tax returns received till now
India has a lot of self employed businesses which employ less than 10 people. Imagine if there are 1 Crore small businesses like that , that is a total of 10 Crore people which are missed out.
A lot of household jobs [like child care, cleaning, cooking] which are traditionally taken care by the women of the household are not coming under the economic activity. If I employ a maid to take care of my ailing grandfather, I pay salary to her, which gets counted. If I take of my grandfather myself, that activity does not come under the formal economy. A lot of jobs like these go uncounted.

All of this is natural for a growing economy. Get out of the middle class bubble. Learn to look beyond the screaming TV reporter and the data challenged ignoramuses.

There are two ways to answer the question.\n\nThe first way is to include random images of India, China, Japan, Biden, Zelenskyy and then say democracy bad, Modi bad, Stalin bad…and gain 2500 upvotes in 2 hours, and experience a new found rush of dopamine. That is what data challenged ignoramuses do.\nThe second way is to look at data critically, understand what jobless growth is all about and lay forward a holistic perspective. The downside is my answer might get less than 100 upvotes, but upside gives me and (hopefully you) a satisfaction of learning something.\n\nJobless growth is a phenomenon where the economy revives without any substantial rise in income levels. Lets say there is a factory that can produce 100 mobile phones in one day and employing 100 workers. If the factory owner finds there is a way to save 20% of manpower costs and double the production, he will go for it. So the factory produces 200 mobile phones per day, but with 80 people.\n\nTheoretically the “economic output” of the factory has improved, but they laid off 20 people. In a way- automation and better efficiency has caused “jobless growth” in the factory.\n\nThis is what happens in large nations, albeit in a complex manner. As the economy grows past the agricultural driven and leapfrogs into industry and service, businesses find it easier to produce more with less people. A growing economy always has some level of joblessness. There are three types of unemployment\n\nFrictional unemployment: When people leave a job for many reasons [birthing a child, higher studies, starting their own business].\nStructural unemployment: Caused by changes in technology, market trends. Millions of sternos and typist jobs of last century are now obsolete. These happen due to the results of innovation.\nCyclical Unemployment: Which is caused by external factors like COVID, recession, wars or due to sudden changes. This is the natural cycle of any economy. However the governments and economists can only guard against this type of unemployment.\n\nWe can never eliminate frictional unemployment since they are voluntary. We can never eliminate structural unemployment because they are a result of innovation.\n\nIn India, we have a combination of all three types of unemployment. Due to COVID and war the US economy is heading towards recession, which can impact jobs in service and finance sector of India and South East Asia. This is the cyclical unemployment we are talking about. A Bloomberg report shows the chance of recession and job cuts in US and India by 2023 is 30% likely. US Recession Odds Within the Next Year Now 30%, Survey Shows\n\nHowever in India we have a set of challenges in measuring unemployment and income levels itself.\n\nA large chunk of people are still employed in agricultural, who are pretty much exempt from coming under the formal economy and paying income taxes. Since this large demographic is exempt from paying income taxes, the unemployment numbers are far understated.\nIf we look at the formal sector, the number of employees filing taxes are too low. As of July 31, only 5 crore people have filed IT returns, which means we can safely assume these 5 Crore people are “employed” in a job. But we know how screwed the data collection mechanism is when it comes to measuring income levels. ITR filing deadline today, over 5 crore tax returns received till now\nIndia has a lot of self employed businesses which employ less than 10 people. Imagine if there are 1 Crore small businesses like that , that is a total of 10 Crore people which are missed out.\nA lot of household jobs [like child care, cleaning, cooking] which are traditionally taken care by the women of the household are not coming under the economic activity. If I employ a maid to take care of my ailing grandfather, I pay salary to her, which gets counted. If I take of my grandfather myself, that activity does not come under the formal economy. A lot of jobs like these go uncounted.\n\nAll of this is natural for a growing economy. Get out of the middle class bubble.

Boris Krstovic,Updated 3y,What is it like to live in a country with hyperinflation (extremely high inflation)?,"I was 19 when hyperinflation peaked in ex-Yugoslavia in ’94.

Things like hyperinflation do not happen over night. Basically you’re already “comfortable being uncomfortable” and very versatile to cope with a political and economic climate in which hyperinflation happens. Inflation is weaved into the fabric of your everyday living, so when it becomes hyper, it’s not something that much different than what you were used to before that.

Here’s a few points to illustrate how it felt to be privileged to experience the “beauty” of such unique historical momentum.

The Currency

The entire country was anchored to a stable currency that ran both gray and white economy. To us back then - it was Deutsche Mark
 (DEM). The magnitude of using DEM as “anchor” currency was such that even the government used it in the official communication channels instead of local Yugoslav Dinars (DIN). It was de-facto the currency, from purchasing a pack of cigarettes or a burger on the streets, all the way to buying a car or a house. Unless you worked for a government institution, your salary was usually tied to DEM and you would probably even receive your salary in DEM, or get dinars that you would convert to DEM that very moment.

Money was printed round the clock. Zeroes were added and then wrote off. It was very common to have a 500,000,000,000 DIN bill that gets denominated over night and becomes 500 DIN bill. We constantly had “old” bills and “new” bills in circulation, as they overlapped in circulation.

50 billion dinar note

Everyday Living

“What’s the exchange rate?” was the new “What’s up”. The rate changed several times a day, and one would change to Dinars only if absolutely necessary, the moment it becomes a necessity. Otherwise you might as well use those bills as a wallpaper.

Of course, exchanging money in a bank or exchange office would just be too easy :) The “official” exchange rate was much less favorable than one on the streets, and you actually had to interact with street “dealers” (eeer, devious foreign exchange “clerks” working in sole proprietorship) that were plentiful back at the time, and constituted for one of the most common grey economy jobs.

This was, like many other common and everyday things back then, illegal. Nonetheless, instead of upholding the law, police officers were actually providing “protection” services to the dealers :) Various scams took place regularly and you had to be sharp and super-careful when exchanging your money. Most of the time, you would exchange as little as 5 or 10 DEM, just to cover for what’s needed at the very moment.

The hyperinflation made most of SME’s effectively charge for their products and services in DEM. Retailers who didn’t accept DEM were very scarce and usually frowned upon. I remember one time a guy in McDonald’s, where they didn’t accept DEM, who was obnoxiously complaining for having to exchange his money into Dinars to pay for the meal :)

In a strange and bizarre way - hyperinflation also meant no inflation at all, since everything was de-facto in Deutsche Marks.

Salaries were, as one would expect, absurdly low. My mother had a monthly salary of around 5 DEM (equivalent of €5 EUR nowadays). Was it enough to make a living? Not by a far shot. Which brings me to:

The Grey Economy

Everybody was in the grey zone. Literally everybody. Yugoslavia (or what’s actually left of it at the time) was under UN economic sanctions
, which meant no goods were being imported. Consequently, illegal import and grey economy flourished.

Vast majority of normal people was forced into doing something on the side. Grey market consumed the entire country. People who were engineers, economists, lawyers or medical workers swallowed their pride and started smuggling cheese and salami from Hungary, reselling cigarettes or gasoline on the streets, or simply becoming “dealers”.

As for myself - being a geek, at the age of 16 I pirated computer games (proud owner of Schneider CPC
 464 and then 6128), and earned around 30–40 DEM a month, which was more than most people with “serious” jobs did at a time. To give a context, with 10 DEM you could easily have fun for entire week.

This created a parallel reality where you could easily spend your “official” or “day time” salary for one evening and then basically live off what you earn on the side.

People also used hyperinflation to their advantage. It was perfectly legit to use a cheque to pay for groceries in the store, and have it cleared after e.g. 15 days. Meaning you practically paid nothing. Same paradigm applied to whatever you had to regulate with the government - utility bills, for example. You pay them after few days or weeks, and basically get away for free.

In a nutshell, everybody was scamming everybody.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/u3qmzcbosfh961n8', 'title': 'What is it like to live in a country with hyperinflation (extremely high inflation)?', 'score': {'original': 0.99815, 'ai': 0.00185}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I was 19 when hyperinflation peaked in ex-Yugoslavia in ’94.\n\nThings like hyperinflation do not happen over night.

Ali O. AlShamsi,Updated 6y,Why do economic crises happen?,"Economic crises happen when there is an imbalance of either supply or demand regardless of the type of crisis. Allow me to draw an image for you™.

Supply and demand is like breathing.

Grow and shrink in cycles.

For example: When we over-supply loans to invest in real estate we get a crisis. This is like me shoving a leaf blower into your throat and blowing up your lungs.

When supply shrinks like what monopoly does and raises the price, its like me drowning you but allowing you to breath every now and then so you are barely alive.

When a country is under sanctions, it cannot trade with anyone. It is like me throwing you in vacuum. Breath whatever is in your lungs. There is no hope for you but to die.

Regardless of the crisis look for the over-supply or over-demand on something and you will be looking at a crisis happening and a bubble waiting to burst. There is no good over-supply or over-demand of anything. Even over supply of food means the industry is going to give way because businesses are not finding customers and they will then lose.

Misha Firer,6mo,What is the apparent strength of the Russian economy?,"sarcon

Bank of Russia opened the gates of hell.

You’re being provocative, aren’t you , biased foreignsky? There’re incalculable strengths and no apparent weaknesses to the Russian economy that I can think of at the moment.

Today is 25th year anniversary of the financial default in Russia. On August 17, 1998 a special financial operation led by nefarious George Soros and other foes of our glorious nation, trashed ruble from 6 to 28 per US dollar.

Russian Central Bank is celebrating financial default today with a new collapse of the ruble to 101 per US dollar.

Had you invested 100 dollars in the Russian economy in 1998 you would have yielded 6 dollars today, which means that as a true patriot you would have sacrificed 94 dollars to the Motherland!

Anatoly Aksakov is the head of the committee of financial markets in the lower chamber of Russian parliament. His job is to keep an eye on finances to ensure they toe the line of supply and demand.

Mr. Aksakov is vigilant. At night he peels his eyes open as his gaze track transactions in the financial markets.

When he blinks once, transactions stop in their electronic tracks and salute him. When he blinks twice, transactions freeze and drop pants and sing national anthem. When he blinks three times, handcuffed transactions get thrown into KGB dungeons until they share a cut with the polite officers.

Market prices bend over backwards to the will of this powerful bear of a man who sits in the office in front of the Kremlin like spoons do to magician Uri Geller.

When ruble dropped to new lows, Mr. Aksakov, cool as a gherkin, stated calmly, “I keep an eye on ruble and dollar exchange rate. It’s part of my job.”

Mr. Aksakov who reads patterns of macroeconomic activities like an open book and assists traders around the world when they make mistakes in judgement, is able to single-mindedly prop up ruble with his psychic powers.

The governor of Russian Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina is impressed but prefers not to have him join her crew lest he overwhelms them with his superior knowledge of macroeconomics and his commanding voice of a VIP deputy who studied economics in the Moscow State University that rivals London School of Economics if counting from the back of the list.

“From the point of view of the majority of the population, they spit on exchange rate!” said Mr. Aksakov confidently. “People receive wages. There’re smiles on their faces. They experience no stress that exchange rate approaches 100 rubles.”

Mr. Aksakov not only keeps two eyes on financial markets but he’s observing the collective behavior of the population. He noted a skyrocketed number of smiling spitters, a clear signal that things in the financial markets are fine.

Mr. Aksakov’s expertise and the scope of watching seems to know no bounds. “Russia lives a normal life. It’s in a state of positive development unprecedented since the Soviet Union.”

For this kind of sweeping, powerful statements, Mr. Aksakov, a native of Chuvashia, holds such an important post. What would financial markets do without his paternal care?

“The country,” continued Mr. Aksakov, a spokesperson for the country’s emotional state, “is in a positive trend of its development. I mean not from the point of view of growth rates, they are still not enough.”

A -7.6% decline from 2021 may look negative but one should not focus too much on a minus sign.

“We relied on oil, gas and energy resources in the development of the economy,” the economic maverick explained the unparalleled boom cycle, because in a matter of months, Russian economy diversified and completely kicked reliance on raw materials in its exports.

“And now mechanical engineering, tool making, electrical engineering are developing.”

Then why ruble is collapsing if the economy is developing , diversifying and growing ? Mr. Aksakov whose son Alexander is a US citizen and lives in America unfortunately didn’t explain.

But we, in Russia, are accustomed to taking words of VIP deputies on faith.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rcns62dey384umpw', 'title': 'What is the apparent strength of the Russian economy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9715, 'ai': 0.0285}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'sarcon\n\nBank of Russia opened the gates of hell.\n\nYou’re being provocative, aren’t you , biased foreignsky?

Jonathan Sadikin,5y,What's holding Indonesia back from becoming a major economic power?,"This is a question fit for a doctoral thesis, so I won’t delve too deeply in it. Take my answer as a layman’s answer.

In my opinion, the single greatest obstacle that stops Indonesia from becoming a major economic power is still an ‘extractive economy’ in the sense introduced by Professor Acemoglu in his famous work Why Nations Fail. Indonesia is, to some extent, an extractive economy. A lot of our wealth is controlled by people whose self-interest is to secure the wealth they have accumulated through decades of corruption.

The dethronement of Soeharto was a turning point for Indonesia. Before 1998, Indonesia may call itself a Republic, but in reality, it was a Kingdom. Soeharto possessed absolute power, and he did with the country what he wished. His rule was virtually unchallenged for a long time. In 1998, Soeharto faced a choice. Yes, there were economic crisis and students were taking to the street. But as far as a man in his position was concerned, these are mere trivial issues. The economic crisis wasn’t an Indonesian-exclusive issue. It was a global economic crisis, and eventually, the cycle will turn and things would get better. Soeharto still had the full backing of all state apparatus, especially the Army. He simply needs to either negotiate with the students and try to defuse the situation or even used force and he could very well keep his position as a president. But he has also been old, and was rumored to be seriously ill. He made a conscious choice: he would avoid a potential insurgency by stepping down peacefully and quietly… with certain conditions, that is. He gets to keep everything. His family and loyal supporters will not be purged, and he agreed to support the new administration.

We were… extremely lucky that his successors were determined to reform the Kingdom into a democracy. And, to the best of their abilities, reverse the extractive economy existing under the dictatorship into an inclusive economy. So in a way, all’s well that ends well.

However… and this is a very important point… the unofficial ‘deal’ Soeharto made with the new administration stands. His families and loyalists remain the key figure in the new administration and they continue to maintain their power and position until today.

To maintain their power and assets, it is imperative for these people to keep ‘their’ people in key positions. And as long as this remains the case, we would still have an ‘elite ruling class’ which are corrupt and extractive.

I’m a cautious optimist. Despite the existence of this elite ruling class, Indonesia continues to chug along like some kind of unstoppable beast. The anticorruption laws got passed, then a bunch of corruptors got arrested, transparency goes up, efficiency goes up, and public awareness and democracy get better…

We’re still moving forward. All we have to do is keep our sight straight, roll our sleeves back, and stay the course.

We’ll get there, mate. We’ll get there.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ro3sd6wjq9uklx1p', 'title': ""What's holding Indonesia back from becoming a major economic power?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This is a question fit for a doctoral thesis, so I won’t delve too deeply in it.

Take my answer as a layman’s answer.\n\nIn my opinion, the single greatest obstacle that stops Indonesia from becoming a major economic power is still an ‘extractive economy’ in the sense introduced by Professor Acemoglu in his famous work Why Nations Fail. Indonesia is, to some extent, an extractive economy. A lot of our wealth is controlled by people whose self-interest is to secure the wealth they have accumulated through decades of corruption.\n\nThe dethronement of Soeharto was a turning point for Indonesia. Before 1998, Indonesia may call itself a Republic, but in reality, it was a Kingdom. Soeharto possessed absolute power, and he did with the country what he wished. His rule was virtually unchallenged for a long time. In 1998, Soeharto faced a choice. Yes, there were economic crisis and students were taking to the street. But as far as a man in his position was concerned, these are mere trivial issues. The economic crisis wasn’t an Indonesian-exclusive issue. It was a global economic crisis, and eventually, the cycle will turn and things would get better. Soeharto still had the full backing of all state apparatus, especially the Army. He simply needs to either negotiate with the students and try to defuse the situation or even used force and he could very well keep his position as a president. But he has also been old, and was rumored to be seriously ill. He made a conscious choice: he would avoid a potential insurgency by stepping down peacefully and quietly… with certain conditions, that is. He gets to keep everything. His family and loyal supporters will not be purged, and he agreed to support the new administration.\n\nWe were… extremely lucky that his successors were determined to reform the Kingdom into a democracy. And, to the best of their abilities, reverse the extractive economy existing under the dictatorship into an inclusive economy. So in a way, all’s well that ends well.\n\nHowever… and this is a very important point… the unofficial ‘deal’ Soeharto made with the new administration stands. His families and loyalists remain the key figure in the new administration and they continue to maintain their power and position until today.\n\nTo maintain their power and assets, it is imperative for these people to keep ‘their’ people in key positions. And as long as this remains the case, we would still have an ‘elite ruling class’ which are corrupt and extractive.\n\nI’m a cautious optimist. Despite the existence of this elite ruling class, Indonesia continues to chug along like some kind of unstoppable beast. The anticorruption laws got passed, then a bunch of corruptors got arrested, transparency goes up, efficiency goes up, and public awareness and democracy get better…\n\nWe’re still moving forward.

Bitcoin had a bad week, retracing much of 2019’s gains but remaining positive on a Y/Y basis (though it’s up again more recently). Here are the positives: Bitcoin and traditional safe-haven assets all sold off, bitcoin is now trading very cheaply on a USD basis, and the fundamental analysis and value proposition remains unchanged. Because of bitcoin’s newer, more volatile nature, the moves in this market will naturally be more extreme.

Safe-haven status remains intact

People think bitcoin lost its safe-asset use case but this liquidity crunch and ensuing government intervention is laying the foundation for bitcoin’s adoption as a safe-haven asset.

It’s easy to talk about long-term theses and other “hopeium” in the face of this nascent market’s most extreme recent drawdown and ignore the fact that a ton of people lost a ton of money. So let’s consider the short-term thesis:

A “first-level” analysis would conclude BTC went down while stocks went down, and so there is no “store of value,” nor does it function as a “safe haven.” I cannot stress how useless this commentary is, and masquerading it as “analysis” is somewhat insulting. Anybody with mediocre programming skills can plot two lines and point to a correlation – what value has this analysis added? None.

Gold in 2008

That aside, consider gold in 2008. Gold prices fell sharply at the beginning of the financial crisis, only to rally after TALF (Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facilities), which was a program to increase credit availability and support economic activity by facilitating renewed issuance of consumer and small business asset-backed securities.

Unlike TARP, TALF money came from the Fed and not the U.S. Treasury and so the program did not require congressional approval but an act of Congress forced the Fed to reveal how funds were lent. Other relief measures were implemented and then further bolstered by quantitative easing (QE), where central banks purchase a predetermined number of government bonds to increase the money supply and inject money directly into the economy.

In the U.S. QE started in November 2008 and ended about six years and $4.5 trillion later. This serves to illustrate that safe-haven assets may sell off during a liquidity crunch but afterwards investors begin to see the need for assets with sound money properties that offer protection from currency devaluation.

For cryptocurrency markets, the signs of a pullback were building. I personally watch Bitmex leveraged positions to get an indication of where the market is. Whenever leveraged positions build up to an extreme, the market tends to (possibly is forced to) move in the opposite direction and clear out the leveraged positions. There were over $1 billion in leveraged longs on Bitmex and from what I last read, roughly $700 million of those were wiped out during the week of the sell-off. It is a painful but necessary cleansing.

Because bitcoin is a mined coin with model-able production costs, it is important for fundamental investors to follow miner behavior closely. Leading up to the crash, miner inventory had built up. Miners either sell coins to market or build up reserves to sell when prices are more favorable. This is called the MRI (miner rolling inventory). Chainalysis put out this fascinating chart that shows miners generated inventory vs. inventory sent to exchanges. One could assume miner hoarding is a sign that there is an expectation of a price increase, but a liquidity crunch throws all that out the window, AND historical data suggests that returns are better when miners are not hoarding.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xw2139tp6g4qbiru', 'title': 'Will Bitcoin follow gold as a ""safe-haven"" asset given the current economic downturn?', 'score': {'original': 0.99435, 'ai': 0.00565}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I consider BTC to be a better version of gold as it is provably scarce, among other benefits.

Nidan Ali Basheer,3y,"What is the debt-to-GDP ratio of India, and what are its impacts in the long term?","India has a Debt-to-GDP ratio of 69.62%. This is how India fares in comparison with other major economies

Debt-to-GDP Ratio of some major economies

Nations with highest Debt-to-GDP ratios

On the surface, a high Debt-to-GDP ratio sounds a really terrible thing as more debt=more liability and there is no free lunch, one day, that debt should be simply be paid back, after all and India's Debt-to-GDP ratio is currently 69% which will probably rise to 76–77% once the pandemic ends and this doesn't sound too great as China has a debt-to-gdp ratio of around 50% and Russia has a paltry 18.5%. But there is more to debt than just numbers and percentages.

Government Debt can be classified into two, External and Internal Debt. Internal Debt is borrowed from instituitions inside the nation while external debt is financed from international financial institutions and from other sovereign nations and this distinction matter a lot, as internal debt is far better to handle and is extremely unlikely to cause any crises as the government has some degree to leverage towards their internal lenders. In India's case, around 75% of India's all debt is to internal debtors which is a far better state than most other nations

But in the Geoeconomic games of Debt Diplomacy, what matter more is the External Debt as it can be easily used as tool to exercise control over other nations and US was the pioneer of this model through the Bretton Woods Institutions, the IMF and World Bank who have in part caused debt crises in Greece and Argentina in the recent past and also in several African Nations.

But China is the current champion of the Debt Games through their dream project of Belt and Road Initiative where they have given generous credit to Financially Unstable nations with a possible intent to foreclose some strategic assets of that nation. China seized the newly constructed Hambantota Port at Sri Lanka and also the Mombasa Port in Kenya as a result of this policy and this is just the start as more than 100 developing nations are part of the BRI

This is why Japan who has the highest ratio in the world is not much worried about their debt as a large portion of it is to their internal lenders as a result of their aversion to external borrowing after the 1988 crisis which in part was due to lending from US.

While USA, which has a far lower ratio of 106% is far more worried about their debt as 40% of their debt is owed to other nations like Japan and China which gives them a position of leverage. This is usually not a problem as most of Global Commerce is done through USD and US can print it's way out, but if that changes, US might be in deep trouble.

India's External Debt was $521Bn in 2018 and it forms around 19.2% of the GDP and 11% of it is to Multilateral Financial Institutions where half of it is to World Bank and IDA and ADB takes the most of the other half and only 1.1% of the External Debt is owed to the IMF and almost no debt is owed to the Chinese Government which means that India has far less to worry about, atleast in the medium term here and most of India's bilateral debt is owed to Japan, Germany, Russia and US with whom India shares a very friendly relation with.

Government Debt is usually not a huge issue as long as there is sufficient economic growth as not to break the trust of the creditor but as COVID-19, we can't quite tell when a crisis would come and we haven't fully comprehended the full economic impact of the incoming financial crisis. As pointed before, India's Debt-to-GDP ratio is likely going to see a bump in the near future which makes India more prone to what happens in international markets and inside US which to say the least, is more volatile than ever.

India recorded one of her best years when US was contracting

India was one of the very few nations to record a high growth during the 2008 Financial Crisis and one of the reasons to this was India's relative insularity against the international markets which had put India in a position of strength during the crisis. But today, India is slowly losing that strength at the cost of more international trade, which is a good thing, but what must be made sure is that India should have some sort of leverage over the nations India trades with, which is unfortunately not the case today as India has trade deficits with almost every major nation which is pushing India more into debt.

India's Trade Deficit from 2015 to 2020

Another rather pressing concern for India is the budget deficit which has refused to even out partly due to Mismanagement and mostly due to Electoral Democracy and after each passing year, there is more and more debt, and after every recession and slowdown, More and more debt is financed to maintain the government programs as not to anger the public, and solving the issue without resorting to cold hard austerity will be one of the biggest challenges to the economy in the near future.

The Deficit Rollercoaster

One of the proposals is to maintain a Rainy Day Fund which is a proposal by Milton Friedman as a measure not to jack up inflation and debt during a recession which is a a very efficient solution but not very practical as it would be a foolish thing to expect politicians to think beyond their term. The most plausible way to handle the debts and deficits for now is to increase the high value exports so that there is some sort of interdependence between India and other major economies which will reduce deficits and might even cancel out each other's debt. The best way of countering an armed person is to arm yourself

Jay Kim,5y,Is there another financial crash coming up?,"The biggest point of contention right now among market pundits is whether this bull market still has room to run or if we should be bracing for another leg down.

The latest move to new highs in the NASDAQ has encouraged many investors to believe that the global equity market correction that began in late Jan has ended.

Many bulls believe that equities could melt-up in coming months. These bulls usually focus on the US tax cuts, synchronized growth and long term growth potential in tech.

Many are also encouraged by the ease with which equity markets absorbed the news of US steel and aluminum tariffs and of Gary Cohn’s subsequent resignation. Cohn’s resignation means trade friction will rise in coming months.

If markets are unperturbed by the risk of a trade war, however low at this stage, surely this is a sign of underlying strength no?

Moreover, there has been good news. The Trump-Kim Summit, if it proceeds, could significantly lower geopolitical risk in this part of the world and will be seen as an unambiguous positive for regional markets.

The removal of term limits on President Xi at China’s recent National People's Congress (NPC), while negative in some respects, has been welcomed as a sign of political stability by Asian investors.

Unfortunately, at this point I believe we aren’t out of the woods just yet.

The NASDAQ has a history of peaking after the other major stock indices. It did this in 1987 and again in 2000. In 1987 the Dow peaked on Aug 25 while the NASDAQ peaked on Oct 5. In 2000 the Dow peaked on 14 Jan while the NASDAQ peaked on 24 Mar. Since the NASDAQ has lagged in two of the last three major peaks we see nothing unusual in recent events.

From a risk reward perspective, it really doesn’t makes to be naked long this market whatsoever.

Dima Vorobiev,1y,Is the resource curse a myth?,"“Is the resource curse a myth?”

Yes and no. Depends on your perspective.

Let’s take it from the humble beginnings of Russia some thousand years ago and see how it went.

Case 1

A bunch of Scandinavians made a technological breakthrough that allowed them to speedily build boats that could navigate both shallow river courses and rough seas. That allowed them access to an abundant source of slaves in the far forests of Eastern Europe whom they then brought to rich markets in the Roman Empire and beyond.

In a matter of a century, Kievan Rus surged out of nowhere as the largest—and possibly richest—kingdom north of Constantinople.

Was it a curse? Not for the guys who ruled the place and their customers. And us, who inherited this place and its legends.

Case 2

In the beginning of the 13th century, the Crusaders busted the Roman Empire. Overnight, our giant market in the south disappeared. Rus lands, already fractured into dozens of competing fiefdoms, found themselves impoverished because the Mediterranean trade was our only source of wealth.

We had to use glass beads and exotic shells for money. Rus lands—easily and mostly by our own volition— became a dull backwater of the Golden Horde.

Curse as promised? Sure.

Case 3

Over a couple of centuries, we became good business partners with the Turks along the Volga river who took over the Chingizide Empire. That allowed us to earn good money selling furs and other valuable things that were abundant in our forests. The world headed into the Little Ice Age. People were throwing money at our merchants. Rulers of Muscovy knew how to pick that money and use it for important government business.

In the 16th century, we gobbled up the shards of the Chingizide empire and started our epic slow march toward the Pacific and southward to the Silk Road. We became the largest land on Earth. Our territory and riches hidden beneath it are a legacy from that time.

Was it a curse? Indigenous locals might agree. But certainly not a curse for us.

Case 4

Some hundred years ago, a small group of Marxists grabbed power in what was left after the collapsed Russian Empire. A devastating Civil War followed. Pigheaded attempts to implement the Marxian 10-point Action Plan from the Communist Manifesto made us a continent-sized smoldering ruin.

But eight blessed years of market-based “new economic policy” followed. Timid Capitalism soon put us back on our feet. And then in the 1930s Stalin shrewdly got our Western enemies to put together for us the greatest military-industrial machine the world had seen. This won us WW2 and later made us a space-age nuclear superpower.

How did we do it? We threw a whopping mass of resources on the task, all our own.

A curse? Heck no.

Case 5

In the 1980s, international petroleum markets imploded. Since exported oil and gas were the life source for the hugely ineffective Soviet machine, the USSR imploded soon after.

We lost the Cold War. Our mighty country was torn apart into 15 different states, several at war with each other and themselves. Misery, chaos, and humiliation followed for millions and millions of us.

Looks exactly like a curse to me.

Case 6

At the turn of the century, things looked bleak for Russia. But suddenly, the international commodity markets surged into the stratosphere. The world was again throwing money at us. Again! And our new confident ruler with solid KGB credentials knew how to pick that money and put it to serious government business.

What was new, he allowed much of this windfall of riches to rain on us, mere commoners. That was an era of unseen prosperity and peace for millions and millions of Russians. Our beloved President made a solid claim to become the best ruler of Russia, ever.

Could he pull this off without oil and gas and the rest of the stuff we chop down, dig up, pump over, and sell to the world?

Nope.

Some Russians may call our President a curse. But for the generation of Soviet old-timers like me, this was a blessing.

Below, a symbolic scene from downtown Moscow. A big statue of Rus duke Vladimir who together with his Varangian guard baptized our country “with fire and sword” stands right outside the Kremlin. You see a shining red star on one of the Kremlin’s towers above his head.

This illustrates the 3D vision we practice in Russia on curses and blessings.

In our mind, the red pentagram of belligerent atheists, internationalists, and haters of historical Russia goes perfectly fine with Orthodox piety, imperial past, and defiant nationalism. At any given moment, we pick whatever works. We leave it to neurotic intellectuals to worry about labels to put on it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3g92lmtko7unhice', 'title': 'Is the resource curse a myth?', 'score': {'original': 0.7228, 'ai': 0.2772}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“Is the resource curse a myth?”\n\nYes and no.

Sahil Bhadviya,Updated 4y,"How is the market touching new highs (NIFTY above 12,000 on 7/11/19) when analysts are saying that the economy is slowing down?","Let’s say there are 100 companies in the business. Together they have a total value of Rs 100,000 (based on what everyone thinks). Now the top 5 companies represent 65% of the business value i.e. Rs 65,000. It means the rest of 95 companies together have a value of Rs 35,000.

But there is a catch. There are 1000 more companies (small and very small) for which we don’t have complete information as a lot of them don’t tell us their income. But these 1000 companies employ a major population of the country.

Now, let’s say there is a slowdown in the country. Due to certain reasons, this slowdown mainly impacts those 1000 companies. No flow of money. No working capital. No buyers. No business.

But the problem is - You don’t know the impact of slowdown because there is no concrete data. On the other side, the top 100 company information is available. But out of those 100 companies, you are interested to know only the performance of the top 5 companies which represent 65% of the business.

You think they will grow even more and hence you keep investing in those top 5 companies. This results in an increase in the market value of the top 5 companies. You look at the value and think that everything is great.

But what about the value of rest 95 companies?

What about the value of 1000 companies that employs the major part of the population?

This is exactly the situation in India.

The top 5 companies represent Nifty 50 ( top 50 listed companies in India) which has a 65% market share in more than 6000 listed companies in India. It means the rest of all the listed companies have a 35% market share. (Please note that we are not even talking about the unlisted companies and unorganized market.)

Nifty has crossed the peak of 12,000. What does it mean?

First of all, 12,000 is the value based on sentiment. If today, I am willing to pay Rs 100 for one stock of a company and if the company has 100 stock, the value of the company would become 100*100 = Rs 10,000. Tomorrow, if I am willing to pay Rs 200, it would become Rs 20,000. Day after, if I am willing to pay Rs 50, the value would be Rs 5,000.

So the first point to note is that Nifty at 12,000 is based on a cumulative stock price of the top 50 companies at a price that people are willing to pay. Let’s say tomorrow if people are willing to pay half price for each of the top 50 shares, the Nifty value would become 6,000.

Now, the question is - When there is a slowdown in India, how the hell Nifty touching all-time high?

As I mentioned in the beginning, Nifty represents only the top 50 companies in the country. There are 6000+ listed companies in India.

So, if you ask - What about the performance of the rest of the companies? We don’t have the tracker like Nifty to track the performance of all of them. However, we can track the performance of the top 500 companies.

Let’s compare the performance of Nifty 50 with Nifty mid-cap 150 and Nifty small-cap 250.

Nifty 50

It has touched 12,000. It is 20% up to as compared to the last 2 years.
But when there is a slowdown, why Nifty is rising? It is because people are investing a lot of money. Especially with mutual fund awareness, a lot of money is flowing into the equity market and mainly in the top 50 stocks. The reason is simple- Everyone is optimistic about India’s growth story and the top 50 companies are stable with a proven track record. So a safer bet as compared to other companies. However, there is a small problem. The problem is with the performance. Most of the companies have not done great in the last couple of years. Still, people are pumping in money with the hope that things will get better and companies will start growing at a good rate. Due to this high demand, the stock price has increased a lot. This has made them very costly. Yes, most of the companies in Nifty are highly overvalued.

Now, let’s have a look at the performance of other companies.

Nifty Mid Cap 150: It represents companies ranging from 101 to 250 (according to market cap)

An interesting observation here. While Nifty 50 has grown 20% in the last couple of years, Nifty Midcap 150 has actually fallen around 10% in the last couple of years. This makes sense as Indian is in a state of slowdown. Still, it doesn’t capture the overall slowdown.

Let's look at the next set of companies.

Nifty Small Cap 250: It represents companies ranging from 251 till 500.

Woah! That looks scary. Nifty small-cap 250 has actually fallen 40% from the peak in the last couple of years. It shows that the slowdown has a big impact on these stocks.
On the other side, it shows a good opportunity to invest in small-cap and mid-cap funds as compared to blindly putting everything in large-cap. This is an important lesson for all investors to balance the portfolio according to the market situation.

But the problem is - We don’t have an Index to measure the performance of the rest of the companies.

What about the impact on the unorganized sector?

There are probably 600,000+ (just a guess as we don’t know the exact number) small mom and pop stores that fall under the unorganized sector which employs a major workforce in India.

The slowdown has badly hurt the economy. Especially the unorganized sector of India.

Who is the culprit?

Demonetization and GST

Why the government demonetized the currency and implemented GST?

Let’s quickly take demonetization:

India is mainly a cash-driven economy. The unorganized sector is mainly driven by cash. Now the problem is - since they are driven by cash, they don’t pay tax to the government.

Government is trying to make India a digital-driven economy which is a great initiative and much-needed move for India to reach greater heights. Demonetization was a part of this plan. The more people start using digital payment, the greater the visibility and hence tax collection. If every individual starts paying tax and government utilizes it in an efficient manner, nobody can stop India’s growth story.

But this demonetization was a real shocker for the country. It suddenly created a huge cash crunch. The implementation of demonetization is questionable.

(The current problem is of chicken and egg. When I interact with people on tax payment, they say that the government doesn’t utilize the money efficiently. There is no infrastructure. There is a lot of corruption. Now since people don’t pay tax, the government doesn’t get a lot of funds to invest. Here, I am not taking any side. I think both are at fault. We need to come out of this situation)

Just when everyone was trying to recover from the shocker of demonetization, the government implemented GST.

Again, the intention was right. This would simplify the complicated tax structure of the country. But, the implementation is again a big question mark. The impact was bad. It created a big problem with working capital. Small business owners started struggling big time. One of the reasons is tax payment. Earlier, these small businesses used to work without bills. Things started changing after GST. A lot of businesses started using bill payment which requires them to pay tax. This increased the final price of the product and service which people found difficult to digest. Hence they avoided purchases. There was already a cash crunch due to demonetization. Due to cash crunch and poor sales, a lot of companies defaulted on their payment to banks. Hence, banks got scared and they reduced the loan approval. This had a snowball effect which triggered the slowdown.

Conclusion

Nifty represents only the top 50 companies and not the entire economy. They have around 65% share of the listed companies in India. The slowdown had an impact on Nifty as well but due to an increase in investment with strong future prospects, the stocks have become overvalued. This has made the entire index overvalued.
While Nifty 50 has grown 20% in the last couple of years, Nifty mid-cap 150 has fallen 10% and small-cap has fallen 40%. They represent only the top 500 companies. We don’t have an index to measure the performance of the rest of the listed companies.
The biggest impact of slowdown is on the unorganized sector due to demonetization and GST. They represent a huge section of society which is not captured in the Index like Nifty.
In short, Nifty 50 doesn’t reflect the true state of the Indian economy and it is not considering the slowdown due to a large amount of money inflow from domestic as well as foreign investors who are optimistic about the future. This has made Nifty 50 highly overvalued.

Jeremy Arnold,Updated 3y,Why are oil prices turning negative in the U.S. and abroad? What does this mean?,"I’m going to try to cover a few different angles in this answer:

What is (and isn’t) happening with oil prices right now
What the next few months might look like
What all this means in economic terms

As preface, my standing here is seven years of living and working in Alberta. While I’ve had just one oilfield client, most of my other Albertan clients operated in a world dominated by downstream effects from said sector, which necessitated me learning a thing or two about it.

That said, this is an enormously complex subject, and I’m not an energy analyst. As such, I’ve done my best to be clear about what I know vs. what I suspect. (As ever, my cash-for-corrections policy applies to all that follows.)

Ok, diving in.

I. Oil Prices Today

Lots of buzz today about negative oil prices. To take one particularly dramatic screencap (h/t Chris Hua):

But while these numbers make for remarkable headlines and watercooler discussions, they’re not quite what they appear (as Chris knows, to be clear).

The skinny version:

Lots of people who don’t want to actually buy oil still like to trade it. (This could be for speculation, as part of a hedge, or for other more arcane reasons.)
The largest US market for oil futures is the NYMEX (part of the CME Group).
Their oil futures benchmark is the WTI (a grade of oil that reflects a historically popular crude output from Texas).
TheIr standard WTI futures contract is an obligation to take possession of 1,000 barrels of WTI-grade oil within a given month at a pre-agreed price.
All WTI futures settle in Cushing, Oklahoma. (That is, if you purchase a WTI futures contract and hold it to maturity, you have to arrange to actually receive 1,000 barrels of physical crude from Cushing by x date.)
Since lots of investors have no desire for the physical product, they traditionally roll their futures forward by selling one month’s contract(s) a day or two prior to maturity and then using said money to buy new ones.
Usually this works fine, as someone in the supply chain will just buy those contracts for something close to the day’s spot price.

In normal times this is an exceedingly mundane bit of the world’s financial plumbing. But then COVID-19 fell upon us and times were no longer normal. In just two months global oil demand dropped by 20%-30% (sources vary, and none can really be considered authoritative given the complexity of the calculation).

While this sort of demand drop has happened to other industries too, the oil economy has some weird quirks:

It can be prohibitively expensive to shut down production. Some machinery and infrastructure just isn’t designed to be turned off, or to run below certain thresholds.
There’s an impenetrable thicket of contracts across the supply chain. For example, a given producer may have minimum volume obligations to a given pipeline that come with onerous penalties if unmet. Plus there’s an even deeper thicket of insurance claims / swaps.
The upshot is that producers will sometimes keep the pumps going despite significant losses so as to avoid even larger losses.
Historically, global demand has kept prices from actually going negative. If prices slumped too far buyers would just throw the oil in storage and wait.
The trouble is that said system wasn’t built for a black swan event like COVID. We’ve never had this much of a supply/demand mismatch before, and global storage is now rapidly approaching capacity.
This has had nasty effects on prices.

As for today’s madness, it happens that April 21st is the maturity date for May WTI futures (the CLK20 batch).

Why this matters:

Imagine you’re a typical trader. You buy futures as a hedge or whatever. But you have no means of ever taking a physical delivery. You’d have to hire some company to retrieve and sell/store the oil on your behalf, which would be an expensive hassle.
So you go to sell your maturing contracts on the open market as per usual, except this time global demand is plummeting and storage anywhere near Cushing is suddenly nigh impossible to come by.
You didn’t buy an oil option. You bought an oil contract. Meaning you must take possession of the underlying or NYMEX is going to penalize you harshly. And once you have said oil you’re subject to government regulations re: storage and disposal. You can’t just burn or dump it.
So buyers look around and say “sure we’ll take your contract off your hands — if you pay us enough”.
You don’t care for this. But you have no real alternatives. Thus you pay up.

Basically what we saw today was a classic squeeze. It isn’t that oil suddenly lost all value to end consumers. It’s just a weird season in a complex global market wherein settlement day came at a very bad time for lots of contract-holders in a specific region. WTI traders expected business as normal. But the business had changed and they were caught off guard.

In contrast, here are the current prices for NYMEX-WTI futures settling in future months:

Certainly not great. (WTI was around $50 USD before the COVID crisis began.)

But are those left-column prices actually going to hold when future contracts come due? That’s a many-many-billions-of-dollars question.

II. Oil Prices This Year

Oversimplifying a bit, there are four basic inputs to the price of oil-derived fuels:

Getting them out of the ground
Getting them to a refinery
Refining / packaging
Transporting them to an end user

As it happens, these costs are very uneven.

Take Alberta:

Most of our oil/gas comes from wells that require complicated and energy-intensive extraction
Labor costs here are substantial (most rig folk do 12 hour shifts for 10-14 days straight, often in remote/inhospitable places, for which they need to be generously compensated)
Alberta is landlocked, meaning our exports need to travel great distances by train/pipeline to get to a port/refinery
Most of our oil products are “heavy” and require above-average refining

Putting this together, we understand why WCS (Western Canadian Select) trades at a steep discount to WTI. Even in good times this was often a $20/bbl USD delta.

So what happens when WTI approaches $0?

(We’ll get to an actual answer in a minute. For now you get the rhetorical point.)

Anyway, as to the macro/global situation:

The three largest oil producers today are the US (18m barrels per day), Saudi Arabia (12m bpd), and Russia (11m bpd). (These numbers shift, so don’t take them as ultra-precise. But for easy math we can use 100m bpd as our baseline for global output, which is fairly close to actual.)
Per above, these countries have very different cost structures.
Saudi Arabia has everything easy (trivial extraction, cheapish migrant labor, nearby/domestic refineries, central location for exporting, etc)
The US has trickier extraction and much higher labor/regulatory costs
While Russia has better labor costs than the US in general, most of their oil is in remote/frozen Siberia
As global demand has dropped, said countries have been uncooperative as far as agreeing on both production cuts and price stabilization
The Saudis agreed to a production cut with OPEC+, then started offering heavy discounts immediately thereafter (while they need prices to rebound eventually to make their national budget work, they’re rich enough to be patient)
Russia has low debt, lots of foreign reserves, and very strong geopolitical incentives to see oil ecosystems in US/Canada collapse
Most producers in the US will need government intervention to avoid bankruptcy (while breakeven numbers vary by region/type, it seems that sustained WTI pricing under $40/bbl would wipe out a huge chunk of the industry within the year)

In a world where demand stays 20% below baseline for even a few more months, the US and Canada are in deep trouble. That’s because Russia and the Saudis can pretend at diplomacy by agreeing to concessions that don’t actually change the core dynamic all that much. Say they confer with a few neighbors and bring joint production down from ~30m bpd to ~23m bpd. This would still only be equal to roughly a third of the theoretical oversupply, thus still allowing buyers enormous leverage, thus still keeping prices perilously low.

Can Trump and OPEC+ work something out? It’s possible. Every nation has its pressure points. But given how most in OPEC+ would benefit from permanent damage to US/CAD production capacity, it’s difficult to imagine a scenario in which they don’t distract/delay. (Bear in mind that the US is in an election year, and Canada currently has a vulnerable minority government. These are not ideal bargaining positions.)

That all said, what’s going to happen in a month when the next set of futures contracts approaches settlement? Will much have changed?

Maybe more countries do open back up. But even raising global demand to say 85% of baseline wouldn’t quite solve the problem. Pricing won’t recover until demand actually meets reduced production. There’s a chasm to close there right now.
The storage situation isn’t likely to improve. The glut is just too large. All the tankers in the world have a joint capacity of something like 200–250m barrels (‘Unprecedented levels’ of floating storage, but where next for the tanker market?
). But most still have deliveries to do, and the current surplus is quickly filling all available containers. What happened in Oklahoma will happen in more places.

So maybe those June WTI futures do close at $20 or higher. It’s possible. But even that price would be something close to a death knell for many US/CAN producers. And that would still require a lot of things going very right.

[EDIT: Some eight hours after first writing this, June WTI futures are down from 21.36 to 14.87. July’s are also down over $4. The only good news is that May’s numbers are now positive again, if barely. About $3 /bbl right now. We’ll see where they end up when the contracts close out for the month at 2:30pm ET today.]

III. Likely Fallout

I’m going to focus mainly on Alberta/Canada, as it’s the market I understand best.

Some baseline context:

The oil/gas industry here contributes something like $20bn CAD a year to provincial/federal coffers via royalties and taxes. (This doesn’t include income taxes on ~500k workers. More here: What Canada's energy sector paid governments from 2000 to 2018
.)
The high average pay from said jobs circulates everywhere in Alberta. It’s what makes the larger provincial economy sustainable. And high income-tax receipts from Alberta are also central to inter-provincial transfer schemes / federal budget balancing.
Alberta set up a rainy day wealth fund decades ago. But this was severely mismanaged, and only had $18 billion CAD in it as of Dec 2019. (In contrast, Norway’s equivalent had well over $1 trillion USD when this crisis started, despite roughly half the daily production in recent years.)
Alberta’s economy never quite recovered from the 2014 oil crash. Unemployment when I moved here in 2012 was a little over 4% (more or less full employment). Just before COVID started it was 7.2% (and about triple that for young men, who are historically the province’s top earners).

Keeping that in mind, here are the underlying assumptions behind Alberta’s 2020–2021 budget (which had already been revised downward before COVID began):

Translating this:

The province was expecting some $4.3bn CAD in oil royalties (gas is an aside here).
That number was based on ~3.7m bpd output at an average price of $51.20 CAD /bbl and a $.76 USD exchange rate.

(Note: The price for CLS crude is different than for WCS bitumen. And even those are just two rough categories that don’t cover the full range of export grades. But the budget didn’t get more specific, so I won’t here either.)

Anyway, comparing to current numbers:

WCS is currently trading at $4.23 USD / $6 CAD. That’s about 12% of expected.
Our dollar is down to $0.71 USD.
Production is currently ~90% of baseline, and will likely fall to 50-60%.

Oh, and unemployment in Alberta is projected to soon hit 25%.

Oh, and capex investment (which creates jobs and obligates producers to stick around for future decades) is rapidly drying up.

Oh, and many of the production facilities going offline now can only be brought back online at tremendous costs. So the choice is between managing that and eating the ongoing losses as WCS falls towards $0 (or perhaps even to negative levels).

Put another way, Alberta is fucked. Our lack of diversification caught up to us, and even extraordinary intervention by the federal government (likely a necessity) won’t fully curtail the generational damage being inflicted.

While the prognosis may not be quite as dire for Texas or Oklahoma or the Dakotas (I really don’t know), all oil-dependent economies are facing the same general reckoning. Even if demand/prices recover by next year, the damage will have been done.

Hence why I’m sympathetic to protestors who want to re-open the global economy. I don’t think the science checks out. Based on what we know today, letting the curve go unmanaged seems likely to cause more net carnage than a well-considered shutdown. But I can appreciate that this is not enormously comforting to people watching what was already a bad situation descend into something from which there can be no easy return.

Edit/Update January 2021

Coming back here some nine months later to make two notes:

Bloomberg published an interesting backgrounder
 on some (likely legal) trading shenanigans that played into just how aggressive the prices went at settlement in April.
The global lockdowns in the spring lifted much faster than most feared, allowing oil demand to recover to something close to baseline before any kind of catastrophic damage was done to this part of the economy. We should be very thankful for that, while also appropriately alarmed at what would happen if a worse pandemic hit. (Not to trivialize COVID, which is a serious disease brought on by a serious virus, but this was not the big one. And as far as stress tests go, what we learned is that the system can handle huge swings that go on for a month or two. But should we ever be in a position where the world couldn’t restart again that quickly, lots of these markets are going to break in weird ways.)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/eb6hds0xpjvzmo93', 'title': 'Why are oil prices turning negative in the U.S. and abroad?

But for easy math we can use 100m bpd as our baseline for global output, which is fairly close to actual.)\nPer above, these countries have very different cost structures.\nSaudi Arabia has everything easy (trivial extraction, cheapish migrant labor, nearby/domestic refineries, central location for exporting, etc)\nThe US has trickier extraction and much higher labor/regulatory costs\nWhile Russia has better labor costs than the US in general, most of their oil is in remote/frozen Siberia\nAs global demand has dropped, said countries have been uncooperative as far as agreeing on both production cuts and price stabilization\nThe Saudis agreed to a production cut with OPEC+, then started offering heavy discounts immediately thereafter (while they need prices to rebound eventually to make their national budget work, they’re rich enough to be patient)\nRussia has low debt, lots of foreign reserves, and very strong geopolitical incentives to see oil ecosystems in US/Canada collapse\nMost producers in the US will need government intervention to avoid bankruptcy (while breakeven numbers vary by region/type, it seems that sustained WTI pricing under $40/bbl would wipe out a huge chunk of the industry within the year)\n\nIn a world where demand stays 20% below baseline for even a few more months, the US and Canada are in deep trouble. That’s because Russia and the Saudis can pretend at diplomacy by agreeing to concessions that don’t actually change the core dynamic all that much. Say they confer with a few neighbors and bring joint production down from ~30m bpd to ~23m bpd. This would still only be equal to roughly a third of the theoretical oversupply, thus still allowing buyers enormous leverage, thus still keeping prices perilously low.\n\nCan Trump and OPEC+ work something out? It’s possible. Every nation has its pressure points. But given how most in OPEC+ would benefit from permanent damage to US/CAD production capacity, it’s difficult to imagine a scenario in which they don’t distract/delay. (Bear in mind that the US is in an election year, and Canada currently has a vulnerable minority government. These are not ideal bargaining positions.)\n\nThat all said, what’s going to happen in a month when the next set of futures contracts approaches settlement? Will much have changed?\n\nMaybe more countries do open back up. But even raising global demand to say 85% of baseline wouldn’t quite solve the problem. Pricing won’t recover until demand actually meets reduced production. There’s a chasm to close there right now.\nThe storage situation isn’t likely to improve. The glut is just too large. All the tankers in the world have a joint capacity of something like 200–250m barrels (‘Unprecedented levels’ of floating storage, but where next for the tanker market?\n). But most still have deliveries to do, and the current surplus is quickly filling all available containers. What happened in Oklahoma will happen in more places.\n\nSo maybe those June WTI futures do close at $20 or higher. It’s possible. But even that price would be something close to a death knell for many US/CAN producers. And that would still require a lot of things going very right.\n\n[EDIT: Some eight hours after first writing this, June WTI futures are down from 21.36 to 14.87. July’s are also down over $4. The only good news is that May’s numbers are now positive again, if barely. About $3 /bbl right now. We’ll see where they end up when the contracts close out for the month at 2:30pm ET today.]\n\nIII. Likely Fallout\n\nI’m going to focus mainly on Alberta/Canada, as it’s the market I understand best.\n\nSome baseline context:\n\nThe oil/gas industry here contributes something like $20bn CAD a year to provincial/federal coffers via royalties and taxes. (This doesn’t include income taxes on ~500k workers. More here: What Canada's energy sector paid governments from 2000 to 2018\n.)\nThe high average pay from said jobs circulates everywhere in Alberta. It’s what makes the larger provincial economy sustainable. And high income-tax receipts from Alberta are also central to inter-provincial transfer schemes / federal budget balancing.\nAlberta set up a rainy day wealth fund decades ago. But this was severely mismanaged, and only had $18 billion CAD in it as of Dec 2019. (In contrast, Norway’s equivalent had well over $1 trillion USD when this crisis started, despite roughly half the daily production in recent years.)\nAlberta’s economy never quite recovered from the 2014 oil crash. Unemployment when I moved here in 2012 was a little over 4% (more or less full employment). Just before COVID started it was 7.2% (and about triple that for young men, who are historically the province’s top earners).\n\nKeeping that in mind, here are the underlying assumptions behind Alberta’s 2020–2021 budget (which had already been revised downward before COVID began):\n\nTranslating this:\n\nThe province was expecting some $4.3bn CAD in oil royalties (gas is an aside here).\nThat number was based on ~3.7m bpd output at an average price of $51.20 CAD /bbl and a $.76 USD exchange rate.\n\n(Note: The price for CLS crude is different than for WCS bitumen. And even those are just two rough categories that don’t cover the full range of export grades. But the budget didn’t get more specific, so I won’t here either.)\n\nAnyway, comparing to current numbers:\n\nWCS is currently trading at $4.23 USD / $6 CAD. That’s about 12% of expected.\nOur dollar is down to $0.71 USD.\nProduction is currently ~90% of baseline, and will likely fall to 50-60%.\n\nOh, and unemployment in Alberta is projected to soon hit 25%.\n\nOh, and capex investment (which creates jobs and obligates producers to stick around for future decades) is rapidly drying up.\n\nOh, and many of the production facilities going offline now can only be brought back online at tremendous costs. So the choice is between managing that and eating the ongoing losses as WCS falls towards $0 (or perhaps even to negative levels).\n\nPut another way, Alberta is fucked. Our lack of diversification caught up to us, and even extraordinary intervention by the federal government (likely a necessity) won’t fully curtail the generational damage being inflicted.\n\nWhile the prognosis may not be quite as dire for Texas or Oklahoma or the Dakotas (I really don’t know), all oil-dependent economies are facing the same general reckoning. Even if demand/prices recover by next year, the damage will have been done.\n\nHence why I’m sympathetic to protestors who want to re-open the global economy. I don’t think the science checks out. Based on what we know today, letting the curve go unmanaged seems likely to cause more net carnage than a well-considered shutdown. But I can appreciate that this is not enormously comforting to people watching what was already a bad situation descend into something from which there can be no easy return.\n\nEdit/Update January 2021\n\nComing back here some nine months later to make two notes:\n\nBloomberg published an interesting backgrounder\n on some (likely legal) trading shenanigans that played into just how aggressive the prices went at settlement in April.\nThe global lockdowns in the spring lifted much faster than most feared, allowing oil demand to recover to something close to baseline before any kind of catastrophic damage was done to this part of the economy. We should be very thankful for that, while also appropriately alarmed at what would happen if a worse pandemic hit. (Not to trivialize COVID, which is a serious disease brought on by a serious virus, but this was not the big one. And as far as stress tests go, what we learned is that the system can handle huge swings that go on for a month or two. But should we ever be in a position where the world couldn’t restart again that quickly, lots of these markets are going to break in weird ways.)"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.7506

Jay Bazzinotti,Updated 1y,What factors made USA to become the biggest oil consumer in the world?,"This is not a bad question.

The US became an voracious oil consumer because of many things:

While “kerosene” was the first known oil byproduct and was discovered in Persia (now Iran) by Ravi in 935 BC, it was a Canadian geologist, Abraham Gesner, who first demonstrated man-made kerosene from petroleum in 1846 and named it “kerosene” which was effective as a lamp oil.

Canadian Abraham Gesner demonstrates the distillation of oil into kerosene on Prince Edward Island for the first time (in modern times) in 1846.

Gesner calls the oily, flammable liquid “kerosene” and sees it as a cheap replacement for whale oil. In America, about the same time, businessman Samuel Keir complains about a black oily substance flowing into his salt mines. In those days, the salt industry was one of America’s biggest industries. (Salt was so important in was dubbed “The Fifth Element” after Air, Water, Fire and Earth.) At first he pumps it into a nearby canal where it floats on the water and kills all the life nearby, but it mysteriously catches fire. He hires a chemist, Robert Cheeseboro who develops oil into a “patent medicine” but it doesn’t catch on. Later, he converts it into a jelly he calls “Vaseline”. It sells well. Kier discovers that he can convert the oil into kerosene using Gesner’s techniques. Kier becomes known as the “Father of the American Petroleum Industry”.

1) Oil was discovered here in Titusville by Drake in 1858 who wanted kerosene for lighting. Lighting has always been a big driver of technology

Drake, in an attempt to find oil to make kerosene, drills the first well in Pennsylvania, 1858, discovers gasoline in the process.

2) The US is enormous, had lots of farms and farm equipment. The “One Lung” engine was invented long before cars. This simple machine transformed the agricultural industry in America.

One lung engines were miracle machines that could do the work of many farmhands and would run all day on one gallon of gas. They were hooked up to everything from saw mills to ice cream makers and were made until 1940.

3) While the internal combustion engine, rechargeable battery and engine components were revolutionized and invented in Europe, and Europe had better roads, they also had a much worse regulatory environment. Autos were crippled in England because the law stated a man with a flag had to walk in front of the car. It crippled innovation and production. In the US, the sky was the limit.

4) Americans were desperately seeking solutions for horses and horse shit everywhere. At first it seemed that the steam car, invented by the Stanley Brothers with locomobile (at least, perfected for practicality, Thomas Blanchard had a steam car as early as 1825 and Trethewick has a steam bus in England as early as 1805) seemed to be the way to go, but steam took a long time to build up and steam cars froze in the winter. FYI: Stanley Steamer was from Boston and first dedicated police car in America was in Boston, a Stanley. Also, we get the word “chauffeur” from the man who fired up the steam car.

The Stanley Steamer was by far the best car in the entire world in the early 1900s. It could drive at 140MPH, got the equivalent of 15 mpg and was dead silent in operation. But the Stanleys were abrasive and the cars cost 10 times what Ford was charging for a Model T. The electric starter invented by Cadillac in 1912 spelled doom for the steam industry as steamers took 20 minutes or more to start.

5) In 1900 there were fewer than a few hundred gas cars in the entire US; by 1908 there were 100,000 in NYC alone. The explosion of the car industry destroyed the horse industry and put people on the hunt for oil.

6) When first invented, ICE engine used ligroin, not gasoline for the fuel. Ligroin was an industrial solvent that burned; some people tried to use charcoal dust (an idea that was resurrected by the Germans in WW2 to fuel jet aircraft) and at the time, gasoline was just a nuisance waste product that was burned off in pits or used as dry cleaning solvent. Laundry was a dangerous job back in the day, which is why the Chinese went into it: facing incredible racial intolerance, the only place they could find work was in gasoline laundries, the most dangerous job in urban environments. As an aside, the British Army still washed it’s uniforms in gasoline in WW2. When it was discovered that gasoline was better than kerosene or ligroin for engines, it was a major breakthrough - and the Americans were awash in waste gasoline

7) When driving took off there was enormous competition between farmers and driving enthusiasts for gasoline. The price was the equivalent then of about 7.50 a gallon today. Cars got about 10 MPG. The effective price of gasoline was about 20 - 25 dollars a gallon today.

8) In 1903, Henry Ford defeated the “Selden Patent” in court where one man, Selden, was holding the auto industry hostage to licensing fees on the specious argument that he held the patent for the internal combustion engine. He lost and the competitive auto industry took off.

Possibly the first purpose-built gas station in America in St Louis in 1913. Gas was hand-pumped up to a measuring device then flowed into the car. (Note the multiple spare tires on the back of the car. Drivers could expect a flat, on average, every fifty to a hundred miles.)

9) In 1913, American company Standard Oil invented the process of “cracking” that made it possible for a lot of gasoline to be made quickly and cheaply. The oldest refinery in America, Pioneer Oil, is located in California as a museum and last worked in 1936.

Oldest refinery in the world, started in Modesto, CA in 1880 and in operation until 1936, called Pioneer Oil Refinery. The ability to crack oil into gasoline developed in 1913 made gas prices fall (in today’s dollars) from 7.50 a gallon in 1913 to about 1.50 a gallon by the mid-1920s. Driving was in everyone’s grasp at those prices.

10) Henry Ford put the automobile into the hands of average people at prices as low as 250 - 500 dollars a car. Because of his, and Ransom E Olds’ efforts in mass production, the price of a car went way, way down. In other countries, cars remained luxury vehicles and works of mobile art, way out of the possible ownership of the average person.

Ford’s first vertical mass production auto manufacturing plant in the world, in Cambridge, MA. It produced more cars for 10 years than all of Detroit combined.

11) Holt invented the Caterpillar tractor and Ford, under the Fordson name, capitalized on it by making a better tractor. The tractor became one of the biggest selling machines in the agricultural world and transformed agriculture as much as the one-lung engine.

The Holt Caterpillar Tractor revolutionized farming and road building. Caterpillar Tractor Company went bankrupt in the 1920s but combined with a competitor and the Caterpillar name was saved.

12) Because of America’s enormous size, the automobile, truck and tractor became popular and pushed up the demand for gasoline and oil products.

Henry Ford perfected the agricultural tractor. In the first year of production, England purchased 100,000 tractors alone making it the most common and practical tractor in the world. Some of these tractors still operate today after 110 years.

13) When Fritz Haber discovered the nitrogen fertilizer process, it was also discovered that oil could be used to render fertilizer. America was all farmland in those days, and the sudden introduction of the Haber Process required enormous quantities of oil.

Fritz Haber won a Nobel for developing the nitrogen fertilizer process. He is the most celebrated and hated man in history because he also invented poison gas for the Germans in WW1. His wife shot herself to death in protest.

14) Bituminous asphalt was patented in Boston in 1901 by the Warren Brothers; America had literally millions of miles of road demanding paving and the waste product of oil after refining was “tar”, used with aggregate to make asphalt. The demand for asphalt exploded exponentially after Dwight Eisenhower lead a convoy of military vehicles across the US in 1919 showing how bad the roads were.

Lt Col Dwight D. Eisenhower was one of the leaders of the Motor Transport Convoy sent across the US to judge US roads in 1919, which were abysmal. It lead to the development of the Lincoln Highway which wasn’t completed until 1935, the first coast-to-coast highway in America.

The sheer size of the US, coupled with an entrepreneurial spirit and friendly regulatory environment and matched with mass production made it inevitable that the US would lead the world in oil production and usage.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/irjzem9v13dofw5k', 'title': 'What factors made USA to become the biggest oil consumer in the world?', 'score': {'original': 0.60666666666667, 'ai': 0.39333333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This is not a bad question.\n\nThe US became an voracious oil consumer because of many things:\n\nWhile “kerosene” was the first known oil byproduct and was discovered in Persia (now Iran) by Ravi in 935 BC, it was a Canadian geologist, Abraham Gesner, who first demonstrated man-made kerosene from petroleum in 1846 and named it “kerosene” which was effective as a lamp oil.\n\nCanadian Abraham Gesner demonstrates the distillation of oil into kerosene on Prince Edward Island for the first time (in modern times) in 1846.\n\nGesner calls the oily, flammable liquid “kerosene” and sees it as a cheap replacement for whale oil.

Eisenhower was one of the leaders of the Motor Transport Convoy sent across the US to judge US roads in 1919, which were abysmal. It lead to the development of the Lincoln Highway which wasn’t completed until 1935, the first coast-to-coast highway in America.\n\nThe sheer size of the US, coupled with an entrepreneurial spirit and friendly regulatory environment and matched with mass production made it inevitable that the US would lead the world in oil production and usage.', 'result': {'fake': 0.7613, 'real': 0.2387}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 15, 'credits': 1976226, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'This is not a bad question.\n\nThe US became an voracious oil consumer because of many things:\n\nWhile “kerosene” was the first known oil byproduct and was discovered in Persia (now Iran) by Ravi in 935 BC, it was a Canadian geologist, Abraham Gesner, who first demonstrated man-made kerosene from petroleum in 1846 and named it “kerosene” which was effective as a lamp oil.\n\nCanadian Abraham Gesner demonstrates the distillation of oil into kerosene on Prince Edward Island for the first time (in modern times) in 1846.\n\nGesner calls the oily, flammable liquid “kerosene” and sees it as a cheap replacement for whale oil. In America, about the same time, businessman Samuel Keir complains about a black oily substance flowing into his salt mines. In those days, the salt industry was one of America’s biggest industries. (Salt was so important in was dubbed “The Fifth Element” after Air, Water, Fire and Earth.) At first he pumps it into a nearby canal where it floats on the water and kills all the life nearby, but it mysteriously catches fire. He hires a chemist, Robert Cheeseboro who develops oil into a “patent medicine” but it doesn’t catch on. Later, he converts it into a jelly he calls “Vaseline”. It sells well. Kier discovers that he can convert the oil into kerosene using Gesner’s techniques. Kier becomes known as the “Father of the American Petroleum Industry”.\n\n1) Oil was discovered here in Titusville by Drake in 1858 who wanted kerosene for lighting. Lighting has always been a big driver of technology\n\nDrake, in an attempt to find oil to make kerosene, drills the first well in Pennsylvania, 1858, discovers gasoline in the process.\n\n2) The US is enormous, had lots of farms and farm equipment. The “One Lung” engine was invented long before cars. This simple machine transformed the agricultural industry in America.\n\nOne lung engines were miracle machines that could do the work of many farmhands and would run all day on one gallon of gas. They were hooked up to everything from saw mills to ice cream makers and were made until 1940.\n\n3) While the internal combustion engine, rechargeable battery and engine components were revolutionized and invented in Europe, and Europe had better roads, they also had a much worse regulatory environment. Autos were crippled in England because the law stated a man with a flag had to walk in front of the car. It crippled innovation and production. In the US, the sky was the limit.\n\n4) Americans were desperately seeking solutions for horses and horse shit everywhere. At first it seemed that the steam car, invented by the Stanley Brothers with locomobile (at least, perfected for practicality, Thomas Blanchard had a steam car as early as 1825 and Trethewick has a steam bus in England as early as 1805) seemed to be the way to go, but steam took a long time to build up and steam cars froze in the winter. FYI: Stanley Steamer was from Boston and first dedicated police car in America was in Boston, a Stanley. Also, we get the word “chauffeur” from the man who fired up the steam car.\n\nThe Stanley Steamer was by far the best car in the entire world in the early 1900s. It could drive at 140MPH, got the equivalent of 15 mpg and was dead silent in operation. But the Stanleys were abrasive and the cars cost 10 times what Ford was charging for a Model T. The electric starter invented by Cadillac in 1912 spelled doom for the steam industry as steamers took 20 minutes or more to start.\n\n5) In 1900 there were fewer than a few hundred gas cars in the entire US; by 1908 there were 100,000 in NYC alone. The explosion of the car industry destroyed the horse industry and put people on the hunt for oil.\n\n6) When first invented, ICE engine used ligroin, not gasoline for the fuel. Ligroin was an industrial solvent that burned; some people tried to use charcoal dust (an idea that was resurrected by the Germans in WW2 to fuel jet aircraft) and at the time, gasoline was just a nuisance waste product that was burned off in pits or used as dry cleaning solvent. Laundry was a dangerous job back in the day, which is why the Chinese went into it: facing incredible racial intolerance, the only place they could find work was in gasoline laundries, the most dangerous job in urban environments. As an aside, the British Army still washed it’s uniforms in gasoline in WW2. When it was discovered that gasoline was better than kerosene or ligroin for engines, it was a major breakthrough - and the Americans were awash in waste gasoline\n\n7) When driving took off there was enormous competition between farmers and driving enthusiasts for gasoline. The price was the equivalent then of about 7.50 a gallon today. Cars got about 10 MPG. The effective price of gasoline was about 20 - 25 dollars a gallon today.\n\n8) In 1903, Henry Ford defeated the “Selden Patent” in court where one man, Selden, was holding the auto industry hostage to licensing fees on the specious argument that he held the patent for the internal combustion engine. He lost and the competitive auto industry took off.\n\nPossibly the first purpose-built gas station in America in St Louis in 1913.

Ron Rule,Updated 1y,How do rich people use economic recessions to their advantage?,"The same way everyone else does — by being smart enough to recognize a bubble and staying out of it until it pops.

The best time to buy is when everything is on sale. You don’t have to be rich to do this. Take the housing boom we are seeing right now. All of these people offering $100k over asking, putting 50%+ down, driving housing prices up across the country. Most of them first time home buyers in their 20’s and 30’s. Why?

It’s the convergence of events. A lot of these buyers are the people who bought Bitcoin at under $15k. They are willing to overpay for the house they want because crypto shot up, companies are more work-from-home friendly, and 5G and Starlink mean even rural areas can get good internet. Everything lined up to where they could do that, and because the rise of crypto was a windfall, they didn’t miss the cash. They’re probably feeling pretty smart right now.

But they aren’t the smart ones. The smart ones are the ones who sold to them, or the ones cashed out their Bitcoin over $50k and didn’t buy a house.

The mistake most people make in a bubble is thinking they’re going to miss out, or that prices will go up forever and they’ll never be able to afford it if they don’t act now.

“It’s different this time!” they’ll say.

It isn’t. A bubble is a bubble. And when it pops, the people who waited will be able to buy two or three houses for what people are asking for one right now. Whenever there is a surge, there will always be a correction/recession. A correction doesn’t necessarily mean a ”crash” — it could just be a return to pre-surge levels and then a long period of no or slow growth. But it always happens.

You don’t need to be rich to win in a recession. You just have to recognize it for what it is. Once you recognize that you’re in a bubble, either be the person selling the thing everyone wants instead of one of the people trying to buy it, or just be patient.

The biggest difference between the rich and the poor isn’t intelligence or opportunity. It’s impulse control. If you have cash now, wait. If you don’t, start saving. Your opportunity is coming.

Ray Loewe,Updated 4y,Has a country ever imposed a serious embargo on the United States that ended up hurting the US economy?,"Has a country ever imposed a serious embargo on the United States that ended up hurting the US economy?

There is an example of an embargo that wasn’t specifically targeted to the United States, but mainly to it.

Back when I was a kid, the Israelis and their Arab neighbors went to war in October, 1973. This became known as the Yom Kippur War in the western world. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) put in place an embargo on all countries that militarily supported Israel during the war. There was a 5% reduction in oil shipments to these countries every month until Israel withdrew to the 1967 borders. As the United States was, and remains to this date, Israel’s biggest supporter internationally, the embargo was primarily aimed at us.

At this time the U.S. was energy dependent on oil from the Middle East, which was mainly supplied from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and even from Venezuela from South America. It didn’t take long for the effects of the embargo to take hold and severely affect American society. The price of oil quickly spiked by over 70%, which in turn led to a spike in gas prices. By December the price of oil had quadrupled. The reduction in oil shipments led to a shortage of oil available for gasoline production, which in turn led to shortages. Gas lines, price gouging and outages became common, and rationing was introduced for the first time since World War 2. I remember people waiting in line sometimes from dawn to dusk waiting for gas, and that was on top of an odd-even rationing system based on your license plate.

Secretary of State Henry Kissenger was able to get OPEC to end the embargo by getting Israel and Syria to disengage each other militarily in March, 1974. However, even though the embargo was officially lifted and oil again began to flow to the U.S. from OPEC, they again cut production several more times in the 1970’s. By 1980, the price of oil was 10 times what it had been prior to the start of the embargo. Pre-embargo, the cost of oil was around $3 a barrel, which was $25.97 when adjusted for inflation today. Post-embargo it rose to $46.35 a barrel. Compare that to the cost per barrel as of this writing (1/12/2020) of only $58.91 U.S.

The effect of the oil embargo on the U.S. economy was devastating, and is widely considered as the cause of the 1973–1975 economic recession in the U.S. During the recession, the U.S. suffered from stagflation, where prices remain high despite falling demand for goods and services. President Nixon put into place wage-price controls, which forced companies to keep wages high, so layoffs resulted in the workplace. With more people out of work as a result, the cycle continued where people couldn’t afford higher prices with no jobs to play for them.

As a result of the embargo and resulting recession, people were forced to change their behaviors and habits. Conservation measures were introduced, including stricter vehicle milage guidelines, speed limit reductions to 55 MPH nationally on highways, and new production methods and energy source development.

A good end result of all of this is that presently, even though we still do import oil from OPEC countries, the United States is actually “energy independent”. which means the country is capable of producing all the energy it needs on a daily basis on it own without outside assistance.

Rahul Sharma,3y,India is going to offer land to companies exiting China. Will this move be productive enough?,"Before I start the answer, let me mention that the labour cost in Indis is almost half of what it is in China. So it's a misconception that China has cheap labour.

Now, let me first show you the reason behind the news of land being offered-

Mumbai is spread in 60000 hectares. So area equal to the size of 8 times of Mumbai is being identified. This is going to be something big, if it really turns to reality. Something massive it sounds like, though there hasn't been anything official yet.

However it is clear that the government has taken a few very good and proactive steps to lure the investors.

The biggest problem that a company faces to shift the base is finding a land and they generally have to do it on their own which involves time and huge cost. This time our government is doing this for them. It's a good message for them, I am assuming its happening.

However a land is not all it takes to attract investors. It takes a lot more.

As per a survey 56 big companies left China between April 2018 to August 2019 and only 3 of them shifted to India, 26 to Vietnam, 11 to Tailwan and 8 to Thailand. That's a sign that we are not doing enough to attract them.

Let's analyze what did we miss-

Poor FDI so far. FDI directly impacts External Inverster Condidence. India pulls merely 0.6 percent of GDP as FDI which is very low. Taiwan has it four times higher at 2.4% of their GDP. Which clearly shows that investors are more comfortable investing there.This also results in India being called sleeping Giant.
Ease of doing business. On papers India has shown improvement however ground reality is different and investers know it. In Vietram, there is a single point of contact who takes care of everything on behalf of government. In India, this is a big task to do.
Tax incentives for foreign companies. This needs to be looked at. India's tax structures and interference by tax inspectors is not in the favour of investors.
Corporate tax cut is a wonderful action taken but a little late and such more steps are needed.
Currently transportation within the country is majorly dependent on road transport which is expensive and time consuming. We need to build more ports and have better rail connectivity. This is important to keep the cost of end product low. Entire ecosystem is based on this.
Survey from McKinsey & company has revealed that number of graduates which support manufacturing which includes technology, mathematics and engineering is only 20 per 1000 in India while they are 34 per thousand in China. Quality education and vocational training needs to be focused to provide skilled labour.

There are a lot of other factors however these few are the top priority and the good news is that government is working towards all of them.

If the news is true, which I am highly optimistic about, this is going to change the entire game.

I personally see the government catching the opportunity of new industrial revolution. We had missed the industrial revolution in 1990 and China took the benefits, it's our turn now. I hope government doesn't miss it this time.

We need to support government to come out of Corona so that above progress can happen.

Ashok Dhamija,Updated 4y,How will Pakistan's retaliatory measures after revocation of Article 370 affect India's economy?,"It is happening for the first time that India is acting and Pakistan is reacting. Usually, it is the opposite, i.e., Pakistan acts and India reacts. So, that way, I am happy with Pakistan’s retaliation since it shows that India has started taking proactive action.

In any case, Pakistan’s retaliatory measures after revocation of Article 370 and Article 35A will not have any substantial adverse impact on India’s economy. It is like a drop in the ocean or something similar.

In order to explain that, let us first see what retaliatory actions have been taken by Pakistan:

Suspension of all bilateral trade.
Downgrading the diplomatic relations by sending the Indian Ambassador (High Commissioner) back to India and deciding not to send its own Ambassador-designate to India.
Suspension of Samjhauta Express and Thar Express trains that connect India and Pakistan.
Suspension of Delhi-Lahore Bus service.
Closing of (some parts of) Pakistani air-space for Indian flights.
Not allowing screening of Bollywood movies.

Firstly, please appreciate that most of these steps taken by Pakistan are not related to economy. Suspension of bus service or two train services or downgrading diplomatic relations will not have any impact on Indian economy, whatsoever. These relates mainly to cultural relations and not economy.

Closing of some parts of Pakistani air space for Indian flights may result into loss of a few crores for Air India, since some of its flights will have to take longer route for its international flights going to Europe, Middle-East, US, etc. But, when Air India already has about ₹ 53,000 crore loss or may be more, loss of a few crores more will not affect it.

Not allowing screening of Bollywood movies will not make much difference to Bollywood film-makers, since even right now, they don’t earn much from Pakistan territory. A lot of pirated Hindi movies are shown there.

Let me now come to the first step of suspending the bilateral trade, which is related to the economy directly.

Please note that there is hardly any bilateral trade between India and Pakistan. Previously, there used to be some trade between the two countries. While India had accorded MFN status (Most Favoured Nation) to Pakistan for several years, but Pakistan had not reciprocated it.

But, after the Pulwama attack, India withdrew the MFN status accorded to Pakistan. After this, India imposed 200% import duty on imports from Pakistan. Due to this, the bilateral trade between the two countries had already taken a severe hit.

Just to give an idea
, in the first quarter of 2019-20, India’s exports to Pakistan were $452.5 million and imports were $7.13 million. In 2018-19 full year, total exports to Pakistan were $2.06 billion, while imports were $495 million.

So, you can see that imports from Pakistan have almost come to naught, while exports to Pakistan have also reduced significantly.

In contrast, India-China bilateral trade in 2017-18 was about $ 90 billion.

As per media reports, suspension of bilateral trade by Pakistan is likely to hit Pakistan itself. Its impact on India will be comparatively much less.

Media reports suggest that India’s major items of export to Pakistan are organic chemicals, cotton, plastics and dyes, while imports are fruit and edible nuts, and mineral fuels. The goods that India exports to Pakistan have a ready market in South Asia and Middle East which will enable India to divert such exports immediately without much cost.

Thus, India is not likely to be impacted by such suspension on bilateral trade since most of the exports to Pakistan can easily be diverted to other ready market. And, as far as imports are concerned, in first quarter of 2019-20, India imported just about $7 million (yes, only million) worth of goods.

Therefore, suspension of bilateral trade with Pakistan is of no meaning to India. It is like a rhetoric for the internal consumption of Pakistan to show that something is being done after revocation of Article 370 by Indian Government.

In view of what I have mentioned above, the retaliatory measures announced by Pakistan will not have any substantial impact on Indian economy. India has a colossal economy in comparison to the measure announced. The adverse impact will be like a drop in the ocean.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/e62tu3ml7i1dfryp', 'title': ""How will Pakistan's retaliatory measures after revocation of Article 370 affect India's economy?"", 'score': {'original': 0.6487, 'ai': 0.3513}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It is happening for the first time that India is acting and Pakistan is reacting.

So, that way, I am happy with Pakistan’s retaliation since it shows that India has started taking proactive action.\n\nIn any case, Pakistan’s retaliatory measures after revocation of Article 370 and Article 35A will not have any substantial adverse impact on India’s economy. It is like a drop in the ocean or something similar.\n\nIn order to explain that, let us first see what retaliatory actions have been taken by Pakistan:\n\nSuspension of all bilateral trade.\nDowngrading the diplomatic relations by sending the Indian Ambassador (High Commissioner) back to India and deciding not to send its own Ambassador-designate to India.\nSuspension of Samjhauta Express and Thar Express trains that connect India and Pakistan.\nSuspension of Delhi-Lahore Bus service.\nClosing of (some parts of) Pakistani air-space for Indian flights.\nNot allowing screening of Bollywood movies.\n\nFirstly, please appreciate that most of these steps taken by Pakistan are not related to economy. Suspension of bus service or two train services or downgrading diplomatic relations will not have any impact on Indian economy, whatsoever. These relates mainly to cultural relations and not economy.\n\nClosing of some parts of Pakistani air space for Indian flights may result into loss of a few crores for Air India, since some of its flights will have to take longer route for its international flights going to Europe, Middle-East, US, etc. But, when Air India already has about ₹ 53,000 crore loss or may be more, loss of a few crores more will not affect it.\n\nNot allowing screening of Bollywood movies will not make much difference to Bollywood film-makers, since even right now, they don’t earn much from Pakistan territory. A lot of pirated Hindi movies are shown there.\n\nLet me now come to the first step of suspending the bilateral trade, which is related to the economy directly.\n\nPlease note that there is hardly any bilateral trade between India and Pakistan. Previously, there used to be some trade between the two countries. While India had accorded MFN status (Most Favoured Nation) to Pakistan for several years, but Pakistan had not reciprocated it.\n\nBut, after the Pulwama attack, India withdrew the MFN status accorded to Pakistan. After this, India imposed 200% import duty on imports from Pakistan. Due to this, the bilateral trade between the two countries had already taken a severe hit.\n\nJust to give an idea\n, in the first quarter of 2019-20, India’s exports to Pakistan were $452.5 million and imports were $7.13 million. In 2018-19 full year, total exports to Pakistan were $2.06 billion, while imports were $495 million.\n\nSo, you can see that imports from Pakistan have almost come to naught, while exports to Pakistan have also reduced significantly.\n\nIn contrast, India-China bilateral trade in 2017-18 was about $ 90 billion.\n\nAs per media reports, suspension of bilateral trade by Pakistan is likely to hit Pakistan itself. Its impact on India will be comparatively much less.\n\nMedia reports suggest that India’s major items of export to Pakistan are organic chemicals, cotton, plastics and dyes, while imports are fruit and edible nuts, and mineral fuels. The goods that India exports to Pakistan have a ready market in South Asia and Middle East which will enable India to divert such exports immediately without much cost.\n\nThus, India is not likely to be impacted by such suspension on bilateral trade since most of the exports to Pakistan can easily be diverted to other ready market. And, as far as imports are concerned, in first quarter of 2019-20, India imported just about $7 million (yes, only million) worth of goods.\n\nTherefore, suspension of bilateral trade with Pakistan is of no meaning to India. It is like a rhetoric for the internal consumption of Pakistan to show that something is being done after revocation of Article 370 by Indian Government.\n\nIn view of what I have mentioned above, the retaliatory measures announced by Pakistan will not have any substantial impact on Indian economy. India has a colossal economy in comparison to the measure announced. The adverse impact will be like a drop in the ocean.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.6487
Bala Senthil Kumar,1y,How can India take infinite advantage of the current Sri Lanka economic crisis?,"It is one of Sri Lanka’s own making.

It would help if we just watched as Sri Lankans came to their own conclusions about their country, their choices, and their goals.

A much touted peaceful country, which boasts of a higher human development index than India, and by every boasts, claims superiority over most things Indian, should be able to stand up on its own. But we know it cannot.

It hasn’t yet bottomed out, but it is getting there. Scratch is a good place to start any reform from.

India should just ensure there is no massive refugee influx from Sri Lanka, because that would not just be the inevitable fallout, it would be the most convenient reason for some of them to escape from their own failures.

That said, it should not be too hard to stabilise a small economy like Sri Lanka’s. Their fundamentals are not sound at the moment, and it will take some repair, but the elephant in the room is revenue. Where is Sri Lanka going to generate revenue from? Tourism is at an all time low, and it was their prime source.

When a country imports almost everything, it becomes weak and dependent. If it cannot earn enough foreign capital to purchase, it has to hawk things that future generations will have to pay for. Right now, the ruling class in Sri Lanka is a bunch of incompetent nincompoops, that thought China was the panacea for their problems, and they borrowed recklessly.

China would love to see India bleed, then make a re entry, pay the usual bribes, and get their pound of flesh, which is already owed to it.

So, that leaves India with a simple choice, albeit a tough one. India should ask Sri Lanka to open up an Exclusive Economic Zone, including port access, for India - in exchange for a bailout package. As part of this settlement, India should also ask for first right of refusal on any project, be it infrastructure, or power or development.

India should also help install a government or group of leaders that is respectful of India’s regional concerns, and not do anything provocative, especially using China as leverage.

No gifts, only lines of credit. As much as possible, only material aid, not money. It would be wonderful to see Sri Lanka offer China a ship load of Indian rice instead of money to settle a loan.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a9dqsljteyo5ivwg', 'title': 'How can India take infinite advantage of the current Sri Lanka economic crisis?', 'score': {'original': 0.9952, 'ai': 0.0048}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It is one of Sri Lanka’s own making.\n\nIt would help if we just watched as Sri Lankans came to their own conclusions about their country, their choices, and their goals.\n\nA much touted peaceful country, which boasts of a higher human development index than India, and by every boasts, claims superiority over most things Indian, should be able to stand up on its own.

Nathan Kimberlin,Updated 5y,What would happen if everybody in this world would be a millionaire?,"You should ask Zimbabwe. Their government printed money in response to poor economic output. This caused hyper inflation. At its peak - inflation reached 79.6Billion%:

Zimbabwe had a 100 trillion dollar bill in their currency. In 2008, this was equivalent to approx $3.75 USD:

Homeless people had signs like this:

People had to carry huge loads of cash to make small purchases:

In the ’80s the Zimbabwe dollar was equivalent to the US dollar. Imagine you had saved $10,000 in your bank account. This money became about as valuable as pocket lint after hyper inflation.

The lesson here - printing money does not make your economy any more prosperous. Money only has a relative form of value. If everyone is a millionaire, (or trillionaire in Zimbabwe’s case) it simply costs more to purchase goods. The easier money is to obtain, the less valuable it is.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lgrpnc0351hwyis7', 'title': 'What would happen if everybody in this world would be a millionaire?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'You should ask Zimbabwe.
