Shweta Jha,3y,What is the best thing you came across on the internet today?,"A man posted a picture wearing red lipstick in support of his 54 y/o mother.

‚ÄúMy mother, a woman of 54 years, got slut-shamed by some of our nearest relatives for wearing red lipstick at a family get-together. So yesterday, I sent all of them this picture with a ‚ÄòGood morning. Get well soon.‚Äô message,‚Äù he wrote.

The way he stood up is incredible. Just showing pseudo-feminism on social media won't help. It's time to wake up. This guy proved that change begins at home.

Sarang Wadhai,3y,What is a life hack that you think everybody should know?,"After reading so many wonderful answers to this question, I feel that I should also contribute too‚Ä¶:)

In your life, you will definitely encounter a beggar when a traffic light hits a car window.

All along, in this situation, my mind is always confused about what to do?

Should I donate? or ignore? Is this person worth it? Or am I encouraging India's begging tradition?

But in the end, I got this trick from my manager (she is indeed a cool person).

Whenever beggar approached our car, she asked, suddenly taking the window down..

‚ÄúChalo, mera hotel hai aage! Bartan maanzane ka kam karoge kya?‚Äù

""Let's go to my hotel nearby, will you scavenging utensils for me?""

Surprisingly, I witnessed 8 out of 10 beggars will not reply and just move away!

She always provides money to the other two beggars in recognition of their willingness to work and get a reply.

‚Äúmujhe aasha hai ki, aapko jaldhi kaam mil jaega‚Äù.

""I hope you can find a job as soon as possible.""

Her tricks have eliminated my great confusion, and since then I have been following her!.

Rutvik Parekh,8y,What are some things that Amazon does that would surprise people?,"I always ordered from Flipkart.

Until this one day , I installed the Amazon app just for trying.
So a few days after I installed the app,was just checking the offers and deals on the app where I got to know about the Amazon Treasure Hunt contest(for people who don't know,its an offer where they provide a clue whose answer is a product and that product's price is ‚Çπ 1)

They uploaded a new clue every 15 mins and you have to think at the speed of light as the stock finishes in 15-30 seconds.I was addicted to this contest and the whole day I was trying to get something at ‚Çπ 1.That moment finally came when I ordered a Breaking Bad DVD set for just ‚Çπ 1 which also had a DIARY and a T SHIRT included whose actual price was around ‚Çπ 5000 :)

‚Äã


‚Äã

The order was delivered the next day only ,but when I opened the package I was surprised that DIARY N T SHIRT were not included.
Being an ardent follower of Breaking Bad, I was very disappointed that the T SHIRT was missing
So I called the customer service and told them about the problem.The lady was very kind and said that they will compensate for it by giving me a gift card of ‚Çπ 300 and hung up and I received it within 1 hour :)

‚Äã

The next thing I did was check out the Breaking Bad T shirts on Amazon.And again I was disappointed to find that all T shirts cost more than ‚Çπ 500.So
 I emailed them once more saying that you compensated very less for the missing items.So
 this was what I received




‚Äã
I received ‚Çπ 600 more.And this was within 5 minutes of writing my email.I was astonished to see such a rapid and considerate action.

I was the happiest person that day .
It goes to show how Amazon treats its customers, not just a source of earning money but with gratitude and respect.They didn't need to do that as the product was sold for just ‚Çπ 1 and they could have said that you have got enough for the price you paid but they didn't :)

Sorry Flipkart, you lost a loyal customer that day ;-)

Came to hall like a boss and started watching breaking bad. We all know the intensity of the series and I got immersed in it.

Barun Mohanty,5y,What are the things that people are collectively doing wrong?,"If your age is between 20‚Äì35, you must read this.

Yesterday, someone messaged me ‚ÄúHi Barun, I want to ask you something‚Äù.

‚ÄúYes! Go ahead and ask.‚Äù I replied.

Barun, can you give me some tips?

What kind of tips?

I want to make money on stock market.

I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recommend stocks but I have an educational program, which might help you‚Äù.

Then he replied ‚ÄúI want just a single tip, then if I make money, I will enroll in your course.‚Äù

I asked a simple question ‚ÄúWhat kind of laptop you have?‚Äù

I have a Macbook, he said.

When did you buy that?

2 years ago when I was in first year.

How much did it cost at that time?

Around 80 thousand, he replied.

Now, if you sell that, how much will you get? I asked.

He replied 40‚Äì50k I guess.

Then I said, the price of your laptop is reducing, are you not worried?

He didn‚Äôt say anything.

See, this is what people are doing wrong. Mainly the young generation.

We are ready to go for a dinner which might cost 3000.

We can drink a coffee worth 200.

We can wear shoes worth 7000.

But, we can‚Äôt learn something which will make us more money for a price.

And what‚Äôs wrong?

You buy a laptop worth 50k.

We both know, the price will become half within a year.

Your 7000 rupees shoes will be worthless after 1 year.

But,

We can‚Äôt gain some knowledge and experience investing a little money.

This is what we are doing wrong.

What I personally think is experience the most valuable thing.

If a self made billionaire will be ready to share his whole experience in exchange of all my money, I will go for it.

Because, there I will learn ‚ÄúHow to be a billionaire‚Äù.

And after learning I can repeat the process as many times as I can.

But, what I see is:

Our youth is impatient.

They want to invest money on liabilities rather than assets.

They can have a hair cut on every 15 days worth 300 rupees but can‚Äôt buy a book and learn a skill spending same amount of money.

And wise people will never give you for free.

Today, the medium of exchange is money.

Yes, the man in the green circle - the one and only person who saved hundreds of people from a train accident. The incident took place on 15/06/2018 at around 5:30 PM. The Ambassa to Agartala rail track was damaged due to natural causes and nobody knew about this except for this guy. He waited for the train to be in sight for over 2 hours at the location of derailment. When the train arrived, he jumped on the track and started waving his towel, without a thought about his little daughter. The train pilot, on seeing the man waving a towel, sensed danger ahead and halted the train.

Indeed, a great salute to this man. His name is SWAPAN DEBBARMA (a resident of Mungiakami area) and standing besides him is the loco-pilot.

Tuesday Cross,Updated 4y,What's the scariest thing (outside of the internet) you've experienced?,"‚ÄúSo, you don‚Äôt talk much?‚Äù I casually asked my Uber driver, an American man in his mid 20s.

He shook his head.

‚ÄúOh, okay.‚Äù I shrugged.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Äì nothing really matters. Why talk about anything, if nothing matters?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a nihilist?‚Äù

And suddenly, I was trapped in a Toyota Prius, hurtling down the highway with a man who‚Äì as it turns out‚Äì actually had a lot to say about the government, the universe, and everything.

Things took a turn about 15 minutes into his rant when it became clear he also held a grudge against women.

Knuckles white on the steering wheel, spittle hitting the windscreen‚Äì dude was angry.

Alarm bells dinged out a frantic ‚ÄòPachelbel Canon‚Äô in my head.

My instincts took over.

I nodded, agreed, backed him up. Cooed over his angry remarks.

Agreed with how unfair life had been to him, feigned concern.

Offered him a snickers bar.

We arrived at my destination, a place I was house sitting.
Completely alone.
For seven days.

‚ÄúYou know, if you want to keep talking, I could come in for a while?‚Äù he asked, no longer with venom in his eyes, but weird puppy-dog hope.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, my Hubbs is going to be home any minute, it wouldn‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù

With a sad frown and greasy hair, he drove off.

I promptly ran inside and locked all the doors and windows.

‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì

Edit:

Thank you to everyone who had something kind to say, I appreciate your empathy!

To everyone else: is it really that big of a deal if I felt unsafe and handled it in a polite and calm way?

Maybe you were overreacting, lady!

I can assure you I was not, believe me, I was there.

But that‚Äôs beside the point. I didn‚Äôt karate chop him and roll out of the moving vehicle, did I?

I just politely said ‚Äògoodbye!‚Äô and went inside.

It‚Äôs really great that there are plenty of people here who are feeling bad for the guy‚Äì I‚Äôm not saying that you shouldn‚Äôt. Heck, everyone should. Mental health is a real issue in the States.

I just hope that we can look at this answer for what it is: an insight into one woman‚Äôs mind when she found herself in a scary situation.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0lw5oacevkxi8nhd', 'title': ""What's the scariest thing (outside of the internet) you've experienced?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': '‚ÄúSo, you don‚Äôt talk much?‚Äù I casually asked my Uber driver, an American man in his mid 20s.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n‚ÄúOh, okay.‚Äù I shrugged.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Äì nothing really matters.

Thunga M Angadi,Updated 4y,What is a life hack that you think everybody should know?,"Not a hack but micro step with huge impact to include in our daily practice:

For those who buy milk sachets. Please do not snip off the corner to pour the milk. That miniscule triangle of plastic escapes even the most sophisticated filters and ends up in your water body, earth, food chain. Your daily single milk sachets' tiny corner can kill upto 10 sea creatures as they ingest these but cannot digest them. This plastic remains in the fish or bird long after the creature itself is dead. It takes a 1000 years to disintegrate. Would you want that? Instead, cut your milk cover like shown below. Milk does not spill. Just needs a knack. The WHOLE sachet can be recycled responsibly.

Lots of these sachet cut pieces are found in compost.

I request every reader to share this & let everyone follow the same. No need to give credit also, share or copy paste.

Credit: Padmaja motamarry for the pic & advice.

ETA:Updating after receiving few suggestions further.

This can be applied for other sachets as well. Please avoid cutting smaller pieces of any sachets.

After the above procedure, we can cut it as shown in the below picture, wash, dry and recycle sensibly.

Again credit goes to community friend Likitha.

Editing it to add one more hack:

kindly Save water - Use RO Reject water and save 10 litres per day.

Encouraged by the various water conservation ideas in Social media, we implemented RO reject water collection at our home and using it for washing hands directly.

There are many uses:

wash your car

wash utensils

watering to home garden

cleaning bathroom and toilets

floor mopping

Simple and hassle free solution!! Saves 10 litres of water everyday!!

An average RO purifier wastes approximately 3 litres of water for every 1 litre of purified water. That means only 25% of water is purified and 75% of water comes out as waste.

A man in chandigarh gave Rs 24,600 in coins as maintenance to his ex-wife.

His wife filed for divorce in 2015 and court gave him orders to give Rs 25000 per month as maintenance however from last two months he was unable to pay so his wife moved to court and court ordered him to pay Rs 50000 as he was failing to pay from two months so this man came with an idea to give her the money in Coins.

Everyday we hear a lot that few women marry rich people for money and later divorce them for alimony this may also be the same case. So this practicing lawyer came with a better plan.

Douglas Frederick,1y,What happened recently that made a huge swath of the internet obsessed with NPD (narcissistic personality disorder)?,"Because it has affected millions of people and now they can find information on the subject to why they have felt the way they do.

Both of my parents are psychopaths.

My ex wife sexually abused me.

I'm a life long victim in an extremely serious way.

I didn't know who my ex wife and parents were until I found the definitions online.

These terms best describe each of these people:

Dad: Primary psychopath with Covert Malignant Narcissist traits (ASPD, NPD)

Mom: BPD and secondary psychopathy

2nd ex wife: Covert Malignant Narcissist

1st wife: NPD

You most likely are dealing with a narcissist or sociopath if you are looking up the traits your partner has.

In the future it may be harder for you to do so as this population is always trying to learn new ways to get smarter about deceiving people.

Palkesh Asawa,Updated 7y,Should I support Facebook's Free Basics in India?,"Assume you're living in Mumbai and you have to go to Pune. A construction company has built the Expressway. This construction company collects toll charges for this service, and you pay it since you are using their services.

Now, you have to choose between AB travels and PQ travels. Both are offering the same service, that is - taking you from Mumbai to Pune. However, AB travels have made an agreement with the construction company. If you choose AB travels, then you don't have to pay toll charges. But if you use PQ travels, then you have to pay the toll charges.

Understand that the road is a public property. Construction company can collect toll charges because they are providing easy transport facility. But they cannot collect different toll charges from different people.

Now, applying this concept to the case in point -

You want to purchase a product through the internet (travel from Mumbai to Pune). You have two options, Flipkart (PQ travels) and Snapdeal (AB travels). Now, you can purchase these products only via internet (the road). The internet is operated by Reliance (construction company). You have to pay internet charges (toll charges) to Reliance.

Now, you like to purchase the product through Flipkart (because you like it better), but you have to pay more because Reliance (construction company) has a deal with Snapdeal (AB travels).

Just like same buses cannot be charged differently for using the same road; in the same manner, same services cannot be charged differently for using the same internet. This is against the principle of net neutrality

Read on to understand better:

[A] WHAT IS FREE BASICS?

Free Basics is a platform given by Facebook in association with telecom operators, where certain basic internet websites will be available free of cost. This means, if you are visiting Facebook's website, then you don't have to pay internet charges. However, if you are visiting other websites, such as Google, then you will need to pay the internet charges.

In India, Facebook has tied up with Reliance to make certain websites free of cost. Here is a list 
of all the websites which are available for free, as per Reliance's website. If you visit any of these websites, then you don't have to pay internet charges. For other websites however, you will continue to pay.

Before moving further, I would compliment Facebook for smartly renaming their internet.org as ""Free Basics"". Anything that is 'free' grabs attention in India, and if it's 'basics', it must definitely be supported. Also notice that Free Basics can be abbreviated as 'FB' - smart move!

[B] WHAT DOES RELIANCE GAIN FROM THIS?

Here is the deal: you want to access Facebook. You have two options: (1) You can choose Reliance network, and access it for free; or (2) You can choose other telecom operators and pay for the same service. What will you do? It is obvious that people would prefer to go for Reliance.

However, once you register on the Reliance network, you realise that actually you need more than just Free Basics. If you see the list of websites available as per this initiative, you will appreciate that it offers nothing significant, and you will anyway need to pay for the other services.

When these people, who are now interested in internet, get converted to full payment service, then Reliance becomes their obvious choice. Therefore, telecom operators gain from Free Basics because it increases their subscribers.

[C] WHAT IF OTHER TELECOM OPERATORS JOIN?

We have discussed that Reliance is interested in Free Basics because it gives them an edge over other telecom providers. However, what if other telecom operators also join in. Imagine that all the major telecom operators in India such as Idea, Airtel, Vodafone etc. join the Free Basics platform, what happens then?

We can understand that, then, Reliance will not have any inherent advantage. In that sense, we will see that all the websites listed above will be available for free on all the networks. In that case, what do these telecom operators gain? Aren't they all just killing themselves?

The fact is: these telecom operators are interested in this initiative because it gives them more subscribers. It increases the size of the market as a whole. A lot of people from rural India who have never used internet on their mobile phones will now start using internet. In this whole initiative, the telecom operators will eventually win, because their subscriber base rises.

You may argue that they are not charging for it (because it is free basics). But this argument is foolish, because you and I both appreciate that the websites offered by Free Basics are not even basics. They are not offering useful websites like Khan Academy, or Amazon, or Quora, or even Google. Therefore, any person who subscribes to Free Basics will eventually want to shift to the full version of internet.

[D] THEN WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

So far we believe that Free Basics is useful because it tries to give people a taste of what internet looks like; and then if they are interested, they can switch to the full version of internet where they can access the whole lot of things that you and I are already accessing on the internet.

So far so good. But the issue with Free Basics is different: who decides what websites should be for free?

Take two illustrations to understand this better:

Suppose you start a website that caters to the weather forecast requirements of farmers. With the help of Free Basics, a lot of farmers are able to use internet. However, they cannot access your application because your website is not available in the Free Basics platform.
On the other hand, assume a farmer wants to buy a television set for his family. He has an option of buying from Flipkart or Amazon. However, he can only access Amazon because other websites are not available for free. Maybe, he ends up paying more for that TV set.

The issue with Free Basics is that, it is controlling the content available for the subscribers of internet. Therefore, your website will not be able to reach a lot of subscribers just because you don't have a tie up with Free Basics. This is outright unfair - both to the website owners (such as the person who works hard to create a useful website for farmers) and also the subscribers (such as the farmer who doesn't even know that he can have better facilities on other websites). This is against the principle of net neutrality.

[E] WHY IS NET NEUTRALITY SO IMPORTANT?

Facebook is publicising Free Basics on the hope that it will connect a lot of people to internet - those people who previously were not connected. In this way, Facebook claims, they can get access to a lot of advantages that internet offers them. However, this sentence is really a fraud.

Free Basics is not offering them internet, it is offering them sponsored content

We must understand that internet is really only internet if it gives equal opportunities to all the people. What Free Basics is doing, is that it is giving only selected websites to these people for free. Therefore, it is unfair because those websites will now have more viewers than others. And in this way, the other websites will suffer. And the very premise on which internet flourished, will be destroyed.

Let us look at certain examples to have a better understanding of why net neutrality is so important:

Why is a company like Flipkart able to compete with Amazon today. This is because they have an equal platform called the internet. Today, they are competing only on the basis of their services. This is a healthy competition and it is beneficial for everyone.
Startups like Ola are able to efficiently compete with established taxi companies such as Uber. Just imagine what would have happened if Ola did not have an equal opportunity? What would have happened if Uber was available for free and not Ola?

You see: internet is giving an equal opportunity to a number of people because all of them can reach so many users at the same time. This is the magic of internet. Therefore, with the advent of internet, people are able to genuinely compete only on the basis of services that they offer.

Free Basics is going to destroy that. This model will give some companies an edge over the others and will therefore discourage other innovative ideas.

[F] THEN WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?

You are probably thinking that if Free Basics is not an option, then how can we connect the rest of India with internet. There is no denying that a lot of users in India are not connected to the internet, and we know that they would be better off if they were genuinely connected to all the plethora of services that internet can offer them.

But this cannot be done by differentiating between some websites over others. Moreover, the power of differentiation cannot be controlled by a single entity (Facebook). This is the case of too much power in the hands of too few people, and this is always disastrous.

A better solution is to provide all the internet for free.

Tell all the subscribers that they will have, say 500 MB of data free, every month. In this way, everybody will get to use some internet. They will realise the advantages it has to offer, and will then want to have more. If a not-so-smart person like me can come up with this idea, obviously the intelligent people in India can come up with much better ideas.

CONCLUSION

The problem with Free Basics is that it is monitoring the content which is available for free. In this manner, everybody does not get an equal chance or equal visibility. This is problematic for website owners (who will have less incentive to innovate and improve) and for internet users (who will not have all the options).

Internet is a very good thing. It has ensured that proper content gets recognition and can be used by several people for many genuine advantages. However, initiatives like Free Basics are giving a lot of control to private entities such as Facebook, and that is not a good thing.

Free Basics is not internet. And therefore it should be opposed. Visit Save the Internet
 to give your opinion to TRAI about this.

EDIT - FOR PEOPLE STILL OBJECTING

I am getting a lot of comments that ""something is better than nothing"", and that the poor people, who cannot afford internet are now getting the advantage of this internet. Firstly, my answer should be enough to counter this doubt. Nevertheless, if you still think that Free Basics is giving any advantage to the ""poor people"", then you should read on.

First, let us see what Free Basics is offering you: Facebook (without images), and some other news websites primarily text. How much data do you think will that consume in one month? Even if you browse Facebook throughout the month, and don't do anything but read those websites on the Free Basics, I don't think you would be able to consume more than 200 MB of data.

As per Reliance website, 200 MB of 3G data costs around Rs. 100. So basically, that ""poor person"" is getting a benefit of Rs. 100. Even to get that benefit, he should be living in a place where he has network connectivity, and he should own a phone with at least an internet browser (if not a smartphone), and he should have the SIM card for other purposes. So, basically, if you can do all this expenditure, you will get a benefit of Rs. 100.

Really? Is that such a big deal? Do you have any idea why people can't afford internet. It is because they can't afford a phone. It is because they live in areas where there is no electricity that can help them charge those phone batteries. It is because they don't have money to buy food, let alone internet. However, if that person already has all those needs fulfilled and he has the money left to buy that phone, I don't think he can't afford an extra Rs. 100 data pack.

Trust me when I say this, Free Basics is really a scam. Don't be distracted by because of the word ""Free"". What you call ""free"" and useful for ""poor farmers"" is neither of the two. In return of this ""generous benefit"", Facebook is getting three advantages - (1) It gets a lot of subscribers; it literally doubles the existing population of Facebook; (2) It helps to avoid any competition because Facebook can now control other websites from reaching the masses; (3) Facebook now has access to a lot of users, which is a very good source of potential earning in the future.

I agree that a lot of Indians who are not connected to the internet should be given access to this. However, Free Basics is not the solution. If anything, Free Basics is taking away the right to free internet.

For people to have internet access, we need to focus on the basics - we need to get them educated, provide them with basics such as water and electricity, then provide them economic opportunities so that they can earn and sustain a livelihood, after which they can start earning enough to buy a phone and will then get an internet package. Trust me, don't get swayed away by the ""free"" banner.

I am surprised that people cannot see through this scam. Think before you decide.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pwjncmz3rv504u8e', 'title': ""Should I support Facebook's Free Basics in India?"", 'score': {'original': 0.2958, 'ai': 0.7042}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Assume you\'re living in Mumbai and you have to go to Pune.

This is the case of too much power in the hands of too few people, and this is always disastrous.\n\nA better solution is to provide all the internet for free.\n\nTell all the subscribers that they will have, say 500 MB of data free, every month.

In this manner, everybody does not get an equal chance or equal visibility. This is problematic for website owners (who will have less incentive to innovate and improve) and for internet users (who will not have all the options).\n\nInternet is a very good thing. It has ensured that proper content gets recognition and can be used by several people for many genuine advantages. However, initiatives like Free Basics are giving a lot of control to private entities such as Facebook, and that is not a good thing.\n\nFree Basics is not internet. And therefore it should be opposed. Visit Save the Internet\n to give your opinion to TRAI about this.\n\nEDIT - FOR PEOPLE STILL OBJECTING\n\nI am getting a lot of comments that ""something is better than nothing"", and that the poor people, who cannot afford internet are now getting the advantage of this internet. Firstly, my answer should be enough to counter this doubt. Nevertheless, if you still think that Free Basics is giving any advantage to the ""poor people"", then you should read on.\n\nFirst, let us see what Free Basics is offering you: Facebook (without images), and some other news websites primarily text. How much data do you think will that consume in one month? Even if you browse Facebook throughout the month, and don\'t do anything but read those websites on the Free Basics, I don\'t think you would be able to consume more than 200 MB of data.\n\nAs per Reliance website, 200 MB of 3G data costs around Rs. 100. So basically, that ""poor person"" is getting a benefit of Rs. 100. Even to get that benefit, he should be living in a place where he has network connectivity, and he should own a phone with at least an internet browser (if not a smartphone), and he should have the SIM card for other purposes. So, basically, if you can do all this expenditure, you will get a benefit of Rs. 100.\n\nReally? Is that such a big deal? Do you have any idea why people can\'t afford internet. It is because they can\'t afford a phone. It is because they live in areas where there is no electricity that can help them charge those phone batteries. It is because they don\'t have money to buy food, let alone internet. However, if that person already has all those needs fulfilled and he has the money left to buy that phone, I don\'t think he can\'t afford an extra Rs. 100 data pack.\n\nTrust me when I say this, Free Basics is really a scam. Don\'t be distracted by because of the word ""Free"". What you call ""free"" and useful for ""poor farmers"" is neither of the two. In return of this ""generous benefit"", Facebook is getting', 'result': {'fake': 0.9876, 'real': 0.0124}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'three advantages - (1) It gets a lot of subscribers; it literally doubles the existing population of Facebook; (2) It helps to avoid any competition because Facebook can now control other websites from reaching the masses; (3) Facebook now has access to a lot of users, which is a very good source of potential earning in the future.\n\nI agree that a lot of Indians who are not connected to the internet should be given access to this. However, Free Basics is not the solution. If anything, Free Basics is taking away the right to free internet.\n\nFor people to have internet access, we need to focus on the basics - we need to get them educated, provide them with basics such as water and electricity, then provide them economic opportunities so that they can earn and sustain a livelihood, after which they can start earning enough to buy a phone and will then get an internet package. Trust me, don\'t get swayed away by the ""free"" banner.\n\nI am surprised that people cannot see through this scam. Think before you decide.', 'result': {'fake': 0.9971, 'real': 0.0029}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 23, 'credits': 1983138, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Assume you\'re living in Mumbai and you have to go to Pune. A construction company has built the Expressway. This construction company collects toll charges for this service, and you pay it since you are using their services.\n\nNow, you have to choose between AB travels and PQ travels. Both are offering the same service, that is - taking you from Mumbai to Pune. However, AB travels have made an agreement with the construction company. If you choose AB travels, then you don\'t have to pay toll charges. But if you use PQ travels, then you have to pay the toll charges.\n\nUnderstand that the road is a public property. Construction company can collect toll charges because they are providing easy transport facility. But they cannot collect different toll charges from different people.\n\nNow, applying this concept to the case in point -\n\nYou want to purchase a product through the internet (travel from Mumbai to Pune). You have two options, Flipkart (PQ travels) and Snapdeal (AB travels). Now, you can purchase these products only via internet (the road). The internet is operated by Reliance (construction company). You have to pay internet charges (toll charges) to Reliance.\n\nNow, you like to purchase the product through Flipkart (because you like it better), but you have to pay more because Reliance (construction company) has a deal with Snapdeal (AB travels).\n\nJust like same buses cannot be charged differently for using the same road; in the same manner, same services cannot be charged differently for using the same internet. This is against the principle of net neutrality\n\nRead on to understand better:\n\n[A] WHAT IS FREE BASICS?\n\nFree Basics is a platform given by Facebook in association with telecom operators, where certain basic internet websites will be available free of cost. This means, if you are visiting Facebook\'s website, then you don\'t have to pay internet charges. However, if you are visiting other websites, such as Google, then you will need to pay the internet charges.\n\nIn India, Facebook has tied up with Reliance to make certain websites free of cost. Here is a list \nof all the websites which are available for free, as per Reliance\'s website. If you visit any of these websites, then you don\'t have to pay internet charges. For other websites however, you will continue to pay.\n\nBefore moving further, I would compliment Facebook for smartly renaming their internet.org as ""Free Basics"". Anything that is \'free\' grabs attention in India, and if it\'s \'basics\', it must definitely be supported. Also notice that Free Basics can be abbreviated as \'FB\' - smart move!\n\n[B] WHAT DOES RELIANCE GAIN FROM THIS?\n\nHere is the deal: you want to access Facebook. You have two options: (1) You can choose Reliance network, and access it for free; or (2) You can choose other telecom operators and pay for the same service. What will you do? It is obvious that people would prefer to go for Reliance.\n\nHowever, once you register on the Reliance network, you realise that actually you need more than just Free Basics. If you see the list of websites available as per this initiative, you will appreciate that it offers nothing significant, and you will anyway need to pay for the other services.\n\nWhen these people, who are now interested in internet, get converted to full payment service, then Reliance becomes their obvious choice. Therefore, telecom operators gain from Free Basics because it increases their subscribers.\n\n[C] WHAT IF OTHER TELECOM OPERATORS JOIN?\n\nWe have discussed that Reliance is interested in Free Basics because it gives them an edge over other telecom providers. However, what if other telecom operators also join in. Imagine that all the major telecom operators in India such as Idea, Airtel, Vodafone etc. join the Free Basics platform, what happens then?\n\nWe can understand that, then, Reliance will not have any inherent advantage. In that sense, we will see that all the websites listed above will be available for free on all the networks. In that case, what do these telecom operators gain? Aren\'t they all just killing themselves?\n\nThe fact is: these telecom operators are interested in this initiative because it gives them more subscribers. It increases the size of the market as a whole. A lot of people from rural India who have never used internet on their mobile phones will now start using internet. In this whole initiative, the telecom operators will eventually win, because their subscriber base rises.\n\nYou may argue that they are not charging for it (because it is free basics). But this argument is foolish, because you and I both appreciate that the websites offered by Free Basics are not even basics. They are not offering useful websites like Khan Academy, or Amazon, or Quora, or even Google. Therefore, any person who subscribes to Free Basics will eventually want to shift to the full version of internet.\n\n[D] THEN WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?\n\nSo far we believe that Free Basics is useful because it tries to give people a taste of what internet looks like; and then if they are interested, they can switch to the full version of internet where they can access the whole lot of things that you and I are already accessing on the internet.\n\nSo far so good. But the issue with Free Basics is different: who decides what websites should be for free?\n\nTake two illustrations to understand this better:\n\nSuppose you start a website that caters to the weather forecast requirements of farmers. With the help of Free Basics, a lot of farmers are able to use internet. However, they cannot access your application because your website is not available in the Free Basics platform.\nOn the other hand, assume a farmer wants to buy a television set for his family. He has an option of buying from Flipkart or Amazon. However, he can only access Amazon because other websites are not available for free. Maybe, he ends up paying more for that TV set.\n\nThe issue with Free Basics is that, it is controlling the content available for the subscribers of internet. Therefore, your website will not be able to reach a lot of subscribers just because you don\'t have a tie up with Free Basics. This is outright unfair - both to the website owners (such as the person who works hard to create a useful website for farmers) and also the subscribers (such as the farmer who doesn\'t even know that he can have better facilities on other websites). This is against the principle of net neutrality.\n\n[E] WHY IS NET NEUTRALITY SO IMPORTANT?\n\nFacebook is publicising Free Basics on the hope that it will connect a lot of people to internet - those people who previously were not connected. In this way, Facebook claims, they can get access to a lot of advantages that internet offers them. However, this sentence is really a fraud.\n\nFree Basics is not offering them internet, it is offering them sponsored content\n\nWe must understand that internet is really only internet if it gives equal opportunities to all the people. What Free Basics is doing, is that it is giving only selected websites to these people for free. Therefore, it is unfair because those websites will now have more viewers than others. And in this way, the other websites will suffer. And the very premise on which internet flourished, will be destroyed.\n\nLet us look at certain examples to have a better understanding of why net neutrality is so important:\n\nWhy is a company like Flipkart able to compete with Amazon today. This is because they have an equal platform called the internet. Today, they are competing only on the basis of their services. This is a healthy competition and it is beneficial for everyone.\nStartups like Ola are able to efficiently compete with established taxi companies such as Uber. Just imagine what would have happened if Ola did not have an equal opportunity? What would have happened if Uber was available for free and not Ola?\n\nYou see: internet is giving an equal opportunity to a number of people because all of them can reach so many users at the same time. This is the magic of internet. Therefore, with the advent of internet, people are able to genuinely compete only on the basis of services that they offer.\n\nFree Basics is going to destroy that. This model will give some companies an edge over the others and will therefore discourage other innovative ideas.\n\n[F] THEN WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?\n\nYou are probably thinking that if Free Basics is not an option, then how can we connect the rest of India with internet. There is no denying that a lot of users in India are not connected to the internet, and we know that they would be better off if they were genuinely connected to all the plethora of services that internet can offer them.\n\nBut this cannot be done by differentiating between some websites over others. Moreover, the power of differentiation cannot be controlled by a single entity (Facebook). This is the case of too much power in the hands of too few people, and this is always disastrous.\n\nA better solution is to provide all the internet for free.\n\nTell all the subscribers that they will have, say 500 MB of data free, every month. In this way, everybody will get to use some internet. They will realise the advantages it has to offer, and will then want to have more. If a not-so-smart person like me can come up with this idea, obviously the intelligent people in India can come up with much better ideas.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe problem with Free Basics is that it is monitoring the content which is available for free. In this manner, everybody does not get an equal chance or equal visibility. This is problematic for website owners (who will have less incentive to innovate and improve) and for internet users (who will not have all the options).\n\nInternet is a very good thing. It has ensured that proper content gets recognition and can be used by several people for many genuine advantages. However, initiatives like Free Basics are giving a lot of control to private entities such as Facebook, and that is not a good thing.\n\nFree Basics is not internet. And therefore it should be opposed.

Cicada 3301

This story is maybe the most tantalizing of all, as someone came so close to cracking the mystery that we almost found out the story behind it, but not quite.

In 2013, a post from a user named 3301 on 4Chan circulated the internet. The post was an image that read;

A renowned cryptographer and internet junkie, Joel Erikson, was intrigued by this puzzle and entered the mad hunt to decipher the message. Erikson was the only person to publicly decipher the entire puzzle.

The image code contained a text message, which was readable by opening the image in a text editor. The code looked like this:

Erikson knew this was a clue. A Tiberivus Caesar is a cipher method, simply known as the Caesar Cipher. Erikson put the code in quotes through a decoder and began trying it with different keys. The key ‚Äú4‚Äù successfully output an Imgur link, which led to this image:

However, Erikson knew this was a trick. The sentence ‚Äúlooks like you can‚Äôt guess how to get the message out‚Äù was out of place. He eventually, after reading the sentence several times forward and backward, got ‚Äúguess‚Äù and ‚Äúout‚Äù from reading both words before and after ‚Äúhow to get the message.‚Äù He figured out that the message was telling him to use OutGuess, a steganography tool, to decipher the image. The OutGuess tool outputs this message when the duck image is ran through it:

The number 3301, when multiplied with the image dimensions which both happened to be prime, output this number: 509 x 503 x 3301 = 845145127. 845145127.com

The cicada led to no clues, simply outputting this message when OutGuessed:

This is where the hunt began to quiet down. People realized that going against Cicaida 3301‚Äôs wishes may endanger their very lives as this search was no longer internet-only. Cicaida had demonstrated their power, placing signs all around the world and the few hunters left were no longer public about it with the exception of Joel.

The book passage was deciphered eventually by using codes from the second message, resulting in this seemingly random jumble of text:

sq6wmgv2zcsrix6t.onion

This text was a dark web link accessible via TOR browser.

The site displayed this:

3301¬†

The trail essentially went cold here. There are some leaked rumors about a MIDI file leading to another puzzle, but nobody who completed it publicly announced anything of the sort.

A month later, this message was displayed on the Reddit forum:

The P.S led to another crazy hunt a year later. However, this hunt was not as public and the trail seemingly went cold early on. The realization that the Cicada organization was actually a powerful and intelligent syndicate and not some coder playing a prank had an effect on the hunters, who were very quiet about anything they did. To this day, nobody knows who Cicada 3301 is, why they devised such an elaborate hunt, or what happened to the people who cracked the final puzzle.

Blank Room Soup.AVI

While other unsolved internet mysteries like Cicaida 3301 are certainly ominous, Blank Room Soup is plain out creepy.

A man named Reymond Persi, a theatrical visionary, created a series of characters that he called RayRay.

These characters were envisioned to have mime-like movements and a very specific demeanor. Reymond spent weeks training professional actors to properly portray his characters for a show.

When the RayRay project went on tour in 2008, two costumes randomly went missing after a show. Reymond looked everywhere for these costumes but could not find them, so he assumed they were stolen.

Now here is where things get creepy. A week later, Reymond received an email from an anonymous address that simply stated: ‚Äúfrom a fan.‚Äù Attached was a video file, named BlankRoomSoup.avi. The video depicted a shirtless man of Asian or Latino complexity with a censored face scarfing down soup in a white room with an oversized spoon.

After around 30 seconds of the man eating, a figure enters the room, dressed in a RayRay costume.

The figure, perfectly portraying the RayRay diction according to Reymond, silently enters the room and the man immediately starts sobbing. He continues to sob while scarfing down soup, and the RayRay kneels down and begins to stroke the man‚Äôs back lightly.

After around a minute of this, a second RayRay enters the room and also begins to stroke the man‚Äôs back, who is still sobbing while messily eating soup.

The video ends suddenly after a minute of this.

Reymond posted this video to the internet, asking who did this and why. The eerie video and the story rapidly blew up, but nobody confessed, even anonymously.

After a while, another email was sent to Reymond, this time completely blank apart from a video named 2.AVI. The video depicts the man eating soup again, this time alone. He stops eating and begins to gag suddenly, and as he does a RayRay silently enters the room.

The man does not appear to notice him. The second RayRay enters the room silently after almost ten seconds, and they silently watch the man.

After almost twenty seconds, they exchange glances. Suddenly, one character rushes across the room, arms raised. A scream rings out and the video cuts silent.

And that was it. No confession, no explanation, nothing. To this day, nobody knows what happened to the man, the costumes, or the creators. The RayRay act was canceled and the videos faded into myth.

EDIT- in the years since, two more Blank Room Soup videos have surfaced. It is unknown whether or not they were created by the original perpetrators.

‚ÄúBlank Room Soup 3‚Äù is perhaps the most ominous of them all. It features a short, shaky clip shot in a dark room. A RayRay character is seen standing over a bound, gagged and masked man. The man seems to be in physical distress, which is evident when RayRay begins grabbing the man and holding his head up to the camera.

Blank Room Soup 4 is the most obscure, confusing, and questionable video. It simply details a zoomed-in shot of a RayRay character standing alone, in the dark, in the rain. The origin and purpose of this particular video is unknown. It is much more likely that this video is faked, but there is too little information to tell.

Sad Satan

In 2015, a YouTuber named Obscure Horror Corner received an anonymous tip from a subscriber, only known as ZK. The YouTuber did a playthrough of the series, claiming the anonymous tip he received led him to a Dark Web forum with the game available for download.

The game consists of a first-person camera traversing a black and white maze, being chased by strange creatures. There is no plot, story, or mechanics. Random ends in the maze contain easter eggs, strange images, and cutscenes that are not discernable.

The game gained popularity and a subreddit where internet gurus discussed the game.

Suddenly, on 4Chan, a user named ZK posted, claiming that Obscure Horror Corner did not play the ‚Äútrue‚Äù version of the game, which he included in a link.

This version of the game included a deadly virus and random cutscenes that showed gore, torture, and child pornography. Many sections also contain ASCII characters on the wall that translate to the phrases ‚ÄúI see you,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt escape me,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can track you,‚Äù etc. Given that the true version of the game was riddled with advanced viruses, these threats are likely actually true.

This game is riddled with easter eggs, containing child molester monologues in the soundtrack that are heavily stretched and processed in addition to the flashing video cutscenes depicting child abuse and murder.

The sheer amount of secrets, easter eggs, and other content hidden behind this seemingly plain game are mind-boggling and it is still poorly understood. To this day ZK and the true origins of this game are unknown.

These three mysteries are the most prominent in Internet history, although many many more exist, some of which involve child abuse, murder, and worse. While the internet contains lots of interesting things, you do not want to see everything it has to offer.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/45ap3stkdrjf2xub', 'title': 'What are some unsolved mysteries of the internet?', 'score': {'original': 0.58388, 'ai': 0.41612}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""DISCLAIMER: THE FOLLOWING STORIES ARE TRUE.

However, this hunt was not as public and the trail seemingly went cold early on.

To this day, nobody knows who Cicada 3301 is, why they devised such an elaborate hunt, or what happened to the people who cracked the final puzzle.\n\nBlank Room Soup.AVI\n\nWhile other unsolved internet mysteries like Cicaida 3301 are certainly ominous, Blank Room Soup is plain out creepy.\n\nA man named Reymond Persi, a theatrical visionary, created a series of characters that he called RayRay.\n\nThese characters were envisioned to have mime-like movements and a very specific demeanor. Reymond spent weeks training professional actors to properly portray his characters for a show.\n\nWhen the RayRay project went on tour in 2008, two costumes randomly went missing after a show. Reymond looked everywhere for these costumes but could not find them, so he assumed they were stolen.\n\nNow here is where things get creepy. A week later, Reymond received an email from an anonymous address that simply stated: ‚Äúfrom a fan.‚Äù Attached was a video file, named BlankRoomSoup.avi. The video depicted a shirtless man of Asian or Latino complexity with a censored face scarfing down soup in a white room with an oversized spoon.\n\nAfter around 30 seconds of the man eating, a figure enters the room, dressed in a RayRay costume.\n\nThe figure, perfectly portraying the RayRay diction according to Reymond, silently enters the room and the man immediately starts sobbing. He continues to sob while scarfing down soup, and the RayRay kneels down and begins to stroke the man‚Äôs back lightly.\n\nAfter around a minute of this, a second RayRay enters the room and also begins to stroke the man‚Äôs back, who is still sobbing while messily eating soup.\n\nThe video ends suddenly after a minute of this.\n\nReymond posted this video to the internet, asking who did this and why. The eerie video and the story rapidly blew up, but nobody confessed, even anonymously.\n\nAfter a while, another email was sent to Reymond, this time completely blank apart from a video named 2.AVI. The video depicts the man eating soup again, this time alone.', 'result': {'fake': 0.8137, 'real': 0.1863}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'He stops eating and begins to gag suddenly, and as he does a RayRay silently enters the room.\n\nThe man does not appear to notice him. The second RayRay enters the room silently after almost ten seconds, and they silently watch the man.\n\nAfter almost twenty seconds, they exchange glances. Suddenly, one character rushes across the room, arms raised. A scream rings out and the video cuts silent.\n\nAnd that was it. No confession, no explanation, nothing. To this day, nobody knows what happened to the man, the costumes, or the creators. The RayRay act was canceled and the videos faded into myth.\n\nEDIT- in the years since, two more Blank Room Soup videos have surfaced. It is unknown whether or not they were created by the original perpetrators.\n\n‚ÄúBlank Room Soup 3‚Äù is perhaps the most ominous of them all. It features a short, shaky clip shot in a dark room. A RayRay character is seen standing over a bound, gagged and masked man. The man seems to be in physical distress, which is evident when RayRay begins grabbing the man and holding his head up to the camera.\n\nBlank Room Soup 4 is the most obscure, confusing, and questionable video. It simply details a zoomed-in shot of a RayRay character standing alone, in the dark, in the rain. The origin and purpose of this particular video is unknown. It is much more likely that this video is faked, but there is too little information to tell.\n\nSad Satan\n\nIn 2015, a YouTuber named Obscure Horror Corner received an anonymous tip from a subscriber, only known as ZK. The YouTuber did a playthrough of the series, claiming the anonymous tip he received led him to a Dark Web forum with the game available for download.\n\nThe game consists of a first-person camera traversing a black and white maze, being chased by strange creatures. There is no plot, story, or mechanics. Random ends in the maze contain easter eggs, strange images, and cutscenes that are not discernable.\n\nThe game gained popularity and a subreddit where internet gurus discussed the game.\n\nSuddenly, on 4Chan, a user named ZK posted, claiming that Obscure Horror Corner did not play the ‚Äútrue‚Äù version of the game, which he included in a link.\n\nThis version of the game included a deadly virus and random cutscenes that showed gore, torture, and child pornography. Many sections also contain ASCII characters on the wall that translate to the phrases ‚ÄúI see you,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt escape me,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can track you,‚Äù etc. Given that the true version of the game was riddled with advanced viruses, these threats are likely actually true.\n\nThis game is riddled with easter eggs, containing child molester monologues in the soundtrack that are heavily stretched and processed in addition to the flashing video cutscenes depicting child abuse and murder.\n\nThe sheer amount of secrets, easter eggs, and other content hidden behind this seemingly plain game are mind-boggling and it is still poorly understood. To this day ZK and the true origins of this game are unknown.\n\nThese three mysteries are the most prominent in Internet history, although many many more exist, some', 'result': {'fake': 0.0543, 'real': 0.9457}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'of which involve child abuse, murder, and worse.

The post was an image that read;\n\nA renowned cryptographer and internet junkie, Joel Erikson, was intrigued by this puzzle and entered the mad hunt to decipher the message. Erikson was the only person to publicly decipher the entire puzzle.\n\nThe image code contained a text message, which was readable by opening the image in a text editor. The code looked like this:\n\nErikson knew this was a clue. A Tiberivus Caesar is a cipher method, simply known as the Caesar Cipher. Erikson put the code in quotes through a decoder and began trying it with different keys. The key ‚Äú4‚Äù successfully output an Imgur link, which led to this image:\n\nHowever, Erikson knew this was a trick. The sentence ‚Äúlooks like you can‚Äôt guess how to get the message out‚Äù was out of place. He eventually, after reading the sentence several times forward and backward, got ‚Äúguess‚Äù and ‚Äúout‚Äù from reading both words before and after ‚Äúhow to get the message.‚Äù He figured out that the message was telling him to use OutGuess, a steganography tool, to decipher the image. The OutGuess tool outputs this message when the duck image is ran through it:\n\nHere is a book code.

People realized that going against Cicaida 3301‚Äôs wishes may endanger their very lives as this search was no longer internet-only. Cicaida had demonstrated their power, placing signs all around the world and the few hunters left were no longer public about it with the exception of Joel.\n\nThe book passage was deciphered eventually by using codes from the second message, resulting in this seemingly random jumble of text:\n\nsq6wmgv2zcsrix6t.onion\n\nThis text was a dark web link accessible via TOR browser.\n\nThe site displayed this:\n\nCongratulations!\xa0\n\xa0\nPlease create a new email address with a public, free web-based service. Once you\'ve never used before, and enter it below. We recommend you do this while still using tor, for anonymity.\xa0\n\xa0\nWe will email you a number within the next few days (in the order in which you arrived at this page).

There are some leaked rumors about a MIDI file leading to another puzzle, but nobody who completed it publicly announced anything of the sort.\n\nA month later, this message was displayed on the Reddit forum:\n\nThe P.S led to another crazy hunt a year later. However, this hunt was not as public and the trail seemingly went cold early on. The realization that the Cicada organization was actually a powerful and intelligent syndicate and not some coder playing a prank had an effect on the hunters, who were very quiet about anything they did. To this day, nobody knows who Cicada 3301 is, why they devised such an elaborate hunt, or what happened to the people who cracked the final puzzle.\n\nBlank Room Soup.AVI\n\nWhile other unsolved internet mysteries like Cicaida 3301 are certainly ominous, Blank Room Soup is plain out creepy.\n\nA man named Reymond Persi, a theatrical visionary, created a series of characters that he called RayRay.\n\nThese characters were envisioned to have mime-like movements and a very specific demeanor. Reymond spent weeks training professional actors to properly portray his characters for a show.\n\nWhen the RayRay project went on tour in 2008, two costumes randomly went missing after a show. Reymond looked everywhere for these costumes but could not find them, so he assumed they were stolen.\n\nNow here is where things get creepy. A week later, Reymond received an email from an anonymous address that simply stated: ‚Äúfrom a fan.‚Äù Attached was a video file, named BlankRoomSoup.avi. The video depicted a shirtless man of Asian or Latino complexity with a censored face scarfing down soup in a white room with an oversized spoon.\n\nAfter around 30 seconds of the man eating, a figure enters the room, dressed in a RayRay costume.\n\nThe figure, perfectly portraying the RayRay diction according to Reymond, silently enters the room and the man immediately starts sobbing. He continues to sob while scarfing down soup, and the RayRay kneels down and begins to stroke the man‚Äôs back lightly.\n\nAfter around a minute of this, a second RayRay enters the room and also begins to stroke the man‚Äôs back, who is still sobbing while messily eating soup.\n\nThe video ends suddenly after a minute of this.\n\nReymond posted this video to the internet, asking who did this and why. The eerie video and the story rapidly blew up, but nobody confessed, even anonymously.\n\nAfter a while, another email was sent to Reymond, this time completely blank apart from a video named 2.AVI. The video depicts the man eating soup again, this time alone. He stops eating and begins to gag suddenly, and as he does a RayRay silently enters the room.\n\nThe man does not appear to notice him. The second RayRay enters the room silently after almost ten seconds, and they silently watch the man.\n\nAfter almost twenty seconds, they exchange glances. Suddenly, one character rushes across the room, arms raised. A scream rings out and the video cuts silent.\n\nAnd that was it. No confession, no explanation, nothing. To this day, nobody knows what happened to the man, the costumes, or the creators. The RayRay act was canceled and the videos faded into myth.\n\nEDIT- in the years since, two more Blank Room Soup videos have surfaced. It is unknown whether or not they were created by the original perpetrators.\n\n‚ÄúBlank Room Soup 3‚Äù is perhaps the most ominous of them all. It features a short, shaky clip shot in a dark room. A RayRay character is seen standing over a bound, gagged and masked man. The man seems to be in physical distress, which is evident when RayRay begins grabbing the man and holding his head up to the camera.\n\nBlank Room Soup 4 is the most obscure, confusing, and questionable video. It simply details a zoomed-in shot of a RayRay character standing alone, in the dark, in the rain. The origin and purpose of this particular video is unknown. It is much more likely that this video is faked, but there is too little information to tell.\n\nSad Satan\n\nIn 2015, a YouTuber named Obscure Horror Corner received an anonymous tip from a subscriber, only known as ZK. The YouTuber did a playthrough of the series, claiming the anonymous tip he received led him to a Dark Web forum with the game available for download.\n\nThe game consists of a first-person camera traversing a black and white maze, being chased by strange creatures. There is no plot, story, or mechanics. Random ends in the maze contain easter eggs, strange images, and cutscenes that are not discernable.\n\nThe game gained popularity and a subreddit where internet gurus discussed the game.\n\nSuddenly, on 4Chan, a user named ZK posted, claiming that Obscure Horror Corner did not play the ‚Äútrue‚Äù version of the game, which he included in a link.\n\nThis version of the game included a deadly virus and random cutscenes that showed gore, torture, and child pornography. Many sections also contain ASCII characters on the wall that translate to the phrases ‚ÄúI see you,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt escape me,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can track you,‚Äù etc. Given that the true version of the game was riddled with advanced viruses, these threats are likely actually true.\n\nThis game is riddled with easter eggs, containing child molester monologues in the soundtrack that are heavily stretched and processed in addition to the flashing video cutscenes depicting child abuse and murder.\n\nThe sheer amount of secrets, easter eggs, and other content hidden behind this seemingly plain game are mind-boggling and it is still poorly understood. To this day ZK and the true origins of this game are unknown.\n\nThese three mysteries are the most prominent in Internet history, although many many more exist, some of which involve child abuse, murder, and worse. While the internet contains lots of interesting things, you do not want to see everything it has to offer.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.58388
Cem Arslan,Updated 3y,Why is there so much Hitler admiration on the internet? Do people lose sight of the line between the joke and supporting him?,"Disclaimer: This answer was originally written using the word ‚Äòadmire‚Äô as analogous to ‚Äòrespect‚Äô, as it is commonly used. The term admiration, within the boundaries of this answer, does not carry any connotations of moral approval or warm regard, and is used purely within the professional and academic subject.

In sum, although the original text of the answer still contained a clear indication that no claims towards Hitler‚Äôs morality was being made, it is worth reiterating that this answer concerns an opinion on Hitler‚Äôs political, leadership and bureaucratic abilities and is not a moral judgment of his actions and beliefs. It is intended merely to serve as a warning to the world of today concerning the perils of underestimating a potential threat.

The greatest problem in the point of view of the common man is the excessive focus on morality.

We affix a morality scale onto everything. We project morality unto virtues and vices that have nothing to do with it. Heroism, valor, courage, competence, efficiency, all of these began to be called as ‚Äògood‚Äô virtues, things that can be possessed only by the good. In the original definition of these words there is not a trace of a moral scale. We judge greatness by morals. Great equals good in our mind while evil is petty and pitiful. Good can never be pathetic. Evil can never be great.

This logic of man is absurd in the extreme. Greatness and morality are two completely detached scales that do not affect each other.

This is why Hitler is oft admired, for he was one of the greatest men of the past century.

Hitler was the last of the long line of warlord-conquerors, and by far the most impactful of them. This man rose from a scorned demagogue to the absolute leader of a Great Power within five years. This man for two years manipulated all the Powers of Europe on the diplomatic table. This man ignited the crowds with a scorching fire with a single speech.

And as a consequence of our inability to realize that good does not have a monopoly on ability, he is today considered a thug, an incompetent brute, a braindead bully with little ability and even less sanity. Anyone who tries to point this out and talk about his competencies is accused of Nazism. Any professional admiration of his abilities is regarded as a crime bordering on the Holocaust.

People think it is bad to admire someone‚Äôs skills because he was evil. Some people think this admiration is a slippery slope that evolves into an admiration for the man and then his ideology, others outright consider it tantamount to being a devout follower.

People think this admiration will lead to more Hitlers taking power. They forget Hitler did not seize power because he was admired.

He seized power because he was not.

When he was appointed Chancellor, every established political force in Germany and abroad considered him just a demagogue, an unsophisticated man of little talent that could be easily controlled.

Less than six years later, Hindenburg was dead, Blomberg and Fritsch were kicked out of their positions in the Army, Beck was forced to resign, R√∂hm was executed and his SA shattered, Schleicher was assassinated, Papen was sidelined, the Communists were annihilated, Social Democrats were dismantled, and Hitler reigned supreme, his authority unchallenged.

If anyone had learned to understand and admire the man they faced, Hitler could never come to power.

To let your hatred blind you to the admirable competencies of someone is one of the gravest mistakes one can possibly commit.

Shubham Wakte,Updated 6y,What's your favorite picture you've found online?,"These are photos I got while I was scrolling my Facebook feed. These photos shows the other side of the fun that we are having while hunting the animals for food, furniture, decoration etc. If the same happens with the humans while animals are enjoying the situation then this would be the case!!

Rhino cutting the nose

Lions posing after a good chase of a man

Sharks fishing the humans for their today's lunch!!

Horses enjoying the ride of a human cart

Fish dealing the varieties of specimen

Outfit of a human skin

Wow!! The human head is looking so cool..

Hog preparing the bacon from a leg of a slim model

Selfie with a selfish human

Ducks trapping the lusty human

Mice experimenting on the useless and populated creatures

Preparing for the slaughter

Bear proud of his hunting skills and decorating the living room with the abundant and dangerous species

As a jewellery..

Cooking shows for special dishes

Enjoying the melodious cry of a prisoned human

Babies as a sea food

Modelling wardrobe

Bull fight‚Ä¶?? No‚Ä¶ Matador fight ending with the result.

Can't be as honest as them, but still treating better than us

So this shows the cruelty, inhumanity and disrespect towards the animals. We are not aware of the results they have to face just for the seek of our need, entertainment or show off. The nature is the gift which we are exploiting causing the adverse effect on the ecology.

If same happens in the future with such cruelty soon the animals will be only in the stories to tell. Your grandchildren will see this beautiful and rare species in the television only. Start feeling the pain and emotions of them and you will enjoy its beauty along with the happiness of real world. So let's take an initiative to stop this nonsense and help in maintaining the beauty of the nature so that our children can see those species in reality rather in books.

Andy Duffell,Updated 1y,Why did people use dial-up internet in the 1990s instead of Ethernet or something faster?,"Well, actually we did use ethernet.

Ethernet is not a type of internet service. It‚Äôs a networking standard. The only type of internet connection available back then was dialup. ADSL (‚Äúbroadband‚Äù) didn‚Äôt come in until later.

Dialup was friggin slow and annoying, even by the reduced expectations of 90s internet. Nobody was happy with the speeds they got. It was far too slow to do a lot of things you‚Äôd like to be able to do, such as stream music at decent quality, stream video, or play games against real humans. Even downloading images on websites was slow.

So what did people do? Lan party!

In the 90s, if you wanted to play games with your friends you all lugged your PC over to a friend‚Äôs house (yes, including the giant heavy CRT monitor with the glass screen!) and you used ethernet to connect them all together into a Local Area Network (LAN). The speeds that an ethernet connection to a machine a few feet away gave you were blazingly fast (they still are) and made gaming against real human opponents possible and fun.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fuq1ybz4jl0x5knv', 'title': 'Why did people use dial-up internet in the 1990s instead of Ethernet or something faster?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Well, actually we did use ethernet.\n\nEthernet is not a type of internet service.

Prakhar Sethii,Updated 3y,What is the best thing you came across on the internet today?,"This man is on the next freaking level.

Dr. Oluyinka Olutoye is a physician of Nigerian origin. He has become extremely well known on social media because of the next to-impossible feat he has achieved!

This Texas-based doctor successfully operated a surgery on an unborn baby.

Yes, you read that right.

The unborn child had a tumour, and it certainly had to be removed for the baby to survive.

So, guess what this madlad did?

He removed the fetus from the mother‚Äôs womb, operated on it to remove the tumour, and then restored the fetus into the womb!

The fetus was safe, and the mom‚Äôs pregnancy continued until she gave birth in the usual 36th week of pregnancy.

I don‚Äôt know about you, but the fact that an unborn being could be removed from the womb, performed surgery on, AND placed back into the mother, safe and sound just blows my mind.

Doctors, especially doctors like these, just aren‚Äôt appreciated enough. This man literally performed a miracle, and gave this family a lifetime worth of happiness and a hope in humanity that they‚Äôll never lose.

On behalf of everyone, I salute you Dr. Olutoye.

Take me to Japan please,

Akhil Kintali,4y,What rare content have you found on YouTube?,"There are days when I hate YouTube, mostly for wasting my time by suggesting stand-up comedy videos and puppy sneezing videos. Both are equally good and addictive.

Today, YouTube decided to show me a useful video, and boy, I was impressed.

It was a video of how a single image released by NASA can tell dozens of stories.

This is a composite image of the world taken by several satellites over a period of time.

Let me just dive into what I learned.

As you can see in the image, the bright areas in the map are areas of heavy light pollution as well as prosperity.

Zoom into the Arab regions

The extraction of oil generates bright lights due to the flaring of lights.

The river Nile, in Egypt, is again bright due to the presence of many commercial boats.

In Asia, India clearly stands out, thanks to the rapid population as well as economic growth.

Compare the images between 2012 and 2016.

2016 is clearly brighter, and that is a clear indication of population growth, a sign of worry.

Syria, unfortunately, has no light because of the civil war which massively damaged its growth.

Another interesting picture is the comparison between North and South Korea, and it requires very little explanation.

There are many other conclusions which you can draw from just one image.

Laura Hornby Kutney,Updated 4y,What is a life hack that you think everybody should know?,"If you love, have, or take care of more than one child, this hack is a must for keeping the peace‚Ä¶.

Sometimes, there is a last piece of cake (or pizza) that two children want, but that needs to be divided.

We all know what happens when young kids feel cheated or shortchanged. So, in order to prevent WWIII breaking out in your kitchen, I share with you this hack. It guarantees, with fairly good certainty, equally cut portions as well as happy children.

First, decide which child wants to divide the piece of cake in half. Before they cut the cake, make sure they know, that the other child gets to choose which piece of cake that he or she wants first, leaving the unchosen piece to the one who made the division.

Each child will quickly realize that they both hold equal positions of power.

It‚Äôs fun to observe the great amount of concentration and care taken by both the child who cuts the cake, as well as the one who is eagerly anticipating and deciding on which piece they will ultimately choose. Every crumb counts in this early, real-life, math lesson!

You will be astonished at how evenly one piece of cake can be cut into two.

Kids are so amazing.

Vasanth Prabakar,Updated 7y,What are some things that Amazon does that would surprise people?,"I ordered a Zebronic headphone from Amazon few months back. The automated system allotted Gati courier service for my order.

Being an isolated village, my location is so far from their service locations. They do not have service for my village, therefore they said that they couldn't provide a door delivery and also added I was supposed to collect that item at their office. (For your kind information their nearest office to my village is 67 kms far.)

What else would I do? I contacted Amazon.
Being a giant online portal, having immense customers from all over the world, They didn't have to consider a request from an isolated village of India. They could have simply told the automated system had allotted the courier service and they would rectify the problem soon.

But the very next day, Gati courier service mini-van traveled over 67 kms with a single box.



And it's for me. ;)

Edit 1: For those who are criticizing my answer.

Asim Qureshi,3y,What is a life hack that you think everybody should know?,"My wife and I work from home, our 3 kids are homeschooled.

But this is where it has become very interesting, and none of it was planned...

Maryam, on the right, is 15. She finished her school exams two years ago, she'll probably never go to university, out of choice.

She's tried coding and data science, didn't enjoy them, then tried digital marketing, loved it.

So she's got a job at a startup - as startups focus on skills - and is working from home, earning a graduate salary.

So, does she meet 100 kids every day? No.

Does she have friends? Yes, plenty.

Is she socially confident? Yes, very.

Does she work all day? No - she works when she wants - she's paid hourly. She reads, rides horses, runs, learns languages, meets friends.

Is she missing out on her childhood? No, she's missing out on an antiquated education system.

What if she wants to become, say, a doctor? She'll do a degree in medicine.

Is she happy? Very.

No exams, bullying, drugs, 9-5 job, rushed commutes. We're saving the planet as well as ~US$400k in school and uni fees per child.

Yet our entire family is doing stuff we're passionate about - learning and earning - but without pressure, without rigidity - and insanely efficient.

Nadh Poduri,Updated 5y,Why do people still prefer Google over DuckDuckGo?,"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.

Shockingly, I totally forgot that Google search exists, and I‚Äôve been using it all these years. It took me a while to understand what Google has been doing to me.
Most of the time, I type something in the Chrome browser, and I get what I want.
Or I ask Google home what I want, and I get an answer.
No drama. It‚Äôs just simple.

Do you see how seamless the Google search is?

Even though I use it so many times every day, I hardly realize I‚Äôm using it. That‚Äôs a sign of a great product.
You don‚Äôt look for it ever. You assume it is there, always. You don‚Äôt realize every second that you are breathing in Oxygen.
It‚Äôs just there. And it is free.

Why am I still using Google? It just boils down to one simple thing.

In all these years, Google never gave me a reason to switch.
There could be a million ways Google could have screwed it up, but it didn‚Äôt. For the most part, Google kept its end of the bargain.

No ads on the home page (home page doesn‚Äôt matter now, but when it mattered they didn‚Äôt run any ads).
The ranking is always based on relevance (you can‚Äôt pay more to get a better ranking).
They figured out a way to monetize without irritating me.

That Is It.

Agreed, they are collecting my information and using that information to show me more ads.

Getting an education is one of the most important milestones of a child‚Äôs life which has a crucial role in determining a child‚Äôs future. However, according to the United Nations, almost 60 million primary school-aged children aren‚Äôt in school. One of the most common reasons is poverty. There are many children throughout the world, who, instead of going to school, have to work to support their families.

Even the basic things most of us take for granted, such as school supplies, can prevent a child from getting an education if they can‚Äôt afford to buy them.

Recently a teacher from Cambodia shared photos of a backpack a father made for his son.

To
 help kids get a better future, parents do their best in supporting their children‚Äôs pursuit of education.

When five-year-old NY Keng from Cambodia started going to a new school, his teacher Sophous Suon couldn‚Äôt help but notice his original backpack.

She said that a simple school bag cost 30000 riels ($7) in her area and there are parents who are struggling to afford them. However, NY Keng‚Äôs father who works as a farmer, decided to save money on a school bag and resorted to a much more creative option.Using the last bits of raffia string, he weaved a beautiful blue backpack

No doubt, He is dedicated heartwarming, touching, cool and creative father.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,5y,What kind of scam have you experienced?,"I have seen a bunch of interesting small scams.

On my last trip to China in September 2017, I was accosted by two women in 20s as I was walking in the forbidden city. They initially said they wanted to practice their English and thus I let them walk with me. As I went through the monuments they kept asking more asking more questions about me, my company and India.

I was curious about what scam they were going to pull and was looking for that. Since China is quite safe for foreigners and this is right around the Tianenmen square ‚Äî their seat of power, I didn‚Äôt feel quite threatened. I was fairly sure that I could call the cops anytime.

I made sure that we walked only in the bigger streets as we kept getting into the heart of Beijing. Then they took me to a restaurant. I just watched out for if they would drug me and in any case put my WeChat and Whatsapp status as that location. I also made a call from there to a local friend just to let them know the my hosts know.

Finally, the scam turned out to be outrageously priced menu items. I didn‚Äôt eat anything for fear of what might be there, but the bill for the 2 ladies came out to be be somewhere around 1000 yuan. Amidst much protest from them, I just said we can only share the bill [they were like how can a lady be charged] three ways and just departed with placing 300 yuan.

There are many such tourist traps where these small scams go on ‚Äî where unsuspecting tourists are brought in to buy ridiculously priced things and compelled to buy it out of guilt and persuasion.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/doafbtmvqy0s4xl7', 'title': 'What kind of scam have you experienced?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I have seen a bunch of interesting small scams.\n\nOn my last trip to China in September 2017, I was accosted by two women in 20s as I was walking in the forbidden city.

Ayush Atreya,7mo,Can you write something dark and deep?,"Once I was watching an interview of shahrukh khan.

The interviewer asked him something about his struggles or how he reached where he is right now.

His reply struck to me so hard that I remember his exact wording till date.

If I say you that whatever I achieved, is because of my hardwork. I am either making a fool of you or of myself. Definitely, I worked hard.

But Much much more than my hardwork, these three thing played a major role. Being at the right place, with right people and at the right time.

Perhaps many won't agree with him. But we all know that there are thousands of people who are much more talented, smart. They are still roaming in mumbai with portfolio in thier hand or doing small work in serials.

So the question is, what exactly decides one's success?

Many successful people will say that they succeed just on their hardwork and persistence and whatnot. Deep down we all know there is something that is not in our control.

Perhaps that's what people call LUCK.

Riki Jones,Updated 5y,What is the best thing you came across on the internet today?,"This is a heartbreaking, beautiful story[1].

Nicole and Brent Keryluke of Red Deer, in the Province of Alberta, decided to go for a motorcycle drive.

They had to be back within two hours, because both of their two young children had medical appointments, as they both suffer from hearing impairments and one needs speech therapy.

As they were turning a curve, a truck coming from the other direction veered into their lane and hit them head on.

They were killed immediately.

The driver of the car behind them said that Nicole had her arms wrapped around her husband, with her face in his back...and never saw it coming. And that Brent, before the moment of impact, instinctively put his arm behind him to hold his wife.

Brent‚Äôs parents, Ben and Marilyn, now had guardianship of three-year-old Liam and six-year-old Arielle, and especially because of the additional costs of the medical bills, they had to sell Brent‚Äôs classic 1973 Pontiac Parisienne, which he restored himself and hoped would one day be Liam‚Äôs on his eighteenth birthday.

They didn‚Äôt want to, but had to.

And they took it to EG Auctions to sell.

Watch the awesome video of what happened next: EG Auctions Charity Car

‚ÄúThey basically stopped the auction, let everybody know what was happening, where the money was going to go, and then we were shocked what happened after that,‚Äù said Ben.

First, Rod McWilliams from Red Deer Motors bought the car for $29,000...and immediately gave the car back to be auctioned again!
Then Danny Fayad, who had driven up from Edmonton, bought the car for $30,000‚Ä¶.and immediately gave the car back to be auctioned again!
All the while, members of the community yelled out pledges to go over and beyond whatever it finally sold for.
One man yelled out, ‚Äú2,000 over the price!‚Äù, another yelled out ‚Äú$4,000 over‚Äù, and it happened again and again and again.
One woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told a reporter that she came with $2,500 to see if she could ‚Äúscore a deal‚Äù on an older unrestored car that was coming up later in the auction, but pledged her money for the Keryluke family. ‚Äú I have two kids myself. I thought of them. What if? I have one car already.‚Äù

It was finally purchased for $20,000 to Bob Bevins from Bulldog Metals in the third and final round.

The reason he didn‚Äôt also give the car back to be sold again, was because after the auction was over, he went to the Keryluke family...and gave the car to them.

‚ÄúMaybe someday that young man will drive his father‚Äôs car,‚Äù he said.

Said Lyndsay, ‚ÄúPeople were overwhelmed with just the generosity of people of central Alberta and the support that this family has. It was incredible. People were cheering, I was crying. Our auctioneer Rod had a hard time getting through it because he was crying. He was emotional.

When the last buyer stepped forward and said ‚ÄòI want your family to have that car, so I'm giving it back to you,‚Äô the audience erupted.

When our auctioneer Rod announced that, the place just went wild. There was a standing ovation, people were cheering, whistling. It was wonderful.""

And that Brent, before the moment of impact, instinctively put his arm behind him to hold his wife.\n\nBrent‚Äôs parents, Ben and Marilyn, now had guardianship of three-year-old Liam and six-year-old Arielle, and especially because of the additional costs of the medical bills, they had to sell Brent‚Äôs classic 1973 Pontiac Parisienne, which he restored himself and hoped would one day be Liam‚Äôs on his eighteenth birthday.\n\nThey didn‚Äôt want to, but had to.\n\nAnd they took it to EG Auctions to sell.\n\nWatch the awesome video of what happened next: EG Auctions Charity Car\n\n‚ÄúThey basically stopped the auction, let everybody know what was happening, where the money was going to go, and then we were shocked what happened after that,‚Äù said Ben.\n\nFirst, Rod McWilliams from Red Deer Motors bought the car for $29,000...and immediately gave the car back to be auctioned again!\nThen Danny Fayad, who had driven up from Edmonton, bought the car for $30,000‚Ä¶.and immediately gave the car back to be auctioned again!\nAll the while, members of the community yelled out pledges to go over and beyond whatever it finally sold for.\nOne man yelled out, ‚Äú2,000 over the price!‚Äù, another yelled out ‚Äú$4,000 over‚Äù, and it happened again and again and again.\nOne woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told a reporter that she came with $2,500 to see if she could ‚Äúscore a deal‚Äù on an older unrestored car that was coming up later in the auction, but pledged her money for the Keryluke family. ‚Äú I have two kids myself. I thought of them. What if? I have one car already.‚Äù\n\nIt was finally purchased for $20,000 to Bob Bevins from Bulldog Metals in the third and final round.\n\nThe reason he didn‚Äôt also give the car back to be sold again, was because after the auction was over, he went to the Keryluke family...and gave the car to them.\n\n‚ÄúMaybe someday that young man will drive his father‚Äôs car,‚Äù he said.\n\nSaid Lyndsay, ‚ÄúPeople were overwhelmed with just the generosity of people of central Alberta and the support that this family has. It was incredible. People were cheering, I was crying. Our auctioneer Rod had a hard time getting through it because he was crying. He was emotional.\n\nWhen the last buyer stepped forward and said ‚ÄòI want your family to have that car, so I\'m giving it back to you,‚Äô the audience erupted.\n\nWhen our auctioneer Rod announced that, the place just went wild. There was a standing ovation, people were cheering, whistling. It was wonderful.""\n\nSource: Tevye - Daily Kos\n\nImage Credit: Tevye - Daily Kos\n (Twitchy Finger)\n\nAfter Parents Are Killed, Family Had To Auction Dads Classic Car.

Rafael Eliassen,3y,What is a life hack that you think everybody should know?,"Epictetus was a Greek stoic philosopher.

He was born as a slave to a wealthy family. His life was unfortunate, his master broke his leg, got banished by the Emporer. Despite this, he was a wise and learned man.

He had one hack for making life easier.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt seek to have events happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen and all will be well with you‚Äù

What does Epictetus mean? Should we not strive for our goals and give up?

You should do both. He knew that life is out of our control.

No matter what we do we can‚Äôt fully control outside circumstances. We can only attempt to control the circumstances and accept the rest.

He wants us to take action but not have an expectation to control the outcome of your action.

In today's world, we try to control every outcome.

We want to study with a specific hack, we want to talk a certain way. we micromanage everything.

We want events to happen as we picture them in our heads.

My life changed when I stopped trying to make outcomes look the way I thought they should look. With your emotions attached to your expectations, you block the path to getting what you want.

When you let go of your results looking a certain way, you accept there are many ways to get what you want.

You will see endless ways to make people like you, to win in the market, to study for the test.

Best Hack: Do your best and adapt to what happens.

When you get out of tunnel vision ‚Äî life will work for you, instead of you working for it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hzk5w4qxpoif0tjn', 'title': 'What is a life hack that you think everybody should know?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Epictetus was a Greek stoic philosopher.\n\nHe was born as a slave to a wealthy family.
