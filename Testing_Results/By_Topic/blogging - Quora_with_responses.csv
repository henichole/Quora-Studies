Matthew Bates,6y,How do you grab a reader's attention?,"Easy.

Single word sentences.

Followed by short sentences.

Then you can move in to longer, flowing sentences that contain the “meat” of what you want to tell your readers. This method works well for me. I guess that, by the time they’ve made it to the fourth paragraph (which doesn’t take long, because the first three paragraphs are short), people figure they’ve made it this far, they might as well finish it.

And just like that, you’ve gotten their attention.

The worst thing to do is to hit them from the beginning with a huge paragraph. People are lazy. You can count on that. If the first thing they encounter seems like work, they won’t do it.

But look at my first “paragraph”. You can’t look at it and NOT read it. Your brain processed that word quicker than you could decide you didn’t want to read it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fdwv9uhick7bq5lm', 'title': ""How do you grab a reader's attention?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Easy.\n\nSingle word sentences.\n\nFollowed by short sentences.\n\nThen you can move in to longer, flowing sentences that contain the “meat” of what you want to tell your readers.

Mark Manson,Updated 8y,What tips & suggestions would experienced bloggers give to young bloggers?,"I've been blogging for almost eight years now and have been doing it professionally for four years. I get asked this question all of the time.

First, I think it's important to be realistic about what blogging is. So let's start with a few misconceptions people have about blogs:

Most blogs don't make any money. And if they do, it took them multiple years to get there. As a business plan, blogs suck. They take years and thousands of hours of work to ramp up to a level where you can monetize them. And in many cases the methods you use to monetize them kill your brand and tarnish your writing's credibility, making them impossible to turn into money-makers.

I don't know the real numbers but I would estimate that 99% of blogs out there have no significant readership, and of those blogs that have a significant readership, 99% of those make little or no money.

So now that I've dumped ice water all over your world-conquering blogging aspirations, let me just say, there are only two valid reasons to start a blog. Either a) you have some other business and blogging would be a nice way to help promote it. Or b) you just really, really, really enjoy blogging. Outside of those two reasons, there's no legitimate reason to start one.

(Edit: a commenter pointed out that there is a legitimate third reason, and that is to build a platform to eventually get a book deal and/or to test ideas for a book. This is very true. But even so, you're looking at a couple years of writing to build a platform large enough to get a publisher's attention.)
A lot of bloggers, even successful bloggers, are shitty writers. No offense, but most bloggers can't write well. Most bloggers are successful not because of their writing but because they found a good niche market to insert themselves into. They're successful because they're solving a problem for people and are serving a practical purpose.

What I'm saying is, is that most bloggers are successful because they're good marketers, not because they're good writers. Take that however you want to.

Writing well is hard. It's a skill that takes years of conscious effort to develop. And if you've gone through the trouble to develop it, chances are you don't need to be blogging. You're working at a magazine or writing The Next Great American Novel or something.

With all of that said, I will tell you this. The better your writing is, the better your chances of blogging success are. Good writing never goes out of style. And truly great writing cannot be suppressed. A great article on a great topic written beautifully will be successful no matter where it is or who wrote it. Guaranteed.
Until you've written hundreds of thousands of words, you have no clue what you will enjoy writing about or what other people will enjoy reading from you. Successful blogs exist at the intersection between the passions of the writer and readers. The problem is that everyone, despite thinking they know where those two passions are, don't actually know either until they've put their reps in.

Until you've written 100 pages about a topic, you really don't know how much you enjoy writing about it. And until you've published 100 pages about a topic, you have no idea how much people will enjoy reading what you have to say about it.

It takes a lot of writing and experimentation for each person to find their own individual style and voice, what they care about, what others care about, and so on. This is a natural process. But it just so happens that when you blog, you need to go through this process in a very public way. Which is awkward. And kind of embarrassing.

But you need to be able to stomach this. Most people, when they want to start blogging don't realize how much embarrassment and ""I can't believe I actually published that,"" goes into it. So if you can't handle public embarrassment (not to mention the occasional hate email), then, as the South Park ski instructor once said, ""you're going to have a bad time!""

It's for the three reasons above that my go-to advice for aspiring bloggers is always, ""Write 100 posts and then come back and ask me again.""

Because until you've written 100 posts, you generally have no clue what you enjoy writing about or what people enjoy reading from you, you have not developed anything close to decent writing chops, and you have no chance at ever monetizing.

Because until you find that unique voice, and until you get your writing chops up to speed, there's not much that can be said other than, ""Keep writing. Keep experimenting. Keep testing out new ideas and seeing who responds."" Hell, start three blogs. Write a post a week for each one. Write a fan fiction. A tech manual. A sci-fi fantasy novel starring Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. The more creative, the better. Eventually you'll find something that sticks.

So that's my go-to answer. But in the meantime, here is some other advice to keep in mind as you join the rest of us in fighting the great tyranny that is the blinking cursor:

Study branding and basic marketing. Even if you're a fiction blogger. Even if you have no intention of ever making money off blogging. Even if you're writing erotica about dwarves and elves. Understanding branding and the basics of marketing (finding a niche, differentiating yourself, unique selling points, etc.) will go further in helping you establish an audience than anything else you can do aside from better writing.

Writing first, design second. Download a nice-looking free Wordpress theme and just run with it until you get a decent-sized audience. Then worry about making your site look beautiful later. Unless you're blogging to a entrepreneur/professional audience, design really doesn't matter much. As a blogger, you will live and die by the quality of your writing and the quality of your message. Design is just the cherry on top.
Read books, not other bloggers. I know I keep saying this, but most bloggers are not good writers. Most of them have built popular blogs off of a brilliant brand or because they are solving a clear problem. I.e., they're popular because of smart marketing, not smart writing. Definitely read successful bloggers to get ideas about branding and marketing. But when it comes to writing itself, you need to be reading writers. Find the best books in the genre or subject you want to be writing about and then pay attention to how they write. Practice mimicking their style and their tone. Read the classics of your genre. Read the greats like Hemingway, Dickens, Tolstoy. Try to figure out what makes them great. Then practice mimicking them. See how it feels. Steal a few stylistic things. Leave others behind.
You want quality traffic first, quantity second. That means no spamming, no black hat SEO nonsense, no viral-baiting a million 10-second visitors with a goofy cat video. Do your work. Put it out there. Then wait and see. Traffic is nice, but you're looking for engagement, for subscribers, for followers, for people who care.
At first, the only people who will care about your blog will be your friends and family. If even they don't care, well, then you're way off-track. Start over. When you finally get something good, not only will your friends and family care, but you'll start noticing friends of friends, old acquaintances, co-workers, etc. popping up. This is a good sign. The better your blog gets, the more the degrees of separation will expand outward.
Set a word goal each week and then attempt to keep it for a year. When I started, I promised myself at least 3 posts of 1000 words each week. I kept that up for almost three years. Sure, a lot of those posts were crap, but man, did it pay off. I improved a lot. I got much closer to finding my voice. And I discovered a lot about what people did/didn't want to read from me.
Proofread. Multiple times. Typos and bad grammar hurt your credibility and hurt the reader's experience. Take pride in your work. Be a perfectionist.
Have fun. At the end of the day, you need to enjoy writing/blogging, otherwise this is just going to be a vanity project that you'll scrap in a month. Blogging is a very lonely profession in many ways. It can also be stressful in weird ways. Like anything else, you really have to have a natural passion for the work if you're going to make it. You have to be in it for the right reasons. So try it out for a few months or a year, and if you still aren't excited to be posting, then perhaps chalk it up as a nice attempt and then go try something else.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wmbh0tqnz4kar9si', 'title': 'What tips & suggestions would experienced bloggers give to young bloggers?', 'score': {'original': 0.71143333333333, 'ai': 0.28856666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I've been blogging for almost eight years now and have been doing it professionally for four years.

I.e., they\'re popular because of smart marketing, not smart writing. Definitely read successful bloggers to get ideas about branding and marketing. But when it comes to writing itself, you need to be reading writers. Find the best books in the genre or subject you want to be writing about and then pay attention to how they write. Practice mimicking their style and their tone. Read the classics of your genre. Read the greats like Hemingway, Dickens, Tolstoy. Try to figure out what makes them great. Then practice mimicking them. See how it feels. Steal a few stylistic things. Leave others behind.\nYou want quality traffic first, quantity second. That means no spamming, no black hat SEO nonsense, no viral-baiting a million 10-second visitors with a goofy cat video. Do your work. Put it out there. Then wait and see. Traffic is nice, but you\'re looking for engagement, for subscribers, for followers, for people who care.\nAt first, the only people who will care about your blog will be your friends and family. If even they don\'t care, well, then you\'re way off-track. Start over. When you finally get something good, not only will your friends and family care, but you\'ll start noticing friends of friends, old acquaintances, co-workers, etc. popping up. This is a good sign. The better your blog gets, the more the degrees of separation will expand outward.\nSet a word goal each week and then attempt to keep it for a year. When I started, I promised myself at least 3 posts of 1000 words each week. I kept that up for almost three years. Sure, a lot of those posts were crap, but man, did it pay off. I improved a lot. I got much closer to finding my voice. And I discovered a lot about what people did/didn\'t want to read from me.\nProofread. Multiple times. Typos and bad grammar hurt your credibility and hurt the reader\'s experience. Take pride in your work. Be a perfectionist.\nHave fun. At the end of the day, you need to enjoy writing/blogging, otherwise this is just going to be a vanity project that you\'ll scrap in a month. Blogging is a very lonely profession in many ways. It can also be stressful in weird ways. Like anything else, you really have to have a natural passion for the work if you\'re going to make it. You have to be in it for the right reasons. So try it out for a few months or a year, and if you still aren\'t excited to be posting, then perhaps chalk it up as a nice attempt and then go try something else.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.71143333333333

Daniel Paterson,6y,What is the difference between Quora and Medium? Which one is better? Why?,"Ah, the great Quora V. Medium debate.

It’s not too great, but, ey’, 200+ people are following this question, so that’s great to me!

In all honesty, the two sites are better than… whatever in the world is happening at that Yahoo “Answers” we see.

First, let’s get into what the two sites are.

Medium is, as the company defines it as: a place to read, write, and interact with the stories that matter most to you. Every day, thousands of voices read, write, and share important stories on Medium.

In other words, a glorified way to say that it’s a place where you can write articles about stuff and have it be shared to the internet.

Quora is, as the company defines it as: a place to gain and share knowledge. It's a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers. This empowers people to learn from each other and to better understand the world.

In other words, quite an interesting version of just saying that it’s a Q&A site. Oddly enough, unlike most of the internet, the “knowledge” part actually holds up with people here!

Most people on Medium will say Medium is better, and most people on Quora will say Quora is better.

Even those who are on both sites, like me, will be biased towards one of the sides.

For example, I say Quora’s better, but that’s probably because Quora has helped me through dark points in time and I’ve been using Quora almost daily for 14 months as of January, 2018.

So, instead, let’s look at the pros and cons of both sites:

Medium’s pros.
Medium can pay you. Need I say more?
Medium has intelligent writers discussing important issues.
Medium has a great fan base, and is even more popular than that of Quora.
Medium optimizes your feed in better ways than Quora with its’ AI systems.
Medium uses claps, a rather more sophisticated form of the primitive “upvote” in which allows you to give anywhere between 1 and 50 claps to a single article.
You can decide what picture you want for your article, unlike Quora.
Medium doesn’t rely on random questions to come for a user to answer them. Users can just write if they want to.
Medium has an amazing community in which any user can fall back to, share any of their stories with - all without fools.
Medium’s cons.
It’s incredibly hard to get popular there. Sure, only about 30 million Medium users go on there monthly as opposed to Quora’s 200 million, but that doesn’t make it easy. If anything, you need to outsource to other sites like Reddit to make you popular.
As of January 20th, 2018, I have a measly 2 followers on Medium. But I have 205 amazing people following me and reading my content on Quora.

Sheldon Paterson – Medium

Daniel Paterson

Medium has no clear cut way to just write about a certain topic. When you come to Medium, you’re expected to write. When you come to Quora, you write based on questions that people make. Because of this, unless if you can think of a great idea to write about, you ain’t going to be using Medium as a medium.
Pun intended.
Most of Medium’s articles are in the six to seven minute range. This isn’t so bad for people who like to sit down and read, but, if you’re reading an article quickly, you aren’t going to sit down to read something that’s worth your whole lunch break.

Now for Quora!

Quora’s pros.
Quora, just like Medium, also has an amazing community in which people will support you every step of the way.
Most of Quora’s answers are short and concise. They aren’t long articles, unlike Medium.
Quora mainly only has articles in the form of answers to questions. If you can’t think of what to write, that’s fine - just answer this query!
You can ask virtually any (appropriate) question on Quora and get logical responses from logical people. Hence as to why Quora got its’ name from the word Quorum!
Quora’s cons.
Quora’s BNBR system. In all honesty, Quora has a decent track record, but it can just be too harsh with its’ banning. I see at least one popular writer being banned every month (eg. Brooke Schwartz’s recent ban), sometimes with little to no explanation or for just ridiculous reasons.
You get a ban, you get a ban, you all get a ban!
The problem with this is that, this has led to even famous Quorans falling onto Medium. It could be possible that this banning outrage may cause refugee crisis into Medium.
Quora isn’t the place to make blogs, people. Even “popular” blogs on Quora get, like what, 50 upvotes per good post at most? Medium sure is, but Quora? Eh… no.
Quora has a defined structure in place. You ask questions, you get answers. You find a question, you answer it. If you really want to write about something, well, honey, you better find the write question about it!
Pun, once again, intended.
Quora is partially turning into Facebook. Questions such as “What is the most Indian thing ever?” is now becoming commonplace. Though I say it is also a pro that you can talk about funny things more often than on Medium (seriously, some of the answers to that query is just hilarious), it also has it’s downfalls.

So now you know the pros and cons to Medium and Quora.

And who is the winner?

DRUMROLL PLEASE!

“Drums.”

Neither one is the winner.

In fact, it all depends on what you want.

You like long articles about random but empowering topics? Medium is for you.

You like short answers with concise information? Quora is for you.

You like a place to make a blog? Medium is for you.

You like a place to write anecdotes and funny situations? Quora is for you.

It all just depends on your preference. I, personally, prefer Quora, but I love using both.

And, if you haven’t tried both of them, try giving the one you haven’t tried a twirl to see if you like it or not.

Who knows, it could be the next best thing since sliced liver meat.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dwb8olcqut3ve105', 'title': 'What is the difference between Quora and Medium?

Chris Coyne,11y,How important was blogging to OkCupid's success?,"Very important. We think.

Still, we don't really have any way of measuring the effects, since direct signups from the blog posts were just a few thousand people each. But over the long run, we just kept hearing how everyone *loved* the posts so much, and that it was one of the big reasons they loved the site. All that said, I get this question a lot from startups who are hoping to fill in the ""how do we grow?"" blank by saying ""Well, we'll just write a blog, like OkCupid did.""  Maybe hire a ""data scientist.""  And unfortunately, I have to advise against it in almost all cases. Some bullets: OkCupid's blog worked because we had sexy data. If you're doing a real estate startup, or a housing thing, or an ad network, or even some social/photo/sharing tool, odds are you don't have the wealth of personal information to produce lots of great posts.

It's easy to look at an OkTrends post, with all its simple graphs and casual writing style and think someone just threw it together, but it probably had 50 serious revisions. And we threw out a lot of research that didn't turn into good posts.  Your startup probably can't afford to do this.

Further, we had pretty deep demo data. We had Christian Rudder writing the blog.  Yes, he studied math at Harvard, but the math on OkTrends was high school level. And with a lot of statistical hand-waving and over-simplification. His posts were great because he\'s such an amazing writer, not because he\'s awesome at math. (He\'s certainly the best writer I know.)The posts each took 4-8 weeks of full-time work for him to write. Plus another 2-4 weeks of dedicated programming time from someone else on the team.  It\'s easy to look at an OkTrends post, with all its simple graphs and casual writing style and think someone just threw it together, but it probably had 50 serious revisions. And we threw out a lot of research that didn\'t turn into good posts.  Your startup probably can\'t afford to do this. It shouldn\'t waste like 10 man weeks of effort/focus/money on writing a blog post.  Most other attempts I\'ve seen at boosting traffic via blogging have failed. Obviously we can all point at exceptions (selection bias), but when I think of all the examples of someone telling me in advance they were doing a blog, they failed.Btw, last thing: I know I used past-tense to describe the blog, but Christian still is at OkCupid and he\'s doing a lot of data research again...', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9999
James Altucher,10y,What is James Altucher's secret for blogging so consistently?,"About 24 years ago I started writing every day because I thought if I got a novel published I would get girls to like me. I also felt like I couldn't get a job in the real world unless I had a published novel.

I don't know why I thought these things. I was an idiot and still largely am. But you are what you eat so I ended up without any girlfriends and with no job.

But I wrote every day.

And before I wrote every day I read every day. I never read in high school or college. But suddenly I was reading every book i could find. And then after I read a book I would go to the library and look up all the criticism of that book.

Then I'd comb through all the literary journals and read every story I could find.

Then I'd go home and write. I wrote about 4 novels. I wrote about 50 or more short stories. I also got 1000s of rejection letters.

All my friends got sick of me because I would force them to read all of my stuff and give me critiques.

And, of course, I couldn't handle any criticism.

So I started to have no girlfriend, no job, and no friends. But I still read and wrote every day.

And still do.

2-4 hours of reading to start off the morning (I wake up very early) and then 2-4 hours of writing before I even consider answering emails or doing my normal business stuff. And then I usually end the day with reading.

Seven days a week. I feel physically ill on days I don't do this.

The only time I took a break from this routine in the past 24 years was when I worked at HBO. I was doing a project for their website that I called ""3am"". I went out and interviewed prostitutes and drug dealers at three in the morning every Tuesday night for almost three years.

This, of course, gave me more material to write about.

Then I started a bunch of businesses and made and lost a lot of money.

This gave me more material to write about.

Then, as you get older you make enemies, lose friends, encounter interesting people, risk your life, do stupid things, get divorced, get people pregnant, and lots of things happen.

And each one of those things can be ""thin-sliced"". You start a company (big slice), which means you might have sex with an employee and then get them pregnant. (thinner slice)

This, as a hypothetical example, gives you something to write about. Abortion. And other fun topics.

Every day I write one or more posts. Most posts I don't post. Yesterday I wrote a post: 5 things I learned from my taxi driver. On the side he is the chauffeur for four high end call girls. I asked him a lot of questions. He was free with his answers and named names. I wrote the post but will probably never publish it.

Some days I can't think of what to write. But I stare at the screen and write whatever I want. Nobody can stop me.

Then when I think I have something good, I paste it into a Facebook status update window. For whatever reason, this forces me to edit very tightly.

After about 10-15 passes, my final post is about 30% smaller than my original post.

Then the post is ready.

Then I hope you like it.

But before that happens, I'm writing another post.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zgto4ba1fc6nej5l', 'title': ""What is James Altucher's secret for blogging so consistently?"", 'score': {'original': 0.09265, 'ai': 0.90735}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'About 24 years ago I started writing every day because I thought if I got a novel published I would get girls to like me.

Franklin Veaux,1y,Does minifying HTML and CSS codes increase web page speed?,"Yes, but…

Let’s take Bootstrap as an example. Bootstrap might reasonably be called a…err, rather heavyweight framework. It’s chonky.

Artist’s impression of Bootstrap

The ‘normal’ Bootstrap 4 CSS file is 187KB. The minified version is 147KB, for a savings of 21%.

Sounds nice, right? That should mean 21% faster load times, right?

Well, no, because (a) most of the page isn’t in the Bootstrap framework, it’s in the HTML and images and such, and (b) more importantly, the Bootstrap CSS file only downloads once, and is called up from the cache as you browse the site.

So it’ll increase the download speed of the Bootstrap CSS file, not the entire page, by 21%, the first time you look at a page on that site, and from then on, the time savings is exactly zero because the file is cached by your browser.

So yes, but really no, because the savings is quite marginal—in this case, 20kb of download saved one time on the first page view.

There are more effective ways to increase speed. The two biggest are to make sure you’re using a fast database server with an efficient database if you’re using a DB site, and optimize images, which typically are going to be much larger than the HTML/CSS size of the site. (For example, don’t use 3000-pixel-wide images that you display 400 pixels wide in your HTML, okay?)

You’ll also likely get a lot further by removing unused elements from your CSS and Javascript than by minifying them, if you really want to shave off file size.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o8sw136iyakx54rb', 'title': 'Does minifying HTML and CSS codes increase web page speed?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes, but…\n\nLet’s take Bootstrap as an example.

Justin William,5y,What advice would you give to new writers/upcoming Quorans?,"As a Quoran who has been here for 5+ years, I have pretty much seen it all.

So here is my inputs for new / upcoming Quorans.

Be Nice Be Respectful (BNBR). This is the foundation of all Quora policies. Follow this to the hilt. Forget being disrespectful to others. Don’t even call your own self a fool. My answer was collapsed just because I called myself an asshole.
Have no expectations. Just because you have followed a popular Quoran, do not expect them to follow you back or upvote your answers. Or expect them to promptly respond back to your answer comments or inbox messages. Remember that they would be getting lots of messages and they also have a life outside of Quora.
Addiction. Remember this. At some point, Quora can become an addiction. Just don’t forget the other aspects of your life, apart from Quora.
Grammar: A lot many people will tell you to write in proper Grammar. I will tell you otherwise. Just write. And write as if you were talking one on one with someone. That will make your answer more relatable to people here. I do this all the time. And if someone suggests “Edits” to your answer, be thankful for it. He / She read your answer and took out the time to work on it.
Stay away from hate. If you have written any controversial answer, and if answer comments start getting hateful or getting on your nerves, don’t respond back, just simply disable comments on the answer. It’s blissful and will put you at peace. And don’t get worked up if your answer gets downvoted or collapsed. Just move on. That’s life.
Inbox Messaging. It’s really upto you if you want your inbox open for messaging from all, only your followers or not open to anyone. And if you get hateful or stupid messages, don’t engage in a war of wits. It’s just not worth your time and effort. Just Report and Block the person. It’s as simple as that.
Top Writers / Popular Quorans. You will eventually see Quorans who have the Top Writer Tag on their profile or Quorans who have tens of thousands of followers and are immensely popular. Don’t aspire to be them. They are not aliens from another planet. They are just humans like you and me. Never get into a race to be a Popular Quoran. It’s just temporary. In the real world, no one will recognize you inspite of you having 50 thousand followers on Quora.
Followers. If you want followers, follow others too. If you want upvotes on your answers, upvote other answers too. If you want to get to know fellow Quorans, follow them, interact with them on their answers and commenting on it. Never inbox a Quoran unless they have specifically mentioned that they are open to messaging. Interacting with them on their answers are a great way to become familiar with them and eventually becoming friends with them.
Honesty. Lastly, this is what I want to say. Just be your self. Be honest and truthful in your answers and who you really are. Just don’t fake it to be popular.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/w6i7aldf2em4pgxj', 'title': 'What advice would you give to new writers/upcoming Quorans?', 'score': {'original': 0.47425, 'ai': 0.52575}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'As a Quoran who has been here for 5+ years, I have pretty much seen it all.\n\nSo here is my inputs for new / upcoming Quorans.\n\nBe Nice Be Respectful (BNBR).

It’s really upto you if you want your inbox open for messaging from all, only your followers or not open to anyone. And if you get hateful or stupid messages, don’t engage in a war of wits. It’s just not worth your time and effort. Just Report and Block the person. It’s as simple as that.\nTop Writers / Popular Quorans. You will eventually see Quorans who have the Top Writer Tag on their profile or Quorans who have tens of thousands of followers and are immensely popular. Don’t aspire to be them. They are not aliens from another planet. They are just humans like you and me. Never get into a race to be a Popular Quoran. It’s just temporary. In the real world, no one will recognize you inspite of you having 50 thousand followers on Quora.\nFollowers. If you want followers, follow others too. If you want upvotes on your answers, upvote other answers too. If you want to get to know fellow Quorans, follow them, interact with them on their answers and commenting on it. Never inbox a Quoran unless they have specifically mentioned that they are open to messaging. Interacting with them on their answers are a great way to become familiar with them and eventually becoming friends with them.\nHonesty. Lastly, this is what I want to say. Just be your self. Be honest and truthful in your answers and who you really are. Just don’t fake it to be popular.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.47425
Habib F,5y,Why was the blog “Duly Blocked” deleted?,"Duly Blocked was something I started. On Quora, you’re not supposed to directly interact with the people who harass you. If you have a complaint against an individual, your only recourse is to report and block. This, especially if you’re the target of constant abuse, can be pretty demoralizing. The blog was an attempt to give people an opportunity to release some steam without actually showing the name of their harasser. You could document what you’d been on the receiving end of and get some validation and support from a friendly audience.

Troll Control Patrol was a bit more active. That was an attempt to develop a rapid response team to quickly identify and report trolls. The idea was that Moderation was clearly not acting quickly enough, and that with the help of some community policing, trollish behavior could come to their attention much faster.

They were both deleted because I was asked to delete them.

Many people believe that patrolling the trolls is tantamount to feeding them, and that the very publicity they generate encourages their behavior. Quora Moderation subscribes to this theory. I disagree. For me, community policing is the most effective form of policing. But this is not my site. And so, when I was asked to delete the blogs, I duly complied.

That’s about it. Some people are talking about taking the fight off site. I wish them well.

Content is King:

High-quality content: Focus on creating valuable, engaging, and informative content that resonates with your target audience. This will establish your blog as a reliable source of information and encourage people to share it.
Variety is key: Experiment with different content formats like articles, infographics, videos, and podcasts to cater to diverse preferences and keep your audience interested.

Engagement and interaction:

Share, share, share!: Share your blog posts on relevant social media groups, communities, and forums. Cross-promote your content across platforms to amplify reach.
Engage with your audience: Respond to comments and messages promptly, answer questions, and participate in discussions related to your niche. This builds rapport and encourages further engagement.
Collaborations: Partner with other bloggers or social media influencers in your niche to reach a wider audience and explore cross-promotion opportunities.

Additional tips:

Utilize social media analytics: Track your performance on each platform to understand what resonates with your audience and optimize your strategy accordingly.
Social media scheduling tools: Consider using scheduling tools to streamline your posting and ensure consistent presence across platforms.

Navin Kabra,10y,When is the best time to start a blog?,"Best time: 10 years ago.

You should absolutely not wait until you become an ""expert"" at something to start blogging about it. In fact, blogging about some topic is, in my opinion, the fastest and most robust (and enjoyable) way to go from being a beginner to an expert in any topic.

Writing a blog will force you to reasearch and learn about the topic. It will also put you in touch with other like-minded people. And, if you do reasonably well, it will put you in touch with the real experts from whom you'll be able to learn, by osmosis, if nothing else.

Ian Lang,2y,Why do vulgar posts visit more than scientific and literary posts?,"Because here’s the thing. Whenever I did scientific or technical copy, it would get a few readers who wanted to know what something did or how to make something do it. Usually it would go into filing cabinet somewhere and be dragged out three or four times a year if it was lucky. It was utilitarian, and being utilitarian, it was straightforward and bone-dry.

When I did humorous copy, it would go in a mag. Several thousand people would read it and laugh. Some would e-mail back.

Anybody who spends their life reading only serious work is in danger of becoming dull. Really, really dull. And people do not listen to the dull because it’s like listening to an automaton. Even if they don’t know the phrase “bon-mot” people do like a good bon-mot.

Vulgarity, when well done, is an art form in itself. Shakespeare was full of ‘em. Like Cleopatra’s hand maiden suggesting that Mardian the Eunuch might be better at billiards. Do you remember Dharma and Greg? There was an extended joke about whether Kitty’s cushion had made the embarrassing noise or whether it was a “blame the dog” incident. It was bloody hilarious. One episode of Fawlty Towers has Basil accidentally groping a young woman’s breast whilst looking for a light switch. Remember Allo Allo? Burlesque as all get out. Top BBC show for years on end.

People like to think when they’ve got to and laugh when they haven’t. Those that have little in the way of a sense of humour usually find they might be good at what they do but are social failures. We are not sheep. You don’t see sheep cracking off a willy gag at each other. Talking fauna likes to stop talking every once in a while and laugh. Everybody does it. Even the French. Even the Germans. Yes, the Germans. And they have mugs like this:

Socially, one has to appreciate a well-presented vulgarity. Otherwise one may be mistaken for an accountant. Or worse, a sociology student. Or worse still, a Californian, and if one is mistaken for such one might as well give up all hope of ever leading a normal life.

And thus, on Quora, a question I answered four hours ago and deliberately misinterpreted to make my answer about drag queens has had more views than a serious answer I did four days ago about the nature of comedy. People like to be entertained. You learn lots more when you laugh about it than you do when it’s a dry discourse.

Dhruvil Modi,Jan 13,"What are effective strategies for driving traffic to a new blog using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit?","Social media can be a powerful tool to propel your blog from obscurity to online stardom, but navigating the ever-changing landscape of each platform can be tricky. Let's explore some effective strategies for driving traffic to your new blog using Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit:

Facebook:

Join relevant groups and communities: Facebook groups are goldmines for targeted engagement. Find groups centered around your blog's niche and participate actively, sharing valuable insights and links to your blog posts. Don't just drop links and run – provide genuine contributions to establish yourself as a knowledgeable member.
Run targeted ads: Facebook's ad platform allows you to laser-focus your reach on demographics, interests, and even online behavior. Craft compelling ad copy and visuals that pique curiosity and entice users to visit your blog.
Host Facebook Live sessions: Offer live Q&A sessions, behind-the-scenes glimpses, or even educational tutorials relevant to your blog's theme. Live video is a great way to connect with your audience in real-time and build stronger relationships.

Twitter:

Hashtags are your friends: Research and strategically use relevant hashtags in your tweets to increase discoverability. Don't go overboard with #spam, but choose targeted hashtags that your ideal audience is likely to follow.
Engage in conversations: Twitter thrives on interaction. Reply to comments, participate in relevant threads, and retweet valuable content. This helps build your network and expose your blog to a wider audience.
Run Twitter polls and contests: Interactive content generates buzz and encourages engagement. Ask your followers questions related to your blog's topic or run simple contests with your blog posts as prizes.

Reddit:

Find your niche subreddits: Reddit is a treasure trove of communities on every imaginable topic. Find subreddits relevant to your blog and become an active member. Share valuable content, answer questions, and participate in discussions without being overtly promotional.
Submit your blog posts to relevant subreddits: Each subreddit has its own rules, so be sure to read them carefully before submitting your content. Choose subreddits where your posts would add value and avoid self-promotion without context.
Host Reddit AMAs (Ask Me Anything): Redditors love AMAs. Offer to answer questions about your blog's topic or your expertise in general. This can be a great way to generate interest and drive traffic to your blog.

Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day. Building a loyal following on social media takes time and consistent effort. Be patient, provide value, and engage authentically with your audience. Over time, you'll see your blog traffic steadily climb, fueled by the power of social media.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zpxk62finlcht41b', 'title': 'What are effective strategies for driving traffic to a new blog using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Social media can be a powerful tool to propel your blog from obscurity to online stardom, but navigating the ever-changing landscape of each platform can be tricky.

Samantha Josh,Oct 9,Is there any travel bloggers who wants to write a guest posts?,"As an expert from clonemyvoice.io, I can tell you that travel bloggers should stick to what they do best: traveling and sharing their experiences.

I mean, why would they want to waste their time writing guest posts when they could be exploring new destinations and creating amazing content?

Plus, with our voice cloning technology, they can even add a touch of their personality by narrating their travel stories in their own unique voice.

So, rather than writing guest posts, they can focus on what truly matters: captivating their audience with their authentic voice and inspiring them to embark on their own adventures.

Trust me, it's much more exciting than writing guest posts!

Geoffrey Verity Schofield,3y,How much money can I earn per each Medium article read on average?,"It actually pays really well — potentially. This article got picked up by Google, and got a big spike in external views (that top blue spike) then was distributed to Medium members.

16,200 internal views, and 715 dollars is 4–5 cents per internal view — and that’s about what I average, around 3–7 cents. External views don’t count for much — it’s the paying medium members that actually determine how much you get paid. You can see here this story started getting picked up by Google, which increases external views, but that doesn’t impact my bottom line.

The thing is, 4–5 cents per view is really good for the internet — if Quora was that generous, I’d be a multi-millionaire.

That’s 40–50 dollars per 1000 views — on YouTube, I’d earn 2–3 dollars per thousand views, and I’d have to put cringeworthy ads on my channel. On Medium, not so. And don’t even get me started about Quora, which has no monetization policy whatsoever for creators.

However, if you post without much of a following, and are not curated/distributed, you are far more likely to see something like this:

A bit of a barren landscape.

If you are starting out on Medium with no fanbase, you will see under a dollar per article in most cases. On Medium
, your fans directly contribute to how much you get paid — they get a membership, and their fees are distributed based on who they read.

So you might earn a thousand dollars per article or one cent, determined entirely by who is reading.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/daboytjs4k5hwc7n', 'title': 'How much money can I earn per each Medium article read on average?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It actually pays really well — potentially.

Zach,Updated 5y,How do you grab a reader's attention?,"By making some crazy claim that seems too good to be true.

Put your crazy claim and main steps in bold. This helps them stand out.
Insert a random stock image. People love images, and will definitely draw their attention. Images also summarize what you’re talking about, and is a great way to let the reader know what you’re talking about.
Give a random statistic. As of August 12, 2017, 100% of respondents agreed that Zach Norman is a horrible writer.[1]
Add a random footnote for your statistic. Gotta cite your sources.
Give a quote from some person who seems to know what they’re doing when they probably don’t. According to Zach Norman, “Everyone should eat more Chipotle. It’s amazing and is the best fast food you can get.”
Insert a random pie chart and some random explanation in italics.

As you can see from this image, very many people strive to either go to the gym, get rich, or get promoted as their New Year’s resolution, as can be assumed from this totally real chart.

In conclusion, use these simple steps to grab a reader’s attention and get those views, followers, and upvotes in no time! Also be sure to ask for followers and thank people for upvotes in italics or bold to really piss them off.

Akhilias Mardy,Jan 13,"What are effective strategies for driving traffic to a new blog using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit?","Some effective strategies for driving traffic using social media platforms:

1. Use healthful content

This tip is not related to social media marketing but it is the essential first step that sets up all the other steps listed here today for success! So the content you produce must be useful, containing unique information.

2. Intriguing title:

A little change in the tone and style of your posts' titles may get you more exposure. This is because often email or RSS feed subscribers of your blog may have subscribed to other blogs in your niche too. With overcrowded information lists in their feed reader or inboxes, a creative title may save you from getting lost in the crowd.

3. Integrate social media with your blog.

By integrating social media into your blog, we mean bridging the gap between popular social media sites and your content. People who visit your blog need an easy way to connect with your blog and share your blog content via social media elements that are integrated into your site.

4.Share your blog Across your social media platforms:

If readers are not coming to your site, go to them instead. Share your blog posts on as many social media sites as you can. You are probably already doing this, as it's not rocket science. But getting certain things right will help your efforts:

5. Whole post updates:

Unlike other social media platforms that allow only a few text characters in updates, some social media platforms like Google+ and Tumblr actually allow you to display the whole blog post. At the end of the post you can give a link to the original blog post URL and this will get you some quality social media traffic.

6.Create relationship with other blogger is common sense to be aware of other bloggers in your niche, but what can you do with that information to help promote your own blog? Here are a few quick tips to use other blogger's influences on your own blog's social media.

Read and share other bloggers' posts and drop comments on them via Twitter to either appreciate or acknowledge the information shared. Make sure to @mention the blogger's Twitter handle. You can also post comments on the post page, but this method will immediately let the blogger know who is commenting.

7.Social Bookmark your blog post.

Social bookmark your blog posts on high profile sites such as Digg, Stumble Upon, Delicious and Reddit, which have a good audience-base. But remember, this strategy has been overused in the past, so much so that social bookmarking is not as effective as it once used to b","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yu20nfaojie364lk', 'title': 'What are effective strategies for driving traffic to a new blog using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit?', 'score': {'original': 0.9847, 'ai': 0.0153}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Some effective strategies for driving traffic using social media platforms:\n\n1.

Matthew Bates,3y,What are some differences between writing on Quora and writing on Medium?,"Writing on Quora has two main advantages:

The writing prompts are given to you, and
It’s much easier to find an audience.

If you’re new to Quora and are getting bummed by a lack of views, the trick is to answer questions that have a lot of followers.

For example, this question has 40k+ followers:

What can I learn/know right now in 10 minutes that will be useful for the rest of my life?

Just by answering that, you’re guaranteed at least a small audience. (A lot of that 40k is bots or long-forgotten accounts, but still, some of them are real people with active accounts.)

Once you build a follower count of your own, even your answers to barely followed questions will get an audience. This answer of mine that you’re reading right now… as of the time I’m writing this, only two people are following this question. Yet, because I have followers of my own, this will likely get dozens of views and several upvotes within about five minutes of me hitting “submit.”

I was doing pretty well for myself on Medium at the beginning of the year … growing my audience at a steady pace and improving my writing and making a few bucks from it all. But I quit going to that site near the end of May. The “woke/let’s make everything about race” crowd was taking it over, and my homepage, despite my attempts to curate it to my liking, was still becoming more toxic every day.

Actually I just checked it, for literally the first time in two months. This is what I was met with:

Keep in mind that this is after several months of me being active on Medium every day, and doing my best to like certain things, and mute certain other topics and authors, to personalize my Medium experience. Despite that, I have:

112 notifications. I should probably look into those.
Three out of five stories on my landing page that are about race.
One that seems to be anti-cop, or at least is going with the “cops are racist” angle.
A story about a woman feeling empowered by seeing another woman doing yoga in the nude.

This is actually an improvement for Medium compared to the daily progressive dribble that drove me away from the site two months ago.

I’m not saying that there’s anything wrong with any of these stories; if that’s what people want to write about, and what other people want to read about, more power to them. I’m just saying that I’m not the target audience for those stories, and I’ve tried my best to help Medium’s algorithm figure that out, but it’s all been for naught. It insists on pushing these stories on me.

Perhaps there just aren’t enough stories on that site of the type I’d actually like to read.

Medium has two big advantages over Quora, as far as I can tell:

You can make money creating content there, and
Your content is more likely to get picked up by a publication there.

I have made a few hundred dollars from my Medium content this year. The content I wrote back in the beginning of the year still makes money for me every month. Just not enough to convince me to begin writing on that site again, for a while at least.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9fjzc1mexqaipo3n', 'title': 'What are some differences between writing on Quora and writing on Medium?', 'score': {'original': 0.9384, 'ai': 0.0616}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Writing on Quora has two main advantages:\n\nThe writing prompts are given to you, and\nIt’s much easier to find an audience.\n\nIf you’re new to Quora and are getting bummed by a lack of views, the trick is to answer questions that have a lot of followers.\n\nFor example, this question has 40k+ followers:\n\nWhat can I learn/know right now in 10 minutes that will be useful for the rest of my life?\n\nJust by answering that, you’re guaranteed at least a small audience.

Lorri Yurkowski,5y,Why did you choose to post or not to post your picture on your Quora profile?,"At the risk of sounding like a douchebag, I’ve posted my picture because, in general, I like my face.

I want to show that some disabilities are invisible on the surface. I don’t look like I’m visually impaired.

I very much am.

You never know what's going on with people only by looking at them.

I think we should all celebrate what we like about ourselves. There's enough toxic shit to contend with out there. Enjoy what you actually like about yourself without worrying too much, I say.

I know full well that some people may think it's a ploy for upvotes and attention. Sure, it helps in some ways. It also works against me, too.

Because of my appearance, some people assume I might be vapid or shallow.

I'm not. You can read my answers and see for yourself.

And, anyway, I like the Quoraverse a lot and don't mind who knows it. Everybody’s got their reasons for showing or not showing their faces here and I respect them all. (:

Avinash Sharma,7mo,Which post deserves at least 4 thousand likes?,,{'error': 'missing content request parameter'},
Mills Baker,Updated 9y,Why should (or shouldn't) you migrate your blog to Quora?,"As Joshua Heineman once wrote:

Creating a good blog is like writing a good book that no one reads past the first page. Creating a good blog is like hiding your treasure under piles of new treasure. Creating a bad blog is like burying your trash under piles of new trash.


One feature of Quora blogs that writers should value very highly, and which distinguishes Quora from other platforms: Quora surfaces content for reasons other than recency.

If you write something on Tumblr or Wordpress, your followers, RSS subscribers, and victims of your relentless cross-posting will see the post for minutes or hours, as it's slowly pushed down their dashboards, readers, inboxes, news feeds.

Your 10,000 word treatise, from the moment you post is, is expiring, decaying, fading from relevance, because most services and sites, due more to happenstance traditions of engineering and models, only care about recency.

As an author or creator, nothing is more frustrating than the web's inveterate indifference to quality when it's not associated with novelty. Only the new matters on Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, and the like. The most important criterion of your work isn't its depth or utility, its accuracy or thoroughness, its beauty or value. All that matters is: is it at the top of the page?

Quora is different: if you write something strong about, say, jazz, and in a few years a user joins Quora and follows the relevant topics and people, they may see what you wrote. And they should, because whether it's new is just one trivial dimension of a post's value! (Meanwhile: things I worked very hard on, pieces which people seemed fond of, are hidden forever from new Tumblr users, unless they decide to waste their lives in my archive).

Indeed: it is depressing that this arbitrary and contingent chronological bias dominates the web, because it hides great content underneath whatever's new, and it obliges creators to repost, reuse, repeat, and worst of all: give up on the creation of enduringly valuable work. I think the consequences are pretty significant.

Other blogging platforms incentivize constant content. And that emphasis exists in opposition to any real evaluation —systematic or human— of a post's quality.

So: Quora restores the value of older, excellent work. It rescues your writing from immediate irrelevance and the great forgetting that defines much of the Internet. It puts work in taxonomic and substantive contexts, and attempts to promote the good, not the new. I hope they're very successful.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xzg42ye0ldjqbwms', 'title': ""Why should (or shouldn't) you migrate your blog to Quora?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""As Joshua Heineman once wrote:\n\nCreating a good blog is like writing a good book that no one reads past the first page.

Sean Kernan,3y,How good of a writer do I have to be in order to write for Medium?,"You need to be at a point where:

You aren’t frequently messing up verb tenses or making other intermediate mistakes.
You understand the importance of Active Voice and idea/thought density.
You know how to structure an 800–1200 word article that is well organized, interesting, and not an information dump.

The latter point was my most difficult adjustment on the site when I started last year. Writing on Quora, we are used to having the topic handed to us and then writing 100–400 word blip answers.

I also had to lick my wounds initially. I’m so used to getting upvotes and praise on this platform that I thought my writing was better than it was.

The standards on Medium for writing are soooooo much higher than Quora (no offense). There aren’t “viral shitposts” on Medium like there are on Quora and Linkedin. It just doesn’t happen.

If your goal is to make money, you must be on top of your game. You need to push several high-quality articles per week that have original thoughts and ideas. If they don’t do well, you must evaluate why and pivot.

I’ve made great money on the site but I’ve been writing for a long time and I busted my butt writing and adapting on the platform this year.

Because there is legit money involved, Medium is very, very competitive. If English isn’t your first language, you’ll be facing an uphill battle as a writer. It won’t be impossible, some do it. But it will be very hard. I just don’t want people to waste their time.

Dan Senu-Oke,8y,Is the blogging business still a profitable one?,"Yes, it can be done. This question is akin to asking the following.. Can someone make money by starting their own business ?

David Abrams,6y,What are the best sites to use for guest blogging if you want your material to be seen by an entrepreneur?,"I think the best way to think about this is to narrow down to more of a strategic level.

Who is the exact customer avatar? You say you want to talk to an Entrepreneur - but that’s super wide. What type of entrepreneur, in what phase of business, with what needs? Make sure to dial this in and get super clear on it
What is your goal? Besides just getting eyes on your name, what are you actually wanting to accomplish? Visits to your website, checking out a product, personal branding, PR, or getting credibility etc…

This is key to understanding the traffic types and where to put your focus.
Make a list of blogs/websites that match your customer criteria. Things like SEMrush and competition checking sites can give you more data on the visitors, type of customers, and interactions on sites over time. This should be thought about for which ones to do.
Reach out to Company marketing teams / Guest blogging contact forms. There’s no reason to guest post on smaller websites that don’t serve the customer avatar or serve your goal, so mark those off the list. Once you find the right ones, you’ll want to find the best ways to reach out. I’ve had great luck emailing/finding the marketing team through contact/support channels or using things like RocketReach to find the emails. Then, I approach with already thoughtful ideas that would benefit THEIR target user (not benefit me).
Establish the relationship with great content. Don’t go in with a me, me, me attitude. People want guest posters who deliver great content to their audience which will get them more eyes, likes, shares, and traffic. Make sure you are writing great content with real value for the users.

This is the strategy we used and it worked great! Got lots of guest posting places and great traffic from them.

That said, we all got a lot of links and outreach using things like HARO (help a reporter out).

Sean Kernan,Updated 3y,Why does Sean Kernan think writing for Medium is better than writing for your own blog?,"One reason: $$$

You can make great money on that site. For so long, there were no centralized places to get paid for writing. It was blogger platforms where you’d get paid pennies per million views. Most people burn out after a few posts.

Companies get so cheap about paying for writing and then wonder why their platforms stagnate. It has happened over and over again. I could list the graveyard of dead companies. There’s a ceiling any company will eventually reach if they don’t optimize for content, which mandates paying good wages to content creators.

Now, to you writers, you aren’t guaranteed to make good money if you write on Medium. I do really well but it’s super competitive. There are a lot of talented people vying for traffic, which, for Medium, is exactly what they want. Good compensation creates a competitive dynamic that churns out quality content for readers.

If you work at it and want to make money, you certainly can. Don’t get salty if you don’t.

Sam W,5y,Why did you choose to post or not to post your picture on your Quora profile?,"You see my picture up there?

As of writing, it’s a lovely little drawing of a girl I made as concept art for an old story. Looks nothing like me.

Before that, I had another drawing that I imagine some people thought was close to my actual appearance, but it wasn’t.

Regardless of what they look like, I do like having something with a face for people to latch on. Even if the impression is far off from the reality, people tend to imagine me looking like that, if only slightly.

Now, as for my actual face. I have no real qualms about posting photos of myself:

…But I think pictures are misleading. Now that you’ve seen what I look like, what do you think of me?

You can see I’m young. My hair is a bit messy here. The lighting is bleaching my skin pastier than usual.

Whatever you're thinking, most people automatically make assumptions based on appearance.

It’s these assumptions I don’t want.

When I write something here, I want it to stand for itself. I want you to take it as it is, without making judgments based on who you think I am. I’m just the writer! The text is more important than me.

I don’t mind sharing pictures within an answer, because I can control which ones to post for a particular piece. But if I use one on my profile, it appears for every answer, comment, and blog post I make—which isn’t always what I want.

So instead I share artwork. It still creates a particular impression, but not in the same way as a photograph.

Chrysaor Jordan,2y,"Does the failure of Trump's blog ""From the Desk of Donald Trump"" represent Trump's entire career?","It’s symbolic of Trump’s previous career in business.

Louis Stevens,Sep 20,"Can I use Chat GPT search results on my blog after certain changes, or will I face copyright violation if I use it?","As an expert in the field, it's always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to copyright issues.

Instead of relying on questionable sources for content, why not unleash your inner creativity and come up with your own unique ideas?

Andrea Del Pico,6y,What are some ways I can promote my blog through instagram?,"Instagram is a great tool to attract readers to your blog. In fact, it is a great bridge between what your other platforms (such as your blog) represent and what you are offering in them as content.

Instagram is simpler, more concise and - for the record- more visually appealing.

To promote your blog, you could share its link in the biography and occasionally leave it in the description of your post every time you update it.

Try to find a good picture that represents the main idea of the blog entry.
Maintain an aesthetically pleasing feed. It is a lot of work, but it pays off. There’s a whole colour theory behind our unconscious choices.
Keep your blog relevant. Offer a good content, your main goal is to lead the visits to your blog, not for them to stay at your Instagram profile.

Allison Allen,Oct 2,Is starting a personal travel blog a profitable niche?,"As an expert at transcribethis.io, I can't help but roll my eyes at this question.

Oh, starting a personal travel blog, how original and groundbreaking!

It's not like there are already millions of travel blogs saturating the internet.

But sure, let's add another one to the mix because the world is clearly in dire need of more generic travel tips and sunset photos.

Now, let's talk about profitability.

Unless you've discovered a secret formula to turn mediocre travel stories into gold, chances are you won't be swimming in cash from your blog.

Sure, you might get a few free hotel stays or sponsored trips, but don't quit your day job just yet.

The travel blogging market is fiercely competitive, and unless you have a unique angle, captivating storytelling skills, and a massive following, it's unlikely to be a lucrative endeavor.

But hey, if you're passionate about sharing your travel experiences and don't mind the oversaturated market and the constant struggle for attention, go ahead and start that personal travel blog.

Just don't expect it to fund your luxurious globetrotting lifestyle anytime soon.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cjiex0lhrqg7on3b', 'title': 'Is starting a personal travel blog a profitable niche?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""As an expert at transcribethis.io, I can't help but roll my eyes at this question.\n\nOh, starting a personal travel blog, how original and groundbreaking!\n\nIt's not like there are already millions of travel blogs saturating the internet.\n\nBut sure, let's add another one to the mix because the world is clearly in dire need of more generic travel tips and sunset photos.\n\nNow, let's talk about profitability.\n\nUnless you've discovered a secret formula to turn mediocre travel stories into gold, chances are you won't be swimming in cash from your blog.\n\nSure, you might get a few free hotel stays or sponsored trips, but don't quit your day job just yet.\n\nThe travel blogging market is fiercely competitive, and unless you have a unique angle, captivating storytelling skills, and a massive following, it's unlikely to be a lucrative endeavor.\n\nBut hey, if you're passionate about sharing your travel experiences and don't mind the oversaturated market and the constant struggle for attention, go ahead and start that personal travel blog.\n\nJust don't expect it to fund your luxurious globetrotting lifestyle anytime soon."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1991277, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""As an expert at transcribethis.io, I can't help but roll my eyes at this question.\n\nOh, starting a personal travel blog, how original and groundbreaking!\n\nIt's not like there are already millions of travel blogs saturating the internet.\n\nBut sure, let's add another one to the mix because the world is clearly in dire need of more generic travel tips and sunset photos.\n\nNow, let's talk about profitability.\n\nUnless you've discovered a secret formula to turn mediocre travel stories into gold, chances are you won't be swimming in cash from your blog.\n\nSure, you might get a few free hotel stays or sponsored trips, but don't quit your day job just yet.\n\nThe travel blogging market is fiercely competitive, and unless you have a unique angle, captivating storytelling skills, and a massive following, it's unlikely to be a lucrative endeavor.\n\nBut hey, if you're passionate about sharing your travel experiences and don't mind the oversaturated market and the constant struggle for attention, go ahead and start that personal travel blog.\n\nJust don't expect it to fund your luxurious globetrotting lifestyle anytime soon."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Sean Kernan,2y,How do Medium writers make money?,"It’s a rather ingenious business strategy. It costs $5 a month to be a member on Medium. Writers are paid based on engagement from paying members. (Non-members do not generate any money for writers).

Until just recently, earnings were allocated by claps. As a simplified example, if a member clapped 1 time for the entire month and that clap was for Joe’s content, Joe got the $5.

If a member clapped twice that month, once for Joe, once for Sarah. Each of them got $2.5. The math scales in simple proportions to your claps.

It is a rather simple model to reward writers for producing quality content. In many ways, this looks to be the future of content creation.

And then — recently — things changed a bit. There was some gaming of the system with people surge clapping each other’s content to boost their position in the feed. And very likely there were other ridiculous, typical monetization tactics that we saw run rampant in Quora’s Partner Program.

Now —they recently changed the monetization plan. Writers on Medium will be paid based on reading time. If a member spends 1 minute on Joe’s content, Joe gets the $5, 1 minute on Joe’s AND 1 minute on Sarah’s, it is $2.5 each (over the course of a month).

So with your writing, more than ever, it is about getting people to spend the time to actually read what you’ve written. Respect their time. Ensure you are writing compelling posts that keep your readers engaged and not abandoning your post. Claps won’t be completely useless. They will still matter as a sign of positive engagement with your content, signaling to the algorithm that you are worth showing to other readers.

The future is focused on ‘voices’ in the publishing industry. It’s why so many journalism platforms are getting buried. People are more interested in the person they hear from than the platform. That’s why paid newsletters like Substack, and Facebook’s coming paid newsletter platform, and Newsbreak’s paid writing program are drawing in so many writers. There’s been a massive shift away from drawing in writers to write for free just for exposure.

People are actually getting paid and the platforms that pay writers are surging ahead of the other platforms. As of this posting, Medium is ranked 73 globally among websites and has been improving.

Quora is drifting back towards the 400s. It’s sad to watch.

Samantha Josh,Feb 5,Why do you think people buy travel books and published travelogues when there is so much good content available for free on blogs?,"While I understand the appeal of free content, there are several reasons why people still choose to buy travel books and published travelogues despite the abundance of free information on blogs.

First and foremost, the quality and reliability of free content can be hit or miss.

With so many bloggers and influencers vying for attention these days, it can be difficult to discern which sources are trustworthy and which ones are just trying to sell you something.

On the other hand, travel books and published travelogues are typically written by experienced travelers and experts in the field, who have spent years honing their craft and building their reputation.

Another advantage of travel books and published travelogues is that they offer a more curated and cohesive reading experience than most blogs.

Rather than having to jump from one site to another and piece together fragmented bits of information, readers can enjoy a seamless and engaging narrative that takes them on a journey from start to finish.

Furthermore, travel books and published travelogues often offer a level of depth and detail that is simply not possible on a blog.

With the space constraints of the internet, bloggers are often forced to keep their posts relatively short and sweet.

But in a book, authors have the freedom to delve into the history, culture, and nuances of a place in a way that is simply not possible in a short blog post.

So while I understand the allure of free content, I firmly believe that there is still a place for travel books and published travelogues in the world.

They offer a level of expertise, reliability, and depth that is simply not possible on a blog, and they provide a more cohesive and enjoyable reading experience for those who are looking to truly immerse themselves in a place.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yr0udxet9qg8j4ak', 'title': 'Why do you think people buy travel books and published travelogues when there is so much good content available for free on blogs?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'While I understand the appeal of free content, there are several reasons why people still choose to buy travel books and published travelogues despite the abundance of free information on blogs.\n\nFirst and foremost, the quality and reliability of free content can be hit or miss.\n\nWith so many bloggers and influencers vying for attention these days, it can be difficult to discern which sources are trustworthy and which ones are just trying to sell you something.\n\nOn the other hand, travel books and published travelogues are typically written by experienced travelers and experts in the field, who have spent years honing their craft and building their reputation.\n\nAnother advantage of travel books and published travelogues is that they offer a more curated and cohesive reading experience than most blogs.\n\nRather than having to jump from one site to another and piece together fragmented bits of information, readers can enjoy a seamless and engaging narrative that takes them on a journey from start to finish.\n\nFurthermore, travel books and published travelogues often offer a level of depth and detail that is simply not possible on a blog.\n\nWith the space constraints of the internet, bloggers are often forced to keep their posts relatively short and sweet.\n\nBut in a book, authors have the freedom to delve into the history, culture, and nuances of a place in a way that is simply not possible in a short blog post.\n\nSo while I understand the allure of free content, I firmly believe that there is still a place for travel books and published travelogues in the world.\n\nThey offer a level of expertise, reliability, and depth that is simply not possible on a blog, and they provide a more cohesive and enjoyable reading experience for those who are looking to truly immerse themselves in a place.', 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 4, 'credits': 1991268, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'While I understand the appeal of free content, there are several reasons why people still choose to buy travel books and published travelogues despite the abundance of free information on blogs.\n\nFirst and foremost, the quality and reliability of free content can be hit or miss.\n\nWith so many bloggers and influencers vying for attention these days, it can be difficult to discern which sources are trustworthy and which ones are just trying to sell you something.\n\nOn the other hand, travel books and published travelogues are typically written by experienced travelers and experts in the field, who have spent years honing their craft and building their reputation.\n\nAnother advantage of travel books and published travelogues is that they offer a more curated and cohesive reading experience than most blogs.\n\nRather than having to jump from one site to another and piece together fragmented bits of information, readers can enjoy a seamless and engaging narrative that takes them on a journey from start to finish.\n\nFurthermore, travel books and published travelogues often offer a level of depth and detail that is simply not possible on a blog.\n\nWith the space constraints of the internet, bloggers are often forced to keep their posts relatively short and sweet.\n\nBut in a book, authors have the freedom to delve into the history, culture, and nuances of a place in a way that is simply not possible in a short blog post.\n\nSo while I understand the allure of free content, I firmly believe that there is still a place for travel books and published travelogues in the world.\n\nThey offer a level of expertise, reliability, and depth that is simply not possible on a blog, and they provide a more cohesive and enjoyable reading experience for those who are looking to truly immerse themselves in a place.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

Kendra Morgan,Oct 2,How do travel bloggers make money?,"Making money as a professional travel blogger?

Ah, the million-dollar question!

Well, my dear aspiring travel blogger, let me burst your bubble and bring you back to reality.

First of all, forget about those glamorous Instagram influencers lounging on tropical beaches with their perfectly staged photos.

That's not the real world of travel blogging.

To make money as a travel blogger, you need to be a master of multiple trades.

It's not just about writing captivating stories and sharing pretty pictures; it's about hustling, networking, and constantly adapting to an ever-changing landscape.

You'll need to be a content creator, marketer, SEO expert, social media guru, and a salesperson all rolled into one.

Now, here's the harsh truth: the competition is fierce, and the market is saturated.

Everyone and their grandmother wants to be a travel blogger these days.

So, you better bring something unique, something extraordinary to the table.

Mediocrity won't cut it.

And let's not forget about the money side of things.

Sure, you might get some free hotel stays or sponsored trips, but that won't pay the bills.

If you want to make real money, you'll need to diversify your income streams.

Think affiliate marketing, sponsored content, brand collaborations, e-books, online courses, and maybe even selling your soul...

I mean, your expertise.

So, my friend, if you're still up for the challenge and willing to put in the blood, sweat, and tears, then go ahead and chase your dream of becoming a professional travel blogger.

But be prepared for a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, endless hours of work, and a reality that might not match those picture-perfect fantasies.

Good luck!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/k2hjicu6abterzq5', 'title': 'How do travel bloggers make money?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Making money as a professional travel blogger?\n\nAh, the million-dollar question!\n\nWell, my dear aspiring travel blogger, let me burst your bubble and bring you back to reality.\n\nFirst of all, forget about those glamorous Instagram influencers lounging on tropical beaches with their perfectly staged photos.\n\nThat's not the real world of travel blogging.\n\nTo make money as a travel blogger, you need to be a master of multiple trades.\n\nIt's not just about writing captivating stories and sharing pretty pictures; it's about hustling, networking, and constantly adapting to an ever-changing landscape.\n\nYou'll need to be a content creator, marketer, SEO expert, social media guru, and a salesperson all rolled into one.\n\nNow, here's the harsh truth: the competition is fierce, and the market is saturated.\n\nEveryone and their grandmother wants to be a travel blogger these days.\n\nSo, you better bring something unique, something extraordinary to the table.\n\nMediocrity won't cut it.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the money side of things.\n\nSure, you might get some free hotel stays or sponsored trips, but that won't pay the bills.\n\nIf you want to make real money, you'll need to diversify your income streams.\n\nThink affiliate marketing, sponsored content, brand collaborations, e-books, online courses, and maybe even selling your soul...\n\nI mean, your expertise.\n\nSo, my friend, if you're still up for the challenge and willing to put in the blood, sweat, and tears, then go ahead and chase your dream of becoming a professional travel blogger.\n\nBut be prepared for a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, endless hours of work, and a reality that might not match those picture-perfect fantasies.\n\nGood luck!"", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1991257, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Making money as a professional travel blogger?\n\nAh, the million-dollar question!\n\nWell, my dear aspiring travel blogger, let me burst your bubble and bring you back to reality.\n\nFirst of all, forget about those glamorous Instagram influencers lounging on tropical beaches with their perfectly staged photos.\n\nThat's not the real world of travel blogging.\n\nTo make money as a travel blogger, you need to be a master of multiple trades.\n\nIt's not just about writing captivating stories and sharing pretty pictures; it's about hustling, networking, and constantly adapting to an ever-changing landscape.\n\nYou'll need to be a content creator, marketer, SEO expert, social media guru, and a salesperson all rolled into one.\n\nNow, here's the harsh truth: the competition is fierce, and the market is saturated.\n\nEveryone and their grandmother wants to be a travel blogger these days.\n\nSo, you better bring something unique, something extraordinary to the table.\n\nMediocrity won't cut it.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the money side of things.\n\nSure, you might get some free hotel stays or sponsored trips, but that won't pay the bills.\n\nIf you want to make real money, you'll need to diversify your income streams.\n\nThink affiliate marketing, sponsored content, brand collaborations, e-books, online courses, and maybe even selling your soul...\n\nI mean, your expertise.\n\nSo, my friend, if you're still up for the challenge and willing to put in the blood, sweat, and tears, then go ahead and chase your dream of becoming a professional travel blogger.\n\nBut be prepared for a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, endless hours of work, and a reality that might not match those picture-perfect fantasies.\n\nGood luck!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

But if you're feeling a bit rebellious and want to go against the grain of generic travel blogs, then look no further than Not Your Average Globetrotter.

This theme breaks all the rules with its bold and unconventional design.

Just be prepared for others to question your taste in blog aesthetics.

Nathan Rich,8mo,Which is the best way to earn as a writer online?,"Just One Step Ahead

In case you are a beginner and curious how to earn cash online with no skills, experience, or beginning capital, you have asked an exceptional question.

The great news is that you don’t have to be the largest expert on the planet to begin making money online.

You merely need to be one step in front of someone else. And here’s how you can do it.

Uncovering Your Distinct Knowledge

First, you need to identify what precisely you know that others mightn’t.

It might be anything at all - how to fix a certain computer issue, how to grow a certain type of plant, how to cook a unique recipe, or even how to navigate a particular video game.

The secret is to find something that you’re confident in and that others might struggle with. This is your unique knowledge. This is where you are one step forward.

Converting Wisdom Into the Profits

Once you’ve identified your unique knowledge, the next step is converting this knowledge into a money-making online side hustle.

Assume you’re good at playing a particular video game and can conquer levels speedier than most people.

This is a skill that others could want to grasp. So, you could create an online course or a YouTube channel giving tips and guides on how to play that game more efficiently.

Uncovering the Winning Formula

The process of converting your knowledge into profits requires a lot of testing.

You’ll have to play around with different strategies, platforms, and techniques. But when you find a formula that works, hold to it.

Using our video game example. If you find that creating video tutorials on YouTube and promoting them on gaming forums draws in views and generates ad revenue, that’s your winning formula.

You should then focus on creating more like videos and engaging with your audience on these platforms.

Broadening Your Revenue Streams

Once you have a winning formula, you shouldn’t stop there. You need to investigate different ways to earn cash from your knowledge.

Using the same gaming example, you could write an digital book with gaming strategies, create a Patreon account for exclusive tips, or offer one-on-one coaching sessions for gamers.

These are different ways to broaden your income streams and raise your earnings.

Handling Your Money and Profits

The way you handle your money and profits is critical to your success as an online businessperson.

It’s essential to keep track of your earnings and expenses. Use a simple spreadsheet or an app to note down how much you’re making from each revenue stream and what your costs are.

This will aid you understand what’s working and where you can cut down costs.

As your online side hustle grows, you’ll start making more money. At this point, it’s prudent to reinvest some of your profits back into your side hustle.

This may be in the form of enhanced recording equipment for your YouTube channel, engaging a graphic designer for your ebook cover, or putting money in a course to learn advanced gaming strategies.

Recall, it’s not about how much money you make, but how much you retain. So, use wisely, save carefully, and invest smartly.

Final Thoughts

To wrap up, making money online as a novice without skills, experience, or starting capital is totally possible.

The key is to recognize that you don’t need to be a world-class expert. You only need to be one step ahead.

Find your unique knowledge, transform it into profits, find a effective formula, diversify your income, and manage your money wisely.

It’s a journey that calls for effort and persistence, but with the right mindset, you can indeed succeed.

Bear in mind, I’m sharing from my own experiences. I’ve established and scaled a number of online operations using these strategies.

It may not be the only way, but it’s a tried and tested method that has worked for me and can work for you too.

I’m always excited to share my knowledge with budding entrepreneurs. If you’d like more insights, tips, or resources, feel free to visit my profile.

David Alexander,4y,What are some tips on repurposing content?,"Content repurposing is probably the best way to increase the ROI of your content marketing budget and greatly increase its mileage.

Here are some of the best ways you can repurpose a blog article for example:

Turn it into a video, host the video on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, Instastories and use it to tap into massive audiences.
Create infographics that can be used in outreach and have a higher probability of earning backlinks than a wall of text.
Create a podcast based on your best content.
Take one blog post and break up the key 5–10 takeaways and turn each one into a separate social media update like tweets or Instagram images you share that you can create with canva.
When doing social repurposing consider the platform, you are better sharing longer pieces on platforms like Linkedin and Facebook than you are on Twitter.

Extra Tip: An added benefit of going back and repurposing your content is that you are forced to review your older content and this gives you a great opportunity to audit and potentially either purge, merge or improve the content. Ideally, it will be the latter and you can freshen up the content or go more in depth after looking at the competition and then begin the repurposing stage creating alternative versions of that content.

Read this full guide on Clever Ways You Can Repurpose Content To Earn More Traffic

If you find you have 4 or 5 articles that are short, not quite working out and closely related, consider repurposing these pieces into one ultimate guide and fill in the gaps to make sure it’s cohesive. You might find you have done 70% of the work on something excellent but the sum is greater than the parts.

Kelly Freddie,Feb 7,What would be the best way to monetize a community of travelers on Instagram if I don't have a blog or website yet?,"While I understand the desire to monetize a community of travelers on Instagram, I must caution against rushing into it without a clear strategy and a solid online presence.

In my experience, building a profitable business requires more than just a large following on social media.

One approach could be to collaborate with travel brands and destinations on sponsored content.

However, without a blog or website, you may find it challenging to secure these partnerships, as many companies prefer to work with influencers who have a more established online presence.

Another option could be to sell products or services directly to your followers, such as presets, e-books, or photography workshops.

However, this approach requires a certain level of expertise and a strong personal brand, which can be difficult to establish without a website or blog.

Ultimately, my advice would be to focus on building your online presence beyond Instagram.

Consider starting a blog or website to showcase your travel experiences, share your expertise, and connect with your audience on a deeper level.

Leonard Kim,Updated 9y,Why do some people choose to use Quora over writing a blog?,"I tried starting a Wordpress blog when I left my job as Vice President of Marketing at a startup in 2011.  I wrote 3 posts.  No one read it.  I quit.   I tried writing a few Facebook status messages that were long form in 2012.  I got like 7 likes per post.  That was high, considering that my normal post got maybe 1-2.   I gave Quora a try because I thought what the hell.  May as well try again.  My first month, I had 102 views.  Compared to what I got on my first three posts on Wordpress, that was actually... Phenomenal.  But then again, I didn't envision it taking off.   There is this thing called a promote feature on here.  One lovely lady, Erin, she decided to promote my one single post to 1,000 people.  It was like instant exposure.

The next month, I had 61,000 views on my content.  61 THOUSAND VIEWS MY THIRD MONTH.  It was basically insane.  Then it got even more insane.  It went up to 162,000 the next month, doubled again, and by now I have over 8 million views and I'm not even at my 1.5 year point yet.   Right now, I average 100,000 views a week on Quora.  My Wordpress blog I started in November or December?  That gets 4,000 views a month now.  Comparing the two, when it comes to view count, wordpress generates 1,000 a week.  Quora generates 100,000 a week.  That's about 100x more of a return than I get on Wordpress alone.  So the key word on why I write on Quora?  More exposure.

Debotosh Chatterjee,Updated 6mo,How can blogging help me in Civil Services exam preparation?,"I cleared the Civil Service Exam 2015 and have been an avid blogger for the last 5 years. Initially I used to write only for my blogs, when I was not an established freelance writer. Later, with more experience, I started writing for a number of websites and sports portals too. Even while preparing for the exam full time, I had kept my freelancing and blogging activities alive since I love writing.

How Blogging can be useful -

Sets you up nicely for UPSC Civil Service Mains examination, which takes up the lion’s share of marks in the exam. There are 9 written papers, each 3 hours long, and fine writing abilities are a pre-requisite for anyone who wishes to get through. I had prepared for only 8 or 9 months before taking the Mains exam, but managed to sail through mainly because of my blogging and writing activities in the last 5 years. The more you write (it can be anything - from politics to cinema to sports), the faster and better you will adapt to exam conditions in UPSC CSE Mains.
Easy pocket money - Once you have gathered enough experience, you can always try your hand at professional freelance writing. I did this, and it helped me keep a source of income alive. Gives you a good feeling when you are preparing for Civil Service and simultaneously getting your pocket money without much effort. Believe me, you can earn 3k to 4k per month quite easily by devoting 1 hour per day to freelance writing.
Stimulates you intellectually - Speaking from personal experience, I have learnt a lot from my writing hobby. A very important trait for a Civil Service aspirant is analytical reasoning - you must be able to quickly analyze things and come up with fool proof decisions. The exam tests this ability in aspirants at every stage - Prelims, Mains, Interview. A regular blogger/writer will know how sharp his analyzing skills have become, courtesy writing which involves thinking deeply on many issues!

Edit : My 1st book - 8 Things To Do When You Turn 20 - has now been published.

Jamie Perkins,Jan 7,What are some tips for finding a good travel blogger to collaborate with?,"When looking for a travel blogger to collaborate with, there are a few key tips to keep in mind.

First, consider their audience and engagement.

A blogger with a large, active following is more likely to provide valuable exposure for your brand.

However, it's important to look beyond just the numbers.

Take a closer look at the quality of their content and the engagement they receive from their followers.

Are their followers genuinely interested in what the blogger has to say, or are they just there for giveaways and freebies?

Another important factor to consider is the blogger's niche and style.

Do they align with your brand and target audience?

A luxury travel brand, for example, may not want to collaborate with a budget travel blogger.

And a blogger who focuses on adventure travel may not be the best fit for a brand that caters to families.

Lastly, don't be afraid to reach out to bloggers who may not have a huge following, but have a strong, engaged community.

These bloggers may be more open to collaborations and have a more loyal and dedicated audience.

In summary, when looking for a travel blogger to collaborate with, consider their audience and engagement, niche and style, and willingness to collaborate.

And remember, bigger isn't always better – sometimes, a smaller, more engaged following can be more valuable for your brand.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bdf1tseh4amgz3q5', 'title': 'What are some tips for finding a good travel blogger to collaborate with?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""When looking for a travel blogger to collaborate with, there are a few key tips to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, consider their audience and engagement.\n\nA blogger with a large, active following is more likely to provide valuable exposure for your brand.\n\nHowever, it's important to look beyond just the numbers.\n\nTake a closer look at the quality of their content and the engagement they receive from their followers.\n\nAre their followers genuinely interested in what the blogger has to say, or are they just there for giveaways and freebies?\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the blogger's niche and style.\n\nDo they align with your brand and target audience?\n\nA luxury travel brand, for example, may not want to collaborate with a budget travel blogger.\n\nAnd a blogger who focuses on adventure travel may not be the best fit for a brand that caters to families.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to reach out to bloggers who may not have a huge following, but have a strong, engaged community.\n\nThese bloggers may be more open to collaborations and have a more loyal and dedicated audience.\n\nIn summary, when looking for a travel blogger to collaborate with, consider their audience and engagement, niche and style, and willingness to collaborate.\n\nAnd remember, bigger isn't always better – sometimes, a smaller, more engaged following can be more valuable for your brand."", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 3, 'credits': 1991174, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""When looking for a travel blogger to collaborate with, there are a few key tips to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, consider their audience and engagement.\n\nA blogger with a large, active following is more likely to provide valuable exposure for your brand.\n\nHowever, it's important to look beyond just the numbers.\n\nTake a closer look at the quality of their content and the engagement they receive from their followers.\n\nAre their followers genuinely interested in what the blogger has to say, or are they just there for giveaways and freebies?\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the blogger's niche and style.\n\nDo they align with your brand and target audience?\n\nA luxury travel brand, for example, may not want to collaborate with a budget travel blogger.\n\nAnd a blogger who focuses on adventure travel may not be the best fit for a brand that caters to families.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to reach out to bloggers who may not have a huge following, but have a strong, engaged community.\n\nThese bloggers may be more open to collaborations and have a more loyal and dedicated audience.\n\nIn summary, when looking for a travel blogger to collaborate with, consider their audience and engagement, niche and style, and willingness to collaborate.\n\nAnd remember, bigger isn't always better – sometimes, a smaller, more engaged following can be more valuable for your brand."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
