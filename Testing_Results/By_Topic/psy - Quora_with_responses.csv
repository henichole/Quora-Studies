Saagar Varma,Updated 5y,What made you feel proud today?,"The bell rang. My order was here.

I opened the door and received the parcel from the delivery boy.

The app had notified me that his name was Rehan. As is my usual tradition, I said “Thank you Rehan! Would you like a glass of water?”

To my surprise, first he smiled and then started tearing up. I was taken aback. I invited him inside to sit and handed him a glass of water.

Once he looked relaxed, I asked him, “What happened? Is everything okay?”

He said, “Sir, I deliver atleast 15 orders everyday, nearly 6 days a week. Not one person addresses me by my name, let alone offers a glass of water. I have come to Mumbai only 2 months back and after a long time, I felt like someone actually cared, even if only for a second. So Thank YOU!”

I smiled and told him, “You should thank my mom. She actually keeps juice/chaas(buttermilk) packets to giveaway, especially during the summer as you guys drive around in the sweltering heat. This is the least I can do.”

He looked at me and said, “Sir, please thank her on my behalf.” Saying that, he smiled and left.

In that moment, I was filled with pride for my mom :)

It’s funny, isn’t it? How you subconsciously pick habits from your parents. And how sometimes, even the tiniest of gestures can make a sizeable impact.

Avrup Preya,Updated 3y,What are some small things that matter a lot?,"I am in relationship with this really cute guy. He is sweet, caring and supportive to the core. The only thing he lacks sometimes is his ability to express and be vocal about his feelings, which is sometimes little frustrating and other times even the slightest of the gesture brings butterflies to my stomach.

A little about me…Well I used be a software engineer, until one day I decided to quit my 9to5 job and start a business of my own. The decision was huge without the easy approval of my parents.

He pushed me towards my passion even though it would cost us living in separate cities. Amidst all these emotional and financial turmoil, I started my own small restaurant in my hometown.

Like most of the budding entrepreneur, my journey was full of failure, hardships and challenges.

During my initial days as the restaurant owner, my per day sale was as low as 106 Rupees. On one such day when I was feeling really low and mixed feeling of sadness,despair, doubt and regret crept in, I texted him

Him: what's your lowest sale?

Me: 106 Rupees. I guess the lowest sale record will be broken today. I was able to sell coffee of worth Rupees 90 only!!

*He immediately transfered 500 into my business bank account*

Me : 500??

Him: Your lowest sale record shouldn't be broken.

It wasn't the 500 rupees that mattered, it was his faith in me and gesture that said “I got your back” that put a smile on my face for the rest of the day .

It has been one year since this message, and yes 106 is the lowest sale till date. I have come a long way from 106 to upto 10k sale per day, but I still remember that day and his small effort to boost my spirit!!

That's the small thing which mattered a lot to me !

Edit 1 -

Thanks everyone for the overwhelming reponse to the answer.

All those who wanted to know the name of my restaurant —its Foodiyapa, a small fast food joint in ranchi. Amidst all struggles and hardships, Foodiyapa is growing inch by inch everyday. Very happy to let you guys know, Foodiyapa was ranked 1 in 2019 by threebestrated. in

All those who wanted to know current story-

Yes this happened!!!

And we are no longer in a long distance relationship since he also quit his job to follow his passion (he is a musician by the way), and we combined our passions to open a music themed cafe in the city called “Beats and Beans”. Here's the glimpse

Thanks a lot everyone for well wishes. If at all you get a chance to visit ranchi.. Please visit us, we will be very happy to host you!!

EDIT -2

Well life is not always same!! is it?

While we had just started blooming with our new outlet, Year 2020 happened. Due to pandemic, restaurant dine-in was closed for almost 6 months. Although we were operating through take aways, we were hardly able to sustain ourselves. Our close ones who once stood strong on our side, now looked at us with doubt and everyone had this to say “if you people hadn't quit your jobs”.

Although I was under a lot of pressure and stress and monetarily burdened, I did not regret my decision which I took 3 years back, because I loved what I did and I still do.Though situation was bad but it was easier to deal this time because I had him with me close and strong. Instead of looking back we had to think of ways to get our business back on feet.

At desperate times, we started delivering veggies and fruits through Swiggy and Zomato, but that was not enough.

Finally we decided to give up one of our outlet space and merge them since we were struggling to pay rent for both the spaces and our landlord was not so supportive. The decision was not easy, specially when we got to know our landlord was waiting to rent out the space to another food joint the moment we left. But we had to take a decision what we thought was wise at that time without letting emotion on our way.

So here's our new merged outlet Foodiyapa + Beats and Beans = FOODIYAPA Upbeats :)

We did not spend much on interiors as we used all our old stuff to renovate the store. Renovation was necessary as we were merging the low rate fast food joint with our sophisticated continental cafe setup.

I am very thankful , as I had group of awesome friends who were home during covid who helped us redesign our cafe.

The coffee bar :

Happy Customers :)

At the end, thank you all for 20k+ upvotes and all the best wishes!!

Those in Ranchi or planning to visit, hoping to see you here sometime :)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qtal2xe850uhsg6c', 'title': 'What are some small things that matter a lot?', 'score': {'original': 0.67535, 'ai': 0.32465}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am in relationship with this really cute guy.

Kartik Nagare,Updated 4y,What psychological trick changed your life?,"Scenario:

I am working in the IT sector.

In my last company I made some blunder. My manager got furious. He called me in the meeting room and started bashing me like anything.

He was literally shouting at me.

Whatever happened wasn't just my fault. My other teammate was also involved in it. He was senior to me and on his suggestions I made some changes which corrupted some functionalities of the system. I was a fresher and it's been just 6 months I had joined the company.

Any normal person and so I, had three options.

Explain my manager that it wasn't just my fault. Other person was also involved. Thus, I could make him cool down a little bit by shifting half of his rage on other person. That would have spoiled my relation with other person.
I argue with him that it wasn't my fault at all and he shouldn't shout at me like this. This would have spoiled my relation with both manager and other person.
I should take the complete responsibility of what happened and thus save other person. This would lead management questioning about my technical abilities.

What I did:

I simply listened.

I didn't say a word. I stared at him blankly without any emotions. I took all his bashing. He kept shouting for literally 15 minutes and I didn't argue, didn't give any explanation, didn't take any responsibility.

I listened and listened and listened.

When he stopped talking, I said 'sorry, I won’t let this happen again' and then walked off the room.

After lunch he called me again.

This time he was very polite. He smiled at me. He asked if I am ok. He then explained me everything very calmly that this is very critical project and we have to be careful blah blah.

The anger, the rage he had was completely gone. He was Bruce Banner again :p.

At that time I told him that whatever I did, I did on the suggestions of other senior person. Then I told, I also take the responsibility and I don't want that you take this matter to other person which might lead spoiling our relation.

He was thoughtfull for a moment and then he again smiled at me and said be careful next time and take care. I smiled back and left the room.

Psychological trick:

When someone is angry don't fight back. Listen what they say. Even if they say very disgusting or humiliating things, keep your calm and endure.

After a while the rage will lead to the guilt and guilt will lead to an apology. And believe me that person will never shout or be angry on you ever again.

It works every single time.

Hope this helps.

Happy reading!

Edit:

I hope this would answer many doubts asked in the comments.

I kept the answer short.

Even if my manager wouldn't have called me after lunch, I would have gone to him and explained what had happened when he would be calm.

The point is, had I argued with him when he was in rage, things would never be in my favour.

This does not mean not to speak up is a weakness.

For those people who are saying, not everyone is as matured as my manager and some they will take advantage. At that point we should put our point sharply (rather than politely) but only when other person is calm and could think sensibly.

That's what I believe!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7w6n2emfurvbdxy3', 'title': 'What psychological trick changed your life?', 'score': {'original': 0.56065, 'ai': 0.43935}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Scenario:\n\nI am working in the IT sector.\n\nIn my last company I made some blunder.

Deepa Naidu,Updated 4y,What are some small things that matter a lot?,"Few years ago, my husband tattooed our daughter's name on his wrist while he was out on a trip with his friends. He returned from the trip and showed us the tattoo.

My son sulked when he saw that only his sister's name has been tattooed and not his; though he forgot about it the moment he saw chocolates and toys which his dad bought for him (my practical son….hahaha).

My daughter became emotional, hugged her dad, kissed him on his forehead as she always does and asked him if it was painful.

My husband replied, “ I can bear any pain for you dear"".

I don't know what happened to her after that, her attitude towards him changed a lot.

She started behaving as if she was his mom. She was already behaving as a mom to her brother, but now her dad too.. ( my inner voice was,”what is my role then??”)

She started taking too much care of him. She never gets angry when he is mad at her.

She would ask him how his day was? Did he have his food? If he sneezes(he is allergic to dust, so he often sneezes), she runs to get Vicks Vaporub and applies it on him.

She never demands things from him, sometimes when my son pesters for something, she will chide him and say, “Arjun, don't disturb papa, he will get you what you want when he is free”.

At first I thought that all this will only be for a span of a few weeks or months and after that she will not be this emotional and will be back to her usual old self, that is, sulking when refused to buy her something.

About 9 or 10 months ago, she was lazily getting ready for school. Her dad shouted at her for being so lazy in the morning. He said, “I hate this Sanju, how can you be so lazy at the start of the day, how will your day be then?”.

She just smiled and got ready. I asked her if she was okay. She just nodded her head and left for school.

1 hour later, I got a call from the school. The receptionist said that my daughter was having fever and has vomited twice. They asked me to pick her up from school. I called her dad to inform him and to ask him to pick her up, but his call didn't connect even after trying for multiple times .

I then took my scooter and went to pick her up. After reaching her school, I picked her up and we were heading towards our home.

As we were both returning I asked her, “If you were not feeling good you could have said to me dear, I wouldn't have sent you to school. Were you feeling bad that your dad shouted at you, so you didn't say anything ?”

She was sitting behind me holding me tight, and resting herself completely on me.

The reply she gave me made me emotional.

She said, “No amma(mom), I will never feel bad for anything that dad says. Yes, he doesn't understand sometimes and shouts but he loves me a lot amma. If he didn't love me at all, would he have bore that pain and got a tattoo of my name?” (She didn't know about labour pains yet, so maybe his pain was too much for my daughter).

The moment she said that, tears started rolling out of my eyes.

“Can a girl who is only 8 yrs old(she was 8 when this happened, she turned 9 this May) think so much? Can she understand love and affection? How can she be so selfless? Can one small tattoo be so powerful?” I murmured to myself.

Yes, sometimes small things matter a lot.

This small tattoo matters a lot to both my daughter and her dad.

Life is beautiful. Let's make it more beautiful with such moments and memories.

Edit 1: Thank you everyone for all the love that you have showered on my daughter.

And to the people who were feeling sorry for my son, my son won't get emotional or feel anything like my daughter did for tattoos.

This is what makes him emotional. I gave him a surprise on his birthday this August. Again, small things matter. Here are his emotional reactions… screenshots from FB…

Thank you all.

Lots of love from my family to each and everyone. :-)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vy0bqdlz4nf8ua9x', 'title': 'What are some small things that matter a lot?', 'score': {'original': 0.68435, 'ai': 0.31565}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Few years ago, my husband tattooed our daughter\'s name on his wrist while he was out on a trip with his friends.

Sidharth Srivatsav,Updated 5y,What are some small things that matter a lot?,"It was a hot summer afternoon in the month of May.

I was riding on my bike to home. A man who may be in his early 50s asked me for a lift. He was sweating profusely and needed to reach home. As his house was on the way I was going in, I gave him a lift.

He explained to me that, his sugar levels are dropping and need to reach home fast. I dropped him off at his home and he thanked me whole heartedly. I got back home and forgot about it.

After a month, a small hotel was opened nearby. I went there to try it out. I was checking out the menu and someone tapped on my shoulder from behind. He was the same man whom I gave lift earlier.

He asked me if I had recognized him. I said no. He explained that I gave him lift a month ago. Then, I recollected him. He asked me, what would I like to eat. I was surprised.

He giggled and said that, he is the owner of that hotel and as a token of gratitude I can have anything for free. I politely refused it but he was stubborn in his offer. So, I gave in.He asked the chef to make the best of the dish I ordered and was given for free.

That day, I realized, the good you do however small, goes far.

Any small help you do to people will for ever be engraved in their minds forever and it comes back to you in the ways you can never imagine.

So, don't stop doing good and spreading smiles!

Zipho Tefu,Updated 3y,What are some psychological facts that people don't know?,"Loss Aversion.

Have you ever wondered why so many companies like YouTube and Spotify are always offering you free trials to their premium services?

Picture this:

You're listening to your favorite playlist on Spotify while doing your work. You've been working for half an hour straight. You're in the zone.

Suddenly a pesky ad for Spotify premium comes on, in the middle of your Playlist, completely ruining your flow of concentration.

The ad offers you a 3 month free trial to Spotify premium.

Unlimited skips, the ability to download music and best of all: NO ADS.

That last part sounds particularly appealing. Up until this point you've just been tolerating the ads. It hasn't been the worst and you've gotten used to it, but it sure would be nice to go 3 months without it.

You really don't need premium, but hey, it's free right? You can just cancel your subscription before the free trial ends.

So you get the free trial.

And for the next 3 months you enjoy splendid high quality downloadable music with unlimited skips and NO ADS to interrupt your flow of focus.

It's amazing.

Life is good.

But the free trial is about to expire.

Oh no! You can't live without your downloaded ad-free music! You can't go back to the old days of not getting to play the song you wanted! Or listening to pesky advertisements!

So what do you do?

You succumb.

You pay the monthly fee and renew your premium subscription.

And the marketing team at Spotify HQ cheer as the numbers of the premium members increases.

You've just fallen prey to a very powerful psychological trick.

Loss aversion.

It plays on the human fact that:

You're more afraid of losing something you already have than you are of not gaining something you don't have.

You could've survived just fine without Spotify premium BEFORE you tried it. But once you did, you didn't want to lose it.

This trick is everywhere ranging from companies offering free trials to parents disciplining their children.

It's been proven to be more effective to threaten to TAKE something away from your child, than it is to say you're not going to GIVE them something.

So parents, instead of offering your child a Playstation or new phone for doing something, get them that device and then threaten to take it away if they don't do that thing.

And next time you see a free trial to something, remember they're probably pulling the same trick on you.

You can just cancel your subscription before the free trial ends.\n\nSo you get the free trial.\n\nAnd for the next 3 months you enjoy splendid high quality downloadable music with unlimited skips and NO ADS to interrupt your flow of focus.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nLife is good.\n\nBut the free trial is about to expire.\n\nOh no! You can't live without your downloaded ad-free music! You can't go back to the old days of not getting to play the song you wanted!

Manju Gangadhar,Updated 6y,What are some psychological facts that people don't know?,"Does it really matter which type of clock we are using?

Yes! It does.

Reason is “Those who use ‘Analog clock’ are more aware of the ‘time spent’ & the ‘time left’ than those who use Digital clock”.

How? Is what your question right?

Here we go. Let’s have a look at the digital clock.

What did we get? The time is 9:30 & that’s it. Only the current time.

Now, Analog clock.

Just look at it. Look at how beautiful it is. What do we observe here? 11:55. That’s it? No. But along with the ‘current time’ there is something else.

This we sense by intuition. An Analog clock resembles a pie chart which can represent self-expressive data.

Intuition matters! It is the advantage of having Analog clock.

This is not so easy with digital clocks. Because we need to force our brain to calculate the ‘time spent’ ,‘time left’, etc.

Sahil Dev,6y,How can I increase my creativity?,"Hello, you can increase creativity by working on these two skills:

Observation

You should have good observation skill. Because we can’t create anything out of nothing. We play with colors, words, objects in order to make any creative art or product. So without good observation, you can’t make something creative out of those things.

Imagination

As I used to say people there is a cycle in order to come up with awesome ideas Observe-Imagine-Create. Let your imagination fly, don’t restrict it. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. And try not to go with the first idea which you get because if it’s easy for you then it’s easy for everyone. Do iterations as many as possible before finalizing any design or artwork.

Example

While watching a cricket match, I observed that there is a shoe icon forming in between letter T & S of Hotstar logo.

Now with this observation I created a logo for a hypothetical shoes business “Trendy Shoes”.

So follow this simple rule Observe-Imagine-Create in order to increase creativity because there are no tutorials for this.

Ankita Srivastava,Updated 4y,What is the difference between an intelligent person and a wise person?,"I am sitting at a coffee shop.

I have a meeting in an hour and I am just spending some time with myself before the client arrives.

There’s a couple sitting right in front of me.

They are so close that I can also see what is their phone’s wallpaper.

I am sure that they were having a good time. Holding hands, giggling they looked beautiful and really sophisticated.

Anyway,

There wasn’t a lot of rush at that hour and we were pretty much the only people along with a few waiters.

Suddenly, the girl bangs on the table.

It was so quiet that it felt like a bomb had dropped.

I didn’t look up. I wanted none of them to feel embarrassed. So I keep looking at the art on my coffee.

The argument heated up and the girl now started shouting.

The guy is still quiet. He is angry, looks disgusted but he is quite unlike girl.

I don’t know what they were fighting about but here’s what I make out of this.

An intelligent person knows so much that it knows nothing, leaves you hanging upside down, mouthing knowledge as your heart falls out of your mouth - Anne.

But,

A wise man knows when to use his intelligence. He knows when to be silent.

To me the guy is wise. He could have said anything and made the scene more dramatic.

Instead, he thought one of us should be silent and since she is not I will be.

Josh Fechter,Updated 7y,How can I become charismatic?,"“What’s wrong with you?” My girlfriend yelled.

“I just have a lot of friends.”

She was jealous. Every girl had their attention drawn to me.

Several years earlier I had only one friend.

My sister started dating my best friend who happened to be the coolest guy in my high school. He threw every party and everyone wanted to take my place as his best friend. When the opportunity came, they did.

I didn’t want them to date. I didn’t think he was right for her and their relationship made me feel awkward. I stopped talking to both of them.

I never got invited to another high school party.

I ate lunch alone.

I went ahead and destroyed all my relationships because I made people choose sides.

They didn’t choose me.

Things got worse when I broke three bones in my ankle during football practice. I lost all my prospects for playing college ball. I could feel myself slipping down this endless spiral of hopelessness.

But then, I made one friend. He had zero friends just like me. I didn’t understand why. When I got to know him, he seemed interesting and enjoyed many of the same things I did.

Most of our conversations were about how we didn’t like anyone at our school and when we’d go to the beach (we lived in San Diego).

We helped each other get through the year until we made it to college.

A year later, I had just finished pledging my fraternity. My sister’s boyfriend wanted to pledge the same fraternity I was in. I had the leverage to prevent him from joining because I was now “officially” a brother.

This is the moment to get my revenge!

The problem was he wanted to join with his many friends. If he didn’t pledge, none of them would. My fellow brothers didn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to grow the fraternity, so we negotiated.

At first, I was stubborn and didn’t want any of them to join. After a couple of weeks, I caved in. I was tired of fighting.

I was close to alienating half my fraternity house from wanting to become friends with me. I tried to control people. I was wrong.

Realizing I almost lost all my friends again gave me doubt to whether I was even right about my actions. So, I began studying the art of social interaction. I read many books and watched hundreds of YouTube videos.

Soon after, I wrote an apology letter to my sister and her boyfriend. I explained I’d grown as a person and I was wrong not to talk to them.

Next, I began focusing on improving my social skills. I went through much trial and error. I tried pickup lines and rehearsed jokes. It didn’t feel right. There’s a lot of noise on the Internet about what you should do to become charismatic.

Eventually, I found something that worked well for me.

I decided I would be unapologetically myself, happy-go-lucky, and not control other people. I would live life in the moment while letting others live their lives.

This simple notion brought a profound sense of calm and happiness to my life. I stopped caring about what others thought or did. Everything in my mind freed up. I became more creative, a better storyteller, and saw more beauty in the little things.

I never complained, argued, or felt the need to become someone I was not. People could sense the positive energy from me. My new demeanor said, “Hey, I love life. I love making friends. Come talk to me.”

I didn’t even need to say these words. Every movement and every word I spoke implied them. I even had a more genuine smile.

I became the guy who would be the first to say hello, make someone get out of their comfort zone and laugh about it later. I remember going to parties where people would gravitate towards me.

I simply decided to stop trying to control people; instead, I focused on living in the moment while being myself. With no negative thoughts swirling around in my head, I took more action.

I became the first guy to start dancing with girls at parties even though I had no idea how to dance.

Even if I was a terrible dancer, everyone loved it. People were there to have fun. I just happened to have the courage to start the fun. Eventually, all my friends thought I was the most charismatic person they knew.

Soon, I realized there were few people like me.

I remember the day before I broke up with my girlfriend. She was upset because she couldn’t control me. I wasn’t wild. I just attracted a lot of attention because of my positive energy. If I wanted to be with her, I’d have to stop going to parties and other fun events.

She wanted me to choose sides. She reminded me a lot of the person who I’d been.

I chose myself.

These small incidents have propelled me to find others who live life joyously, embrace themselves, and don’t try to control people.

There may not be many of these charismatic people around you.

Go find them.

They’ll guide you.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/be32tifz7vo84asg', 'title': 'How can I become charismatic?', 'score': {'original': 0.4686, 'ai': 0.5314}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“What’s wrong with you?” My girlfriend yelled.\n\n“I just have a lot of friends.”\n\nShe was jealous.

Josh Fechter,Updated 5y,How do I develop razor-sharp focus?,"I read 170 business books in a year.

After the tenth book, I became an addict.

My entire routine was built around reading.

I’d wake up at 5 a.m., then read for three hours before work.

Ten minute lunch break?

I’d read.

Two hours before I’d go to sleep?

I’d read.

I couldn’t stop.

I skipped events with friends, family, and even the gym.

All I could think about is one more page.

Razor-sharp focus.

It got darker -

When I wasn’t reading, I got anxious.

It’s like I was a homeless addict and a drug had been taken away from me.

What I realized -

I had built reading into my routine.

After the second week of reading five hours every day, no longer did it feel like a chore. My body and mind were adjusted. It craved more of it.

What I learned is that sharp focus is built on addiction.

You know you’re addicted when you have a compulsive feeling to do something.

It’s not a bad feeling.

It’s what keeps a NBA player motivated to train every morning at 5 a.m.

A physicist solving some of the most complex math equations.

A doctor working 18 hrs. a day to care for their patients.

Most of us have this feeling many times a day.

I need to close another sales deal.

I need to eat another candy bar.

I need another cup of coffee.

I need to surf today.

We all have addictions because we all have routines.

And routines foster addiction - the core element of razor-sharp focus.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fs1ei63akhtx8pdw', 'title': 'How do I develop razor-sharp focus?', 'score': {'original': 0.9982, 'ai': 0.0018}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I read 170 business books in a year.\n\nAfter the tenth book, I became an addict.\n\nMy entire routine was built around reading.\n\nI’d wake up at 5 a.m., then read for three hours before work.\n\nTen minute lunch break?\n\nI’d read.\n\nTwo hours before I’d go to sleep?\n\nI’d read.\n\nI couldn’t stop.\n\nI skipped events with friends, family, and even the gym.\n\nAll I could think about is one more page.\n\nRazor-sharp focus.\n\nIt got darker -\n\nWhen I wasn’t reading, I got anxious.\n\nIt’s like I was a homeless addict and a drug had been taken away from me.\n\nWhat I realized -\n\nI had built reading into my routine.\n\nAfter the second week of reading five hours every day, no longer did it feel like a chore.

Sharvani Musandi,Updated 5y,What's the biggest friendship killer? Or any examples?,"When I was in 8th standard, I had a friend named Priyanka.

We were benchmates. We never cared about other girls in the class. We enjoyed each others company. From having lunch together, helping in studies, going to tuitions on a bicycle, working on a project together and securing first prize in it, sharing our success and watching other girls feel jealous of us!

We were ‘Best friends forever'.

I still remember while creating my Gmail ID, my password was her name followed by her mobile number because I knew I can never forget that! And I never told her about it!

After 10th she chose science stream and I chose diploma in EC. Her college was too far from my hometown, so we didn't meet for 3 years. In those days, her college didn't allow cell phones, so she rarely called me. But she always wrote letters to me.

Yes, it was in 2010 when we both used to write letters to each other. I still remember the day when she called me on my birthday but didn't wish me because she is very bad at remembering birthdays! I didn't mind though, I didn't say her that it was my birthday, I was happy that she remembered me and gave a call!

She completed her college in 2012 and joined engineering college in her hometown. I completed my diploma in 2013 and joined the same engineering college as a lateral entry.

I was on cloud nine that we both are in the same college and same branch. We will be classmates again!

Unfortunately, my happiness didn't last long!

We both were on the same branch but different division. So our classes differ, class timings differ and friends group too!

She had an amazing group of friends while I was struggling to adjust to hostel life.

During first few days of the college, she talked to me whenever we met. After few days she just smiled when she saw me, and after few more days, she didn't see me at all!

I was badly hurt! My childhood friend who always enjoyed with me is now ignoring me for other girls!

One day I was so angry with her that I used foul words in 'hike messenger' status to express my anger. I deleted her number after that. But I didn't change my Gmail password.

After few months when I used to login to my Gmail, my password made me remember her and all the happy moments of us.

My heart said to try one last time! I saved her number and sent a text. She replied with the screenshot of my ‘hike messenger' and asked me the reason.

I thought she might have never seen my status as she doesn't use ‘hike messenger'. Maybe any of our common friends might have sent her the screenshot of that status!

We had a worse conversation that day. Officially said goodbye to each other. I regretted my mistake of updating my anger and again texting her after few months!

And now it was all over! I deleted her number again. This time I changed my Gmail password too!

We graduated from the same college in 2016 without even looking at each other. I don't know what she felt but my heart broke every time I saw her on the campus!

After engineering, I still remembered her and missed her. After all, she was the only good friend I had in my childhood! One day I saved her number in my mobile. I opened whatsapp and saw her profile. Her DP was visible! I updated a random status and looked at the people who viewed it, I saw her name on it!

I was glad that in these many years she never deleted my number!

I thought of texting her but never did that because I didn't want to repeat my mistake. She might have moved on. She has too many friends and she doesn't need me anymore!

For few days we both continued viewing each other's status. On the new year, she sent a text “Happy new year” I was so happy that I had tears of happiness in my eyes and I wanted to say that I missed you but I just said “thank you, same to you”

We are still in contact now, but we rarely text each other. Our friendship is not same as it was a decade before!

Sometimes I think what broke our friendship? Silence or Anger?

I still have those happy memories in my heart and her letters in my cupboard!

Now she's just a person I was familiar with!

Time changes, people change, memories last forever!

Out of all the friendships that I have lost, she is the only one I wish to get back!

Here are the letters sent by her…

I wish we could be ‘Friends’ again!

Edit: few people said that I should send her the link of this answer and let her know that I miss her! I'm confused.

Edit 2: One of her 12th class friend read this answer and forwarded it to her. Priyanka called me today and said that she too missed me! We talked for almost 2 hours!

Shefali Naidu,5y,Why do people disown their children? What is so bad that cannot be forgiven?,"Let me tell you about Pallavi. Pallavi is my sister's friend. She is 10 years elder to me just like my sister.

She has done her masters and has a good job and loves to write poems. She had her whole life plan chalked out. She wanted to gift her parents a world trip. Take them to their hometown and gift them their ancestral house by purchasing it again, which they had to sell to fund off her college education abroad.

Her parents were happy that she was doing well for her and that they had plans for her too.

The only glitch among this? Pallavi fell in love. With an American.

All hell broke loose. She was disowned. Her parents have told everyone they knew that she is dead for them. They blocked her number and didn't want to do anything with her. Extended family were given a warning that they shouldn't be in touch with her. She wasn't even called in her sister's wedding that happened a few months later.

Pallavi thought they would come around once they hear about a grandchild. 3 years later when she was about to give birth she called up the residence number to tell them they were about to become grandparents. Her mother picked up the call and heard her but cut the call as soon as she was done giving them the news.

Pallavi was shattered but she moved on. During her second pregnancy, there were a lot of complications. Even after delivering a baby she was in the ICU. Her husband called her parents as she kept asking for them while laying there semi conscious.

“We don't have a daughter. She died 5 years ago.” They said to him.

“Please don't say that. She is battling between life and death and keeps asking for you. I will book your tickets, please come. I beg of you.”

“Only on one condition.”

“Yes. Anything you want.”

“Divorce her and take your kids with you. We will get our daughter back to India.”

“Is falling in love with a non Indian such a big crime?” He asked unbelievably.

“Yes.”

“Can't it be forgiven?”

“No.”

“But our kids are your grandchildren. How can you not care about them?”

“They are half yours so we don't consider them ours. Deal or not?”

“But, what will you get by getting your daughter back when she would be unhappy and miserable without her family?”

“We will get her married to someone in our own caste. She will be happy, eventually.”

Pallavi's husband was shocked.

He hung up the call and never called them again.

It's been 14 years. Pallavi still hasn't been forgiven for her sin that she unknowingly committed. She was even barred from coming over when her father died and she badly wanted to see him for the one last time. They have accepted this and are now happy in their own little world.

For some parents the wellbeing and happiness of their kid is much lesser than their wishes and ego. Such parents think their kids owe it to them for getting them into the world.

It doesn't occur to them that they haven't done the kids a favour by giving them birth, that they ought to have a right on their life. So they will never forgive them for something they don't consider right in their own terms.

Becoming parents was their own decision and kids don't have an obligation to fulfill all your expectations and wishes.

Edit: There are many who questioned if this is true and if there are parents like that.

Well, see for yourself.

One more.

And one more.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/13kp7hgo9eyqc26i', 'title': 'Why do people disown their children?

Pallavi is my sister's friend. She is 10 years elder to me just like my sister.\n\nShe has done her masters and has a good job and loves to write poems. She had her whole life plan chalked out. She wanted to gift her parents a world trip. Take them to their hometown and gift them their ancestral house by purchasing it again, which they had to sell to fund off her college education abroad.\n\nHer parents were happy that she was doing well for her and that they had plans for her too.\n\nThe only glitch among this? Pallavi fell in love. With an American.\n\nAll hell broke loose. She was disowned. Her parents have told everyone they knew that she is dead for them. They blocked her number and didn't want to do anything with her. Extended family were given a warning that they shouldn't be in touch with her. She wasn't even called in her sister's wedding that happened a few months later.\n\nPallavi thought they would come around once they hear about a grandchild. 3 years later when she was about to give birth she called up the residence number to tell them they were about to become grandparents. Her mother picked up the call and heard her but cut the call as soon as she was done giving them the news.\n\nPallavi was shattered but she moved on. During her second pregnancy, there were a lot of complications. Even after delivering a baby she was in the ICU. Her husband called her parents as she kept asking for them while laying there semi conscious.\n\n“We don't have a daughter. She died 5 years ago.” They said to him.\n\n“Please don't say that. She is battling between life and death and keeps asking for you. I will book your tickets, please come. I beg of you.”\n\n“Only on one condition.”\n\n“Yes. Anything you want.”\n\n“Divorce her and take your kids with you. We will get our daughter back to India.”\n\n“Is falling in love with a non Indian such a big crime?” He asked unbelievably.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Can't it be forgiven?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“But our kids are your grandchildren. How can you not care about them?”\n\n“They are half yours so we don't consider them ours. Deal or not?”\n\n“But, what will you get by getting your daughter back when she would be unhappy and miserable without her family?”\n\n“We will get her married to someone in our own caste. She will be happy, eventually.”\n\nPallavi's husband was shocked.\n\nHe hung up the call and never called them again.\n\nIt's been 14 years.

Krishna Suryakanth,2y,What are the most interesting facts about human behavior?,"I conducted a human behaviour experiment on Quora. Sometime back, I anonymously asked a question which was something like below.

Almost all people who answered the question assumed that 17 year old person in the question is a boy and saw the mother in the bad light.

What I did is, I asked the same question to people who don't use internet and watch TV often. I made sure that while asking the question, the gender of 17 year old was hidden. Most of them answered assuming the 17 year old is a girl.

People who watch crime petrol and use internet come across such incest incidents which made them assume 17 year old is a boy. People who are far away from TV and internet assumed the 17 year old is a girl.

Lesson 1:

A person sees the world through his past experiences.

Lesson 2:

What is assumption? When there is a lack of details our brain fills the details from our past experience. It's like auto-fill which happens automatically. Gender of 17 year old person was missing, so our brain filled it.

Just based on what a person is assuming unknowingly, you can have a pretty good idea of his past.

Lesson 3:

A lot of people ask me, how to read people? It's a long but interesting journey. However, first thing you need to learn is..

“See the things as they are, not through your past experiences.”

He :— rukiye puch lete hain… ( wait…let me talk )

Shopkeeper :—After talking, the shopkeeper wrapped a pack of pads in paper 😓and gave him …

Matthew Manning,Updated 6y,How do you know someone's true personality?,"A lot of the answers here recommend observing a person when they're hungry or tired, or even intentionally provoking them/depriving them in order to see their “true” personality.

This approach is bullshit.

You can do this to people, but all you’ll be seeing is them at their worst. Not their best personality and certainly not their “true” personality.

I’ve known a few genuinely kind people who become awful to be around when they're hungry or tired. What does that mean? It means they aren’t used to repressing their body’s signals to eat or sleep. How does that make them bad people?

You can't know someone’s “true” personality, because you can never fully know someone else; there will always be parts of themselves that they keep from you intentionally, and other parts that even they might not know exist.

The only thing you can do is take a chance and spend time with them. The more time you spend with a person, the more you interact, the better you get to know them. It's that simple.

Although other studies have found that we find individuals who resemble family members trustworthy not “lustworthy”, fitting with known deficits of sexual attraction to someone related to you.
Studies have also found that as time goes by, couples in long term relationships eventually look like one another. This is due to mimicking the same facial expressions over time, creating similar wrinkle lines.
Use mirroring body language when talking to somebody. I've used this in interviews and have had great outcomes. Copying someone else's gestures in a subtle way makes you more understanding and likeable.
When you shake someone's hand for the first time, make sure they're warm. Warm hands mean a warm approach. Not mind-blowing but a useful technique.
The Bystander Effect. This theory suggests that when an incident occurs, the more people that are present in the accident, the less likely it is for someone to come forward and help. It's true.
People follow authoritative figures blindly. A study by Milgram found that people would administer electric shocks on individuals, even if the 'consequences’ were severe, just because an authoritative figure asked them to.
Your name is powerful. Using a person's name upon greeting or in the middle of a conversation means that you recognise their existence. You massage their ego, boosting their self esteem. This one act does them a huge favour.

Natasha Nayak,Updated 4y,What are the most interesting facts about human behavior?,"Wanna get some attention? Stop chasing that person and start ignoring him. He'll shower you with attention.

2. Want someone to confess something? Stop talking and stare at them and they'll do the needful.

3. Validate the words of someone by just looking into their eyes. Mostly while telling a lie, they tend to look away from you and smile more often than needed.

4. Intelligent people tend to have fewer friends.

5. Look at their feet while talking. If they’re not facing you, they aren't probably interested in what you are telling them.

6. Are you sad? You can trick your mind by pretending to smile and in no time, you would be smiling for real.

7. Your body language changes with the person you are talking to. Your body language tends to be relaxed and flowy when you are talking to someone you like whereas it tends to be stiff if it's someone you are not much fond of.

8. You can sustain that high level of concentration for not more than just 10 minutes.

9. Speak a line to yourself daily about what you wish to do or become. You would see it turning into reality.

Bob found someone in China who could do his job. In effect, he Outsourced himself. He continued to arrive at his company every morning and sat at his desk watching cat videos, browsing eBay, and updating his Facebook. Meanwhile his Chinese replacement did his job. Bob earned a six figure salary and was continuously rated the best programmer at his firm. He paid a fraction of his salary to his Chinese replacement.

In fact, this worked so well that Bob took jobs at other companies, provided they would allow him to work from ""home"", and hired even more Chinese. It's not clear how many jobs Bob was holding when his plan was uncovered.

Aabishkar Wagle,Updated 5y,What's the best brain hack you know?,"Know if someone is paying attention to what you are saying by folding your arms.

If you are having a conversation with somebody and you have a doubt if they are actually listening to you or not, then fold your arms. If they are observing you and pay attention, then they will most likely fold their arms too.

The 5 second rule

The moment you have the desire to act on a particular goal, count backwards from 5 to 1.

Like this: 5… 4… 3… 2… 1!

And BAM, now start to move physically towards your goal before your brain kills your desire to act.

This is one of the most popular brain hack in the world.

Know who likes you.

When someone in a group tells a joke and everybody laughs then Pay attention to who is looking at you.

People instinctively look at the person they like within the group while they smile.

Cure for a headache.

Ever felt dejected or sad in your life?

If you feel sad again then put your hands into ice water and start to think about the positive things that had happened in your life. You will feel relaxed and this trick will also cure your headache.

Malky McEwan,Updated 4y,"What screams ""mentally healthy""?","Sam and Sylvester were opposites.

Sam was number one in his class. A bright student who cruised through school and university. He was smart, eloquent, funny, and had an almost eidetic memory.

Sylvester had a low grade point average in school. Not academically inclined, although he tried hard. He wasn’t shy, but he preferred to remain in the background. Quiet and unassuming.

Sam left school and studied law .

Sylvester left school and became an apprentice spray painter.

Sam graduated top of his year.

Sylvester became a good spray painter.

Then, about the same time, Sam and Sylvester joined the police. And that is when I got to know them.

I liked Sam and Sylvester.

Sam’s quick wit could hold an audience and keep us spellbound in admiration.

Sylvester’s anarchic sense of humour, once you got to know him, would have me in stitches.

In time, Sam gained many promotions and ended up a senior officer.

Sylvester had no ambitions other than to do a good job, go home, and have a beer. He remained a constable his entire career.

Sam, with his abundant and obvious smarts, had something else…

Emotional intelligence.

I saw many police officers gain rank and change personality. Some became over-officious or bullies. Not Sam. Sam talked like we were equals. He made me feel comfortable.

I sat in a meeting where the Chief Constable had a go at Sam. An unwarranted assault on the way he had handled a situation. I think everyone around that table felt embarrassed for Sam. Even my face flushed.

Sam remained calm. He listened and nodded his head. Like he appreciated the feedback. He gave the Chief Constable his place. The Chief Constable calmed down, his tone lowered, and he smiled.

Sam thanked him.

He thanked the Chief Constable for the bollocking. We couldn’t believe it. Sam had accepted this unnecessary lambaste. But not quite.

“So, what would you have done differently?” he asked the Chief Constable, and he leaned forward with genuine interest.

It caught the Chief Constable on the back foot. He mumbled a few words before realising that, in the circumstances what Sam did was the only option. It was brilliant.

Sylvester and I arrested Willie Gibbon.

Willie Gibbon is the vilest human being I have ever come across in my service. He has done some despicable things to other people. On this occasion, he had punched an elderly lady neighbour.

On route back to the office, Willie Gibbon kept up a torrent of verbal abuse and directed it all at Sylvester.

He said things about Sylvester, his wife, his children and his mother that would spur any lesser man to stop the car take him out and give him a hiding.

Not Sylvester. He didn’t bother. You could say anything to Sylvester and he didn’t take offence. He was the most effective person I know at controlling his temper.

At the office, Willie Gibbon continued his tirade of abuse. He struggled, he spat, he cursed and swore. We got him to a cell.

“Aye, so are you going to give me a doing over now are you?” Willie expected us to take it out on him, what he had been saying would rile a nun into retaliation.

“Och no,” said Sylvester. “Once ye calm down we’ll come back with a cup of tea for you, and we’ll just go through the process of getting you charged, okay?”

Both Sam and Sylvester screamed ‘mentally healthy’.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9hwr8tbuc1emxk6s', 'title': 'What screams ""mentally healthy""?', 'score': {'original': 0.69035, 'ai': 0.30965}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Sam and Sylvester were opposites.\n\nSam was number one in his class.

Varun Verma,Updated 4y,What are some psychological facts that people don't know?,"These are 2 psychological facts you can use while shopping.

Never mislead yourself by the price assigned to the stuff you want to buy! For example, you have come to buy a shirt and confused between 2 of those. By asking the shopkeeper you came to know that one shirt is of 600 and the other one is of 1200. The price difference is because of the material of shirts as told by the shopkeeper. When you touch and try to differentiate those you will automatically like the material of expensive one! But the catch here is that there is no such thing like good or bad material, and maybe two materials will be same. The shopkeepers play this trick so that you will try to bargain that 1200 priced shirt. And they will happily give you that shirt at 800. This trick works 99% of the time.
Next time you go for a shopping don't ask the price of that stuff directly. For example if you like a pair of shoes, ask the price of neighbouring pairs and then by giving a disinterested face ask the price of your liked one. By this you can play your psychological trick on the shopkeeper because the shopkeeper will try to assign more price on initial pairs thinking that you like them and would spend big on them!! This trick helps me 90% of the times.

If you want boots in red circle first ask price of neighbouring boots like in green circle.

This trick doesn't apply on fixed price shops :D

Alexis Tzatoise,6y,What is something you did today that you're proud of?,"I ordered my own fricken food.

For those of you who don't know, I have social anxiety disorder, among other things.

I haven't ordered my own food in over four years.

But I've been going through this new type of therapy that seems to be helping me. It's called exposure therapy, so you slowly expose yourself to what you're afraid of.

But my therapist assigned me something- I had to go to McDonald's sometime in the next week and order my own food.

I rehearsed what I was going to say close to fifty times, in different tones and with different smiles and amounts of eye contact.

Also, I have an eating disorder. I barely eat at all. I'm on a supplement right now.

I was so excited I took a picture of the victory meal. The one I ordered myself and ate all of (well, most of, but hey, you can't blame me).

Mark Jones,Updated 5y,"As a psychologist, who is the most disturbing individual you have ever met?","Actually, I would have to say my sister.

My sister, like myself and the rest of my siblings, was raised in a high control religion by our parents (Jehovah’s Witnesses). She’s still a member of this religion whereas I and one of my brothers left it a few years ago. The religion has taught her to have black and white thinking and reasoning skills and a deep distrust of the outside world. Except, my sister has taken it a few steps further than anyone else I know.

I left the religion two years ago and from the very second I announced my exit to the family she hasn't spoken a word to me. Not by text, email, letter, phonecall - nothing. She thinks demons live in my home and that Satan is using me to persecute Jehovah’s Witnesses. [Translation: I write accurate things on Quora about Jehovah’s Witnesses].

But I do remember that last time I spoke to her, it was at the time where I was having serious doubts about the religion. I told her that maybe if we just accepted people the way they were and rather than rely on a book to tell us how to think, maybe we’d all be happier.

Her reply: “But without religion, how will we know who to hate?”

If she wasn't absolutely serious it could have been a beautiful statement made against religion. But she wasn't joking. She actually looked to this religion to be told who to hate. The conversation went like this:

Me: We wouldn't hate anybody. We’d focus on ourselves and live and let live.

Her: But you can’t accept these people.

Me: Which people?

Her: All of them… gays, Catholics, the Muslims…

Me: Why hate though?

Her: What? You love these people?

Me: I don’t know them. I'm indifferent. I can’t judge a whole group of people I haven't met.

Her: Look, they’re either on Jehovah’s side or Satan’s. I know which side I’m on. And I look forward to the day when Jehovah kills all these people (non JWs) so we (JWs) can live forever.

Since then I’ve been informed by my 4yo daughter’s teacher, my ex-wife and her friends that my sister contacts my daughter's school trying to get information on her and telling them that I’ve said she can pick her up from school. This is very creepy and very illegal. I’ve had to get lawyers involved to keep my sister and other Jehovah’s Witnesses away from my child. I know what my sister’s intention is, she wants to teach my daughter the religion because—shock horror—I don’t teach religion to my child.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/67k2p93sxlof8d5t', 'title': 'As a psychologist, who is the most disturbing individual you have ever met?', 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Actually, I would have to say my sister.\n\nMy sister, like myself and the rest of my siblings, was raised in a high control religion by our parents (Jehovah’s Witnesses).

Matthew Bates,Updated 1y,"Who are you thinking about right now, and why?","A man named Daniel, who lived in Queens, NY, from 1680–1722.

According to ancestry.com, this man is one of my seven-times-over great grandfathers. He’s the oldest relative the site has for me, but I’ve been told that one of my distant cousins paid a professional to trace our ancestry (well, a part of it) all the way back to the 1500s in England. Supposedly, that information is all in a physical book that belonged to my grandmother. She passed away just a few years ago, so now the book and all of her pictures and whatnot are with my uncle. I need to remember to ask him about that the next time I see him. We usually only see each other at funerals now, since he lives six states away. Interestingly, my uncle’s name is also Daniel.

Anyway, the Daniel who was born in 1680 does not share my last name. The oldest Bates in my line is my great-great-grandfather, who was born in Indiana in 1838. I can pull up a picture of his signature on a few different things, including census forms and a draft roll from the Civil War. He was drafted to fight for the Union in 1863. I can also see a picture of his gravestone.

My father’s picture from his obituary is also on that site. And his father’s picture. It got me wondering which picture of me they’d use on there. I should probably tell them which one I want them to use.

I had to add someone to the tree; someone who is still alive, but unknown to whoever filled out the rest of that part of the tree. They had my dad and two of his siblings, but they were missing one: my aunt, who has cognitive disabilities and has lived in group homes for most of her adult life.

I’ve also noticed, as I poke around this family tree, that something my father told me about his life seems to be a pattern in our family. He said that he had a picture of himself with his grandfather, but had no memory of it because his grandfather died when he (my dad) was just four years old. My grandfather died when I was just seven, and I have a picture of us together, but I don’t remember him. My father died when my son was just three. I have a picture of my dad holding my son, but my son has no memories of my dad. As far back as I can trace the Bates men in my line, seven years is the longest overlap between the lives of grandfather and grandson.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6h03ptkyb7wj1rzo', 'title': 'Who are you thinking about right now, and why?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'A man named Daniel, who lived in Queens, NY, from 1680–1722.\n\nAccording to ancestry.com, this man is one of my seven-times-over great grandfathers.

Kumar Sonu,Updated 1y,What are some psychological facts that people don't know?,"Some of the psychological facts, which I am sure most of the people would not be knowing

Any friendship that exceeds the 7 year mark... Is more likely to last an entire lifetime.
When cleaning your room, start with making your bed. It will make everything around it look out of place and it will motivate you to clean!
92% people type things into ”Google” to see if they spelled them correctly.
If you can’t explain it to a six year old, you don’t understand it yourself. ~Albert Einstein
Whenever you're curious about something write it down. This way, whenever you're bored you'll have an entire list of things to learn about.
After 3 to 4 months of having a crush on someone, you either fall in love with that person or become interested in someone new.
85% of people have experienced a dream so real that they were not sure if it happened in real life or not.
Never judge someone without knowing the whole story. You may think you understand, but you don't.
At a restaurant? Wash your hands after ordering. The menu is generally the dirtiest thing you can touch !
Coca-Cola only sold 25 gallons syrup the first year but kept going. Never give up !
‘Dysania’ is the state of finding it hard to get off the bed in the morning.
A study has found that friends-with-benefits relationships are just as sexually satisfying as marital relationships.
Kissing and cuddling can increase your lifespan.
Having sex only 3 times a week, has proven to make you look 5-7 years younger.
Shy people tend to have great observational skills, making it easier to recognize the core of a problem then solving it.
The ""Pinky Promise"" originally meant that the person who breaks the promise must cut off their pinky finger.
Last and quite weird - In 1895 there were only 2 cars in the entire state of Ohio yet they still ended up crashing into each other.

Damon Hernandez,Updated 6mo,What event actually traumatized you as a kid?,"Damon is my name. I am fifty seven years old and studying for my Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice degree. I am happy to meet everyone and pleased to be taking this journey to a higher education with all of you. I lost my thirty two year old daughter Megan on May eighth twenty twenty one to a murderous hit and run driver who either killed my daughter and fled the scene, or who hit my daughter then killed her while fleeing the scene. Either way the person murdered the brightest star in my universe.

She was the mother of my sixteen year old granddaughter whos father died in an accident on a motorcycle three years earlier. She is now an orphan. My wife and I have been married thirty two years and together almost thirty five years. We have five children of which two have passed. Both of our daughters have left before us. There is a mighty truth in how unnatural and painful it is for a child to preceed there parents in death.

We have three sons who are still with us, as well as seven grandchildren that we are quite in love with. I will tell you a bit about my life as a young child and as a teenager.

I was adopted in the state of California at age four by a very old couple. The husband was born in 1907 and the wife not long after that. I was born in 1964. The adoption was in 1968. He was a hitter. He liked to hit to teach or to discipline. A ruler. A flyswatter. A belt. A heavy wood yardstick. His hands. A car antenna on an especially painful afternoon when I was five years old. He was also a pedophile that spent his teen years abusing his younger sister. Later in his life he would molest his own grandchildren.

I was not allowed to know that I was adopted. I found out by accident when in a fight with my niece who was also adopted but who knew she was and also knew that I had been adopted as well. It suddenly all made sense to me. The ages of everyone etc... I finally was told the big secret that everyone had been made to keep from me. I died inside immediately. There was no feeling of any connection to any of them ever again.

The decision was made to move us to Klamath Falls Oregon. It was soon after my confronting them about the truth of my adoption and my acting out in school started getting them unwanted attention. About three months after settling in Klamath Falls I ended up taking a car that had the keys in it. I decided I had enough of the physical abuse and that I would go back to where I grew up and start a search for my real mother. It was a bad decision that led to my getting five years in a place called Mclaren Training School For Boys. I would end up staying there for five years. I could have been out in six months, but I was so mentally ill from all the years of abuse that I could not earn my way out on parole. I ended up living in high security programs. The highest security for juvenilles in the state at the time.

I went to the hole fifty seven times while in Mclaren. Once I was in solitary confinement for nine months at age fifteen. I experienced everything from being chained to the bunk with metal and leather restraints for days at a time, to finding ways to amuse myself by obtaining razor blades and slashing myself to the point of needing over three hundred stitches in one sitting. I was found to be seeking attention, so they ignored my need for mental health treatment. And ignored it and ignored it and ignored it.

Eventually during my sixteenth year I was found to actually have Major Depressive Disorder as well as chronic PTSD and chronic Anxiety disorder as well as Dysthymic disorder. These are now covered by mostly the same diagnosis. I was eventually placed in the Oregon State Hospital in the Children and Adolescent Secure Treatment Program on ward 40 c.

I stayed in the hospital about a year or so. I took medicine and lots of talk therapy. I eventually went to community college and was allowed to go out on my own into the community. I reached the day when I had to return to Mclaren and get ready for my release. I spun out in a short time and was back in solitary in no time. I stayed there until my eighteenth birthday and was verbally terminated by the original sentencing judge. I was given a ride to the bus station and a one way ticket back to the adopteds. I stayed there two weeks before going to Portland Oregon and testifying in federal court against the state and Mclaren School for neglect, abuse, and torture.

Eventually I went in the Army. I made it thru basic training and went to school in Virginia at Ft.Lee for AIT. I graduated and went to permanent party in Grafenwohr Germany. I was there about a year and had serious PTSD start to develop. I was discharged due to psychologica l difficulties. I eventually ended up on skid row before I was twenty years old. I then went to prison for forty four months for a robbery that was actually an attempt at suicide by cop.

I lost my best friend due to suicide. He had spent almost day for day with me in the hole as a kid. I had known him since age thirteen. After being released from adult prison at the age of twenty one he was wanted for a crime he committed. One night he was being pursued by the police. He chose to hide in some random house. He took the family who lived there hostage. For keith this had to be an act of extreme desperation. I later would find that Keith had actually committed a drug robbery of several released prison inmate gang members .He knew he could not return to prison without being in terrible jeopardy. He would have to hide by going into protective custody. That was something Keith would never do.

The police responded by cordoning off the immediate area. Every once in awhile keith would shoot in the direction of the police. I believe he was hoping to be killed by the police returning fire. In middle of the night keith decided to let the people out of the house. He had them walk towards the police. I know all this as I lived in a dorm in the prison at this time. Dorms had 24 hour T.V. priveleges. The police were talking about keith on most of the areas television channels. After letting the people go keith apparently went into the basement. At some point during that night keith decided to shoot himself in the head. He was dead at 22.

We had agreed when we were kids that if one of us died or commited suicide that the other would not let him go alone. We were to take our own life. Becoming brothers forever. I intently debated this pact on learning of keiths death. I wondered what keith must have been thinking as he pulled the trigger. Of course I have no way of knowing for certain. I feel that I let keith down. I did not choose to honor our pact. I chose to live. To give it all one more try. I had no idea of my future. I just felt the need to not die in prison.

I made it out of prison. I had been paroled. Soon after my release I was hired as a bouncer in a very violent downtown Portland bar. I would meet my wife to be in her apartment about a month after getting hired. We were introduced by friends of ours who were dating. I knew him and she knew her. Amazingly we have been together over 34 years. We have five kids and seven grandkids. Our oldest daughter died from complications of drug addiction. The rest are free from crime. Free from institutions. Free from drugs.

On Thanksgiving Day of 2018 I was taken by surprise when I received an email from my birth mother. I had been trying to find her my entire life. This would be the first contact with each other in any way since 1968. We were introduced by a first cousin that I met through a DNA database kept by 23 and me. My mom and I were reunited about two weeks before Xmas . She immediately planned to visit me. She told me she had never been on a plane in her life. She said she was always terribly afraid to fly. Yet she came to Portland Oregon within days of our being virtually reunited. We had been seperated over 50 years. I now have my mother in my life. I have recently been cured of Hep-C. However it did its damage. I have stage 4 cirrhosis. But I survive. I repeat I continue to survive. Never give up!

UPDATED WED. MARCH 31 2021

My wife has a lifelong history of chronic agoraphobia and chronic panic attacks and extreme anxiety. Unlike most people she had in her life I did not exploit these issues or use her illness against her. She had been the victim of a severely abusive former spouse. A very sick individual that would use her illness against her. If she did not do exactly as he wished he would punish her by exploiting her panic disorder and agoraphobia. Her own family, mother included put her in the role of a subservient person with little worth unless she was doing exactly what her family wanted. Very early in our relationship we established a trust with each other that looking back seems impossible. She could trust me not to use her. I would not and have not to this very day ever used her illness against her. She has helped me with my mental health issues. She has been my rock in life whenever I needed grounding. She has the heart of an angel. She helped me to stay alive when life seemed hopeless. Her strength kept me from returning to an institutionalized form of life. She gave me love. She let her children love me. She let me love them. She gave me two of our children in common. She provided a family for me to raise and I daresay a family who helped to fill alot of what was missing in my life. To say that it was an unusual pairing is an understatement. We are now on our 34th year together. We are 32 years married and we just welcomed our 7th grandchild into our family. We have lived thru the passing of our oldest daughter due to opiate addiction. We remain a strong family. We are united even though my children have established there own homes and are at the helm of there own families. My wife and I are your everyday grandma and grandpa on the surface. Underneath we bare the scars from the battles we have fought, but they are hard to find. I am in school pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice. It is my most fervent desire to be of assi stance to young people who have been victimized. I would like to be of assistance to any victim who needs help. Understanding victimology and what breaks a young person so that I may assist them to recover there lives would be the best use of my experiences. Thanks for reading and for taking an interest in our story. Damon and Ronnee and family.

FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST MACLAREN SCHOOL FOR BOYS.

Inmates of Oregon's MacLaren School (a facility for adolescent wards of the juvenile court system, located in Woodburn, Oregon) filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The plaintiffs, represented by the Oregon Legal Services Corporation, the Legal Aid Service, the National Juvenile Law Center, and the Juvenile Justice Legal Advocacy Project of the National Center for Youth Law, asked the district court for declaratory and injunctive relief. They alleged that their constitutional rights had been violated by cruel and unusual punishments such as beatings, macings, druggings with powerfu l psychotropic drugs, strapping juveniles to beds for long periods of time, forcing them to stand at attention for hours on end, forcing them to sit silently for days at a time, confining them in cramped isolation cells, depriving them of items such as mattresses, reading materials, and bathroom facilities, forcing them to urinate out windows or on the floor, overcrowding, and lack of personal security. They also complained of unconstitutional violations in the areas of due process of law, forced involuntary servitude, right to privacy, freedom of religion, and equal protection (such as failure to provide fire and emergency procedures, use of corporal punishment, failure to provide administrative hearings before discipline, and overcrowding, all of which are regulated by Oregon laws in adult correctional facilities).

On February 22, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Judge James M. Burns) granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs, detailing specific requirements that the defendants had to meet before they could be found compliant with the Constitution. The court issued requirements in the areas of confinement requirements, procedural safeguards, environmental conditions, supplies, clothing, disciplinary procedures, use of restraints, exercise and recreation, education, food, visitation, medical care, drug and alcohol treatment, mental illness, staffing levels, and staff training. The defendants appealed.

This is an introduction of myself to the class I am taking for Child Abuse. This is part of my classes needed to obtain my Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice degree. I am 26% done and have a 3.53 GPA. I have earned 47.5 credits since October 2020.

The highest security for juvenilles in the state at the time.\n\nI went to the hole fifty seven times while in Mclaren. Once I was in solitary confinement for nine months at age fifteen. I experienced everything from being chained to the bunk with metal and leather restraints for days at a time, to finding ways to amuse myself by obtaining razor blades and slashing myself to the point of needing over three hundred stitches in one sitting. I was found to be seeking attention, so they ignored my need for mental health treatment. And ignored it and ignored it and ignored it.\n\nEventually during my sixteenth year I was found to actually have Major Depressive Disorder as well as chronic PTSD and chronic Anxiety disorder as well as Dysthymic disorder. These are now covered by mostly the same diagnosis. I was eventually placed in the Oregon State Hospital in the Children and Adolescent Secure Treatment Program on ward 40 c.\n\nI stayed in the hospital about a year or so. I took medicine and lots of talk therapy. I eventually went to community college and was allowed to go out on my own into the community. I reached the day when I had to return to Mclaren and get ready for my release. I spun out in a short time and was back in solitary in no time. I stayed there until my eighteenth birthday and was verbally terminated by the original sentencing judge. I was given a ride to the bus station and a one way ticket back to the adopteds. I stayed there two weeks before going to Portland Oregon and testifying in federal court against the state and Mclaren School for neglect, abuse, and torture.\n\nEventually I went in the Army. I made it thru basic training and went to school in Virginia at Ft.Lee for AIT. I graduated and went to permanent party in Grafenwohr Germany. I was there about a year and had serious PTSD start to develop. I was discharged due to psychologica l difficulties. I eventually ended up on skid row before I was twenty years old. I then went to prison for forty four months for a robbery that was actually an attempt at suicide by cop.\n\nI lost my best friend due to suicide. He had spent almost day for day with me in the hole as a kid. I had known him since age thirteen. After being released from adult prison at the age of twenty one he was wanted for a crime he committed. One night he was being pursued by the police. He chose to hide in some random house. He took the family who lived there hostage. For keith this had to be an act of extreme desperation. I later would find that Keith had actually committed a drug robbery of several released prison inmate gang members .He knew he could not return to prison without being in terrible jeopardy. He would have to hide by going into protective custody. That was something Keith would never do.\n\nThe police responded by cordoning off the immediate area. Every once in awhile keith would shoot in the direction of the police. I believe he was hoping to be killed by the police returning fire. In middle of the night keith decided to let the people out of the house. He had them walk towards the police. I know all this as I lived in a dorm in the prison at this time. Dorms had 24 hour T.V. priveleges. The police were talking about keith on most of the areas television channels. After letting the people go keith apparently went into the basement. At some point during that night keith decided to shoot himself in the head. He was dead at 22.\n\nWe had agreed when we were kids that if one of us died or commited suicide that the other would not let him go alone. We were to take our own life. Becoming brothers forever. I intently debated this pact on learning of keiths death. I wondered what keith must have been thinking as he pulled the trigger. Of course I have no way of knowing for certain. I feel that I let keith down. I did not choose to honor our pact. I chose to live. To give it all one more try. I had no idea of my future. I just felt the need to not die in prison.\n\nI made it out of prison. I had been paroled. Soon after my release I was hired as a bouncer in a very violent downtown Portland bar. I would meet my wife to be in her apartment about a month after getting hired. We were introduced by friends of ours who were dating. I knew him and she knew her. Amazingly we have been together over 34 years. We have five kids and seven grandkids. Our oldest daughter died from complications of drug addiction. The rest are free from crime. Free from institutions. Free from drugs.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day of 2018 I was taken by surprise when I received an email from my birth mother. I had been trying to find her my entire life. This would be the first contact with each other in any way since 1968. We were introduced by a first cousin that I met through a DNA database kept by 23 and me. My mom and I were reunited about two weeks before Xmas . She immediately planned to visit me. She told me she had never been on a plane in her life. She said she was always terribly afraid to fly. Yet she came to Portland Oregon within days of our being virtually reunited. We had been seperated over 50 years. I now have my mother in my life. I have recently been cured of Hep-C. However it did its damage. I have stage 4 cirrhosis. But I survive. I repeat I continue to survive. Never give up!\n\nUPDATED WED. MARCH 31 2021\n\nMy wife has a lifelong history of chronic agoraphobia and chronic panic attacks and extreme anxiety. Unlike most people she had in her life I did not exploit these issues or use her illness against her. She had been the victim of a severely abusive former spouse. A very sick individual that would use her illness against her. If she did not do exactly as he wished he would punish her by exploiting her panic disorder and agoraphobia. Her own family, mother included put her in the role of a subservient person with little worth unless she was doing exactly what her family wanted. Very early in our relationship we established a trust with each other that looking back seems impossible. She could trust me not to use her. I would not and have not to this very day ever used her illness against her. She has helped me with my mental health issues. She has been my rock in life whenever I needed grounding. She has the heart of an angel. She helped me to stay alive when life seemed hopeless. Her strength kept me from returning to an institutionalized form of life. She gave me love. She let her children love me. She let me love them. She gave me two of our children in common. She provided a family for me to raise and I daresay a family who helped to fill alot of what was missing in my life. To say that it was an unusual pairing is an understatement. We are now on our 34th year together. We are 32 years married and we just welcomed our 7th grandchild into our family. We have lived thru the passing of our oldest daughter due to opiate addiction. We remain a strong family. We are united even though my children have established there own homes and are at the helm of there own families. My wife and I are your everyday grandma and grandpa on the surface. Underneath we bare the scars from the battles we have fought, but they are hard to find. I am in school pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice. It is my most fervent desire to be of assi stance to young people who have been victimized. I would like to be of assistance to any victim who needs help. Understanding victimology and what breaks a young person so that I may assist them to recover there lives would be the best use of my experiences. Thanks for reading and for taking an interest in our story. Damon and Ronnee and family.\n\nFEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST MACLAREN SCHOOL FOR BOYS.\n\nInmates of Oregon's MacLaren School (a facility for adolescent wards of the juvenile court system, located in Woodburn, Oregon) filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The plaintiffs, represented by the Oregon Legal Services Corporation, the Legal Aid Service, the National Juvenile Law Center, and the Juvenile Justice Legal Advocacy Project of the National Center for Youth Law, asked the district court for declaratory and injunctive relief. They alleged that their constitutional rights had been violated by cruel and unusual punishments such as beatings, macings, druggings with powerfu l psychotropic drugs, strapping juveniles to beds for long periods of time, forcing them to stand at attention for hours on end, forcing them to sit silently for days at a time, confining them in cramped isolation cells, depriving them of items such as mattresses, reading materials, and bathroom facilities, forcing them to urinate out windows or on the floor, overcrowding, and lack of personal security. They also complained of unconstitutional violations in the areas of due process of law, forced involuntary servitude, right to privacy, freedom of religion, and equal protection (such as failure to provide fire and emergency procedures, use of corporal punishment, failure to provide administrative hearings before discipline, and overcrowding, all of which are regulated by Oregon laws in adult correctional facilities).\n\nOn February 22, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Judge James M. Burns) granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs, detailing specific requirements that the defendants had to meet before they could be found compliant with the Constitution. The court issued requirements in the areas of confinement requirements, procedural safeguards, environmental conditions, supplies, clothing, disciplinary procedures, use of restraints, exercise and recreation, education, food, visitation, medical care, drug and alcohol treatment, mental illness, staffing levels, and staff training. The defendants appealed.\n\nThis is an introduction of myself to the class I am taking for Child Abuse. This is part of my classes needed to obtain my Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice degree.

Anonymous,Updated 6y,What made you resign from your previous job?,"Employee does not leave the company; Employee leaves the manager.

It was my first company. I was working as a software developer. As I was very new to the industry so whatever my manager would say, I used to believe. I worked very hard there. I have worked for 16–20hrs/day for many months. I have worked on many weekends(without even demanding for compOff :P )

Heartbreak-1

We had to release something on monday.

Friday morning, I came to office at 10:30am. We worked till 6am(saturday morning). After that we slept on sofa/bean-bags in the office itself. We woke up around 12 noon. We ordered mouthwash from grofers; chai, samosa from chai-point and then pizzas from dominos. We stayed till sunday afternoon and after going home also, I unit tested my code.

Monday morning, I came by 11:26am, my manager literaly humiliated me in front of my team for coming late. By the way, we released our code successfully on monday.

Hearbreak-N

There were many heartbreaks for me something like this. I ignored all of them because the Work was really good there(I still miss the work I used to do there). I was learning a lot.

One fine day I was having tea with one of my seniors, He was very depressed, I asked for the reason. He told me that his 6 years old little daughter told her teacher that, “Now a days papa doesn’t have time for me. He has his dinner with his laptop, not me!!“. Within few days he searched for a new job and he resigned. I was very happy for him. After serving 60 days of notice-period, On his last day with us, When he has sent Goodbye-Mail to all, When he had returned his laptop to IT team, my manger asks him to work from his laptop using remote-desktop. My manager came to me and told me (it was already 7 in the evening), “Give him one more bug, you will have one less bug to fix. Anyways he is leaving”, and he smiled.

At this point, my manager would have thought that by doing this he is becoming great in front of me. But a big NO. I reaslized that day that when I will leave that day also he will say things like this for me to others then why am I working for this idiot.

——————————Edit-1——————————

Now it has been more than a month at my new organisation and I am happy about my decision. I have read all the comments and I like the way you guys think :-)

Vishorag Shadja; Darshan Satya: Your deduction
 was correct. Yes, I am an unmarried Software developer working in Bangalore with just more than three years of experience :P

As some of you guessed the company would be a startUp but it is not. It is a well stablished MNC in existence from 25+ years. (User-10776042513124016312; User-9906169549787416827)
I did(will) not reveal name of the company because the work culture at company is very good (What I mean by very-good is you can even think of retiring from there), So just by the work-culture of a single team it would be unfair to judge the complete organisation. (Pradeep Giddappa; Aditya Sodhiya; User-11853298722427668083)
I did(will) not reveal the name of my manager because whatever I learnt in last three years, I learnt from his team only. In short, I don’t want to be an Ungrateful person. (Gagan Sagar)
Some of you have the same doubt as my manager had. When I resigned he told(maybe cursed) me, “I know you are leaving for some lakhs. I am sure, I can give you in written, that you will not get work as good as you get here”. I said, “Yes, I know. It may happen. But I want to learn that by experiencing it”. Rikil Shah: you might have got the answer for your question. Actually I was not assured at that time but I was so frustrated that I was ready to resign even without any offer in hand.
Some of you have asked about my linkedIn profile, And some of you have doubted that It is very dramatic to get new job in 8 steps: So Yes, Obviously these are not the only steps which helped me to get a new job. As I had mentioned in the answer that I miss the work I used to do there. The work was very good in my team. I got to write many modules from the scratch. I got the opportunity to work upon many new technologies (cassandra, kafka, redis, rabbitMq, mysql, elasticSearch, aerospike, nginx, AWS, django and many more). And YES, I consider myself very lucky that I could get a new job within short period of time. (Tushar Kawadkar; User-12273749584258203886; Zinkal Bhatt; Keerthi G; Vibhor Kashyap)
I updated my profile on some of the job-seeking-websites
, asked some friends to refer me in their company, got many interview calls, got shortlisted in a few, gave few interviews, got rejected, and got rejected many times, and finally I got offers from 2 companies. I chose the most suitable one for me out of these two, and sent a sorry mail to the other one. You can be wrong many times, It is perfectly fine. but You have to be right just Once. (Keith Sequeira; Dimpi Mehta; Alessandro Samuelly; Srinivasa Reddy; Hemant Chhonkar; Dinesh Gunasekharan)
Some people have asked, what if my new boss also behaves the same: Yes, He can!! But if I would have stayed there then I was assured to get the same treatment, but now I have a hope at least. And sometimes little hope is all you need. (@chethan; Kapil Pal)
I was able to stay there for three years just because I loved the work. I was able to handle that kind of environment just because there was motivation within myself to learn something new. But as the time passed, I came to know that You cannot continue like this forever.
I did(do) not have any problem working for extra hours. If I like what I am doing, I will work for 25 hours out of 24 hours. But at the end of the day, For all the hard-work you have done: If you do not get respect it is totally fine because you learnt something out of that, but at least you should not be humiliated!! I love singing. I wanted to perform in the Annual-Event organised by company itself. I was told by my manager to not to participate in the event (And all my other friends were dancing/acting/singing). (Dolly Suchak; Sagar Kotian)
And Yes Gokarna!! It has always been into one of the favourite places of mine to relax.

(Pankaj Ramani)

PS:

Most of the times I used to reach home late and frustrated. So I was not able to call my parents regularly. Whenever I used to call, it used to be a quick 5–10 minutes call, and that too in the frustrated mood, and my parents never complained.

I used to question myself,

what wrong my parents have done?

They gave me birth, I am giving them just 5–10 minutes of my time that too like this?

They are in their 50s, they are living away from their son that too for their son’s future and happiness, And Who the hell I am to talk to them like this?

I am living a lavish life here, And they have not asked for even a single rupee, Do they deserve it?

They don’t deserve it, do they?

No they DON’T.

I was not doing it intentionally, I used to be very frustrated. But from the day I resigned, my parents(even I) can feel the difference in the way I talk to them now. If I would have not got any hike also, then also It was worth it!!

(Hanshal Nautiyal; Kritika V)

Here is an advise for the newbies (like me) in this industry: If you are working for more than the hours which are expected from your role, then Do make those hours countable i.e. mention/track them somewhere, take compOff for those hours or something like that. Because if you work extra hours and those hours are not tracked anywhere then your manager would start taking those hours for granted eventually. And obviously for the longer period of time you cannot work for 10+hrs/day. So as soon as you stop working extra hours, this will become a Negative point for you, And all the extra hours you have worked upon in past, ARE GONE!!

I reaslized that day that when I will leave that day also he will say things like this for me to others then why am I working for this idiot.\n\nOpens googleChrome.\n\nTypes “linkedin”.\n\nHits Ctrl+Enter.\n\nUpdates profile.\n\nShaves beard.\n\nGets new haircut.\n\nResigns within 20 days.\n\nGets 80% hike.\n\nTakes 2 weeks off. 1 week at home, One week at Gokarna/Coonoor.\n\nand I joined my new company on last Monday.\n\n——————————Edit-1——————————\n\nNow it has been more than a month at my new organisation and I am happy about my decision. I have read all the comments and I like the way you guys think :-)\n\nVishorag Shadja; Darshan Satya: Your deduction\n was correct. Yes, I am an unmarried Software developer working in Bangalore with just more than three years of experience :P\n\nAs some of you guessed the company would be a startUp but it is not. It is a well stablished MNC in existence from 25+ years. (User-10776042513124016312; User-9906169549787416827)\nI did(will) not reveal name of the company because the work culture at company is very good (What I mean by very-good is you can even think of retiring from there), So just by the work-culture of a single team it would be unfair to judge the complete organisation. (Pradeep Giddappa; Aditya Sodhiya; User-11853298722427668083)\nI did(will) not reveal the name of my manager because whatever I learnt in last three years, I learnt from his team only. In short, I don’t want to be an Ungrateful person. (Gagan Sagar)\nSome of you have the same doubt as my manager had. When I resigned he told(maybe cursed) me, “I know you are leaving for some lakhs. I am sure, I can give you in written, that you will not get work as good as you get here”. I said, “Yes, I know. It may happen. But I want to learn that by experiencing it”. Rikil Shah: you might have got the answer for your question. Actually I was not assured at that time but I was so frustrated that I was ready to resign even without any offer in hand.\nSome of you have asked about my linkedIn profile, And some of you have doubted that It is very dramatic to get new job in 8 steps: So Yes, Obviously these are not the only steps which helped me to get a new job. As I had mentioned in the answer that I miss the work I used to do there. The work was very good in my team. I got to write many modules from the scratch. I got the opportunity to work upon many new technologies (cassandra, kafka, redis, rabbitMq, mysql, elasticSearch, aerospike, nginx, AWS, django and many more). And YES, I consider myself very lucky that I could get a new job within short period of time. (Tushar Kawadkar; User-12273749584258203886; Zinkal Bhatt; Keerthi G; Vibhor Kashyap)\nI updated my profile on some of the job-seeking-websites\n, asked some friends to refer me in their company, got many interview calls, got shortlisted in a few, gave few interviews, got rejected, and got rejected many times, and finally I got offers from 2 companies. I chose the most suitable one for me out of these two, and sent a sorry mail to the other one. You can be wrong many times, It is perfectly fine. but You have to be right just Once. (Keith Sequeira; Dimpi Mehta; Alessandro Samuelly; Srinivasa Reddy; Hemant Chhonkar; Dinesh Gunasekharan)\nSome people have asked, what if my new boss also behaves the same: Yes, He can!! But if I would have stayed there then I was assured to get the same treatment, but now I have a hope at least. And sometimes little hope is all you need. (@chethan; Kapil Pal)\nI was able to stay there for three years just because I loved the work. I was able to handle that kind of environment just because there was motivation within myself to learn something new. But as the time passed, I came to know that You cannot continue like this forever.\nI did(do) not have any problem working for extra hours. If I like what I am doing, I will work for 25 hours out of 24 hours. But at the end of the day, For all the hard-work you have done: If you do not get respect it is totally fine because you learnt something out of that, but at least you should not be humiliated!! I love singing. I wanted to perform in the Annual-Event organised by company itself. I was told by my manager to not to participate in the event (And all my other friends were dancing/acting/singing). (Dolly Suchak; Sagar Kotian)\nAnd Yes Gokarna!! It has always been into one of the favourite places of mine to relax.\n\n(Pankaj Ramani)\n\nPS:\n\nMost of the times I used to reach home late and frustrated. So I was not able to call my parents regularly. Whenever I used to call, it used to be a quick 5–10 minutes call, and that too in the frustrated mood, and my parents never complained.\n\nI used to question myself,\n\nwhat wrong my parents have done?\n\nThey gave me birth, I am giving them just 5–10 minutes of my time that too like this?\n\nThey are in their 50s, they are living away from their son that too for their son’s future and happiness, And Who the hell I am to talk to them like this?\n\nI am living a lavish life here, And they have not asked for even a single rupee, Do they deserve it?\n\nThey don’t deserve it, do they?\n\nNo they DON’T.\n\nI was not doing it intentionally, I used to be very frustrated. But from the day I resigned, my parents(even I) can feel the difference in the way I talk to them now. If I would have not got any hike also, then also It was worth it!!\n\n(Hanshal Nautiyal; Kritika V)\n\nHere is an advise for the newbies (like me) in this industry: If you are working for more than the hours which are expected from your role, then Do make those hours countable i.e. mention/track them somewhere, take compOff for those hours or something like that. Because if you work extra hours and those hours are not tracked anywhere then your manager would start taking those hours for granted eventually. And obviously for the longer period of time you cannot work for 10+hrs/day. So as soon as you stop working extra hours, this will become a Negative point for you, And all the extra hours you have worked upon in past, ARE GONE!!\n\n//peace', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.958725
Debasish Dey,Updated 1y,What made you quit your job?,"The day I joined IBM India (Noida) I realised I made a blunder leaving HCL. Just next day after my joining the Talent manager tagged me to a project where my responsility was to monitor a specific IBM tool and create Excel sheet reports.

Next day I went to him and told him the job profile doesn't match with my skill sets. I still can't believe the reply I received from him. He said “ this is not a restaurant that you have the Liberty to choose your own food” and I will be allocated to the right project when there is availability.

I was completely shattered ! My turmoil didn’t end there. I had to do night shifts throughout my entire tenure of 10 months in IBM.

One day I said to myself “enough” and I resigned within a week. Everyone felt it was an immature decision except my parents.

Fortunately my notice period was one month as per IBM policy as I didn't complete an year. I came back to Kolkata my hometown and spend quality time with my parents. Also I used to update my Naukri profile on a daily basis and offers started pouring in. Finally after 3 months of unemployment I got an excellent offer from CTS Hyderabad.

It's almost six months now I am here in Hyderabad and can't express how much happy and motivated I am. I work in an excellent project with awesome team mates and a superb manager.

Also CTS gave me 43% hike from my last drawn salary.

One thing I have understood now “ The only risk in life is not taking any risk”

Juveria Siddiqui,Updated 2y,What toxic behavior has been normalized by society?,"In 11th grade, one of my classmates developed a strong crush on my best friend.

He'd waste his day staring at her and would pester me all the time, in order to gather some information about her. Almost everyone in the class was aware of his feelings.

My best friend wasn't into dating at that time and she was crystal clear about her decision. So when this guy approached her, she politely refused.

But that didn't seem to get into his mind. He aimed to try a lil harder this time. He started lavishing her with unsolicited gifts and chocolates, doubled up his stalking abilities and did all the stuff that made me count him as a CREEP.

When my best friend finally declared that it was still a big fat NO from her side, this guy tried another new tactic.

He amassed truckloads of sympathy from all the other classmates and asked them to persuade her. And guess what? They obeyed him.

Now each one of them would request my best friend to date that guy, notice his efforts and atleast give it a shot. They'd even ask her why are you playing so hard to get? or Why are you so hard to impress? But none of them realized that she has all the rights to decide for herself.

What toxic behavior has been normalised by the society?

Not respecting someone's free will.

Not respecting someone's personal opinions.

Not respecting someone's reasons.

The next time when you ask someone to join you for a movie, and if they say that they don't feel like, respect their decision. Don't tell them it'll be fun or you'll miss a lot kind of stuff.

It's okay to request once, but if that doesn’t work, you need to know and stop.

Thank you for reading ^_^

We were in line to get on a cruise ship and had to put our suitcases on a conveyer belt to be scanned. His suitcase went through fine, but they pulled mine aside, looking concerned.

That’s when I heard it.

My suitcase was… vibrating.

With growing horror, I watched as they opened up my suitcase and first pulled out handcuffs.

“These are not allowed on the boat, sir.” They said to the boyfriend.

Before he even had a chance to say that it was my suitcase: I bolted.

I left him there awkwardly talking to the security guys and hid around a corner.

I watched as they opened the side pocket and pulled out my vibrator.

I watched as they made him take the batteries out.

I watched his face turn 500 shades of red in front of the huge line of people that we were about to be stuck on a boat with for 7 days.

When he finally caught up to me, he said four words: “You fucking betrayed me.”

Dawn Amber,Updated 3y,What are the best examples of reverse psychology?,"In 1756, King Frederick II of Prussia wanted to find a way to end the prolonged suffering and famine that his people were suffering from.

His solution? Potatoes.

He passed a circular order that would ensure the growing of potatoes in the region.

The ‘new’ crop from South America, seemed to be the answer to his prayers and he hurriedly ordered that potato fields be planted for the people. He made sure to let people know about the many benefits of the new food so that they would be interested and start eating it as well.

However, it wasn’t all going to plan.

Many people turned away from the food because of its weird ‘dirty-looking’ exterior and bland taste,

It seemed that the King’s plan was going to fall through, until he decided to try to turn things around.

He sent guards to ‘protect’ the fields from thieves, which in turn made villagers curious as to what amazing source the guards might be hiding.

The soldiers were told to go easy on robbers and let down their guard so that the crops would then be taken during the night without trouble.

This in turn let potatoes be grown in personal gardens, and be used for consumption by many villagers—which was the King’s plan all along.

To this day, if you visit King Frederick’s grave, you will see potatoes lying on top to remind everyone of when the food was introduced into Germany and what a great service it was to the people.

From the stars,

Ketan Pande,Updated 1y,What made you feel proud today?,"The decision to pick up the phone from my busy schedule.

This morning, my phone buzzed, and it was on the table. I was completely immersed in some work. Thus I was thinking of avoiding the call.

But, I thought it might be an urgent one, and I was right. It was from a friend of mine, who rescued an Indian Cobra and needed some help with it.

Thus, I asked him to meet me and describe the complete situation to me. Later onwards, I met him and I got to know about a tricky yet serious problem.

I mean just look at this pic:

Here is a snake which we don’t know how, but stuck its body in a 1-inch CPVC pipe, and urgent removal of pipe fitting was necessary; as the snake's movement got restricted, plus it was stifling.

Thus, I along with two friends chalked down a plan and decided to move forward. We had two goals in front of us:

Remove the CPVC which was stuck strong on the body of a 5 feet cobra
Avoid getting bitten by the snake while removing it.

And we started the mission ‘PIPE REMOVAL.’

I took the responsibility of holding and immobilising the snake’s head and tail, while my other friend would cut the pipe.

We had to carefully take each step, and the work required complete concentration; as we had to make the sure to not hurt the snake.

Thus, after 15 minutes we were able to cut this much pipe.

In between, we took some rest to reduce the stress levels of the snake.

After 45 minutes since the start we reached here:

[Just look at the thickness of the snake's body and the CPVC pipe. ]

And After 1 Hr 30 minutes since the start, we were almost there.

But, it took us some more time and after 15 minutes, finally this happened:

The snake was fit and the removal operation did not hurt him.

At last, the snake was again free to roam.

After this, we informed the Forest Dept and released it in the wild to let it again rule its territory. It’s rare but felt proud of all of us.

Pooja Yadav,Updated 5y,What are some psychological facts that people don't know?,"Curse of Knowledge

Do you know why some teachers despite of having very good academic profile are worse in teaching?

You feel irritated when your parents don’t know how to save a number, dial a new number from contact list, or how to message on Whatsapp.

You boil up when you are telling your son/husband to fetch their T-shirt from drawer and they don’t have any idea which place you are talking about!

This is because of Curse of Knowledge

Curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias. When one person while interacting with others talks about a particular thing, they involuntarily assume that others have a background to understand the same.

When you know things and you have forgotten what it’s like to not have this knowledge. This makes it harder for you to identify with other person’s situation and explain things in a way that can be easily understood to someone who is novice.

A brilliant professor might no longer be able to relate with the struggles of the students when they are learning about a new topic. They have difficulty in teaching because they can not put themselves in the position of students.

In this famous psychological experiment, a group of subjects was divided in two: Tappers and Listeners.

The tappers were asked to think of a song and try to rhythmically tap that song on the table, while listeners would identify the song tappers were tapping.

Surprisingly the tappers were 50% sure that the listeners would be able to identify the song they had in their mind while tapping. But the result was shocking. Only 2.5% listeners were able to figure out the song. The tappers overestimated their success ratio of being understood 20 times above how many times they actually were being understood.

So from now, if you are explaining something to others assume that they don’t know anything about it. Try to explain it in most simple way with little and simple information and few stories or examples from everyday life.

Sometimes it’s better if you don’t know things!!

Kudos!

Srinath Nalluri,Updated 4y,"What is the difference between knowledge, intelligence and wisdom?","In Ramayana, there is an episode where Vali is killed.

On the suggestion of Ram, Sugreev challenges his twin brother Vali for a fight.

When both of them are mace fighting, Ram hides behind the tree and shoots an arrow into Vali’s chest.

Vali dies.

Now, Ram has immense knowledge about weapons and warfare.

He is extremely skilled and has more dexterousness than Vali. When Sugreev told Ram about Vali’s powers by showing him a hole in a Saal tree which Vali had made in one shot, Ram shot an arrow that penetrated seven trees of saal in a row.

This is knowledge.

Ram learns that Vali has a special power —Whenever he fights, half of the opponent’s powers come to him and add to his powers. Thus his power doubles and his opponent's power becomes halved, making him invincible.

It is impossible to defeat him in a single combat.

Hence he sends Sugreev first and brings Vali out. He then stands behind the tree without facing Vali and kills him when they are fighting.

This is intelligence.

Intelligence is how you use your knowledge to achieve the desired effect.

Knowledge is the long column of wax, while intelligence is tiny matchstick-flame that lights the candle. You need both for a great result.

Now, Ram could have bet on the stronger horse.

Vali was the most powerful person at that time He had weapons and a strong army. He had also defeated Ravana in an earlier war. Ram could have easily joined Vali and got his help in finding Seetha.

But, he didn’t. He stood by the righteousness. He stood by the law.

He knew Sugreev deserved justice. And he promised to be on his side. So he used his skill and intelligence to achieve it.

This is wisdom.

Wisdom is when you know to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong and then use your intelligence and knowledge for the greater good.

Lindsay Elizabeth,Updated 4y,What is the cruelest trick of the mind?,"Eye-witness testimony in a court case, it can be pretty damning. I mean, if someone saw it happen, it must have, right?

Elizabeth Loftus challenged this. She challenged this notion that our memories are inalterable and rather argued, that our own perceptions of the past could be changed by just a few words.

The experiment she set up was alarmingly simple:

A few dozen students watched a video of a car crash.

Then they were asked a question: About how fast were the cars going when they contacted each other?

The wording however, was changed, between a few different options.

About how fast were the cars going when they (smashed / collided / bumped / hit / contacted) each other?

They all saw the same video, nothing about the actual information was changed.

But, depending on the phrasing, their answers varied drastically.

Loftus still questioned the results however, she concluded there could be two reasons for the discrepancy.

The leading nature of the question may have influenced the answer, but the memory itself was unchanged.
The memory itself was altered, the verb literally changed how they saw the crash.

So she set out to test it, her logic being that if the second reason was true, the participants might also remember other details that are false.

Her second experiment was similar, a slightly larger group this time, but they were played the same video.

This time, there were two potential questions:

How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?
How fast were the cars going when they smashed each other?

A week later, the participants were called back and asked another question.

Did you see any broken glass? Yes or no?

There was no broken glass.

Participants in the second group were significantly more likely to claim to have seen glass, despite there being literally none. Their memories were false.

Priyanka Basu,Updated 5y,What's the hardest part about getting older?,"Year 2008

Husband (Then boyfriend) :- Want to have some spicy chat (Indian street food)

Me:- yess!

End up with chat, golgappa, kulfi, pakoda. All of them are varieties of street food which is mouthwatering in taste but not so good for health.

Year 2018

Me:- Want to have some chat?

Husband:- lets have some dosa. you know you get sick with so much spicy food.

Me:- ok :(

**********************************************

Year 2004

Me:- mom give me 1000 , I want to buy some scarf .

Mom:- No you already have 10, mix and match it. You young people don’t understand the value of money

me (promising myself), I will get a fabulous job and once I get it I will buy whatever and whenever I want.

Year 2018

Mom:- Why don’t you get a new shoe, something that match your new dress.

Me:- Its okay I have golden one which goes with almost everything.

Coming back to the question , so whats the hardest part about getting older?

The hardest part here is the self-control.

You have your own money and freedom which allows you to do anything and everything you want but you don’t do that. You know what suits best for you and you know the value of saving. So growing up(or getting older) is nothing but maintaining the self control for your own good.

After some time, I found out that the owners of both stores were brothers.

Both stores had the same quality, same quantity, they were both really sweet. But somehow the elder brother's store had more customers in general.

I asked the younger brother, how come his brother has more customers? He told me this is called luck.

I was still confused by this disparity. After some more time, I got to know a minute detail.

The younger brother used to put more amount of material (pulses, rice, etc.) on the balance scale and then remove it until it hit the desirable amount on the scale.

And, the elder brother used to put less amount of material on the balance scale and then add some extra material until it hit the exact amount on the scale.

Amy Smith,3y,What thing made you feel both happy and sad?,"Today, someone on our street was having a garage sale.

Out of curiousity, my mum decided to go around to their house to take a look, and maybe see if there was anything that we could use.

She ended up coming home with this for me…

It's a mini Galileo thermometer. The little colourful floats inside move up and down depending on the room temperature.

I've wanted one for literal years. Not only is it useful, it's also really decorative and peaceful to watch. I'm so happy to finally have one.

But why did this make me both happy and sad?

Apparently there was a darker story behind the garage sale. A lady in her 90s was evicted from her house. Her husband, who was blind, had recently passed away and left her living alone.

Someone reported her, saying she should not be living on her own anymore. The authorities came to her house, told her to pack a bag on the spot, and took her away to a nursing home.

The lady's new caretaker had come to clean out her house before it was put up for sale, and decided to have a garage sale to raise a bit of money for her.

It really made me sad to think of what that lady must be going through right now… losing her husband, being forced to leave her home, and who knows what health problems she might be facing that forced someone to report her.

I couldn't help but feel empathy for her, despite having never met her before.

But at the same time, it made me happy to think that I now have their little Galileo thermometer safely sitting on my windowsill right now. It's like I have a small piece of their life; a life I never got the chance to know but has suddenly become so important to me after hearing the story.

I feel lucky to be able to have saved one of their possessions. I'm really going to treasure this for a very long time.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/25ctsbmyxfvinw3p', 'title': 'What thing made you feel both happy and sad?', 'score': {'original': 0.999, 'ai': 0.001}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Today, someone on our street was having a garage sale.\n\nOut of curiousity, my mum decided to go around to their house to take a look, and maybe see if there was anything that we could use.\n\nShe ended up coming home with this for me…\n\nIt's a mini Galileo thermometer.

"David McPhee, Ph.D.",Updated 3y,Is it true that if someone is forced to go to the psychologist he can decide not to speak for the duration of the meeting?,"I have been given the stony, sullen, no eye-contact treatment by tons of teenagers who did not want to be in my office but couldn’t avoid it for some reason. The record was three whole sessions. Usually it’s only for a few minutes.

IT CAN BE A HEALTHY DEFENSE

It’s a useful, though primitive defense. It can be a healthy assertion of. . .health.

Socially skilled adults do the same thing, but in much sneakier ways, often with a lot of words.

JASON WAS SILENT THE WHOLE TIME

Jason, 14, was silent for the entire first session.

I said something like “Looks like we both have to be here. I totally respect you and your decision not to use words until you decide it’s the right thing.” (Giving him “permission” to do what he was already doing was a mini-assertion of my own.)

“I’ll just sit here wondering about you, or maybe just meditate. It’s all good.”

RC RACING CARS

The next week I met with him on a Saturday morning, so the building was 90% empty. Earlier I’d noticed him glancing at my remote-control racing cars a few times.

I said cooly (no name or warmth yet). “This is boring. The parking lot is empty and I want to go out and play with my race cars, but I can’t leave you in here alone. Just come outside, you don’t have to do anything.”

I TOOK A CHANCE

I took a chance, stood up, and said, slightly annoyed, “I can’t carry both cars and both remotes. Here, carry the Maserati.” When he reached out for it, the standoff was over.

We spent the rest of the session racing and smashing cars into each other. Even laughing. The foster dad drove up, saw what was happening, and parked 50 yards away. Smart guy.

Jason turned out to be a long-term client, and returned twice for “boosters” during high school. I made sure to have batteries in the cars and remotes, just in case.

He: Sir, here is your order.

He: Sir, sorry the address has been mistakenly entered. Sorry to disturb you.

Me: No issue.

Me: Please have this.

Rafael Eliassen,4y,How do I develop razor-sharp focus?,"You have two choices: control your mind or let it control you. ~ Buddha

Here are 7 ways to improve your focus.

Turn-off distractions: Whether they are notifications or other people bugging you, find a way to turn it off. You can’t expect your brain to focus if Billy is constantly messaging you.
Don’t multitask: We can only focus on one thing at a time. let’s give our brains a break, shall we?
Posture control: If you are slouching that’s going to make you feel lazy. If you are sitting straight you are going to be more attentive. Check your posture daily.
Be active: If you don’t exercise you are always going to be slow and sluggish. How can you intend to focus in a state like that?
Goal oriented: When you are working on something, instead of focusing on the hours put in focus on what you want to get done.
Read: Building a reading habit can do wonders for your attention span. It’s better than binging tv-shows. Whether it’s fiction or self-help start reading.

Rana Ashish,5y,What are the habits of people who never get stressed?,"I am an IT professional, where I have dedicated 7 years of my life. In four years people graduate from Engineering, but from the last 7 years, I have been learning only one thing, i.e. Java and its related technology.

But why am I telling you all this?

I have seen enough stress around me. People suffer to the point where it starts hampering their personal life and professional life as well. There are many kinds of stresses, but I will only talk about office stress. And what I do to handle this.

Many of you know one of my friends and colleagues named Sarbajit, I have mentioned his name in many of my answers before. He is one of the best employees that any company can ever ask for. He knows everything about technology, but one thing that he doesn’t know is, how to handle stress.

His stress buster is: Alcohol.

He drinks 4–5 times a week. 20–25 thousands of his earnings go in his drinking habit per month. I tried to convince him, but you will always fail in front of a fool and drunkard. You cannot reason with them, they will give you shittiest possible reason to counter you.

This is not a good habit to get relieved of stress. Momentarily, you will be happy, but in the long term, it will invite many undesirable things.

I will tell you my way. This is a little difficult, but with little practice it is manageable.

“Keep your eyes and ears closed inside your office and only focus on your work.”

I am honestly saying, I am not aware of anything in my office.

Few Incidents, I would like to share:

Incident 1:

Guy: “XYZ” is a hot girl on the floor. I want to contact her, will you please help me.

Me: Who is she? I have heard this name for the first time.

Guy: She sits behind you.

Me: Since when? I thought, she is some trainee.

Guy: As expected, do you know anything around you?

Now, why would I take stress, who is flirting with whom, and what are they doing in their personal life?

Incident 2:

Guy: I got only 15% hike and “PQR” got 17%.

Me: Oh! you got 15%, that’s great.

Guy: But “PQR” got 17%.

Me: I got 0%.

Guy: What?

Me: You know my relationship with the manager.

Guy: But why are you so chilled?

Me: Because taking stress will not increase my salary.

Incident 3:

If any conversation starts related to my office, people directly assume I don’t know anything.

Guy: XYZ has resigned, it is his last day.

Me: Really, when did he resign?

Guy: Everyone knows it, and here you are!!!

Guy: Of course you don’t know about the promotion of “Lambda”?

Me: Well, Lambda never told me.

Guy: And Beta is going to France for 3 months assignment.

Me: Then, what am I supposed to do?

Guy: You know, company has laid off employees. And your relationship with the manager is well known.

Me: I am an individual contributor, I can get a job anywhere.

After listening to this much news, does anything affect me?

No. Not a bit.

If someone is doing better, I am happy for them. Becoming sad will not add any value to my life except stress.

I know, I am good at my job and I am confident enough that I will survive anything in this corporate world and then rise.

This is my way. I stay away from any office gossip, politics and internal affairs. No one has ever heard from me about my office life, because apart from my work I am not aware of anything happening around me.

I am a self-centered guy. I don’t have time for myself, people around me think I am a monk who has come from another world. But the truth is, I don’t give a fuck around me.

Next time you are stressed:

Take a step back, inhale and laugh.

Remember who you are and why you are here. You have never given anything to this world that you can’t handle. Be strong, be flexible, love yourself, and love others.

Always remember, just keep moving forward.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gmdnock4795jfe2i', 'title': 'What are the habits of people who never get stressed?', 'score': {'original': 0.44045, 'ai': 0.55955}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am an IT professional, where I have dedicated 7 years of my life.

Juveria Siddiqui,1y,What psychological tricks work on most people?,"“You're looking a bit off today, is everything okay?” one of my classmates randomly asked this to a girl (say X) as soon as she entered the class.

In reality, she wasn't looking down or any such thing, but he just wanted to mess with her mind.

X denied saying that she's perfectly fine.

A few minutes later, he questioned her again “Are you sure you're okay? You don't look like”

X now tried harder to look happy because she felt that everybody thinks something is wrong with her today.

But the guy once again asked her the same question after a few lectures. X now actually started feeling low.

By the end of the day, X was into tears at the fact that she's actually sad and she couldn't hide it anymore.

But was she actually sad right from the start of the day? Of course not. She was neutral and fresh back then.

It's just that the guy successfully tricked her into believing that she's appearing gloomy. Just like everyone else, X too had her share of lows in her life. The more the guy asked her if she was okay, the more she was reminded of all that was going wrong in her life.

And that's how at the end she actually broke down.

I don't know if this psychological trick will work on a lot of people or not, but having witnessed it live throughout the day, I was dead sure of its power.

Another example of this is when you tell someone “You're looking very happy today!” even when they don't. If you keep showering them with such phrases, you’ll yourself see how they bloom with uncontrolled bliss by the end of the day.

Thank you for reading :)

Razia Zahraa,5y,What is the scariest thing you have seen your mother do?,"I was in an abusive relationship and I had finally walked out after catching my ex in bed with his work colleague. I was devastated. I moved back with my parents and didn’t tell anyone of my bitter past. I would wake up screaming because of the trauma I underwent. Mom would come rushing into my room and would try her best to console me. She would lie down beside me, stroke my hair asking me what happened. I would always say I had a nightmare and force myself back to sleep.

One fine Sunday morning after about a month of not telling her anything, I found the courage of opening up to her and gave her a brief of what happened and how my ex would beat me black and blue and how I was getting nightmares that he’s killing me. I was crying all the while telling her my story. I looked up to see Moms face. Her beautiful face suddenly looked scary. It had turned to stone. Her eyes were like steel. My heart sank. At that moment, I felt she is going to slap or hit me. She looked like she was going to murder me. She stormed out of the kitchen and I was now truly scared. I could hear her search for something and there was a racket of things being thrown around the house. I couldn’t move.

And then she returns holding a hockey stick in one hand and a sharp butcher knife on the other. Felt like she was going to kill me. I whispered ‘Mom’. She looked at me with those piercing eyes and replied, “Go get dressed. We are going to teach that bastard a lesson he will never forget. How dare he raise his hand on my beautiful baby girl who we have brought up with so much love and affection. How dare he break you causing your nightmares. I’m going to kill him”

I wailed. I cried. I never thought my Mother would support me like this. I never knew my sweet sweet Mother would ever do something like this for me. I ran up to her and held her tight. She was adamant we go and beat up my ex. This was the day I knew I had a true friend for life. One who will always have my back. And no, we didn’t go as I told her I don’t want her to do anything. She made me promise that if anytime I wanted to have my ex killed, to tell Dad as she knew Dad would definitely kill him. Love you Mom.

Dawn Amber,Updated 3y,What are you afraid of and why?,"I once confided in a friend of mine about one of my worst fears.

They still mock me about it to this day.

I think it’s a very serious fear and one that should be taken way more seriously than it is currently. Just look at the facts people! Nevermind the emotional factor behind fears.

What is my fear you ask? Enclosed water slides.

…Alright, you can quit laughing now, it’s not that absurd. And if you didn’t see the humor in it then that’s awesome, I found a fellow logical human being to confide my worries in.

But, seriously, just take a step back and think about it for a second.

Slides, themselves aren’t that bad.

Sure they could potentially pose a danger if you used it the wrong way, but they’re pretty straight forward. Nothing a normal person could mess up.

If we pick it up a little then we get water slides.

Now, water slides possess a bit more danger than normal slides. There are dozens of examples of people going careening off the sides or missing the pool they were supposed to land in, but they’re still not as bad as the next level.

Enclosed. Water. Slides.

Why would you ever go on one?

Sometimes, they even have loops. Loops are dangerous enough that they even have little doors on the bottom just in case you can’t go all the way through.

And not only do you have to worry about being in an enclosed space, but there’s also water gushing in all around you!

Nothing better than drowning in a tube, right?

It doesn’t help if the tube isn’t even transparent. Sounds like a nightmare, honestly.

Pallab Roy Chowdhury,2y,What is Stone Man syndrome?,"Nitin ( name changed), 8 yr old boy came to our pediatrics OPD, which very vague complaints.

His father complained that, he wasn't playing anymore. That's it..

Upon asking to tell more about him in details, his father added, that he is suffering from mild fever, and pain in the joints along with restriction of movements.

Fair enough..

Our senior resident examined him, and there were few hard swellings around his neck..

SR suspected, it may be a case of disseminated tuberculosis, or may be juvenile idiopathic osteoarthritis or the worst of all, blood cancer.

He asked, “ For how many days is he sufferinh from the same? “

His father replied “ Sir, 2 years “.

2 YEARS…??????

No child would survive blood cancer or tuberculosis without treatment for 2 years, and JIA will be unbearable after 2 years.

How is he still alive? Our HOD was called, and he immediately sent him to radiology, as he suspected something rare, rarest of rare.

The radiology department did a X ray of hand, legs and spine, and were surprised..!!

To confirm their suspicion, a 3D imaging of the whole body skeleton was done.

And their suspicion was correct.

FIBRODYSPLASIA OSSIFICANS PROGRESSIVA. aka stone man syndrome.

This is how it looked like. (source - from Google)

You see the tree like branching arising from the back of the child? Well, that was once, a muscle, which is now gradually turning into a BONE!!.

YES, A BONE!!

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is caused by a mutation
 of the gene ACVR1
. The mutation affects the body's repair mechanism, causing fibrous tissue including muscle
, tendons
, and ligaments
 to become ossified
, either spontaneously or when damaged as the result of trauma. In many cases, otherwise minor injuries can cause joints
 to become permanently fused as new bone forms, replacing the damaged muscle tissue. This new bone formation (known as ""heterotopic ossification"") eventually forms a secondary skeleton and progressively restricts the patient's ability to move. Bone formed as a result of this process is identical to ""normal"" bone, simply in improper locations. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the disease can cause joint degradation separate from its characteristic bone growth.

In simple words, upon minor trauma, the muscles turn into a bone, and gradually, all the muscles of the body will turn into bone, giving out appearance like.

This.

Or this

Or this.

What a horrible disease to have.

The child cannot play like normal children can, as something minor as falling down, can trigger a stimulus which can turn his muscles into a rock solid bone.

You can literally feel your whole body getting stiff day by day, to a point when even your respiratory muscles hardens to form a bone, and you can't breathe and hence, death.

Currently, no permanent cure has been made for this, but we hope, one day we will.

And about that boy? Well, he was transferred to CMC vellore, and was advised painkillers, steroids and muscle relaxants.

I have tried to keep it as layman as possible, so that everyone can understand. Still, feel free to ask your doubts to me in the comments.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mzdgwc7tjl68nsqr', 'title': 'What is Stone Man syndrome?', 'score': {'original': 0.42725, 'ai': 0.57275}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Nitin ( name changed), 8 yr old boy came to our pediatrics OPD, which very vague complaints.\n\nHis father complained that, he wasn\'t playing anymore.

Jordan Yates,7y,Why do some people like cats more than dogs?,"This is my cat, Roka:

She’s a doll.

Actually, she’s an ass, but I love her anyway.

I also have two dogs- an English mastiff named Beauregard and a chihuahua-dachshund named Banjo.

I love them all; I really do.

I’m a cat person all the way, though.

First of all, my cat is low-maintenance compared to the dogs. If we go out of town, the dogs have to have sitters or have to be boarded. They have to be fed twice a day, let outside to go to the bathroom, and receive many pettings.

Roka requires her food refilled maybe once every two weeks. She uses the litter box when she’s inside, so she can be left alone as long as is necessary. She doesn’t want attention 90% of the time, anyway, so being left alone doesn’t bug her.

The attention is another reason I love cats.

When I’m home, the dogs demand most of my attention. Beau needs his ears rubbed at all times, else his feelings get hurt and he pouts. Banjo demands belly rubs or he barks. Beau wants to play right this second and if you don’t play with him, he pouts. If you don’t play with Banjo when he wants it, he barks at Beau which hurts Beau’s feelings… and then he pouts.

Yeah, the 150 pound dog pouts if the 12 pound dog yells at him.

Roka, on the other hand, doesn’t want that.

She has about a 20 minute period on any given night where she requires pettings. When she requires them, she requires them all that very second or else she forces herself upon you until she gets her pettings.

Then she disappears.

The dogs get up early- between 5:30 and 6 in the morning. At that point, they want to go outside and pretend to get the newspaper (a trick neither of them know to do, but both receive treats for). Then they need breakfast. Then Beau needs medication. Then Banjo needs his morning playtime, then his morning nap.

It’s a process.

This morning, Roka didn’t get up until about 4 in the afternoon. Her habit is to make her way to my bed at around 8 in the morning, get a morning headrub, then curl up at the foot of the bed until something more interesting comes along.

I live in the attic; it’s rare that something interesting happens.

Roka doesn’t need a lot of attention, or specific routines. She doesn’t really do anything all day. At night, she’s outside hunting and causing trouble. During the day, she sleeps.

That’s why I prefer cats to dogs. I like a pet that will spend time with me, but doesn’t require as much active maintenance as dogs do. Roka is mostly self-sufficient compared to the dogs.

I will always pet a dog if I see one, though. I love dogs.

But I love owning cats more, for nothing more than my own laziness.

Rachel Lay,Updated 5y,Were you ever in denial about a pregnancy?,"Yes. I was 14 and pregnant. I didn’t want to be pregnant. Felt trapped. Couldn’t talk to my parents. The baby’s father told me if I told anyone he would “ram his boot into my head and make it look like an accident”. I told a friend at school and pretty much the whole school knew not long after.

I was in complete denial. I felt alienated, alone and in a situation I felt like I had no way out of.

My parents did ask me a few times if I was pregnant and I kept denying it.

I didn’t put on much weight whilst pregnant and was skinny to start with, so by the end they just assumed I was getting fat.

I had just turned 15 two weeks prior and I had a few days of sick with a cold. I was going to go back to school the next morning, however I spent the night awake going through labour. Finally told me parents - when I was in labour. They drove me fast to the hospital. My mum stayed by side and held my hand as I gave birth to my daughter. My brother was at the barbers later that day and saw the baby’s father walking through town. He promptly jumped out of the chair and punched him in the face.

Happy ending though, I have a gorgeous 15 year old who I absolutely love, I finished high school, got a uni degree, and at 30 just had my second child.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/uizhgrn97ckt3s4a', 'title': 'Were you ever in denial about a pregnancy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes.

Himank Gupta,Feb 8,Can you tell me something about yourself?,"Always wanted to answer this question after I know I achieved something tangible in life!

I am a 26 year old guy who has his humble origins from the capital of India- Delhi.

From the day I was born- I had to fight death.

When I was in my mom’s womb, I had IUGR and reversal of Umblical arterial end-diastolic flow. For non medics reading this and wanting to know the significance - It basically meant that I was at significant risk of death (>50%). But I survived and was brought into this world!….

Only to realise that I was 1.1kg! Severely underweight. I had to spend 22 days in NICU (ICU for babies). I survived and was successfully discharged!…..

Until I was 3 months of age when my dad (a surgeon) discovered that he could definitely hear a murmur. It was missed by paediatrician during my examination when I was born although that sometimes does occur. It turns out my aortic valve (fleshy things made of 3 cusps which prevent blood from going back to heart when pumped out) was instead made of 2 cusps (bicuspid valve) and that it was severely stenosed! That meant I had a life expectancy of just 2–4 years if not treated…. So my mom and dad got me operated by balloon valvuloplasty (a balloon is inflated to widen the valve and increase the flow). It was successful! One major issue with this procedure is that you start to develop regurgitation as well (Basically the blood starts to go back a bit into your heart) . Nevertheless, your little baby Himank now just had to get a heart scan every 2 years till they could find out whether any extra intervention was required….

Days and years passed. Himank eventually became a doctor! Got into AIIMS Bhopal after getting a rank of 180ish in 2015 and finally cleared the hurricane that was MBBS!

I lost my dad in 2020. That was a really difficult time for me and of course, Covid was a real scare for me since I was relatively more at risk of suffering lethal consequences of Covid due to my heart issue (Though as absolute risk- It was still very less due to my age and health)….

And then came 2021. So a heart scan and aortic scan (angiography) found out that I have a HUGE 5.1ish cm swelling at the initial part of my Aorta… Hmm.. wait… Oh SHIT here we go agai-……

Apparently bicuspid valve predisposes you to aortic aneurysms! And it was 5cm, ready to burst whenever it wanted and would… you know… KILL ME ALMOST INSTANTLY (Aortic dissection can be really life threatening and very difficult to resuscitate)

So I had to have an open heart surgery (elective) when I still had the control over this. I had it in November 2021 and basically- My heart was stopped for 1 hour or so and my aortic valve was replaced. Yes I kind of died? (Sigh.., but as a medico I can’t even say that lol because I wasn’t technically brain dead…). Surgery (7 hours!) went fine, heart restarted, off the ventilator, chest drains removed, smiled at the nurses etc etc. 4 days in ICU and 3 in ward. So how was the experience and recovery?

IT WAS FUCKING PAINFUL. They have to cut sternum to reach heart and it took 6 weeks for it to heal. Every time I sneezed or coughed, I felt a lot of pain. So bad that once I sneezed 5 times and it was excruciating.

But I recovered! And just 5–6 months later went to UK to give my license exam and I cleared it!

in February 2023, I finally started working as a doctor in United Kingdom! I am currently earning more than 50k pounds (50 lacs)/year, rent my own private apartment, pay my own bills, send money to my mom without any issue and will hopefully soon get a nice German car! (Once license is sorted out). I am also planning a foreign solo trip to Japan or Europe depending on which visa I get first!

Death has always been close to me. But now, I am not scared of death anymore.

What I want to do now is- To live a life without regrets and to live it on my own terms!

Edit- Just added some pictures for a positive end.

Stand tall. Stand straight.

Mahesh Rallabhandi,3y,What is your greatest fear?,"Imagine a girl completed her graduation and got a job in good company. She packed her bags boarded train and excited to join her new job.

Train reached its 2nd last stop and everyone in the train deboarded, the coach is almost empty like this.

That girl is just one stop away from starting new life, new job, support her family and become independent.

But suddenly a gang of 5 guys boarded train and saw this alone girl. They checked thier surroundings and confirmed no one is in coach.

Two guys started passing comments on her and other guys started slowly approaching her. Those monsters brutally raped her and thrown her body outside from running train.

In just few minutes, a girl dream collapsed, her family hopes destroyed.

So what is my greatest fear is women safety.

I have one sister who is working, a mother who is living for us, few female friends who are fighting with their family for career.

Sometimes when they travel alone these thoughts always run in my mind and make me restless.

I just pray to god that no one should get into situation like this.

David M Joseph,Updated 5y,What is a fun psychological trick to try on someone?,"This psychological trick is not only fun but also highly profitable!

I didn’t invent this trick, but I’ve used it successfully many times. It requires a group of people, ideally at least 30, and the more competitive the group is, the better, so groups of doctors and lawyers are ideal!

It’s called “The Five Dollar Auction.”

You stand up in front of the group, and hold up a five dollar bill.

You explain that you will auction this five dollar bill off, and the highest bidder gets it, even if the high bid only a dime. Bidding starts at 10 cents, and goes up in increments of 10 cents or more. There’s just one trick to this auction, and that is that when the auction ends, whoever has the second highest bid also has to pay, but doesn’t get anything. Everyone understand?

Heads nod, and you ask if anyone will bid a dime for the five dollar bill?

Bidding also proceeds quickly at first, and once the bids are at $2.60 and $2.50, you are guaranteed a profit.

Bidding continues quickly until the high bid gets to about $4.90. At that point the second highest bidder realizes that they will lose $4.80, unless they bid $5 and break even, so invariably they bid $5. There’s usually a brief pause at this point, but then the other bidder (there’s always only two bidders at this point) realizes that they will lose $4.90 unless they bid $5.10, so better to lose 10 cents than $4.90.

Once bids are over $5, the value of the item is forgotten, and it becomes a battle between the two remaining bidders, each of them alternately deciding it is better to bid higher and at least end up with the $5 bill. The competitiveness of the participants really comes into play at this point, and the bidding generally goes into higher and higher incremental bids, and can really go crazy when neither bidder wants to “lose” (even though they will both lose in the end).

The best result I ever had was with a group of about 40 surgeons, when the high bid was $410 and the second highest was $400; so $810 for a $5 bill!

The only time this came close to not working was when the two remaining bidders realized what was happening, and when the bids were at $20 and $19 they conferenced with each other and agreed to stop the bidding and split the loss evenly. Even in this case, though, the total proceeds were $39 for a $5 bill!

Enjoy and good luck!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kzc6hstojxnfi8ry', 'title': 'What is a fun psychological trick to try on someone?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This psychological trick is not only fun but also highly profitable!\n\nI didn’t invent this trick, but I’ve used it successfully many times.

Melody Thomas,7mo,Who is the best writer on Quora in psychology and psychotherapy?,"Elinor Greenberg might be the first person I ever trusted.

When I first encountered Dr. Greenberg’s work, I had just started learning about personality disorders.

And I had just started suspecting I might have one.

The “Melody” people on here know is different than the Melody Dr. Greenberg first met. That Melody was angry. Often enraged.

Suspicious.

She was just starting to see that some of her family members probably had NPD. That this mess that was her life hadn’t been entirely her fault.

This made her hopeful.

And being hopeful made her scared.

So, she put up a false front. The early “Melody” was more guarded than the real Melody and tougher. She was sometimes devaluing and often arrogant. She used words the real Melody didn’t use and pretended to be harder than she actually was.

This is the Melody Dr. Greenberg first met.

I don’t remember if I asked her a question and she answered it or if I commented on one of her posts and she responded. But I remember I used the word “narc” and that she took me to task for it.

But then she answered my question.

Respectfully.

And thoroughly.

Without holding a grudge.

And that’s when I saw how people in the caring professions were supposed to act.

My family members were in the caring professions. But they didn’t act like Dr. Greenberg. Dr. Greenberg was kind. Accepting. She answered your questions and treated you like an equal. My family members talked down to you. If you dared to say something they didn’t like, they screamed in your face.

Dr. Greenberg acted like you mattered.

This was a revelation for me.

That someone “in authority” could be kind to you. Could even disagree with something you’d said and then go on to talk matter-of-factly with you. Respectfully. Without devaluing.

Like you were a regular person.

I started to trust her. A little. And I started paying attention to what she said.

She spoke clearly. In a voice I could understand. And she had the patience to say the same thing over and over again. In slightly different ways.

Until I finally got it.

If you’ve ever read anything I’ve written about splitting and found it easy to understand, it’s because Dr. Greenberg took the time to help me understand. She wrote about splitting in a thousand different ways until I finally got it. And what I couldn’t get, she would help me get by answering my questions in the comments section.

Who does that?

And so, little by little, I came to trust someone. I came to trust that people could be kind. And patient. That I could ask something of them and they would do it. If they could. And that people — nice people — didn’t yell at you.

Just for asking.

And that made all the difference.

I’m not so angry anymore. I split less. I still have a way to go, but I’m not sure I would have even started on my way without Dr. Greenberg.

There are a lot of great psychology and psychotherapy writers on here and I’ve learned a lot from them.

But the one who changed my life was Elinor Greenberg.

And so, she gets my vote.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ltcv6q5fesramz82', 'title': 'Who is the best writer on Quora in psychology and psychotherapy?', 'score': {'original': 0.42855, 'ai': 0.57145}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Elinor Greenberg might be the first person I ever trusted.\n\nWhen I first encountered Dr. Greenberg’s work, I had just started learning about personality disorders.\n\nAnd I had just started suspecting I might have one.\n\nThe “Melody” people on here know is different than the Melody Dr. Greenberg first met.

Anonymous,5y,"As a psychologist, who is the most disturbing individual you have ever met?","The most disturbing individual I ever met was another psychologist, and he inspired me to research a paper into the motivation behind persons with PD’s becoming Psychologists (which is more common than most people appreciate).

I knew of this individual from school but had no idea he had studied Psychology.

He was the most vicious bully the school had ever seen.

Three of the people he bullied went on to commit suicide.

There was an accusation of rape levelled against him but, as it was the eighties, the girl withdrew the accusation when the police informed her there was no evidence and it was her word against his.

There was an episode where he discovered a smaller boy was claustrophobic. He locked the boy in a cupboard for over half an hour. By the time we rescued this boy he was non responsive and non verbal. This boy subsequently committed suicide.

He showed no remorse and no empathy when I met up with him years later at a seminar.

He questioned my recollection of the events at school, trying to convince me (a clinical Psychologist) that memories weren’t reliable and he had no recollection of any of “those events”.

Most disturbing was that this person was working with vulnerable youth.

I took this up with one of his Professors and demanded to know why he hadn’t spotted what, in my opinion, was an individual with a very obvious PD studying in his classes.

He replied that perhaps this individual was the perfect fit for vulnerable youth as he understood the victim/perpetrator dynamic.

I was horrified.

"David McPhee, Ph.D.",Updated 3y,"As a therapist, have you ever lost control of a session?","Yes. It was a family therapy, years ago. Dad, Mom, and three daughters, 9 to 16. The older daughters ganged up on Mom. The 16 year old accused Mom of being a “selfish drama queen.” Mom immediately started to wail, top volume, calling the daughters vile names. The two older daughters started screaming too. Nobody was listening to me. Dad looked at me helplessly. I realized people in the waiting room and other offices could hear it all.

There’s a principle in family systems theory: when the system is locked in dysfunction, change something, anything, because even random change is better than no change.

I needed some “random change” fast. I stood up, waved my arms a bit and said with all the authority I could muster “Dad, leave the room.” He fled, gladly.

Everybody got silent with surprise. Nobody expected me to send silent Dad away. I stayed standing and turned to the nine-year old and said “Melissa, can you tell me what’s going on?”

“Mom does this all the time,” she said, “and after a while she makes my sisters apologize, and they do, but they don’t mean it, and Daddy doesn’t do anything.”

I have my theories but still don’t know for sure why the impromptu random intervention worked so well, but it was a turning point. They later figured out why sending Dad out was so “brilliant,” and I never admitted it was only a desperate guess.

Shulamit Widawsky,Updated 7y,What are some amazing brain hacks?,"Turns out, your brain cannot really tell the difference between completely imagining something, and actually experiencing it.

That means, that if you don't have time to practice throwing baskets into the hoop one day, but you usually practice, you can imagine throwing basket after basket, and your brain will actually improve your skills when you get back to the court.

It means, that if you can picture yourself doing something that you are afraid of, you will become less afraid, as if you actually did it for real.

It means, that if you keep thinking that you hate doing a certain thing, or that you don't want to do a certain thing, say, washing the windows, you will convince your brain that this is a task to be avoided. But if you imagine wanting to wash the windows, over and over in your mind, by the time you get to those windows, you will actually want to wash them...which actually, you really do, because you are so tired of them being dirty.

What you tell your brain, your brain believes.

Tell it you are great.

Don't tell it you are bad.

Imagine the person you want to become, over and over, and you will become it.

Imagine the person you don't want to become, over and over, and you will become that.

Details make the difference.

This does not work if what you imagine is a final outcome, without imagining what it takes to get there. For example, imagining yourself wealthy, but not imagining yourself investing or working, will not magically create wealth. You have to have a plan, and imagine carrying out the plan. Same for fame. Same for sex. Same for career.

Does your brain distinguish real from imaginary?

Shubham KP,2y,Are you afraid of being alone?,"There are times when parental love isn't enough. Sibling’s fight doesn't excite you anymore. Friends become distant. Romantic movies seem bullshit. And your favorite book bores you to death.

Believe me, no matter where you go, there's always a lingering void enveloping you. Void, that has the might to kill as many as a hundred people ever so smoothly.

This void is catastrophic. Heart-wrenching. And makes you suffer a deep restlessness that won’t go away for hours.

You might be brimming with self-love. But that doesn't help. Sadly. As sometimes, self-love isn't enough. Sometimes, all your ‘self’ wants is to be held by someone. Someone, who can say I love you. And mean it.

Someone, who's fond of your scars. Someone, who can bear you for long. Someone with whom you can see forever.

And if you haven't found that person, yet— it hurts. No. Not like hell. But like thousands of hells combined.

The situation gets worse if you've built a rock wall across your heart. Where you won't let anyone stroll inside. You’ve some firewalls, some filters, that’s never met by a single person.

And deep down, you know it never will. As you’re too afraid to open up. You keep pushing people away.

But that's okay. It doesn't matter. As that’s how things always were.

Alone.

Alienated.

And, all by yourself.

We all are gifted,

Cristian Mihai,8mo,"How realistic is ""Lord of the Flies""?","Let's say you find yourself in a plane crash. It's you and a couple dozen children, stranded on an uninhabited island, just like in Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"". Sounds like the plot to another one of those TV series you'd binge-watch, right? But ask yourself, how realistic is it?

We're not talking about the physics of the crash or the botany of the island. No, you're wondering how quickly those cherubic, innocent faces would dissolve into feral snarls, forsaking civilization for a conch shell and a sharpened stick.

It's easy to nod along with Golding, view human nature as a thin veneer, easily shredded. Our barbarism is not some antique relic; it's a vintage classic, lovingly maintained, just waiting for the garage door to open.

But reality is not as romantic as fiction, and the real world doesn't always conform to the dystopian prophecies of dead British novelists.

In 1965, six boys from Tonga did get stranded on an island for 15 months. No adults, just them, the sky, the sand, the sea. Their story? No Piggy got squashed by a boulder. No paranoia-induced hunts. They worked together, water pooled in coconut shells, watch shifts to keep the fire burning. They survived not through anarchy, but unity.

So how realistic is ""Lord of the Flies""? It's as realistic as our own fears, our own insecurities. It reflects not the reality of stranded boys, but the terrifying mirage of our own potential savagery. It's a chilling cautionary tale, but remember, cautionary tales aren't predictions. They are, above all, warnings against what we could become, not prophecies of what we will.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r3ijzlwq0592baek', 'title': 'How realistic is ""Lord of the Flies""?', 'score': {'original': 0.1882, 'ai': 0.8118}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Let\'s say you find yourself in a plane crash.

Luise,1y,What incidents shook psychiatry to its foundations?,"In 1973, a study entitled ""On Dwelling in Insane Places"" shocked psychologists and psychiatrists around the world.

Nothing for them was as it once was. What made this study so remarkable ?

The Rosenhan experiment was conducted by a psychologist named David Rosenhan and has since been considered one of the most remarkable studies in the field.

The Stanford professor and his associates pretended to hallucinate in order to be admitted to psychiatric hospitals.

When they were admitted, the men behaved absolutely normally.

They told the hospital staff that they had recovered and no longer had any hallucinations.

But in the psychiatric wards they were simply not released and forced to admit that they were suffering from a mental illness.

On average, the team members had to stay in the ""closed"" for 19 days and were diagnosed with schizophrenia, except for one of them.

They were released on the condition that they take anti-psychotics.

Rosenhan had reassured his family before the experiment, telling them that yes, he could leave when enough was enough.

But they locked him up for two months.

One was released only if one admitted that the psychiatrists were right in what they said.

You had to admit that you were crazy, but you could say that you were better now.

The ""patient"" who had to stay the longest was kept for 52 days, although he said from the beginning that he no longer heard voices.

All of the pseudo-patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia ""in remission"" prior to their release.

Rosenhan felt that this indicated that mental health problems were not considered diseases that could be completely cured.

After all, having schizophrenia ""in remission"" does not mean that one is completely healthy.

It was enough for psychiatrists , if you heard voices once in your life , to label you as sick for the rest of your life .

Rosenhan made his study and its results public.

And the psychiatric guild naturally got very upset about it and rejected all the accusations.

They claimed that they themselves would never fall into his trap and could quite safely distinguish pseudopatients from real patients.

One of the psychiatric hospitals contacted Rosenham and asked him to send pseudo patients to their hospital without warning.

In their hospital, he said, such a thing could never happen, and they would be able to distinguish whether patients were faking their symptoms.

Rosenhan sent them a total of 193 patients, and the hospital identified 41 of them as pseudopatients.

But Rosenhan hadn't sent any pseudopatients at all. All of them actually had serious mental health problems.

All of this triggered an earthquake. Psychiatry changed. And that's fortunate.

But there is still a lot to do.

Roland Bartetzko,8mo,How traumatizing are war flashbacks?,"I get flashbacks all the time. No surprise here: I fought in two wars (Bosnia and Kosovo) and now I’m in Ukraine, supporting the war effort.

Yesterday, for example, I was walking to a meeting in a suburb of Kyiv. To my surprise, the ground was sandy and there were a lot of pine trees growing on the sides of the streets. To me, everything looked a lot like in Mostar, a city in Bosnia and Hercegovina that saw a lot of fighting.

The residential buildings were built in the same (ugly) style as in former Yugoslavia, and even the level of dilapidation was the same. This is quite unusual for Kyiv: usually, the buildings here are always kept in very good condition.

Kyiv, in one of the less affluent neighborhoods.

There were some broken benches in front of the buildings and it was extremely hot. I was suddenly brought back to my time in the Bosnian war. I’ve been sitting many times on similar-looking benches, drinking beer with my Croatian comrades.

The only thing that was different this time, I thought to myself, was the absence of any stench. In Bosnia, there was always a bit of a bad smell in the air: a mixture of feces, human sweat, and dead animals.

I enjoyed my flashback, I had an adventurous time in Bosnia. Of course, there was a lot of suffering but there were also some good times, for example, sitting on a bench under the shadow of a tree and sipping on your beer.

Some flashbacks, of course, are less amusing. But even the worst ones do remind me that I’m still alive and that it could have been worse.

Indu Dahiya,Updated 1y,Does it seem to you this Covid19 has turned into a mental illness as well?,"I would like to say yes.

I'm a nursing officer at AIIMS Delhi. Being a health care worker, it is my responsibility to take care of my patient whether it's HIV or coronavirus. We usually deal with hepatitis and HIV patients with standard precautions.

But coronavirus is a new thing to everyone. I want to share what happened today in my department.

I reached my department at 1:30 pm for my evening shift(after walking for 30–40 minutes as there was no means of transportation due to lockdown) on entering I saw staff members totally covered, wearing protective equipments. At first I was shocked, but on enquiry I came to know that there is a patient admitted who is suspected of having coronavirus. The patient was admitted first in new emergency and then transferred to my department. At the time nobody knew that he had most of the symptoms of Covid 19. All the night staff, morning staff and emergency staff and patients in same cabin were thereby exposed. Everybody was in shock. Immediately samples (oropharyngeal swab) were sent for testing, whose results were to come after 6–8 hours. Immediately the patient was isolated and nobody was allowed to enter or leave the ward. All the morning staff present ,were in fear of being infected and afraid of touching one another. Nobody had eaten breakfast or lunch and they refused to go to home in fear of infecting their loved ones. Patients were afraid and a few developed fever due to panic. Finally ,we received a call after a long wait of 7 hours saying that the report is negative and everybody gave a sigh of relief.

And these are the happy faces😊 after negative report of first covid suspect in AB2 (AIIMS) On 22 March, 2020. (Mask is removed for pic purpose only)

I want to say that yes, the disease is here and it’s contagious and spreading like anything, but panicking will not help us out, we have to fight it by taking precautions.

The Govt. and the health care system is doing all they can do and now, as citizens it’s our responsibility to break the chain of infection. I'm a health care worker staying away from my family and like me there are many more out there, whether doctors, nurses, paramedics and hospital staff. We don't know whether we will be able to meet our family again, but we will fight till our last breath. We will definitely win, may be at the cost of our healthcare worker's lives, yet I feel proud that I'm part of a life saving system.

So here is a humble request to you all. Please be safe by breaking the chain and staying at home.

Jai hind.

The incident i narrated got proof 👇

First case,which i told u .

Second case,we are waiting for the report, which I have been caring for last two days, almost all the staff have been exposed in my department i.e. AB2 Gastro. Let's wait for the result now.

And COVID team has been prepared, trauma centre in AIIMS is vacated to contain these patients. Staff will be on rotation. The team will care for some days and the individual staff will go on quarantine (isolation) under observation for 14 days. If they are well after 14 days, they will be called back. Alternatively the other team will operate.

They’d ask me where I was going when I had a week off, and I’d tell them I couldn’t afford to go anywhere, and they wouldn’t believe me. They’d assume I was just being cheap. They asked why I drove an old car, and I’d tell them I couldn’t afford a new one, and they wouldn’t believe me. And so on…\n\nAll of this happened in Chicago. For some people here, “white” is synonymous with “rich.” It’s not true, of course. But some people believe it.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.6999
