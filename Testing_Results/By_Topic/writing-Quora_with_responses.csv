Nana Bello Shehu,Updated 4y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"“Till Death Do Us Part”

Two Selfless Souls.

WARNING: HEART-RENDING CONTENT AHEAD.

Jake Coates and Emmy Collett, childhood Sweethearts. They dated for years before they got separated after college but eventually, they reunited.

Finally, in 2016, this couple took a bold step created time out of their busy schedule (Emmy, a teacher in London and Jake, a medical Doctor in Sydney) to move their relationship to the next phase, and planned to spend time together for the first time after a long time. What can really go wrong?

But one fateful morning everything came crashing down when they found out Emmy had terminal thyroid cancer. Unknown to Emmy, Jake had planned to propose to her during this vacation. But to Jake nothing in life can hinder him from his plan, instead, he proposed to her with a cup of tea on a sick bed. So sweet and romantic yet quite sad.

She agreed of course.

Emmy cried throughout their whole process of marriage, even to the moment “till death do us part.” because she knows literary what those words really meant.

Her beautiful smile almost hides the fact that this moment is just but for a bit.

She had her dream just like she'd imagined but she knew it would only to be for just a moment. She never allowed pain to steal away her precious time, She tried to enjoy life to the fullest, with the little time she had left.

At the time, she said: ""Although all of this news has been a shock and challenging at times, it has also made me realize how important and precious every day is and to enjoy and treasure every moment.”

And so she did. Living her life like there's no tomorrow, which is for certain.

They got matching tattoos.

At a Coldplay concert.

Does she look like someone that has but a few months to live? The illness may try to take everything from her but not her cheerful outlook.

When this selfless lady sees that if she can't have Jake’s child, she feels that it was her duty, just as she put it on a sad note, “As his wife, I should be able to give him one and I can’t.”

Thank God for surrogacy.

Emmy and Jake's old school friend, Liz, steps in to help this couple when she heard about their plan.

Three weeks later, Liz conceives. It's the best moment of their lives but Emmy’s health is gradually failing.

Even in extreme pain and to her very last moments, she always blessed the world with her beautiful smile.

Emmy succumbed to the illness in June 2017, but her bravery and smile throughout her battle are one of the things she will always be remembered for.

After her death, Liz's pregnancy got complicated and she later lost the child. To many, it might seem that Jake suffered a second loss, but to him, it wasn't so:

""Emmy will be up there with her little baby Emmy, always be watching over us and be wanting us all to continue her legacy - to keep smiling, loving and being kind.""

Although their story has a tragic ending, Their bravery, the Love and commitment they shared will always be a legacy to remember.

And finally in Jake's words:

“You have inspired so many and given so many people the hope and strength they have needed to continue on in the darkest of times. You are and always will be the biggest inspiration to me. I love you, angel. Now and always,” he wrote in a Facebook post.

Jake, a selfless and kind soul, gave her love and happiness and smoothed her journey.

She left a legacy: Smile, Love, Kindness and always live like there is no tomorrow, even when literary there's no tomorrow for you. ❤

This gave me hope in humanity.

Thanks for reading. ❤

Mamta Satywali,Updated 6y,How do you increase the value of a white paper without writing on it?,"1.Take two big bowls filled with saffron and green color respectively.

2.Hold the white paper breadthwise and make sure the ratio of sides is 3:2(length x breadth) as shown below.

3.Dip the upper 1/3rd rectangle of the sheet into the bowl full of saffron color, as shown next.

4.Dip the lower 1/3rd part of rectangle into the bowl containing green color.You’ll get something like this:

5.Take a smaller bowl , paint its rim with navy blue color and press it down exactly at the center of this rectangle, like this:

6.Finally, take a matchstick or toothpick(or any stick of similar girth) whose length is equal to the radius of the bowl used in point 5.Now, dip this stick in the same navy blue color and paint the circle above with 24 equal radii partitions to get something similar to this:

And done…

You have just profoundly increased the value of the white paper, which was mere sheet of paper initially, is now representing the world’s most populous(apx 1/6th of world’s population) democratic country’s flag, INDIA.

You may now feel proud of yourself.

Ben A. Wise,Updated 5y,What brought tears to your eyes?,"Six decades ago, my grandparents decided to donate their bodies to science.

They didn’t know when they would die. They just knew that others could benefit from their death.

It wasn’t common back then. People were superstitious. The thought of young medical students slicing through the veins and arteries of the mass of flesh that once housed your consciousness was appalling.

And yet they were both true to their word.

My grandmother was always generous. Whenever she saw me, she would lavish me with affection and food. I can’t count the number of times she took me out to nice restaurants.

After Alzheimer’s had devoured through her hippocampus and conversations would reset every two minutes or so, her constant refrain was, “Can I give you some money? I want you to get something nice for yourself.”

She did alright between her late husband’s pension and the money the German government sent her every month as compensation for property seized—and family members slaughtered—during WWII, but she wasn’t especially wealthy.

Last time my wife and I visited her, she said, “If you see something around the house you like, please take it. I won’t need anything where I’m going.”

This Sunday, she passed away, four years shy of a full century on this Earth.

The way I see it, her generosity is so large that she gave away the very last thing she owned on this planet—her corporeal frame—to the progress of science and medicine.

And that spirit of largesse, that selfless giving all the way to the very end, that final gesture of benevolence, brings tears to my eyes.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/t3pus7crwyv290od', 'title': 'What brought tears to your eyes?', 'score': {'original': 0.9979, 'ai': 0.0021}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Six decades ago, my grandparents decided to donate their bodies to science.\n\nThey didn’t know when they would die.

Prasanjeet Ghosh,Updated 4y,What brought tears to your eyes?,"A few days ago I attended a function where I met a lady. My aunt told me about her and my eyes were full of tears.

She was 17 years old when she got married to a man who was roughly 14 years older than her. After 1 month of her marriage, she came to know that her husband was an alcoholic and every night he abused her and forced her to bring money from her mother. When she denied, he used an iron rod to beat her.

Many times she told her mother about these problems but her mother said:

“This is a problem of every house and you’ve to fix it or face it”

Her mother in Law was worse than her husband and gave only 2-time meal and forced her to do all kinds of stuff like Cleaning, washing, etc..

A few months later when she got pregnant, her family members said if you give birth to a girl then you’ll have to leave this house. Unfortunately, she gave birth to a girl child.

That day was the worst day of her life, and they beat her badly and forced her to leave the house.

She had thought of suicide but that child’s face stopped her and she knows she has to work hard to make her child successful.

She sold her Gold earrings and from next day she got a job in a paper carry bag factory, where she got Rs150/2000 carry bags. She had to work at least 8 to 9 hours daily.

Along with this work she worked as a table and utensils cleaner in a Dhaba. And she worked there for 5 to 6 hours daily and able to earn 100Rs/day.

Image Source: Google and my gallery

Now she can manage 250 to 300Rs daily which was sufficient to feed her baby.

A few months later she faced some back related problems and this made her weak. After this problem, she had to left that cleaner’s job and started work as a laborer in toys factory.

This is how she managed her daughter’s education and did many works to makes her children’s life easy, she knows that “God only help them who works hard”

I met her daughter yesterday and guess what, she scored 93% in Higher secondary and she wants to be a Doctor.

She had nothing except her daughter and she left her husband and she had no Idea what she will do next but she believed in herself.

Thanks for reading :)

Jean-Marie Valheur,2y,Why is Anne Frank's diary the most well-known diary over other Holocaust victims?,"Because of several reasons. First off, Anne Frank was actually a pretty damn good writer. She died at sixteen and wrote like a woman far older. Secondly, her father Otto Frank was a businessman before the war and he knew a good product when he saw one, he also understood the need to edit his daughter’s words somewhat, remove some parts that may have been ill-received at the time.

The age of Anne Frank is probably what made her work so monumental — her youth, and the sense of impending doom one gets from reading her words, knowing already the tragic outcome she herself has no clue about. She will die. She is young. She is bright. Writes far, far more coherently and more beautifully and correctly than the vast majority of girls her age ever would or could.

And you just know this is a girl who could have made it big. You know this is a girl who had tremendous talents. Who could have been a writer, a politician, an activist. Instead all she became is a symbol of tragedy. At the time her diary was published and made available to the world, her testimony was earth-shatteringly haunting. And it still is.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7ercilmvuk5dj1hn', 'title': ""Why is Anne Frank's diary the most well-known diary over other Holocaust victims?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Because of several reasons.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am born third daughter in indian middleclass family. My parents were dying to have a son. My mother had sex determination tests done at second and third pregnancy, she wanted to abort but my father convinced her otherwise. When I was born she went into shock, refusing to feed me.

In my teens I remember her saying that she did not care much if we as kids were crying, she said slapping our faces made us stop crying.

Me and my sisters grew up confused, trying to put up a happy front, pleasing her. She was not very generous with her approvals. Appreciation from her was beyond our reach.

Her wardrobe was full of clothes she bought left and right. We got one dress every year. The two younger sisters would wear the handed down dress from the oldest. Needless to say, till the time I graduated, I have worn my elder sisters clothes.

After many abortions, my brother was born. We were finally relieved of the guilt of being born as girls. Now every thing was about him. Three of us were made to look after him at nights when he cried while she slept. The movie chandani was going hit that time. Sridevi dancing on the “9 choodiyan ” song was very famous. Two of us went to a choodi shop and bought the same 9 red choodi. Our giggling and laughter made the monster awake. Infront of my dad and few servants she called us “whores”.

Two of us did well acedemicaly, she would then compare our scores trying to make us fight. This was later about salaries.

Gifting her branded clothes, shoes, purses, mobiles did not make her happy. She would make faces. She would tell her friends that she bought all those. Always demeaning us infront of them.

I wanted to buy an apartment, I had saved some but was falling short of 1.5 lakhs for the down payment. I believed my parents would loan me that, and would also be my garantor. She created such drama instead of simply saying “no”. She refused after two days. Later a school friend told me my mother had loaned her 1 lakh for some renovation of her house. I did not know what to say.

When my daughter was two weeks, she was crying non stop. My mother was about to slap her when I stopped her. This made the monster inside her awake. Gossiping, spreading lies, making things difficult for me was the least, she went ahead with starving me in the name of weight gain, I was only 60 kgs!!!!

My father has been a silent spectator. Usually agreeing with her or then staying quiet.Like us he must also be confused.

I am 38 years old. I do not talk with my mother or my sisters. Sometimes I weep at nights. I am very good at maintaining a happy face. I am still trying to figure out why she did not help me with the loan. I try to forget about it.

My kids are awesome. I love them. I do not know how a mother should be. But I know how a mother should NOT be.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nqipm4szg5oheb9u', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.51865, 'ai': 0.48135}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am born third daughter in indian middleclass family.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I was gential mutilated (Infibulation) by my parents when I was 9 years old.

For those who don't know the Infibulation… its a pharaonic mutilation, which is done through cutting the girl’s external genitalia.

I live in Sudan. I was 9. One day morning, my sister and I were taken to a woman who used to do this surgery. I remember the room, it was meesy and untidy.There was no privacy, lot’s of women were in the room looking, and some kids (who I don't remember where the hell did they come from!), were on the windows sneaking the glances and laughing, while I was crying. On the small table, there were cotton, water, razors and other stuff. I was terrified, loudly screaming and flinging. Two or three women held me so I can't move. I was begging. The womon took the razor and killed me.

At house People were celebrating, food and songs. I had to stay in the bed for several weeks. Visitors came to congratulate and give me money and gifts! the suffer didn't stop here. It was extremely hard to move, or sit for several weeks. Bathroom was always a catastrophe, the pain was untolerable lots of scream, blood, and tears.

Many years after, I questioned my mother. Why did she do it? As I was taught at school how devirly it is. She answered “to make you clean. It's our tradition, my mother did it. I did it, and you should do it to your future daughter, as well”. By the time I realized that my mom doesn't like to speak about it at all, I don't know was it because of the guilt or for she was avoiding her bad memories from her childhood.

I mean, to make me clean of what!? They never tell the reason, and I doubt if they know the reason in the first place! People where I belong have fear of thinking, they rather choose to follow, for its easier.

Finally, and thank for education, I got answers. old practices related to purity, for maintaining us virgin, to not bring the shame to our families. “you have no clitor..difficult to get lust.. you stay virgin!. And when you get married, your feeling doesn't matter, you are almost like a sex doll”

I wish no more girls will go through what I went through. although the law prevents it now, but it's still happening secretly.

I have a freind who comes from an educated family, and didn't have to go through it. She asked once “ what is it feel?”

I answered “ I don't feel”.

Sorry for my bad English and poor narrating. I needed a vent.

EDIT:

Thank you so much for your kind words, and support, it really means a lot.

Just to make things clear…

Some people in the comments considered me to be a Muslim, and started attacking Islam although, I didn't mention my religious background!. I am not defending any religion here, it's just that Sudan is a divers country, these practices aren't done by Muslims only, Coptic Christian and some animist groups are known with it, as well. People keep doing things and traditions, then attribute it to religions
Yes, there are some organizations in Sudan fighting to stop it. It's less now than in the past .

‘That is not the case. You know I'm not comfortable with sexting and pictures. You know I love you, I just need some time.’

Shubham KP,1y,"Be honest, why do you write on Quora?","Many girls were throwing their hearts at this flair writer.

He wrote an answer on heartbreak. And seemed like every girl in the comment section wanted to elope with our writer.

I couldn't believe a boy can make girls fall in love with him. Just by words.

I never thought words can be so luring. So powerful.

And that, frankly framing, was my sole motivation to start writing on Quora.

It took me around 1–2 years to get in the light. And to get dm from girls. And it was one of the most sedating feelings, ever.

Getting so many messages from girls was kind of overwhelming. Keeping in mind that I was just an everyday guy (I still am) from a small city— I never saw this coming.

But soon, things began to fade.

I talked to many girls on Quora. And some of them even happened to be my really nice friends. But eventually, I got to know I didn't want a hundred knockout girls.

I just needed one.

That ‘one’ ordinary girl who'll love me like the protagonist of some John Green novel.

And by and by, she found me.

I wrote an answer about ‘five reasons not to date me' and she didn’t eye the ‘not’ in that question.

And then?

Chats turned into long chats.
Long chats turned into Telegram.
Telegram turned into a phone call.
A phone call turned into innumerous long calls.
Innumerous long calls turned her being the first-ever person I've met from Quora.
And this meeting turned out to be something more…

After 24 years, 1 month, and 12 days of my grave existence on Earth, she turned out to be the first-ever girl whom I've rested my lips on, romantically.

And now that I have her— the longing to write continually on Quora is slowly sinking.

I'm being loved outside Quora, like a newborn, and I've to figure out if I crave anything else for the time being.

We all are gifted,

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am BSF jawan posted at Punjab Frontier, FHQ Jalandhar, Ferozepur Sector. Here I would like to open up my heart.

It's really cold out here during especially winters. We find our warmth in the very little calls we make to our dear ones.
If you see any army man just pass a smile. You never know how much great it feels out there.
Sometimes we sleep just 3 hours but we never regret because it's after all we who chose to live this life.
It feels kind of demeaning and discouraging when our own people suspect our bravery.
We go by the thought 'Everyone's got to die one day so why not die worthy'.
It makes every army jawan sad when the people who we try to protect themselves are behind our death.
Guns seem quite amazing in a virtual world but in reality it's a 3kg burden we carry.
We live the ‘present’ at its fullest because there is no assurance of a ‘tomorrow’.
When such headlines and pictures pop up

Kirti Chakra awardee beaten up in road rage

It hurts more than any metal bullets.

We do celebrate Diwali and Eid with everyone where one's religion doesn't matter. It's among some of our joyful moments.
We have some pesky neighbours but in the end, we all sail the same boat to safeguard our nation.

But it's an amazing life with your friends, sharing thoughts and working together. Afterall, it's the thinking that even if we struggle, there are millions out there who live peacefully and that's what drives us.

A life of an army jawan.

Have a nice day!

I am a 34 year old, MALE. IIT. Computer Science. I got placed in a top MNC in Bangalore.

As soon as I got the job I got comfortable in the project. It was a maintenance kind of project and I was happy to work over there because I didn’t want to work hard(That was my attitude! That too in my initial years of career). Years passed and somehow I managed “not to get” low performer. I just worked that much so that I don’t get LP and don’t get fired. That was my goal. Company decided to close that project after 4 years and I moved to another project and as I was good at maintaining the project. The manager put me again on one more maintenance project and as the work was in my comfort zone. I agreed to take that. I was 4 year experienced that time and I could have asked for more challenging work! but No!! I didn’t care that time. that year I got blessed with my daughter so I wanted to spend time with her and I thought this is the time I should give time to my family than working hard in office.

5 more years passed!! few bug fixes!! few feature implementation! but no technical skill improvement. I am almost 10 year experienced now and my technical skill are like a 2 year experienced person. I always escaped taking interview too!! because I was not confident about my skills and I was scared of giving and taking interviews. I avoided challenging technical discussions with peers. In June 2018, I decided to change my company and then I realized how much time I wasted working on a maintenance projects. How casually I took my career which I could have made great! Wherever I am giving interview, I am getting rejection saying your skills are not sufficient for this level. Its been 5 months already and I got 7 rejections!! My situation is depressing! I am working on my coding skills. Reading tech blogs. and regretting everyday about my past casual attitude!

I hope I catch up soon!

Shreyas Chavhan,4y,Can you write something inspiring so that I can be inspired?,"Have you recognised the man sitting on the back seat of the bike?

By his appearance, you must be thinking that he might be a boy from lower middle class family, working in a grocery to earn money and support his family.

But no, that's not the truth.

He is Dhravya Dholakia, son of a billionaire Savji Dholakia.

( Image Credit - Google Images)

Surat diamond magnate Savji Dholakia caught the world’s attention two years ago when he rewarded 1200 employees with apartments and cars as Diwali bonus.

For teaching his son how challenging life is, he decided to ask his son Dhravya Dholakia to go to an unfamiliar place and earn livelihood through odd work.

(Image Credit- Google Images)

Dhravya Dholakia accepted his father's challenge and left for Kochi with Rs 7000, a pair of clothes and nothing else.

Condition of his challenge

First Dharvya needed to find some work but wherever he joins, he should not stay there for more than a week.
He should not use his father’s identity
He should not use those Rs 7000 until an emergency.

Dhravya accepted the challenge and went to Kochi where Hindi would not help him.

What difficulties he had faced?

For 5 days, Dhravya did not have any proper place to stay nor did he have any job. He was rejected from 60 places, he lied that he was from a very poor family and wanted to earn money to help his family. At last he got a job in a bakery. He kept switching jobs. Do you know how much he earned? He earned Rs 4000.

( Image Credit- Google Images)

Dhravya Dholakia said

I never worried about money and here I was struggling to get a one time meal worth Rs 40 and I needed another Rs 250 per day to stay in a lodge.

What do you think? Wasn't that inspiring?

Every father (whether from rich or middle class family) should do this experiment with his son/daughter to teach them true values of life.

Thanks for Reading!

Shefali Naidu,Updated 5y,Can you write something so strong it will make me cry?,"Back when I taught dance to kids in an NGO, I had this boy called Rahul and his twin sister Anjali. They were about 8-9 years old.

I had this session after the class where I would sit with them and talk. Anything. They would share some incidents and I would listen. I would tease them and make them laugh.

During one such session, Rahul asked me if I know how he and his sister were named.

“I don't know. Tell me.”

“Because my parents loved Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (Hindi movie).”

“Is it?”

“Yes. They loved Shah Rukh and Kajol so much that they gave us those names.”

“Wow. That's interesting.”

“They would tell us how we will also be very happy and successful like Rahul and Anjali in the movie.”

I smiled at the enthusiasm.

Suddenly another kid asked if there was a movie called Shiva and he was wondering if his name was kept because of that. All of them laughed.

I excused myself to get some water, when an NGO guy walked up to me and said,

“Rahul and Anjali have never seen their parents. They were given to our ashram when they were a few days old.”

I stared at him.

“But he said….”

“He says that to everyone he meets. He makes stories about what his parents must have worked as. What they said to them. What they liked to eat. We just listen and smile. We never contradict them. They love their small bubble of happiness.”

I looked over at them, and Rahul was telling something to the other kids who were looking at him in rapt attention.

I went and hugged him and Anjali.

“You know what, I will tell your story to all the people I meet. Everyone should know how amazing were Rahul and Anjali's parents to name them that.”

He smiled and said,

“You know they loved Brinjal. No kids love Brinjal in our ashram. But Anjali and I do. Sunita aunty said it's because our parents might have loved it. I am sure she is right. Does it happen as such?”

“Yes it does,” I replied.

I last heard of them when they had secured a scholarship due to their excellent percentage. After that I kept moving and changing numbers, and I lost contact.

Rahul and Anjali must be 19-year-olds today, studying to have a bright future or working somewhere to earn a living. Whatever they must be doing, I am sure both of them must be as enthusiastic and optimistic about life.

I hope they have a Quora account and they see this answer and know that Shefali Didi has kept her promise of telling the whole world of how they were named.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dmato80q5fel7jbs', 'title': 'Can you write something so strong it will make me cry?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Back when I taught dance to kids in an NGO, I had this boy called Rahul and his twin sister Anjali.

Franklin Veaux,5y,How do hackers know when they have been caught (I'm writing a scene for a novel)?,"Usually, they know when the FBI shows up at their door.

Jeanne Girolami,Updated 6y,"If dogs had Quora, what kind of questions would they ask?","My lady-human whelped recently, but there was only one baby in the litter. Is this normal?

I am concerned about possible emotional developmental delays for this singleton human baby in the future. Having no littermates to learn socialization skills from, will this baby grow up to believe she is the center of the universe? For instance, how will she learn that she won't always have all the food to herself? Or that not every toy in the house is hers and hers alone? I'm sure she will never allow another human to share her crib, her stroller, or her car seat. I'm quite concerned about what may happen when, inevitably, at some human-park, she will be faced with having to relinquish a stick or a toy to a superior human? Will she know that it's not acceptable to bite another human too hard, or pull their ears with too much force? Will she aggressively take another's pacifier or bottle?

Another concern I have is that the baby is now eight weeks old, but she shows no signs of being ready to walk or talk. She just lays down all day. Additionally, she has no teeth, which seems to cause her to drool constantly. When shes not sleeping, shes either crying or making odd gurgling or cooing sounds, like some kind of strange bird.

Leon Brennan,5y,How do you know if writing is your thing?,"Homework is for nerds.

That's exactly what Mom's boyfriend used to say. In hindsight, I can see why he used to say that. It gave him the whole evening to hang out, get high and try to get laid, as opposed to helping my brother and me with our schoolwork.

The good thing about homework being for nerds was when I brought home my report card I didn't get in trouble. This is my 7th-grade report card from Ephrata Junior High.

Phys Ed had no homework, obviously.

Over the years, my grades never really improved. The ten or so people who were my classmates, who now follow me on Quora, I'm sure would attest to that fact.

When I started answering questions on Quora, my ability to write and communicate was, well, worse than awful. I’d read the question, I thought I knew the answer, but I had no idea how to get there.

At the beginning of 2018, I started really studying other people’s answers. I noticed a flow in the way they answered questions. I followed them (and still follow them) because I admired how great they were at communicating.

I ask(ed) people for direction and advice all the time. I take suggestions seriously.

Instead of telling people what to do and writing answers like a confused know-it-all ass hole, I started writing about personal experience. I stopped advising because really, who the hell am I?

I found that by sharing what happened to me, the amount of enjoyment I got from writing went up immensely.

When I share some of those experiences it also helps me learn things about myself. Writing from experience allows me to reflect on how I handled a situation and look for ways to improve.

I think that writing is for me because it helps me focus, which is something I’m always trying to work on. It has also improved my ability to communicate with my family.

But I know for sure that writing is for me because it has opened doors that I never even knew existed.

And as far as homework being for nerds, that was one of the biggest lies I was ever told in my life.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am 25 years old girl from Nagpur. I lost my father when I was 16 years old. He left me with my mom and an elder brother who is schizophrenic. After his demise, I was the only one to take care of my family. He left us with a home and minimal savings on which we had survive hardly two months . I was a very pampered kid when he was around. Every day after his loss I realized I am not a kid anymore. After completing my 12th, I started searching for part time jobs. I worked in an hospital as a computer operator and since then my struggle started. I scored moderate marks in 12th and was lucky enough to get admission in one of top engineering colleges in Nagpur. Since then I knew I have responsibility of my mom and brother and I just have to work hard to make things better at home. We had survived on Roti and Salt for years. Those were the days when we were unable to pay even electric bill and we had to survive on a candle light. This is when I sensed poverty at my home every day.

Shefali Naidu,6y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"I am not a typical Indian mother.

I do not forgo my wishes for my daughter.

I cannot magically find things in the cupboard. I look for them with the family in tow.

I cannot make delicious dishes all the time.

I readily agree to have a meal outside.

My house isn't spick and span all the time.

I can't cook a meal in a jiffy for uninvited guests.

I love having time for myself.

I look forward for a date alone with my husband.

I left my daughter and husband and went on an all girls trip.

I cook food which I like and don't feel guilty about it.

I have never forced my daughter to have green veggies, because I have never given her a choice. We all have our meals together and she eats what we eat.

Sounds harsh? Unmotherly?

Maybe it is. But does that make me a less of a mother?

No.

I still love my daughter to the core. I am a new generation parent and I don't fit the bill of the age-old stereotyped mother who is an epitome of sacrifice. An unselfish person.

It is high time we stop stereotyping moms out there.

A question I read the other day,

“My mom didn't prepare hot food for me when I returned home last night. How can I show my anger without pissing her off?”

This is what it has come to. A mother is taken for granted without blinking an eye. And because this trend is so prevalent, mothers like me who do not fit the bill are frowned upon.

Please don't give me the Mothers-are-unselfish-That's-how-they-show-love bullshit.

They are like this because they have seen their mother and had it ingrained in them to behave in a certain way. If given a chance, no mother wants to stay hungry till their kid has eaten. No mother wants to eat only what their kids like all the time.

The society and the unnecessary hammering about a certain way a mother is perceived are the real reason behind it.

Such sacrifices are one of the reasons youth out there are scared of getting married and becoming parents.

Break the stereotypes. Your love for your kids isn't in any way related to the sacrifices you make.

Unconditional love sure is a thing. But not at the cost of the mother’s happiness.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cz4ht162xfigwkro', 'title': 'Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am not a typical Indian mother.\n\nI do not forgo my wishes for my daughter.\n\nI cannot magically find things in the cupboard.

Vidushi Gupta,Updated 6y,What is the best original romantic conversation you can write?,"*Five years of relationship. Both were settled in their life. Out on a dinner date for the fifth anniversary.

He- You booked the whole restaurant ?

She (mischeviously) - Nope. Probably no other person decided to come here this evening. Probably their food is bad.

He chuckles.

They both have dinner. Talks about random things. About orange bars, and chole bhature and black dogs, and selling pani-puri together in future. The waiter pours more wine after dinner.

He- Will you dance with me?

She (thoughtfully)- Let me think, I am wearing a saree, heels, am a terrible dancer. *Think some more* Definitely. (With a wide smile).

She take her heels off. They both start with naagin dance and then do some random steps. Then they settle down for slow dancing. She keeps her head on his chest.

He (his arms around her, his face on her head)- I love your perfume.

She (playfully) - I also love my perfume.

He smiles.

Just then, the projector starts playing a movie on the screen. A ten minute movie of their memories together. He is in awe of it. Five years of memories. Sweet, bitter, painful, lovely. The roller coaster ride. The smiles and the tears, the break ups and the patchups. The songs and the photos, the movie has it all. It ends. He turns around, pleasantly surprised on this lovely gift, and finds her sitting on her knees, in a red saree, with a ring in her hand, surrounded by the photographs he had taken over the years, her books, and some cookery books.

She - I can't promise to bring or buy stars for you, I am not that rich. But I can promise that together we will have two little stars of our own who'll make our life beautiful. I can't promise to be the best cook ever, but I can promise that together we will burn many chapatis. I can't promise that I will look stunning in every photograph you will take, but I can promise that I will always be beside you in each of them. I can't promise the world that I will write for it, but I can promise that you will wake up to my words every morning for the rest of your life. So Mr Handsome, will you marry me ?

He sits down on his knees too. Tears of joy in his eyes, a wide smile over his handsome face.

He- Shouldn't I be doing this ?

She (smilingly) - Stupid boy. Just say your signature hmm, acha, okay, vhi, Sahi hai. Just say yes, my knees are paining. Also I will make you wash this Saree. She pulls his nose.

Prashant Motwani,Updated 5y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel happy?,"I will share a story which brought tears to my eyes.

An old lady receives a box with a note at the top .
The note is from her son, which read ;

“ Sorry mom, Couldn’t make it back again this year.

Here is something for you.”

3. The old lady finds a robot in the box .

“She thought, she can use the robot for the household works”

She asked the robot to help her clean the house , to which the robot happily agreed.

4. The robot was a very smart one.

It used to clean the entire house , water the plants and also cook for the old lady.

5. The robot used to take full care of the old lady,

as if, she was the robot’s mother.

6 . Slowly, the old lady also started taking care of the robot.

She started developing affection for the robot , as if, it was her very own son.

7. Whenever, the robot batteries would discharge,

The old lady, herself, used to change its batteries. The robot used to watch her do this.

7. One fine day, the robot saw the old lady sitting on her chair, with her eyes closed.

The robot tried a lot to wake her up, but all its attempts failed.

8. The robot saw the empty pocket of the old lady and naively thought;

“Maybe, the batteries need to be changed”

9. So, the robot brought new batteries and started filling her pockets with the batteries, hoping, that this would wake her up.

8. When the robot saw that nothing is working;

It then gave her one last hug, and removed its own batteries and filled the old ladies pocket.

As soon as the robot removed its batteries, it died too

10. After some time, the robot started opening its eyes,

And the robot saw;

“The old lady was standing in front of it; both of them are now dead, but now they are together again”

I get enough messages seeking advice on broken relationships.

To be bluntly honest,

“You crying because she/he left you; is as petty as crying for a pair of shoes, stolen from a temple. You can always get a new one”

Come on !, there is so much love in this world, why do you only have to think about the love between a boy and a girl!

We all crave and demand for a opposite sex love, we never think of actual love.

Don’t we all feel that Love for the Unknown?

Love is just not that happens between a Boy & Girl or a Husband and Wife, Love can be between

You and Your Mother
You and Your Sibling
You and Your Driver
You and Your Pet
You and Your Cook

“You Never Realize it, until it’s gone”

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I am a food inspector at a very reputable country of India. I have to work overnight, i would go to work at 10 PM in the night and return by 8 in the morning. By the time i come home, my shirt gets drenched with sweat, my bones start shaking and the only thing i want to do is sleep.

Now, one time i had to work till 11 AM, I was too tired to even speak. but somehow i reached the bus stop and waited for my bus in the extremely hot sun. I was standing with the help of a pole nearby.

The bus arrived.

I stepped into it.

And luckily there were 3 empty seats.

I just sat down and tried to control my sleep as i don’t want to miss my stop. My stop came 5 stops later. After 2 stops the bus got a little crowded. On the third stop, an old man approached me asking for a seat, he looked at my face and understood that i was not in a condition. a young man seated nearby stood up and gave his seat to the old man. We exchanged smiles.

now on the fourth stop, your typical “DELHI GIRL” enters.

you must have guessed by now what happens next.

Qid5a4x3yzlllabramkhaninshakalam

She asked me to vacate the seat. I gave that same look to that girl which i gave to the old man. but she won’t move. she was not a human, she was a cyborg.

I had to tell her that i did not sleep the last night and i am way too tired to even speak. But she was unmoved. I knew if i kept standing for the nest 90 minutes, i won’t be able to walk up to my home. BUT NO.

I had to give up my seat, everyone in the bus started staring, some nosy aunty said

“O bhaiya, aap itni der se toh baithe hai, usko seat de dijiye na, thak gayi hogi woh”

“O mister, you have the seat from a long time, give her that seat she must be TIRED”

I had no other option, i had to give my seat to that girl.

I kept standing for an hour and a half, I then i walked about a kilometre, to reach my home, and before you know it, i was asleep WITH MY DOOR OPEN FOR STRAIGHT 21 HOURS.

I could not go to work the other day, BOSS screamed like hell.

Even after waking up i was too tired for anything.

MY BOSS AND THAT GIRL TOGETHER TOOK ME THROUGH HELL.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pavx4soy0ecrnzgb', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I am a food inspector at a very reputable country of India.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"So I completed my bachelors back in 2015 from one of the NIT's. I belong to a middle class family and I had a alcoholic father. After clearing AIEEE I thought my life would get better but life had planned something else for me. So after counselling for 2nd round was over I got a seat in NIT Surat(Civil).But my father refused to let me go. He said if you want to study you can study in the NIT which is my hometown otherwise he wont pay the fees. So I ended getting admitted in the NIT which was situated in my hometown.(which was not a bad option).

I started studying there but being a day scholar I had to witness his abuse and bad behaviour towards my mother everyday. Which took a toll on my mental health and for the first time in my life I failed. I tried to study more harder but to no avail.

This continued till second year and I somehow barely passed subjects. My morale was at an all time low and one day I had a panic attack while I was performing practicals in my department and I fainted. The profs called the heath center and an ambulance came to take me. I was brought back to consciousness but something strange happened. I was not able to speak no matter how much I tried. A psychiatrist was called who asked me to relax and after some breathing exercises I was able to speak again. I told the psychiatrist everything . He gave me a questionnaire and asked me to fill it up. After that he counseled me and told me that I have characteristics of pure OCD(obsessive compulsive disorder) and severe depression and I need to be treated. The medicines he gave me stopped my excessive thinking but my cognitive performance reduced even further and I needed more sleep.(the medicine contained sertraline hydrochloride). Because of this I flunked few subjects and my course got extended by one semester.

I could not sit for placements since I had one extra semester. Meanwhile all my batchmates got placed and started the happy phase of their life which I dreamt about. After I finished my degree I applied for jobs at various places but my academic record was so bad that most people never even called me for interviews, and few of them who called me asked me about my bad grades. When I told them the truth they were sympathetic about what I have been through but nobody offered me any job. My dad used to beat me because I was a failure and psychotic. After sometime I totally gave up on my life and I felt like I had no purpose. I had even stopped looking for jobs.

Since I had a lot of free time I started teaching kids in my colony for free. In the beginning parents were reluctant to send their kids because of my fathers behaviour but then a uncle asked me to teach his kids. Soon he could see improvement in his kids and asked others to send their kids too. I started teaching 10 kids and now parents paid me 500 rs per month for teaching them. My mother was very happy and literally cried in happiness when I gave her my salary of 5000 Rs. That was the best moment of my life and I could finally see some hope.

But my father learnt about me taking tuiton classes in his absence and said that you should stop this or I will throw both of you out of my house as I was ruining his reputation in society which was true to some extent. People used to make fun of me that I was a NIT graduate but I was still doing such a petty job. I stopped taking tutions and started studying chemistry which I liked since my JEE days. After 2 months of pouring myself into chemistry I went to a local coaching institute and was offered a job on trial basis. I had never taught so many kids at once so initially I got scared but after a few days I became comfortable.

After teaching 11th standard kids for over 1 year there at a meagre salary of 25k I wanted to leave the coaching. Now here comes the twist , the senior teacher who was supposed to teach 12th standard chemistry had a very monotonous way of teaching and my students didn't like it so they requested the owner to let me take their classes instead. The owner called me and told me the situation and offered to pay me 35k per month. I bargained with him since he was giving the senior teacher over a lakh rupees per month. He finally agreed at 60k per month and told me if my students cleared JEE mains he will give me bonus over and above my base salary. I was on cloud 7 that day.

I worked really hard after that and made my students work harder. And finally it paid off. My students got good ranks in Jee mains and advanced this year and I was paid 7 lakh as bonus recently.

I admitted my dad forcefully into a rehab program a few months ago and he has finally stopped drinking. He is not a bad guy but when he drinks alcohol he can't control himself and starts taking out his frustration over others.

My life is better now. I have everything that I could want from life. But it took patience and efforts. So believe in yourself and remember that “you haven't lost the battle if you can still stand”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5xohugn6jyiwaz9c', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.5308, 'ai': 0.4692}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""So I completed my bachelors back in 2015 from one of the NIT's.

After sometime I totally gave up on my life and I felt like I had no purpose. I had even stopped looking for jobs.\n\nSince I had a lot of free time I started teaching kids in my colony for free. In the beginning parents were reluctant to send their kids because of my fathers behaviour but then a uncle asked me to teach his kids. Soon he could see improvement in his kids and asked others to send their kids too. I started teaching 10 kids and now parents paid me 500 rs per month for teaching them. My mother was very happy and literally cried in happiness when I gave her my salary of 5000 Rs. That was the best moment of my life and I could finally see some hope.\n\nBut my father learnt about me taking tuiton classes in his absence and said that you should stop this or I will throw both of you out of my house as I was ruining his reputation in society which was true to some extent. People used to make fun of me that I was a NIT graduate but I was still doing such a petty job. I stopped taking tutions and started studying chemistry which I liked since my JEE days. After 2 months of pouring myself into chemistry I went to a local coaching institute and was offered a job on trial basis. I had never taught so many kids at once so initially I got scared but after a few days I became comfortable.\n\nAfter teaching 11th standard kids for over 1 year there at a meagre salary of 25k I wanted to leave the coaching. Now here comes the twist , the senior teacher who was supposed to teach 12th standard chemistry had a very monotonous way of teaching and my students didn't like it so they requested the owner to let me take their classes instead. The owner called me and told me the situation and offered to pay me 35k per month. I bargained with him since he was giving the senior teacher over a lakh rupees per month. He finally agreed at 60k per month and told me if my students cleared JEE mains he will give me bonus over and above my base salary. I was on cloud 7 that day.\n\nI worked really hard after that and made my students work harder. And finally it paid off. My students got good ranks in Jee mains and advanced this year and I was paid 7 lakh as bonus recently.\n\nI admitted my dad forcefully into a rehab program a few months ago and he has finally stopped drinking. He is not a bad guy but when he drinks alcohol he can't control himself and starts taking out his frustration over others.\n\nMy life is better now. I have everything that I could want from life. But it took patience and efforts. So believe in yourself and remember that “you haven't lost the battle if you can still stand”"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.5308
Avanish Yadav,Sep 15,What is something deep you want to write here?,"I have an unbreaking bond with sexual assault in my life an I'm living these scars for years.

But this is not what I want anyone to know. I have something else to share.

Few days ago,

I got a text from a girl on Quora asking if she can share something with me. I nodded yes but then she didn't say anything.

Two days later, she shared an incident of rape that happened to her friend and asked me to help her friend as she is lost in her life.

Giving some raw peices of advice do not work without knowing a person better. So, I told the girl to ask her friend to talk to me.

She hesitantly confessed, that girl was not her friend but only her. She was scared of being judged.

She, a teenager girl, came from an orthodox family. For competitive exam preparation, she went to an another city and the rape incident happened there.

There was only one friend of her in that city and she shared this incident to her but she took it lightly and said, it happens. Her friend statement screwd up her more. Atlast, she left the city for home, unable to cope mental traumas.

Her family doesn't know the actual reason, why she came back to home. If she tells them the actual reason, they will discontinue her studies and her education career will be ruined.

Now,

Coming back to question.

What is something deep I want to write here?

In above aforementioned story, the girl has no one in her life with whom she can feel comfortable. That incident is not much messing her but the people around her. She has lost trust in her parents and friends both.

I'm here emphasizing that people are around us but they are not with us.

Parents have created a phobia in their kids. They have set up number of boundaries as per respective societies which their kids shouldn't break.

These boundary are what actually breaking the relation between parents and a kid. It is becoming a burden and which is suffocating to live.

Our parents are first persons for whom kids want to look for any kind of help. But their orthodox and narrow nature scare kids to open themselves.

They are unable to share themselves with them. Infact, how would they, when they see you pathetic treating behaviour with others?

It shuts their expectations. They find themselves an orphan, even though after having parents.

I get tonnes of messages regarding depression, mental traumas and career. The root cause lies in within parents and friends.

There is lack of trust and understanding between parents and children. Parents’s judging and dominant behaviour are causing children to thrive into loneliness and depression. Friends are already sitting on the edge of cheating and backstabbing.

A kid is lost alone, wrapped in a sheet of insecurities and depression.

Be friendly and trustworthy to your people. This single alone thing can solve too many problems.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I made my husband cry and I feel like I am the worst person on earth for having done so.

My husband is a jolly and fun loving guy. He is my pillar of strength. He has always been supportive of me when I needed him. We have been married for 5 years and I have cried like a hundred times in front of him even for small things but he has always treated me like his own daughter and consoled me.

Like most couples we too engage in deep conversations late at night. One night he revealed his darkest secret to me. He had been sexually abused by an older girl when he was 12 years old. It had continued for months.

I, like the stupid girl I am, couldn't understand the gravity of the situation and started laughing at him. I thought he might have enjoyed it. But I was wrong. He started crying silently. I have never seen him cry before. I was confused and surprised. Then I realized what a grave mistake I had done. I too started crying. He didn't console me. He himself stopped crying and went to bed. That night he didn't talk to me.

Next day he acted like nothing had happened. He was again the happy guy like he was. It has been few days since then. He never mentioned it again and I am afraid to ask about it. I feel I let him down when he needed me the most.

Sometimes the happiest people hold the darkest secrets inside them. Boys and men also get raped. And they certainly don't enjoy it. The mental trauma is same as that of a girl. I feel there is much less awareness about crimes against men than women.

Dhawal Barot,Updated 4y,Can you write a short story on silence?,"“Raj, where are you going?” Raj’s father asked.

“Office dad,” Raj answered.

“I heard in the news that the weather is not going to be good. Can’t you take a day off?” His father requested.

“I can’t, dad. I already took many leaves this month. Plus, the weather looks good to me.” Raj gazed out of the window and explained.

“Okay, at least, grab the raincoat son.” Raj’s father added.

“You’re impossible dad,” Raj said those words, but he took the raincoat with him.

He drove his bike for a few minutes and the rain started.

Raj was having the raincoat which helped him to reach his office safely without getting drenched.

He reached to his desk and texted, “Impossible dad, thanks. :p”

Years passed. Life played its games.

Raj woke up and opened the window. He found the weather was good. Thus, he got ready quickly.

He came out from his home, sat on his bike, put the helmet on his head and ignited the bike’s engine.

In ten minutes, out of blue, rain started.

He couldn’t stop the bike as he was running late for the office.

When he reached his office building, he was fully drenched.

He entered his office and sat on his desk. The AC was making him feel cold. Thus, he turned it off. He put out his wallet, hankie, and mobile on the desk.

While taking out the wallet, the wallet opened and he found his father’s photo inside the wallet.

He took the wallet in his hand, looked at his father’s photo for five seconds and smiled. He didn’t utter any word.

The silence of those five seconds had a story.

Rahul Sinha,8y,What are some short stories where you don't know whether to laugh or cry?,"Our 14 year old dog, Abbey, died last month. The day after she died, my 4 year old daughter Meredith was crying and talking about how much she missed Abbey.


She asked if we could write a letter to God so that when Abbey got to heaven, God would recognize her. I told her that I thought we could, so she dictated these words:

""Dear God,

Will you please take care of my dog? She died yesterday and is with you in heaven. I miss her very much. I am happy that you let me have her as my dog even though she got sick.

I hope you will play with her. She likes to play with balls and to swim. I am sending a picture of her so when you see her, You will know that she is my dog. I really miss her.

Love, Meredith.""



We put the letter in an envelope with a picture of Abbey and Meredith, and addressed it to God/Heaven. We put our return address on it.
Then Meredith pasted several stamps on the front of the envelope because she said it would take lots of stamps to get the letter all the way to heaven. That afternoon she dropped it into the letter box at the post office.
A few days later, she asked if God had gotten the letter yet. I told her that I thought He had.
Yesterday, there was a package wrapped in gold paper on our front porch addressed, ""To Meredith"" in an unfamiliar hand writing. Meredith opened it.
Inside was a book by Mr. Rogers called, ""When a Pet Dies"". Taped to the inside front cover was the letter we had written to God in its opened envelope.
On the opposite page was the picture of Abbey & Meredith and this note:

""Dear Meredith,

Abbey arrived safely in heaven.

Having the picture was a big help. I recognized Abbey right away. Abbey isn't sick anymore. Her spirit is here with me just like it stays in your heart.
Abbey loved being your dog.

Since we don't need our bodies in heaven, I don't have any pockets to keep your picture in, so I am sending it back to you in this little book for you to keep and have something to remember Abbey by.

Thank you for the beautiful letter and thank your mother for helping you write it and sending it to me. What a wonderful mother you have. I picked her especially for you.

I send my blessings every day and remember that I love you very much.
By the way, I'm easy to find, I am wherever there is love.

Michelle - MAD PIRATE QUEEN,3y,"Does Michelle Steele use pen(cil) and paper or a whiteboard for her drawings? How much paper does she go through, or how many photos of whiteboards does she have? Enough for a book?","Michelle Steele has a confession to make.

Michelle Steele … doesn’t even own crayons.

Michelle … You know what? This third-person thing is hard → “I don’t own crayons.” (no, I didn’t eat them because — disappointingly — crayons have no flavour). I have no pencils, no art paper or canvas or easels or paints or talent, and my only whiteboard is digital. I create my ‘art’ (heh - there’s some sarcasm right there!) on Microsoft Whiteboard with a digital stylus.

I do it that way because I’m lazy.

If I was forced to draw it, then scan it or photograph it and upload it and blah blah blah, Stick Figgaz would never have happened. I don’t go through any paper (#savetheplanet) and I have no photos of whiteboards… except the one I loaded above… and the one in the image below. Wait, that means I have two photos of whiteboards.

Images source: Twas all me. #badartinception

Do I have enough for a book? Yeah, I guess, but not a very good book. It wouldn’t make any sense. My images are all over the place given the different topics for questions I answer and Stick Figure Michelle has also transformed since I first started. A reminder — this was the very first Stick Figgaz Michelle:

Ugh, I hate looking back at bad haircuts. And what was I thinking, wearing that?!

So… one or two minor changes there.

I might do something in the future with them but at this stage, it is just a fun thing to do! I save them all here, though: Stickfiggaz -Crayons R'US

Darragh Groeger,5y,Which was J.R.R. Tolkien's single best line of writing?,"You asked for a single line, and I will quote a passage but only to put a single line into its proper context.

The line itself is the very last line in the following passage, and to this day I cannot read it without the hairs on the back of my neck standing up.

It ends the chapter, and comes as both as stirring war cry, and a collective sigh of relief.

Succinct, simple, beautiful:

In rode the Lord of the Nazgûl. A great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of the Nazgûl, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.

All save one.

There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dínen.

""You cannot enter here,"" said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. ""Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your Master. Go!""

The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.

""Old fool!"" he said. ""Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!"" And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.

And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of war nor of wizardry, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.

And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns, in dark Mindolluin's sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the north wildly blowing.

Rohan had come at last.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/54o3hzt9arj12sfp', 'title': ""Which was J.R.R.

Dhawal Barot,6y,What is a story within 500 words on the theme of 'ignorance and waiting in love'?,"“Sorry, I don’t think things will work anymore between us. I can’t oppose my family.” The girl whatsapped.

The boy read it and replied, “Can we meet for the last time?”

“No.” The girl replied without giving it a second thought.

“Please?” The boy requested.

“Alright. It’s the last time. See you at the Brew cafe at 7 p.m.” Girl typed and pressed send.

The boy knew that brew cafe was the place where they had their first date. But, he avoided further thoughts and just answered, “Okay. I will be there.”

The boy reached the place at 6.30 p.m. He didn’t order anything, but walked near the waiter and gave him 500 INR to not disturb him on the table for that evening.

He chose the last table in the corner in silence and had a seat there. So many things were running through his mind. Time was running very slowly for him. Every tick-tack of his watch was killing him. Nervousness was besetting him slowly-slowly.

The clock showed that it was 7 p.m. He quickly looked at the entrance. He stood up and looked outside the door. The face he was looking for wasn’t visible so far. He got worried. He dialed a number but cut the call before it connected. He thought to wait.

The clock was running. He started hating time. The clock showed 7:30, 8, and 8:30 p.m. Loveless time was doing its duty very well. The time was passing. He felt himself like a silence in the city of voices.

He looked at his watch, which showed him that it was 9:00 p.m. He touched the nib of the watch and adjusted time back to 7:00 p.m. He pressed the nib inside. Then, he looked at that entrance, but the face which he was looking for was still not visible. And a tear came out of his eye.

Finally, he made a call to the last number he dialed. But, the number was unreachable. He understood the rest. A tear dropped on the clock. He took out the clock which was a gift from her, dropped it on the table. Somewhere inside his heart, all he knew that he just wanted to see her the last time, for the rest of his life. In the end, with many tears inside him, he walked away from the cafe.

Jesse Sinclair,Updated 1y,What are the biggest opportunities storyline-wise that writers missed on the assorted Star Trek shows?,"THE BORG

Nothing in the entirety of Star Trek is a bigger (or more frustrating) missed opportunity than the Borg. By the end of Best of Both Worlds part 2 the Borg are set up as a truly perfect villian for the Star Trek universe.

Let’s break down what makes the Borg, at that point, so compelling.

THEY ARE COMPLETELY AMORAL

I used amoral instead of immoral for a reason. The Borg at this point were not malicious. They weren’t cruel. They are completely dedicated to their own unfathomable goals, and that is all. They will kill of course, without hesitation, if you get in their way, or if you become a threat, or if they want something you have, but otherwise they ignore you. In Best of Both Worlds part 1 the Borg are laser fixated on Picard, but once they get him they just leave the Enterprise alone. They could have destroyed it without any effort, but they don’t. They have what they want and so they just leave.

Star Trek has a long pantheon of malevolent enemies. We’ve seen the calculated cruelty of the Romulans, and the fierce brutality of the Klingons. We’ve had the Tholians, the Gorn, even the Ferengi as adversaries. What unites them all is that their motivations were familiar to us. They wanted power, or territory, or wealth. They had moral codes that might be different from we the viewers, but were still completely recognizable to us.

The Borg were the first unfathomable threat. The first truly alien concept. The scenes in Q Who where the crew beams over to the Borg Cube are enthralling. The Borg drones just don’t care. They completely ignore our heroes. Not dismissively, either. It’s not a pretense, or haughtiness, they just… it’s like they don’t even see them.

It’s so alien and strange. It sets the Borg apart conceptually, makes them unique.

THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY POWEFUL

The Borg are a uniquely powerful force in the Star Trek universe. Not only are their ships incredibly powerful, but even if you do manage to hurt them they’ll both adapt and regenerate. In Q Who the Enterprise has to escape them. It can’t defeat them. If Q hadn’t pulled them out of there, they would have been destroyed. And that’s just one single Cube. Guinan tells us that when they came for the El-Aurians the did so with a fleet of Cubes that, in her words, swarmed over their system.

Later, in Best of Both Worlds, the tragic battle of Wolf 359 happens. We wont actually get to see the battle on screen until Emissary part 1 of Deep Space Nine, but the iconic image of the Enterprise arriving late to the carnage, drifting through a field of broken, destroyed, starships is haunting. The Borg Cube makes it all the way to Earth, the heart of the Federation, and is only stopped by some extremely out of the box thinking on the part of the TNG crew.

AND THEN THE DOWNFALL BEGINS…

And sadly, the Borg go brutally downhill after that. Every successive interaction with them makes them less interesting, less unfathomable. The writers don’t seem to be able to follow up the themes they’ve established, and so they keep making the Borg more and more normal to compensate. First Contact introduces the Borg Queen, putting a face and emotions to them. Even worse is Voyager, which turns the Borg into a generic conquering force. Simply Klingons with less fashion sense. Then, feeling the need to up the ante, they introduce Species 8472, and manage to essentially Worf an entire concept. The Borg become a punching bag, and never recover.

WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN…

Ever since Voyager had been announced I couldn’t wait for them to encouter the Borg. There was no way the USS Voyager could defeat or escape the Borg, and so I thought surely the Borg would return to their original roots and themes.

I came up with an elaborate head-cannon for where I thought that Voyager would go. I was sure I had cracked it and knew where they were going…

THE BORG DON’T WANT TO DESTROY THE FEDERATION

This seemed the most obvious to me. After all, one of the first things we learn about the Borg is that they ignore things they don’t think of as threats (or opportunities). The second thing we learn is that if they want to destroy you, they bring (puts on my best Archon voice) power overwhelming!

So why did they only send one Cube in The Best of Both Worlds, instead of hundred, or thousands? Because they weren’t trying to destroy the Federation. They were trying to cultivate it.

Before we have even met the Borg (on screen) the first thing we know about that they’ve done is they’ve carefully destroyed outposts on both sides of the Neutral Zone. Why would they do that? Those outposts had no value to them. It’s a needless provocation. Unless, of course, they were trying to start a war between the United Federation of Planets and the Romulan Star Empire. I mean, think about it. What other reason would you do that?

But why do it, you might ask. If the Borg are so overwhelmingly powerful why would they start a war instead of just conquering both sides?

BECAUSE IT’S NOT ABOUT CONQUEST!

It’s about farming. The Borg seek out new things:

“We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us.”

For all of it’s destruction and bloodshed, almost nothing breeds innovation and new technologies faster than war. The Borg don’t care about who wins or who loses or how many people die. They just want to see what new things the Federation and the Romulans come up with.

But it doesn’t work. The two powers don’t go to war. Even stranger, a Federation starship just suddenly appears in system J-25, hundreds of lightyears from where it should be. So the Borg poke and prod at it, trying to figure out how it got there. They decide to assimilate it. And they can’t! At the last moment the nigh-omnipotent Q whisks the Enterprise away and back to safety.

Now, you have to imagine from the Borg’s perspective this is weird. What is so special about this ship that the Q, who normally ignore the Borg, saved it? And suddenly The Best of Both Worlds makes perfect sense. It was never about destroying the Federation. It was about understanding Q, and he relationship to Picard. They deliberately target Picard to see if Q will intervene again.

He doesn’t. Picard is now Locutus. Ok, so maybe it’s not the captain that’s special, maybe it’s humans in general? Let’s threaten Earth itself. See if Q intervenes this time. Even First Contact makes more sense this way. They still only send one Cube when they could have sent more. Hell, even two would have been enough. So why the weird time travel into the past? Again, its to see what Q will do. And he does nothing.

At this point it’s a reasonable assumption for the Borg that Q doesn’t have a vested interest in protecting Picard or humanity. Whatever reason he had for saving that ship one time, that reason is gone. It’s just another example of the already inscrutible Q just being inscrutible as normal.

AND NOW WE ARE PERFECTLY SET UP FOR VOYAGER

I need to preferace this with something I’ve already said but is vitally important to remember: USS Voyager is not a threat to the Borg. Not even a little bit. And if the Borg don’t have any interest in destroying the Federation, then the only danger to Voyager would be if she has some new technology the Borg want. Which seems doubtful. Cyborgs probably have much better bio-neural gel packs.

So I imagined this:

“Captain’s log. The moment I have feared since we were stranded in the Delta Quadrant has arrived. Long range sensor probes have detected the Borg.”

Sensor probes from Voyager have been ranging far ahead of the ship for months now, and they have picked up traces of Borg signals, and even sighted several Cubes going about their unfathomable and terrifying business. However, baffingly, they also have detected normal subspace chatter from non-Borg transmissions. Even inhabited planets. Inhabited by non-Borg.

Confused and needing answers, Janeway decides they’ll use a dense nebula to slip closer. It borders one of the inhabited systems, and hopefully they can make sense of this with close range scans. If it’s safe, they can even contact the inhabitants of the system. Ask them how they live around the Borg.

As Voyager approaches the nebula, a leviathin emerges from the depths. A Borg Cube. Voyager tries to take immediate evasive action, but the Borg lock onto them with a tractor beam.

“United Federation of Planets starship USS Voyager. Our scans indicate you do not posses transwarp technology. Your ship cannot be at this location, yet it is. We will assimilate you. We will understand.”

Borg drones transport onto Voyager. The first few drones are taken down by handheld phasers, and Voyager opens fire on the Cube. Her first volley of phaser fire and torpedos breaks the tractor beam. Turning quickly, Voyager attempts to hit warp. She can’t. Borg weapons fire tears through the left pylon, cleanly severing the nacelle. Secondary explosions rock the ship. A second shot takes out main power.

Janeway has only one option left: words.

“We have no new technology! We were brought to the Delta Quadrant against our will by a being called the Caretaker! We are ju-”

The Borg interupt her.

“Caretaker. Entity 364. This entity is known to us. It’s technology is known to us.”

The Cube leaves, returning to it’s original heading out of the neubla. Having gained it’s answers it cares nothing more about them. Voyager has survived, abeit battered and damaged worse than they’ve been since they first arrived.

And so begins a season long story as Voyager makes it’s way through Borg space, and the strange inhabitants who live out their lives in the shadows of giants. Civilizations afraid to advance, to develop, to become interesting to the Borg. They would rather eke out a living as they are, rather than dream of what they could be!

Think of the stories the writers could have told!

Black market salvagers of Borg parts. Brave souls who rush to crashed or abandoned Borg ships and sites hoping to find something.
A planet suffering from a terrible plague. A plague the Doctor could cure, but they are too afraid to take it. What if curing the plague is what brings the attention of the Borg down on them?
A civilization that has been secretly developing an anti-Borg superweapon and Voyager has the last part/technology they need. If it works they could finally repel the Borg! But if it doesn’t… If it doesn’t the Borg might retaliate and destroy their civilization completely. After much moral debate Voyager agrees to supply it. The weapon works! It destroys one Cube, tearing it apart in a violent chain reaction. The second Cube is damaged, but adapts. The third is completely unphased. Voyager must flee, and must watch as the Borg destroy this civilization utterly.
A destroyed planet rumoured to still contain the shreds of incredible technology from a long lost civilization that once warred with Borg.
Voyager discovers the El-Aurian homeworld, or whats left of it at least. Perfect time for a guest cameo from Guinan!
A planet of rejected drones, abandoned by the Collective, and the race of caregivers who try and rehabilitate them.
And so much more…

Borg space could have been a rich and fertile ground for so many interesting stories. It could have posed the kind of moral and ethical conundrums Star Trek is famous for. And it would have preserved what made the Borg so interesting.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fuyxsr3jn517klgc', 'title': 'What are the biggest opportunities storyline-wise that writers missed on the assorted Star Trek shows?', 'score': {'original': 0.965225, 'ai': 0.034775}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'THE BORG\n\nNothing in the entirety of Star Trek is a bigger (or more frustrating) missed opportunity than the Borg.

Vans Grimiere,Updated 5y,"Is it possible for an entire book to be written so that at the very last phrase, the meaning of the rest of the novel changes entirely?","Would you mind if it did by the “last chapter” rather than the “last sentence”? Here it is:

“Si” by Bob Ong

It’s published last 2014. A short read with only 185 pages and large font size. Sadly, this book is only available in our language (Filipino). (There's no official nor fan translation available anywhere, my bros and sis). What made this book interesting is that the story is in reverse order.

The book starts with chapter “72” and ends with chapter “0”. Each chapter tells the most significant event in EVERY YEAR of the MC’s life, from when he’s 72 years old up to when he’s still inside his mom’s womb (0 yrs old). And you’re supposed to read it that way.

[Spoiler-Alert]
So what’s special about the ending?

The book is all about a man’s life. I mean, everything. It is a story about love, family, friendship, life during WW 2 and every other things that everyone may have once or wished to experience. The story developed with a magical feels to it because of the reverse order that would make you feel nostalgic in every chapter.

It’s as if you’re looking through the eyes of an old man recalling his past before he leaves this world peacefully.

But once you reach chapter “0” where he’s still not born, you’ll realize how wrong you were. Here’s an excerpt from that chapter:

“Ngunit tulad ng dati ay binulungan ako ni Ina. At sa dulo ng bawat luha ay muling nakiusap na patawarin ko siya. Nagsumamo ako. Sa huling pagkakataon . At ipinagmakaawa ang karapatan ng aking buhay”

Translation: “But just like before, my Mom whispered to me. And in every drop of tears, she’d ask me to forgive her. I plead. For the last time. I begged for my right to live.”

And the last few sentences of the book described how he slowly lost his senses. From how it’s getting quieter, how it’s getting colder, how it’s getting darker.

It squeezed my heart to pulp as it only implies that: He was aborted.

The book was NEVER about how a man struggled and lived his life BUT about a life that someone would have had if he was given the chance to live.

It also made me facepalm ‘cause I never saw that coming despite all the clues like:

Snow. Philippines is a tropical country meaning there’s no snow here. The snowflakes on the book cover and the scenes were there’s snow symbolizes imagination in our context.

The Title. Which is “Si”. Si is a Filipino article (like a, an, the) that ALWAYS comes before a name. (Ex. Si Vans, Si Elon) So why only “Si ____”? Because the MC never had a name. Why no name? Because it was our parents who give us a name when we are born. He never had a name because he was never born.

MC’s name was never mentioned. Because he didn’t have one. Also, lack of name symbolizes his lack of identity or place in the real world.

The Overview. It’s comprised of a dialogue that goes like…

MC: “When will I meet you?”

Victoria (love interest): “Once you’re born”

-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

We all knew how annoying was the trope “It never happened” but this book’s message saved it from that.

It’s true that our life depends on the choices we’ll make. That our destiny is in our own hands. But none of that would have mattered if our parents never let us live in the first place.

Ayush Atreya,7mo,Can you write something dark and deep?,"Once I was watching an interview of shahrukh khan.

The interviewer asked him something about his struggles or how he reached where he is right now.

His reply struck to me so hard that I remember his exact wording till date.

If I say you that whatever I achieved, is because of my hardwork. I am either making a fool of you or of myself. Definitely, I worked hard.

But Much much more than my hardwork, these three thing played a major role. Being at the right place, with right people and at the right time.

Perhaps many won't agree with him. But we all know that there are thousands of people who are much more talented, smart. They are still roaming in mumbai with portfolio in thier hand or doing small work in serials.

So the question is, what exactly decides one's success?

Many successful people will say that they succeed just on their hardwork and persistence and whatnot. Deep down we all know there is something that is not in our control.

Perhaps that's what people call LUCK.

Anonymous,Updated 5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"You know, that kind of girl who isn't the most pretty one or the sexiest but is still sooo damn attractive that you don't want to look away?

The first time I saw her at orientation class, she looked like she came to class straight from bed. She had sneaked into the hall but then caught the eyes of professor, she was called on stage. She flirted in the most subtle way you would imagine, everyone in the hall was enjoying their que-ans round? Her interrogation? Needless to say, she became popular.

I knew she was someone I wanted to get to know, but so did, rest of the college. Her reputation builded up as one of the ‘hard to get chicks'. She was, still is so private about her life, even though she has accounts everywhere you wouldn't figure out what she does, where she goes, who she hangs out with, nothing!

Someone, one of the guys, got so damn curious that he hacked into her account. Half of the hostel was there, but nothing except some quickly ended conversations. (He later did apologise.)

College was about to end, exams, things were getting stressful, I had given up the thoughts of going out with her and even friendship. She kept everyone at arm's length. She didn't even mix up with girls. She was friendly yet cold, rude yet sweet, I don't know how to explain how she was exactly while we were strangers, but if there was some grey area where you could place someone's personality, she would fall in the greyest place. Okay, yeah, exams were coming and I was staying in library all the time. She happened to seat next to me and started talking, I couldn't figure out whether she was talking to herself or me but I wanted to say something. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to say something funny to the context or something intelligent, what I blurted out instead was ‘ummm'. Inside my head, I was like dude, you're so cool, I don't know why.

She was like, am I disturbing you? ‘No, how about we grab some coffee and talk? We can talk freely.’ She said yes right away. I was like, ‘hard to go out with'? What? (She did go out with 2 guys, things didn't turn serious)

We were talking about this and that when she blurred out, hey, I'm hungry, lets go … place, my treat. I was like, yaaaaaaaay! Why would I say no?

Before I could even realize it, we were hanging out daily. We became friends, but still I knew almost nothing about her. I was expecting something mysterious but she was just a normal person, with normal background, nothing out of place, except HER.

She always seemed out of place.

I wanted to know if I was something else other than a friend to her but I was scared if she'll grow distant afterwards. There were rumors everywhere. She was teased with my name everywhere, she would turn deaf to them. I too did the same.

It had already been 1 year of us being the way we were and 5 years of crush from my side. I did go out with other girls in my college days, had some flings, but she never left my mind.

I wanted more but I was getting more hopeless. I did build up some courage and asked her to hangout at my place. (by that time,we were comfortable enough to show up at the others place unannounced.) She came in as usual, I thought I would confess , let her know how much she means to me, before I could even utter a single word, she kissed me gently and told me, (something along these lines)

‘I love you too. I know you've liked me for a long time. I think for me it was when you had that fever and you looked at me with those puppy eyes, or the time you were praying for me, I'm hopelessly in love with you, my impossible fucktard, I love you too.’

I had never realized it until then, that she can tell what's going on in my mind.

I was about to cry then she kissed me again. Rest of the evening is blur. It felt like a dream. I might have asked her to pinch me,maybe a little more than 100 times that evening.

I love her. And, she loves me too. My life is like a fairytale right now. Even when things are not working out, I tell myself, dude, she loves you too, everything feels perfect then.

P.S. We might be, might be, getting married by the end of this year. :)

Sean Kernan,Updated 5y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel happy?,"“Gorgeous.”

“This guy is so smart.”

“I wish I dressed as well as her.”

“She has the prettiest eyes.”

“He’s really cute, I’d shag him.”

“Please don’t be married….”

“I hope I can be as good of a person as she is, someday.”

Your entire life.

Matthew Bates,Updated 1y,When should you use a semi-colon in writing?,"Best. Question. Ever!

My English teacher senses are tingling!

A semi-colon should have a complete sentence on each side of it. Those complete sentences should be closely related.

Look at these two sentences, for example:

I bought a car. It’s a chick magnet.

Since those sentences are closely related, you could join them with a semi-colon:

I bought a car; it’s a chick magnet.

Anywhere that you have a semi-colon, you should be able to replace it with a comma and a conjunction:

I bought a car, and it’s a chick magnet.

That’s the main reason people use semi-colons.

The other reason is for “things in a series.” Susha Thaj’s answer explains that well.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/jhbkx046qcyf5a1d', 'title': 'When should you use a semi-colon in writing?', 'score': {'original': 0.9952, 'ai': 0.0048}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Best.

Alex Johnston,Updated 11mo,Does it make me homophobic to write a failing gay relationship in my novel?,"No.

What would be homophobic would be if you wrote it like this:

‘Gary, I… I think we should break up.’

‘But, Lance!’ Gary sat up, his eyes wide with alarm. ‘Why? I thought we were so happy!’

‘I did too, Gary,’ Lance said, sitting on the edge of the sofa where Gary sat, and looking sorrowfully at the floor. ‘I really did. But I’ve come to believe that… in the long run, we can’t ever be happy.’

‘Why not?’ Gary said, his face pale.

‘Because we’re gay, Gary,’ Lance said, raising his eyes to Gary’s and speaking in a soft, level voice. ‘We’re gay. And we both know that, well… that that’s just plain wrong. We might kid ourselves that we’re happy, but we’ll always know, deep down, that it’s just wrong to be gay. After all, it says so in the Bible.’

‘M-my God, Lance,’ Gary said, wonderingly. ‘You’re right. For all that we love each other and apparently make each other happy, our basic wrongness will always be there, won’t it.’

‘It sure will,’ Lance said.

Gary slumped back in his chair.

‘Aw, hell,’ he said. ‘Why did I have to be one of the gays? Why did God make us like this? Why couldn’t I have been straight, and married Debbie?’

‘God didn’t make you like that, Gary,’ Lance gently pointed out. ‘You decided to be one of the gays, when we had hot butt sex that night in your garage.’

‘Oh yeah,’ Gary said. ‘I did, didn’t I.’

‘Never mind,’ Lance said. ‘We’ve made our mistakes, and I’m sure that if we work hard we can become straight again, like God meant us to be. I’ve already bought a hat.’

Lance pulled a cap out of his pocket: a dark green feed cap. He put it on his head. It said on the front in large silver letters, GAY IS WRONG.

‘Wow,’ Gary said. ‘Cool hat.’

‘Thanks, man,’ Lance said. ‘I think if you get one too, and we wear them regularly, we’ll be okay.’

‘I sure hope so, buddy,’ Gary said, and he instinctively reached out to clutch Lance’s hand for support.

‘Uh, no touchsies, Gar,’ Lance said, standing up and backing sharply away from the sofa.

‘Sorry.’

Just don’t write it like that, in any way.

Ashley Nicole,5y,Do you have a right to read your teen’s personal diary?,"No.

When I was younger I kept two fake journals to keep my mom from reading my real one. Finally she figured this out so I bought a lock for it. Once my mom found the key she read my journal and our relationship was never the same. Keep in mind that I wrote down all of my thoughts and feelings in this journal. I wrote about the good, the bad, and the ugly. Apparently all that stuck out to my mom was the ugly. My brother was home visiting us over summer break from MIT.

After reading his PRIVATE journal she forced us both into therapy. (He was 20 and I was 12 at the time) Once we get to therapy the therapist expects us to be these deeply troubled kids from what my mom had been saying about us. After our first therapy session the therapist was totally perplexed. She tells us our mom read our journals and was worried, but that she didn’t see what was wrong. After telling both me and my brother this she spoke to my mom. That night at dinner she was furious. She said we were only sabotaging ourselves and she was done trying to help us.

Hector Quintanilla,5y,Can you write something that will fundamentally change how I see the world?,"Last week I visited Chichen-Itzá, named a UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2007 voted as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.

This archeological treasure is found in the state of Yucatan, Mexico, very near the famous tourist area of Cancun. It’s estimated that over 2.6 million people visited the Chichen-Itzá in 2017… it’s a very busy place!

I found people from all over the world, many from Europe and USA, all of them with plenty of money to buy anything. Everything in Mexico feels cheap for them because of the purchase power of their currency.

Now, to answer your question, “Can you write something that will fundamentally change how I see the world?”

Yes, I will change how you see selling.

I’m still impacted by what I saw. Thousands of tents located all around the area trying to sell to tourists.

As I walked along the dirt road, all I could hear was the salesperson saying, “One dollar! Take one! Everything for one dollar!”

Several times I heard people saying, “One dollar, almost free!” Yet, very few people purchased stuff.

There were several amazing pieces of art like this man making objects carved in wood and painted with local flower tint.

But, these were more expensive, around $50 to $100 dollars, and the vendors struggled to sell their goods.

Why?

We used to live in a world of scarcity. We were easily attracted by material things, but now we live in a world of abundance and we have changed as consumers.

Where’s the value in those things that these local people were selling?

It’s not the object. It’s not the usability of the object. It’s not luxury. They’re selling a souvenir, a token of remembrance of the place.

It’s hard to sell stuff. These people struggle daily to make a living. Poverty is widespread in the area even though these people live in a place that attracts millions of tourists a year… all of them with money!

What is it that the people who visit Chichen-Itzá search for? What are they willing to pay top dollar for?

Not things! As consumers we don’t buy things anymore, we buy an experience or a solution.

We don’t buy shoes. Most of us take shoes for granted. We buy comfort or fashion.

We don’t buy food, we buy nutrition or pay top dollar for an experience with food.

Tourists pay for adventure, to explore the world, to experience the place. People like Efrain, our private guide, make top dollar, but he sells information, knowledge, stories and insights.

Can you sense how we have changed as consumers?

It’s NOT your real estate location nor the quality of your product. It’s NOT your degree, not your grades. Nobody cares!

All we care about as consumers is the value we receive from whatever you are offering.

Sellers don’t have the power anymore, consumers do, and if we want to make a good living in this world, we must understand what our buyers are really searching for.

Not answering this question will lead to financial struggles in this New Economy of abundance.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r2w4ag9c6qot8ify', 'title': 'Can you write something that will fundamentally change how I see the world?', 'score': {'original': 0.489, 'ai': 0.511}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Last week I visited Chichen-Itzá, named a UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2007 voted as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nThis archeological treasure is found in the state of Yucatan, Mexico, very near the famous tourist area of Cancun.

It’s not the usability of the object. It’s not luxury. They’re selling a souvenir, a token of remembrance of the place.\n\nIt’s hard to sell stuff. These people struggle daily to make a living. Poverty is widespread in the area even though these people live in a place that attracts millions of tourists a year… all of them with money!\n\nWhat is it that the people who visit Chichen-Itzá search for? What are they willing to pay top dollar for?\n\nNot things! As consumers we don’t buy things anymore, we buy an experience or a solution.\n\nWe don’t buy shoes. Most of us take shoes for granted. We buy comfort or fashion.\n\nWe don’t buy food, we buy nutrition or pay top dollar for an experience with food.\n\nTourists pay for adventure, to explore the world, to experience the place. People like Efrain, our private guide, make top dollar, but he sells information, knowledge, stories and insights.\n\nCan you sense how we have changed as consumers?\n\nIt’s NOT your real estate location nor the quality of your product. It’s NOT your degree, not your grades. Nobody cares!\n\nAll we care about as consumers is the value we receive from whatever you are offering.\n\nSellers don’t have the power anymore, consumers do, and if we want to make a good living in this world, we must understand what our buyers are really searching for.\n\nNot answering this question will lead to financial struggles in this New Economy of abundance.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.489

Murphy Barrett,4y,Where does Robert Heinlein belong in the pantheon of science fiction writers?,"God sits at the right hand of Robert Anson Heinlein, and Spider Robinson is his prophet.

Heinlein did something that was rather new in sci-fi at the time. He wrote “contemporary” science fiction. That is, apart from the notable example of Starship Troopers, Heinlein for the most part did not bother to explain how everything worked. He assumed his readers were smart enough to either figure it out, or realize that the how didn’t matter so much as the what.

In Beyond this Horizon, Heinlein wrote “the door dilated” without ever explaining just what that meant. It didn’t matter. The door was closed, now it’s open, and clearly it opens by a different mechanism that we are accustomed to, but that doesn’t matter so much because the status of the door is more important than how it works.

This is because Heinlein was more interested in how new technologies or gadgets affected people, rather than how the gee-wiz gizmos worked themselves. Certainly he didn’t ignore technical details, he was an engineer. But he didn’t wag on about them for their sake alone. It always came back to how it affected the characters and plot. For example, in Starship Troopers he didn’t explain how radar, radio, or infrared snoopers worked, or even exactly how the “musculature” of the Maurauder suits worked, but he did describe the command and control systems of the Marauder suits. But even then, while he was clearly excited about how such a machine was controlled, the reason to explain the functioning was so that you could appreciate how easy it made for the person to operate the suit and maintain battlefield awareness. It wasn’t techno-detail for its sake alone.

Most other sci-fi of the era focused on various technological developments, and the characters served to showcase the doo-dad. As much as I love Asimov’s robot stories, the humans exist mostly to explain and show off his robots. In his Foundation series, people exist mainly to showcase Hari Seldon’s psychohistory. And they’re genuinely fascinating ideas!

But Heinlein focused on how those ideas affected people.

Furthermore, his “juveniles” were not like kids stories of the era either. They featured juvenile protagonists, sure, but they dealt with adult problems. Heinlein treated children like adults-in-training, and didn’t talk down to them in his works intended for them. The only real difference I can find between his adult works and his juveniles is the protagonists age and no sex.

Of course, it should be fairly obvious at this point that Heinlein is my favorite author.

Peon informed Raj and arranged a meeting. Raj went to meet vice-chancellor.

Vice-chancellor asked him angrily, ""What do you guys want?""

Raj informed, ""Our private university is reservation free for years. We won't allow caste based reservation in our university. That's our one and only demand sir. Nothing else.""

Vice-chancellor informed, ""It's decision from our new trustee Mr. Anand. We can't pull it back. Name your exam percentages and price. Quit all these leadership. Think for your self Ram, sorry, what's your name?""

Raj replied, ""It's Raj, not Ram.""

The peon interfered and reminded vice chancellor that Raj's the one who topped the university last year.

Vice-chancellor asked, ""In that case, why you're destroying your career and study? I can fail you for next term. Do you know that?""

Raj moved the curtain from the window, showed the crowd of students to vice-chancellor and replied, ""As you can see, young India don't want caste based reservation. This crowd is more than my career. Who cares about the next result on the base of injustice?""

Meanwhile, Mr. Anand entered into the VC's cabin. He found Raj and VC in the cabin. Peon offered him a seat and said, ""Sir, this guy is a leader of the student union.""

Mr. Anand smirked and asked, ""Will you fight with your community too? After all, you're also reserved, right Raj?""

Raj smiled and replied, ""Let's remove my last name for a moment. Now, I can walk. I can talk. I can work. I'm good with economical level on my own. Am I still reserved?"", he added, ""By the way, that's the difference between you and me. You're a big businessman and I'm a leader, dad.""

Sean Kernan,Updated 5y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"Your name is Robert.

You’ve been working for 10 years as an accountant. Your hard work and sleepless nights have finally paid off: last week you landed the promotion you’ve been seeking for all these years.

Two days ago, you took your daughter to school for the first time. You tried not to get emotional. You summoned all of your manliest thoughts, but failed to defeat the feels-onslaught of a 5-year-old walking, with her Spongebob backpack, to class for the first time.

The next day, you got a call from your mother. She is sick; they’ve found “something” in a recent scan. It has you thinking and worried around the clock. It’s the first time one of your parents has gotten sick, and it has you reflecting a lot on your own mortality and the time you have with your parents and your daughter.

You’ve experienced a whirlwind of emotions: joy, sadness and fear.

And now here you are, in anticipation, walking to your office in the downtown New York, for your first day as a manager.

On the sidewalk walking towards you is a stranger.

Now you are the stranger.

You are looking at Robert. You know nothing about Robert or any of his trials and tribulations. To you, he is just another stranger who appears deep in thought.

Kathy Casey,Updated Sep 8,Why did my top performing employee quit after write up?,"Thank you for all the up votes y'all! I'm really proud that so many do know their worth. Keep going!!

I did it. I was a 6 year beloved employee at a Golf Course whose name you would recognize. I ran a state of the art type of snack bar. During a member/pro tournament of 200, I ran short on Coke, a big seller and also used for mixed drinks out there and called it in. They said they would bring it. They were 1.2 miles from me. I called again 30 mins later. Then, they ghosted me. Wouldn't respond to any type of communication at all. Well, for the first time EVER, I had to tell players I was out of something. I was livid. The new manager wrote me up for calling him out for ignoring me and the tourney. I hadn't raised my voice, cussed or acted a fool. I told him if he planned to go through with it, he could turn the paper over for my written 2 weeks notice. He signed, I refused and tendered my resignation on the spot. I worked the 2 weeks. They tried to get me to stay another week. I declined to train their new employee because 60 % of my success was rapport and knowing my players and what they wanted. Many came out to eat sandwiches I made for them instead of the hotel or other facilities as a result. I made tons of money for them, every week, weather permitting. During hard freezes instead of going home, I'd work prep for the chef. When I left, my members gave me 3 dozen roses and 2K in cash to help me to my next job. I was hired by a member as an International Project Coordinator for a major oil exploration company. Members missed me and one even said that my old place felt like a gas station with very little good stuff… My point here is for you to look at the big picture and don't be a petty jerk.

Dhawal Barot,Updated 5y,What are some short stories on the theme save the girl-child?,"“So, how was the life on earth?” God asked.

The old couple who was standing together answered, “The life was good. We thank you for giving us everything. But, there was a bad phase, which ruined our old age days.”

“Which was it?” God asked.

“Our son who moved us out from our home, God. I mean, everyone from our friends circle was blessed with a good son who took care of them. But, our son made us spend our last days in an old age home. Why didn’t you give us a son like Shravan
.” The old man asked.

God smiled and answered, “Shravan? I did give you. In fact, I gave you someone who was more caring than Shravan.”

“What?” The old man questioned.

“Yes. I blessed you with a baby girl who could serve you more than any Shravan. But, all that you both needed was a boy. That’s why you killed her in the womb.”

The old couple was awestruck. They weren’t able to speak anything. Suddenly, the spark light came from the face of the God and the man who was old woke up and found himself in bed. He realized that he was not old, but young enough. It was just a dream.

He woke up from the bed and started following his routine life.

Mercedes R.

Problem is—OH SO MANY PROBLEMS! He didn’t get permission from the game company. He didn’t bother to tell his test subjects they were test subjects. He didn’t bother to figure out whether they were underage. He didn’t get permission from ANY of his test subjects. He didn’t get permission from the underaged ones’ parents. He didn’t offer psychiatric counseling after he traumatized them.

The book was canceled. He got hauled up in front of the Dean. I don’t know if he got fired, but I do know he had to withdraw his paper and erase it from his CV.

Franklin Veaux,Sat,"In my novel, should I use “dinner” or “supper” to refer to the third meal?","Dinner and supper don’t mean the same thing.

Which one you use should depend on where your novel is set. As a general guide:

“Dinner” means the largest meal of the day. In some parts of the US, that’s the midday meal, particularly in the rural Midwest. When I lived in a farm in Nebraska, we had breakfast, dinner, and supper. The “main” meal was dinner; supper was a lighter meal.

On the coasts, and in every large town or city I’ve lived in, it’s breakfast, lunch, dinner. The midday meal, lunch, is typically smaller than the evening meal, dinner.

So if your novel is set in New York City? Breakfast, lunch, dinner. If your novel is set in Venango, Nebraska? Breakfast, dinner, supper.

Anonymous,Updated 4y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"Warning: Extremely Emotional phase.

I was living a normal student life till yesterday evening. I’m having my final exams next week and this is the Crucial time for me to study and I’m sensible enough to understand that.

My mom has been having few problems since the last 2–3 years. Upon asking her to go to the doctor, She used to ignore it by saying they’re just hormonal problems.

last month by my convincing on seeing her condition, She got her hormonal tests.

The results came and show extremely high level of hormonal problems. So she went to the gynaecologist yesterday evening.

i was waiting for her but she didn’t return back by 3 hours.

I knew something was wrong. I called her and she didn’t respond. I got extremely worried.

I’m not an emotional person yet the only person I am attached to , in my life is my mom.

I had a very bad intuition If she got into an accident or something bad happened with the reports conclusion.She came back in about half an hour and she just told me that another test has to be done for uterus size and diabetes and it’s gonna be fine and she went to my dad. They never closed the door while talking but they did yesterday.

I went and directly checked the reports.

What I read was life shattering for me. My entire life came down. She had been advised for a test named Pap smear test and being a dental student, I knew what it’s for. But still I went with tears in my eyes and went near to the room where My mom was telling that doctor has a doubt on her having Cancer and Pap smear test has to be done and they didn’t want me to know. I directly went to the bathroom and cried so much for the first time in my life. I opened the tap so that they couldn’t hear to my wails in the noise of the water from the tap. I went to her in the kitchen where I could see from her face that’s she’s not in a good mood, but she still smiled on seeing me.

I knew she was crying and so was my heart. Whenever I saw her face, I just recollected all the times I was angry with her or even raised my voice. I started assuming if she dies, what would I do, I’d constantly cry looking at her face, but I didn’t want her to know that I know about what she’s been hiding from me. I went to my room and cried my heart out again. I couldn’t imagine my life without her. I just imagined her lying with eyes. Closed and my heart froze with fear, I couldn’t study yesterday night. I didn’t have dinner yesterday. Upon been asked by mom for dinner, I told her I had food when she had gone out and I need to study for exams and she understood coz I’ve been studying a lot recently for my exams.

I literally wasn’t hungry at all even without having food for the first time. My emotions had eaten my hunger. I’m not a type of guy who cries even at something extremely emotional moment of someone else’s life, but I realized what my weakness was. It is my mom. I cannot imagine my life without her. I’m still crying while typing this out. I can’t wait for the reports showing negative in the tests, I’ve been praying to god a lot for her not getting any problem. My family is thinking I’m praying for my exams to pass coz they’ve even disclosed about the doubt with my sister and not me, Coz I’m the youngest of my family and so closest to my mom. I hope no mother in this entire world gets cancer or any other problem. This 1 day has been the longest and the most emotional time of my life which I cannot even share with anyone.

Edit :

Thank you so much everyone. Her reports have come and they show seedling uterine fibroids which are non cancerous. I really feel blessed to be a part of Quora where so many people show concern and are supportive despite being absolute strangers. I can finally concentrate on my studies for my final exams and I promise to be the best son to my mom that no problem even touches her. Thanks a lot again everyone. Lots of love to each and every one of you who took time to show me their concern ❤️","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5ic2uljwkzf90ha4', 'title': 'Does anyone want to write their heart out here?', 'score': {'original': 0.9672, 'ai': 0.0328}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Warning: Extremely Emotional phase.\n\nI was living a normal student life till yesterday evening.

Dhawal Barot,7y,What is the best short war story you can come up with?,"Khan was injured and alone. Everyone from his team died with gunshots in that war. He lost his gun while doing the fight. But somehow, he managed to enter inside the building.

As he was gunless and injured, he left with the last option to blast the bomb. He thanked God and his country for everything. Finally, he pressed the self blast button and the building blasted with many lives.

The next day, newspaper headlines drafted. They were,

Khan Strikes Again. India Beat Pakistan.

'Zak is Back' - The left-arm paceman took five wickets to give Indian side a great start. Certainly, his tremendous bowling attack was unanswerable.

Indian Army's Most Vigorous Answer Against Terrorism

""In the desert of Afghan, Major Khan & team vanished terrorist camp by blasting an old building.""

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"In 2016, I completed my engineering from a tier 3 college in Greater Noida. During campus placements, I got placed in Cognizant, but 7 months had passed and Cognizant did not mail any call letter. By that time all of my friends had joined companies and I was just waiting for the mail. I decided to attend an off-campus interview being conducted by Airtel to recruit GETs ( Graduate Engineer Trainees). Being a core company for ECE, I put efforts and I got selected and called for training along with other 40 selected candidates to their Airtel NOC, Manesar, Gurgaon. The training went on for 3 months and then I was assigned a department. After 4 months, Airtel abruptly fires all the newly joined GETs, citing revenue loss due to the Jio’s popularity. I was not even given an experience certificate because they said that for getting an experience certificate from the company, one has to serve for at least 1 year. I was in shock, not able to realize what had happened. I was jobless without any experience letter! I reached home and started searching for companies for openings for freshers. I was struck down by the fact that nearly all good companies were now hiring freshers of batch 2017 and if you passed in 2016, you were required to show the experience letter. This provision kicked me out of almost 95% of the interviews of good companies for B.tech ECE profile. The interview calls which I got and am getting are of call centers, sales representative and delivery boy. Dejected, I started my preparations for govt exams and defense exams. I cleared nearly all defense exams and went for 6 SSBs and failed in all of them. This makes my number of SSB attempts 10 and in the meantime, I wrote SSC CGL and CHSL, cleared their stages and now the result is about to be scrapped by the government.

I have been sitting at home unemployed for nearly 2 years. What did those good grades in school and engineering fetch me? Nothing. All my batchmates who got placed are doing their jobs and now have 3 years of experience. They are purchasing gifts for their parents and for themselves. They are traveling. They used to call me but with time each of my friends has forgotten me. My father, a die-hard alcoholic and an immoral person, came out to be involved in an illicit extramarital sexual relationship and he left the house 8 months ago and now I don’t know where he is. He does not pick our phone calls. My mother has always been exploited by my father since the first day of their marriage. Domestic violence was a daily affair, she has struggled too much so that we can study( I and my brother). After my graduation she had high expectations of me, She wanted to see her son as an officer but now she sees her son sitting at home unemployed. She has to give false justifications to people and the wicked relatives when they ask about me. I am living in a rut, there is deep melancholy in me. I do not know how and when I will be able to get out of this vicious situation, I cry and I shout and I feel pity for me. I was totally opposite of what I am now. I was an energetic, optimistic and jaunty kind of person but these 2 years of despondency have taken a toll on me. Only one question haunts me day in day out, when will I be able to give her a life she deserves?

Dhawal Barot,Updated 5y,Can you write a short and sweet story about feelings?,"To make himself healthy, Raj added walking as an activity in his evening schedule.

He used to walk for like five kilometres daily around the lake.

A week passed and he started loving his new activity.

After walking for five kilometres, he used to sit near a bench.

Just a few steps away from that bench, an old man was seated.

The old man used to distribute chocolate to every kid who passed by him.

Raj observed that for a week.

After a week, Raj walked up to that old man and sat beside him.

Then, a kid came to the old man and asked for a chocolate.

The old man gave him one smilingly and the kid happily walked away.

Then, the old man looked at Raj and with a smile on his face, Raj asked, “Uncle, why do you distribute these chocolates to kids?”

The old man was amused and he questioned, “You mean sweetness?”

Raj heard those words and understood everything.

Anonymous,5y,Does anyone want to write their heart out here?,"I feel so exhausted.

I married when i was 25, December of 2013. Immediately I got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy the year after that. Being a mother is the best thing that ever happened to me... Some time around the second year of my son, my husband told me that he noticed something different and odd about our child. He said that he seemed to be detached from the world and not making eye contact when being talked to. My husband had a cousin who was diagnosed with autism when he was three and my husband suggested that we should get our son checked. I refused a few times and even lead to arguments everytime the subject was being brought out.

I was sceptic for quite long until i noticed that my son stopped talking. He can already speak a few words when i noticed he just stopped. All he did was create a humming sound over and over. It was that moment when i agreed to take him to a developmental pedia. He was then diagnosed with ASD (autism spectrum disorder).

Now he's 4, he's in a constant occupational and speech therapy. He's making progress somehow.. But sometimes i feel like it's taking him a long time to cope. He talks now, but most of his words are only understood by him and himself alone. I know it would be strange if i'll say that I'm actually happy with that,.. Well i've seen him really quiet not even babbling so hearing his voice even when i can't understand what he's saying is really a big thing for me. There are a few times when he speaks ""mama"" mostly when he's upset and complaining .. It makes me think that he wants me to console him.

The struggle is this, I'm working and i wouldn't want to sacrifice my career to be a stay at home mom. Sometimes i feel guilty about it but other than not wanting to let go of my career is only one issue why i need to keep my job. Another important thing is that his expenses with the therapy he's having involves an ample amount of money. If I would stop working we could still survive but might run out short for other more expenses we need.

My husband and I worked out our schedules, to make sure that when one is out, one is home to stay with our child. He works in the morning shift and i work on the night shift. We can't really hire someone who can watch over our son because he can't talk yet and he won't be able to tell us if ever abuse is going on when we're out of the house to work. We don't want to risk that.. His safety and wellbeing are the things we always keep in mind.

The reason why I feel exhausted is that part where i have to be constantly strong all through out. I go home late, sleep late and wake up early, not having my husband around because he's already off to work around 6 in the morning. I cook my son pancakes then get him ready for his therapy after he's done eating.. After therapy, we'll go home and i'll prepare for work.. By then my husband comes home and i'll leave.

It's that way for 2 years now... And another matter i have to take care of this year is my son going to school, another time to squeeze in on my hectic schedule. How can i handle all of this.. I feel so tired.. But i love seeing my son happy.. I love laughing with him and playing with him, i don't want to go back to the days when i kept calling his name but it seems like i'm talking to a wall. I want to be a good mom i want my son to be all well.. I want everything good to happen and i hate myself for being exhausted.

I'm not frustrated with my son's situation, i know he can cope, he just needs time. I don't even care how long it would take, I happen to rejoice and celebrate even at the slightest progress he makes. Just recently i tought him how to count with his fingers up to five. I'm the one who counts through my mouth and he follows through his fingers and we clap our hands after. Parents with normal children would think of that as lame for a 4 year old, well i don't really care, my son is learning and that's all that matters to me.

I'm thankful to have stumbled on this question while I'm browsing quora, it's amazing how my mood changed after composing the paragraphs above. Today was one of those days when i wanted to cry all my heart out hoping it would lessen the tiredness i feel.. Everytime i talk to my husband when i'm having low days like this, he would always ask me to strengthen my patience and understanding to a higher level, he would say that no one will be here for our son but us so if we'll start giving up on him that means we're giving up on his life and future. That would shake me and make me 30% stronger everytime it happens.

I tried talking to other people or reading books about autism but they tend to frustrate me more than help me figure things out. When i tell people about my son's condition they don't really say things that could help, they would just say things like maybe I'm spoiling him too much that's why he's always dependent on me. I wish they'd understand, but on the later i started caring less of what others are thinking. I'm proud of my son and always looking forward to what kind of brilliance he'll be in the future.

On my part, I've learned to pick the right books to read, books that would give hope rather comparison of my son's progress from other cases of children with autism.

Although I read books about autism, my shelf is not always about that subject, only one out of 10 books. I keep my self sane from not brooding over ""autism"". My reading involves a lot of history, philosophy and science. I guess it helps with the balance i need mentally. As much as possible i don't want to raise my son as someone with autism but someone as normal as everybody else.

This is my son when I first saw him.. He was a big baby 3.2 kg.

This is him now.. He smiles for the camera when he’s in the mood…

Rakshith Akira,Updated 5y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"Scene#1

Rakshith was working as a software engineer in Bangalore. He's very punctual and dedicated towards his work.

One fine day, at 9:30 AM he was heading towards the office. That day was so important and hectic because he had his project deadline. He should deliver his project to UK clients at any cost that day. A project worth £5,00,000. When he was on the way, He called to his boss,

Prateek Mishra: Yes Rakshith.

Rakshith: I can't turn up to the office today.

Prateek Mishra: Wtf! Are you fucking kidding man? You know we should deliver the project to clients. Do you know the value of that project? It's £5, 00,000.

Rakshith: Yes, I know but I have stuck in something more important than that.

Prateek Mishra: I will make sure you will be fired soon.

Rakshith: I don't mind.

Prateek Mishra: You will face the consequences soon.

What happened to him? Why couldn't he turn up to office? When he was driving to office what made him to took a leave?

Will let you know soon.

Scene#2

There was an accident on the road. No one was ready to help that mother and her little angel.

Honda Activa met with an accident with Hyundai i20. That mother and her little angel were sunken in the blood pool.

That mother was dropping her little angel in school on a 2 wheeler, but suddenly they met with a brutal accident by a car. The owner/driver of the car didn't even step out to look what happened to mother and the daughter. He just escaped in a jiffy. Probably, he might be scared to handle the legal issues. Some old guy who was smoking a cigarette in a small tea stall which was nearby noted car number.

Even though the government has ordered, publicized and made the advertisement for people awareness no one was turning up that day to help that mother and daughter.

On what did the government issue an order?

“Reporting a road accident to police or taking a victim to the hospital will no longer be a harrowing experience for good Samaritans.”

Scene#3

Rakshith was also there in that crowd. He called the ambulance, but he was sure that in India pizza comes faster than an ambulance.

So, after a couple of calls and thoughts, he decided to help the duo. He took both of them into his newly bought car. His interior decorated again with the pool of blood.

While driving, he received a mail. It was from his employer, Prateek Mishra. Prateek Mishra sent a termination letter to Rakshith.

Rakshith was least bothered about that mail at that moment.

Scene#4

Blood pooled mother and daughter were taken to the operation theater. Rakshith was caught by hospital inquiry team. He started searching for an address in the ID card/ phone number of that little angel who met with the accident, so that he can inform her guardians.

Scene#5

At last, Rakshith found the address and phone number. He called to the number which was on ID card. Someone picked up the call on the other end.

That number he took from ID card belonged to Prateek Mishra.

So, that little angel is Prateek Mishra's daughter!

Aditi Mishra.P, daughter of Prateek Mishra.

P for Prateek.

He called back to his employer Prateek Mishra.

Prateek Mishra: I knew it, you lower middle-class people should come back to us to beg job. You know what, I already fired you, check your mail for the termination letter. I know you called me to apologize, but I don't need your fucking sorry Mr.

Rakshith: Sir, it's not the time for proving who is great. I have a bad news for you. Your wife and daughter met with an accident. Please come quickly to the hospital.

Scene#6

Prateek Mishra entered the hospital. Rakshith was sitting at the main entrance lobby. They both exchanged the gaze. Prateek couldn't gaze into Rakshith's eye. He felt shameless for his act in the morning.

The doctor came out from operation theatre.

Mr. Mishra rushed towards the doctor and begged the doctor to save his daughter and wife.

The doctor said that typical dialogue “We are trying our best, rest is up to God.”

After 2 hours of hectic operation, doctor came out and said to Mr. Mishra “ No need to worry, operation is successful. Both of them need six months of rest.”

Mishra with the great move said, “thank you, doctor.” and hugged.

Doctor in turn, said “There is no need to thank me. Thank that fellow sitting on the couch of front lobby. If he wouldn't have brought them on time, we could do nothing .”

Rakshith was observing all this from the main entrance lobby. He made sure that daughter and mother were alive and went back to parking slot.

He took out his car and drove off.

Mishra and Shetty never spoke in that 2 hour span in the hospital. Mishra didn't approach Rakshith because of guilt.

Scene#7

It's been 2 years, still Mishra is in search of Rakshith.

Rakshith's number is in switched off mode from past 2 years. He left his room. Mishra tried but couldn't find his whereabouts.

Even today Mishra tries to call Rakshith twice a day to thank him and apologize for his act, but the sweet voice on the other end says “The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off. Please try again later.”

THE END!

I know, I have abruptly ended the story. It's an open-ended climax. The judgment is left to readers. I know Questions are flooding your mind.

Why Rakshith left unnoticed?
Why he left?
What happened to that £5, 00,000 project?
Has humanity won over money that day?
Where is Rakshith now and what happened to him?

Some or the other day, You could be Mr. Mishra or Mr. Rakshith. Never speak without knowing person circumstances. We play according to circumstances rhythm.

Plot twist which makes you lost in thoughts

Probably, Mr. Mishra was right.

Just because he was so ethical and dedicated to his work. He used to sleep on footpath and had a hunger stomach in the past. £5,00,000 project was a lot to him. So, Mishra knew the value of money. He turned from rags to riches. So out of furiousness he terminated Mr. Rakshith.

Probably, Rakshith was right too. Just because he knew much about humanity. He lost his mother in accident so he might know the pain of losing a person and took a leave on D-day. So, out of furiousness he ignored Mr. Mishra.

We can't judge who is right and who is wrong. Just do what is more important to you. Never bother about Someone or something.

Person never move but circumstances make him to.

Shovan Chowdhury,Updated 4y,Can you write something so deep that it would make me feel something?,"I was rejected after 2 years virtual relationship. When she was marrying a successful man, I was waiting in the interview waiting room to get rid of my 2.5 years unemployment life.

While She posted pictures on Instagram about her new house in London with her husband, my landlord was searching me because I did not pay my two months rent due to financial insolvency.

When she was getting taste of delicious food of world's one of the expensive restaurant in Italy, I was eating cheap street food in Bangladesh to save money.

When she was traveling and exploring the world with her husband, I was dealing with chronic depression, taking antidepressants and confined myself in a dark room for hours and hours.

While she was enjoying night concert of Bruno Mars at Vancouver with her husband and bunch of friends, I was waiting outside of operation theater of my mother with sleepless night, tensed mind, broken heart and empty pocket.

While she was busy to shop at Walmart owned Asda supermarket in UK, I was doing tuition to manage my pocket money and studying hard to get a good job.

She posted smiling picture in Facebook with her husband while driving their new BMW car, that time I was hanging in the crowdy bus with many people in suffocated situation.

While she was feeling proud and happy to join in a Fortune 500 company, I was working in a local NGO with poor salary.

When she was enjoying the motherhood of one adorable child, I was leading a single life and console my father that “Dad, don't worry. I will manage everything of our financial crisis in our family. Just give me some more times”. My dad touched my hand with firm belief.

I did not cry for many days. Now I hate virtual life, I focus more on real life. All of my rejections, shortcomings, grief, sufferings, failures, agony made a strong person what I am today…

Damn little pests, coming into her house and antagonizing her like that!\n\nEventually, she gets the upper hand, and the camera pans back and zooms out, and you see the damaged spaceship, with the American Flag painted on the side; you hear the commander of the ship calling for aid, in English.\n\nThe entire time, the human woman was a giant alien, and the little “aliens” were humans.\n\nYou always expect something unexpected with The Twilight Zone.

Dhawal Barot,Updated 4y,What is the deepest story you’ve heard behind a pen?,"“Kunal’s mom makes amazing sandwiches. By the way, why didn't Kunal eat his lunch, and he gave it to you?” Raj the 4th standard student asked.

“He’s sad, I guess.” Ruchir shared.

“He lost his pen gifted by his late dad. I bet someone stole it.” Kush added.

“God will surely punish the thief.” Tapan added.

A piece of Sandwich got dropped from Raj’s hand. He felt nervous and walked away. Everyone kept wondering what went wrong with him.

The next day, Kunal entered into his classroom, which was 4A. Then, he moved to his bench where he found a box with a note which read, “Sorry for stealing it. :( - Raj”

Kunal opened the box and found the pen.

Raj’s lips took a positive curve in direction of a smile. He felt happy.

Raj scanned Kunal’s reaction.

Then, he reached to him and apologized. Kunal didn’t hold any grudge and forgave him.

Years passed. Raj and Kunal are now best friends. They share every secret of their lives with each other. But Raj never told Kunal ever that he never stole his pen and Kunal also didn’t reveal that he knew every scratch on his dad’s pen very well.

If there was a notification displaying the number of times who has viewed your DP, I would have topped it.
I was never in a relationship; I was only mistaken to be taken.
Fake people are easily accepted while the true ones are often misunderstood.
You finally came back not because “I needed you” but because “You needed someone”.

Then: How should I start a conversation?
Now: Why should I start a conversation?
In a hurry to identify the ones who “likes her”, she surely lost the one who “loved her”.
The problem is I always wanted to share every bit of my feelings I have for you while you were never in a mood to understand them.
We all are in search of someone who knows that we don’t want to leave when we say we want to.
From ignoring everyone else just to be available to one; To being available for everyone else just to forget the one, I learned a lot.
It started with “No sorry, no thank you in friendship”and ended with “Sorry for everything I did and thanks for everything you did”.
I could hardly love anyone now coz someone once said to me “I love you and will be with you no matter what” and then left forever.

Matt P.,Updated 4y,What do authors need to know about guns to write them realistically?,"In no particular order…

You don’t cock striker fired pistols. “Glock Cocking” is a sign of poor gun knowledge.
Bullets, fired from pistol and rifle alike, will pass through car bodies from one side to the other. Thin metal, steel or aluminum, is not hard cover.
Slides lock open on the last round on most pistols.
People are not thrown backwards by incoming gunfire.
Bullets do not ignite gasoline, propane or any other type of flammable liquid. Shooting barrels of such material stored conveniently where the antagonists can hide behind is right out. As are exploding gas tanks in cars by being shot.
There is no database of registered guns or gun licensees to access.
Outside of places like MA, NJ, New York City and Illinois there is no such thing as “registered guns” or “licensed owners”. If you’re a writer from one of these places, get out to the rest of America and find out how gun ownership actually is. Saying one has a legal registered gun and is properly licensed is stereotype writing and not reflective of reality.
Full auto firearms are not common. There are no black market sellers selling a variety of military hardware for the person with the right amount of money to acquire. Full auto is so rare that only 3 crimes have been committed with legally owned machine guns in the past 80+ years and only one crime of note, the North Hollywood Shootout in the late 1990s, was done with illegally modified guns to make them fire full auto. Yes, it is that rare. Don’t portray machine guns as common or readily available. They are not.
Suppressors do not make a “Pfft” sound on anything that is centerfire, pistol or rifle.
Know the difference between rimfire and centerfire.
Know what “high powered” means in firearms. Hint: It is not an AR-15 or an AK-47/74 type rifle.
There is no such thing as a “sniper rifle”. Snipers perform a role. It is not a weapon type. So-called “sniper rifles” are just accurate off-the-shelf modified hunting rifles. The same rifle carried by a sniper is used to hunt deer and can be acquired in the exact same military configuration if one wants to spend the money.
People are not incapacitated immediately by most gun shots if not hit in the head or central nervous system. If shot by a pistol a person can remain functional for several minutes even if mortally wounded in a vital area. If shot by a high powered rifle a person can be dropped in a single shot. Remember, 80% of people shot by a handgun survive. Learn about terminal ballistics as it does matter.
There is no body armor that can stop anything more powerful than .30–06 that you don’t sit in and drive. .338 Lapua or .50BMG will go through any worn body armor like it didn’t exist.
Body armor is heavy. Even soft armor worn under clothing weighs several pounds. Hard armor designed to stop rifle rounds can weigh 20 to 30 pounds easily depending on plate composition and coverage.
There is no such thing as “armor piercing ammunition” that is designed to penetrate soft police body armor. Any centerfire rifle with sufficient energy can do it.
Guns are fucking loud! As in “you’ll be shouting afterwards with ears ringing” loud if you discharge any gun in an enclosed space. If Hollywood played gun shots at their actual noise levels in a theater they’d both deafen the audience and blow out their speakers in the process.
Magazines and clips are different. While a small detail, knowing the difference and using the correct terms will raise your respect level by those in-the-know if you are writing anything where guns are a central part of the narrative. If you can’t understand what is meant by “The soldier withdrew a stripper clip quickly from her pouch, jammed it into the guide, shoved the rounds into the magazine and desperately resumed fire against the charging mass of humanity.”, you need to do more research.
There are no such things as ice bullets, poison tipped bullets, mercury bullets, guided or exploding ammunition (Note: Guided ammunition prototypes have been built, purely experimental, nothing in service and exploding ammunition is likewise limited. Not something you can buy or make. The reference is to general availability. ).
Hollowpoints are not designed to penetrate body armor. Nor are they designed to “explode in the body”.
Teflon coating does not make a bullet able to penetrate body armor.
Plastic guns with no metal in them that can be concealed, made undetectable and fire regular centerfire pistol or rifle rounds do not exist. The only “plastic gun” that can shoot anything is the 3D printed Liberator and that only shoots a measely .22LR and is more likely to explode after a few rounds.
An unskilled person cannot get behind a random rifle and make a headshot on a person from several hundred yards away like Call of Duty or Fortnite. Not unless the rifle was configured for that exact range by the person who owned the rifle beforehand, left it behind conveniently for the shooter and there was no wind. Then they might scare the wall next to the person they were firing at. If you want to portray long range shooting, go do some long range shooting (200 yards/meters+) to see how hard it actually is. 1000 yard shots are very, very difficult.
In an apocalypse or survival scenario, people are going to be carrying more than the magazine or rounds in the gun. Make sure you reflect they have reloads and how they are carrying them if they are going to be in a firefight.
Caliber is not a measure of power. It is only a measure of diameter.
If you’re going to write about guns and never seen, much less handled, one, sign up for an introductory gun safety class at your nearest range that includes live fire. If you can’t do that, get a knowledgeable friend to take you to the range. You will learn more in an afternoon handling real guns than you ever will in imagining what it is like.

Additions:

Typical walls will not stop bullets. Pistol rounds and shotgun pellets will go through several layers of drywall. Rifle rounds will go through as well but the faster they go the more likely they will fragment.
Bullets will not bounce off stair rails, car mirrors, lamp posts and other similar items. If people used these objects for protection the way movies show them you’ll have a lot of dead people.
Rifle bullets do not go through water like little torpedoes you see in movies. In fact, supersonic rifle rounds fragment within inches of the surface. Pistol rounds and slow moving projectiles will penetrate deeper but not more than a few feet.
The loudness of a gun is not indicative of its recoil. People perceive the noise is related to power. It isn’t. All guns are loud. Especially indoors. Guns like the AR-15 and AR-10, for all their sound and fury, are very gentle shooters so much so a small child can shoot one and not be hurled backwards.
People making headshots at 50 yards with single pistol shots is somehow common yet people with rifles at the same range shooting back can’t hit the broad side of a barn. Rifles are much more accurate than pistols. 25 yards is a long shot for a pistol. 25 yards for a rifle is point blank range and virtually impossible to miss.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/m0dvk9yszgfx1b4a', 'title': 'What do authors need to know about guns to write them realistically?', 'score': {'original': 0.74586666666667, 'ai': 0.25413333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In no particular order…\n\nYou don’t cock striker fired pistols. “Glock Cocking” is a sign of poor gun knowledge.\nBullets, fired from pistol and rifle alike, will pass through car bodies from one side to the other.

Dhawal Barot,Updated 5y,What are some two line love stories which they found in Facebook but pure love?,"Writing a few,

She logged inside his profile, liked her new uploaded DP on her FB profile and logged out.

A few minutes later when he noticed that activity, smilingly, he changed the like into the heart reaction.

Sean Kernan,2y,What is the secret to hitting your writing goals?,"The secret applies to essentially any goal: incrementality.

Divide the goal up into subgoals so you can feel like you're moving.

I’m starting my third year as a professional writer. But I’d been writing for years before that and did it each day. I set small goals and got excited about them, even if they were stupid things like getting 100 or 1000 followers.

Anything that gets you motivated towards your goal is a worthy source of motivation. You don’t have to tell anyone about it. You can use a secret rivalry as a way to push yourself. You can set candy rewards. As with anything in your imagination, there are no rules.

When I quit my job in my first year, my goal was just to prove that I could make a full-time living at writing and stay out of the cubicle (this part will never change). Writing in a competitive environment where money was on the line totally changed my view on writing and made me realize so much of my writing on Quora was trash. I learned so much and had to revamp everything.

In year two, I wanted to start ghostwriting for corporate clients and establish a business. That worked out well. I finished writing my first book but you won’t know I wrote it because it’s under someone else's name (the pay is higher when your name isn’t listed).

Year three is “Year of the Book”, as in my own book. It’s going to be in the self-improvement genre and will blend my “cool fact” style writing that I’ve done on Quora.

I’ve just started and am putting a lot of pressure on myself for this book to be good, not wishy-washy platitudes or a boring information dump. I’m comparing it to the most popular books in this genre and constantly reminding myself, “It needs to be THIS good.”

Starting a book is hard because it looks like you are staring at this giant mountain, that you can’t fully see because of clouds covering it.

The trick is to start somewhere in the middle and just start writing. Then, look for ways to segue ideas and transition to subsequent parts. I’ve had a few moments where I felt completely lost but I’m getting the hang of it. It’s all about chunking out the goals and aiming for them.

Anyways, wish me luck.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ws0cn6ydiz8fj1pq', 'title': 'What is the secret to hitting your writing goals?', 'score': {'original': 0.9871, 'ai': 0.0129}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The secret applies to essentially any goal: incrementality.\n\nDivide the goal up into subgoals so you can feel like you're moving.\n\nI’m starting my third year as a professional writer.

Reshma Merani,Updated 3y,What is the best original romantic conversation you can write?,"A2A

She opened the door wondering who it could be at this hour of the night. There she saw him, standing there awkwardly, shuffling his feet, his shirt loosened from his worn out jeans, sleeves pulled back, his hair mussed up as if he'd been running his hand through it a lot.

Nisha: Are you okay?

He looked at her, and his eyes spoke what words couldn't say.

Nisha (in a resigned voice): It's her again, isn't it?

Rohan: I didn't know where else to go.

Nisha (sighing): Come on in.

He came in and hugged her tightly without saying a word. She held him close, until his body stopped shaking. She made him his favourite hot chocolate, and knowing that he wouldn't have eaten anything, she whipped up some sandwiches.

Rohan: But, I don't want to eat -

Nisha: Shush. Eat, you'll feel better. I have the whole night to listen to the problems of your love life!

He gave up, and started eating. He had never been able to win an argument against her. Half an hour later, she was settled on the couch watching a movie. He was sprawled next to her, and still chose not to utter a word, but just kept staring at her. After a few more minutes, finally fed up, she looked at him with raised eyebrows, asking a silent question. He just kept staring.

Nisha: Alright! Enough of this. Speak. You know I don't like it when you keep staring at me!

Rohan: I wasn't staring, I was thinking.

Nisha: You really think you can lie to me? I have known you for 7 years! So, listen to me because I'm gonna say this for the last time today! You need to stop doing this to yourself. This happens every time. You can't let it get to you so much!

Rohan: I know. But, why? Why couldn't things have worked out? Why couldn't she have loved me back? Is there something wrong with me? Did I not treat her well? Do I not deserve even a shot at happiness? Is that too much to ask for?

Nisha: I keep telling you, if she was the right girl for you things would have worked out. If they didn't, it means it isn't meant to be.

Rohan: Hmm! Can I stay here tonight?

Nisha: The couch is all yours.

Saying this, she made to get up, but he caught her arm.

Rohan: No, stay. Please. Just be here for sometime. Then go to sleep. Please, I don't want to be alone.

Nisha: I have to work tomorrow. And so do you. Just 10 more minutes, and then I'm off to bed.

She sat back down.

Rohan: Thank you so much.

He then rearranged himself in such a way, that his head rested in her lap. She looked down at him in exasperation.

Nisha (chuckling): This isn't what I signed up for, when I became your neighbour and best friend, all those years ago, Rohan! You're like a kid. I have to feed you, take care of you, and now this. You better start paying me for being your therapist cum babysitter!

Rohan (smiling reluctantly): You're the best. I love you.

Nisha (rolling her eyes): Of course you do! Now sleep.

And soon, he dozed off. And she left him there, and went to bed. Next morning, she woke up to find breakfast in bed, and with him standing near the door, with a smile on his face.

Rohan: Good morning! Hey, I'm so sorry for last night. It won't happen again.

Nisha: Morning! Wow, breakfast in bed. I'm impressed. Mm, this coffee tastes delicious!

Rohan: A dash of milk, 1 cube sugar, and lots of cream; yeah, unlike what you think, I do remember how you like your coffee.

Nisha (smiling into her cup): Alright, good to know.

Rohan: Why do you tolerate me?

Nisha: Best friends, right? It's part of the deal.

Rohan: That's all? That's the only reason?

Nisha: Yeah. What else would it be?

Rohan: I don't know. This says something else. Remember this?

Nisha paled as she saw what he was holding. This couldn't be happening. He couldn't have read that.

Nisha: Where did you find that? Give it to me.

Rohan: Why didn't you tell me?

Nisha: Rohan, this is not a joke. Give me that letter!

Rohan: You were never going to tell me, right? Why?? Why wouldn't you tell me?

Nisha: Because you were in love. You are in love. You love her. It doesn't matter how I feel.

Rohan: It matters to me. This changes everything.

Nisha: No, it doesn't. Just because I like you doesn't mean you're obligated to like me back. And plus, that was a long time ago. I don't feel that way now. I'm over you.

Rohan: So, you don't love me?

Nisha: Not anymore.

Rohan: Oh okay, then.

He left the door and walked slowly towards her, till he was sitting on the bed beside her.

Rohan: Because, you know, if you did love me, I'd tell you that you were the first person I ever fell for, 4 years ago, but was too scared to tell you. I would tell you that I didn't want to lose our friendship, so I never told you how I felt. I would tell you that even when I started dating her, I always had a soft corner for you. Yes, I loved her. I am sad that it didn't work out. But, that has been over for a long time. I need to accept that. I have just been holding onto a false hope. And now, this! It's you. My first love. And to know that you loved me back - I can't help it, I'm so happy. So, yes, I would tell you that I still love you. I never stopped loving you. I want to be with you always but as someone more than a best friend. But, all this doesn't matter now, right? Because you don't love me anymore.

She looked at him with moist eyes, the tears threatening to fall. She opened her mouth to speak, but words wouldn't come out. He spread his arms and she went in them. She hugged him tightly as he placed soft kisses in her hair. They stayed that way, lost in each other. After she finally withdrew from his embrace, he looked at her.

Rohan: So, I have officially seen you in your pyjamas, with tear stained eyes, a red nose, and a disheveled head, and I'm still here. So, now you know how much I love you.

Nisha (smacked him hard): Shut up, you doofus. I love you.

She ruffled his hair, and gave him a light peck on his cheek, and leaned her head against his chest. He wrapped his arms around her, and rested his chin on top of her head. He was finally content. He was with her. She felt like joy. She felt like peace. She felt like home.

Sean Kernan,2y,Does writing improve your thinking?,"It teaches you to consider more variables.

Everything about writing is achieving balance. I often think about sentences and ideas as sandwiched between two poles:

Confidence vs arrogance

Specific detail vs excess information

Logical flow vs being too predictable

Being original vs trying too hard to be original

Balancing complexity with simplicity

It’s a very analytical craft. This is what editing is all about. Catching typos is only 10% of the editing process.

And as you go out into the world, you catch yourself being more analytical and thoughtful about your conversations, ideas, and reflections on your own life. This is a very beneficial hobby.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ir1bv7x0lkjtu69n', 'title': 'Does writing improve your thinking?', 'score': {'original': 0.9971, 'ai': 0.0029}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It teaches you to consider more variables.\n\nEverything about writing is achieving balance.
