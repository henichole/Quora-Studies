Alex Johnston,2y,What are some great philosophy books for beginners?,"If you want a good book of real philosophy, not supposedly universally applicable ancient wisdom or else some non-philosopher merely telling the reader what to do and think, but a book in which you can read what philosophy is like when it’s done well, one of the best philosophy books for beginners that I’ve ever read is Morality: An Introduction to Ethics, by the late Bernard Williams.

This wasn’t written as a textbook or as an introduction to philosophy, but it is a well-written and extremely clear example of a philosopher doing philosophical work.

Williams is not teaching any morality in particular; he’s arguing about what morality is, and whether or not it does what its supporters say it does. Of particular interest are the chapters in which Williams concisely but convincingly shows that religion and the idea of God are unsatisfactory bases for morality, and in which he succinctly disposes of one of the most popular and widely adhered-to forms of morality, utilitarianism.

Williams admits, in the introduction, that he has no systematic theory of morality, but also suggests that perhaps such a thing isn’t needed, or at any rate might be impossible.

It’s a very short book. My Pelican edition is only 112 pages long.

Toni Kannisto,6y,"What advice would people who study Kant and Hegel, give to their 18-year-old self who has just started studying Kant and Hegel?","Dear Toni,

First, since you are an 18-year old looking to take on Kant, it bears stressing that you should never forget which of you two is the clever one.

In the hubris of youth you may think that Kant will help you in developing your own philosophy that will ultimately surpass his, but know that whenever you think you have caught him making a mistake, you will soon see that he was always one step ahead of you. Do not let yourself be disappointed, not to mention bitter, about it. There is such beauty and honour in being allowed to learn from possibly the greatest mind that ever lived, and he will take you places you never even dreamt of. He will humble you, and he will elevate you. You will know despair, and you will know enlightenment, and you will never cease to be amazed at the speed with which he hurls you from the one to the other.

But never forget that Kant, too, was but a product of his time. His thoughts may soar higher than most, but they spring from the foundations laid down by two millennia of philosophy.

Learn those foundations.

Read Plato and Aristotle, Descartes and Leibniz, Hume and Spinoza – and never read them with anything but utmost respect. It is their insight, no matter how insufficient he ultimately judges them to be, that Kant sought to incorporate and surpass, and it is only if you keep this thought in the back of your head that you can unlock the true potential of his philosophy.

Learn contemporary philosophical tools – they can be a great aid – but scoff at those who would cast aside the wisdom of philosophy that was weaved before the dawn of these tools. Never believe for a second that philosophers predating predicate calculus did not know how to think (let haters hate!). But also never underestimate the power of these tools when applied to a thinker like Kant. Philosophical development is measured in centuries, not decades, and while it might not be the most efficient strategy in the great game of academia to stick with good old Kant (don’t do it for the respect, is all I’m saying), it certainly is a philosophically sound thing to do. (The academic dogs bark, but the philosophical caravan goes on.)

And hey, here’s a pro tip: save yourself from a lot of headache and read his immediate predecessors, Wolff, Baumgarten, and Meier. Now you may not find their philosophy particularly convincing, but what you will find is the terminology that Kant took for granted and that has since been lost in time. Such central terms like representation and determination and such fields of study as rational psychology will barely find any explanation in Kant’s published works – any more than you would today find someone stopping in the middle of a philosophical revolution to explain the universal quantifier. And how these definitions can open your eyes!

Also, please don’t make the mistake that everyone seems to make and think that Kant’s philosophy started with the Critique of Pure Reason. Pre-critical Kant is amazing – and all the development that led him to the Copernican Revolution is there: follow it and you will see it all the more clearly.

Speaking of reading, do not wait ten years to get to know his later works like the Critique of the Power of Judgment or Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason – you’ll thank me, ehm, yourself later (or how does this work now?). While you cannot understand these works without understanding the works that came before, without them you will also fail to see the big picture that Kant always laboured to realise when he wrote. It all hangs together. Metaphysics, logic, and epistemology may be the foundation, but the real purpose of Kant’s philosophy lies in ethics and other disciplines with more, well, life in them.

Speaking of life, never for a second think that Kant is more important than your friends, your family, or good old enjoyment. Don’t take it all too seriously, you’ll live a longer, happier life. (Not that I am exactly one to speak of long life yet, but hey, I’m starting to get an inkling.) Always strive to be a good human being first, a good philosopher second.

Finally, trust in your own capacity to understand Kant. You will find much delight (and much frustration) in reading what other people thought of him, and especially in the beginning it may be more of a necessity than an option, but there are as many theories about Kant as there are interpreters. Read Allison and Gardner, Longuenesse and Paton, or whomever you find helpful – but for the love of God, don’t read Guyer (seriously, don’t do it!). Let the other travellers help you in your philosophical journey (and don’t forget to help others) but never let them define that journey for you. Don’t be the guy who instead of becoming a champion of Kant becomes a lackey of some random dude that wrote about Kant. Find your own way, and trust your own philosophical instincts – and bring a good sharp machete with you into the philosophical jungle!

Yours truly – or should I say: you, truly!

Toni

Eleftherios Tserkezis,2y,Did Socrates really tell a tale called “The Three Sieves” or is that just some interesting hyperbole?,"No, he didn’t.

For those who are not acquainted with the matter, an online story has it that the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates was once approached by someone who wanted to share a piece of vicious gossip. Socrates refused to listen and urged the man to ponder whether what he was about to say was certainly true, good/kind and useful/necessary, those being the eponymous three sieves.

The story is very popular and goes viral at times, with articles and posts on social media and other websites recycling it and, sometimes, adapting it to their needs. A Google search of “three sieves” and “Socrates” gives thousands of results. Mind you, the incident is usually portrayed as something that happened to Socrates, not a parable or tale he recounted, as the OP says.

Now to establish whether a quotation or story is genuine, the first thing one can do is check the record of that person’s life and statements. Apparently, Socrates himself didn’t write anything, as he was suspicious of writing in general. Everything we know about him comes from the accounts, and through the filters, of others, foremost his students Plato and Xenophon.

Well, guess what. There is nothing in that Socratic corpus that resembles the tale about the three sieves. Socrates is indeed reported to have taken part in numerous public debates, but none of them mentions those three criteria knowledge has to be filtered through. There is a reason why the tale is never accompanied by any verifiable citation — that’s always a big alarm bell.

A simply Google search reveals that the tale has been around at least since the 1870s. Then it wasn’t attributed to Socrates, though. Here is, for example, how the Children’s New Church Magazine of 1872, p. 82 recounts it:

Perhaps the story goes even further back than that, but at any rate, we can safely assume it was attributed to Socrates at a later time. Stylistically and content-wise, it does look like a moralistic tale for the religious upbringing of children, not a story from a philosophical work. In fact, I’d say it’s not even good — more like childishly simplistic, trite and not really thought-provoking.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/eurso8w9dzq3f6ph', 'title': 'Did Socrates really tell a tale called “The Three Sieves” or is that just some interesting hyperbole?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'No, he didn’t.\n\nFor those who are not acquainted with the matter, an online story has it that the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates was once approached by someone who wanted to share a piece of vicious gossip.

Benjamin Murphy,4y,What do analytic philosophers generally think about Hegel?,"When I was an undergraduate in Oxford, an interest in continental philosophy was viewed with suspicion. I told my tutor at Pembroke that I wanted to study Heidegger and Nietzsche. He found a tutor to teach me that paper, but evidently regarded this as an eccentric choice on my part. I did make some attempt to understand Hegel in my own time. Reading Hegel’s works was no help, so I tried Walter Kauffman’s Hegel: A Reinterpretation, hoping that this would provide me with enough understanding to read Hegel’s works for myself. It didn’t. Kauffman was great at telling me what Hegel didn’t mean, but not what he did say. After that, to be honest, I gave up. After all, I’d made a serious attempt to get to grips with two important continental philosophers. It was obvious that a knowledge of Hegel was considered optional by analytical philosophers. And the intense study of analytical philosophy turned out to be very rewarding.

But that same tutor who mocked my interest in Heidegger and Nietzsche also required us to read work by McDowell and Sellars. I came to realize that McDowell and Sellars were both strongly influenced by Hegel - both of them mention this. A couple of years after finishing my D.Phil. I attended a conference in Cape Town where the main speaker was John McDowell, and that’s when I realized the importance of studying the work of Robert Brandom. (Sellars, McDowell and Brandom are frequently described as the “Pittsburgh School”). Brandom’s work was obviously directly relevant to what I was doing. Making It Explicit is an important contribution to analytical philosophy, one that I should really have read much earlier. Brandom, like Sellars and McDowell, pays tribute to the influence of Hegel.

These tributes to Hegel told me that Hegel must have said something important, but didn’t tell me exactly what. (McDowell basically says “If you’ve read Hegel, you’ll see how strongly I’m influenced by him at every point.” Fine. But if I’ve not read Hegel, that isn’t much help).

So when Robert Brandom published A Spirit of Trust in May 2019, I was naturally very excited. For forty years, Brandom has been teaching a class on Hegel’s Phenomenology of the Spirit at Pittsburgh. Now, at last, there’s an opportunity to find out why Sellars, McDowell and Brandom found Hegel to be so inspirational.

So, I purchased A Spirit of Trust. It was completely engrossing. Forget about Fire and Blood, for me, 2019 is the year of A Spirit of Trust. Brandom reveals that analytical philosophers have been following slowly in Hegel’s footsteps all along.

I still find Hegel’s prose obscure, and of course I’m not in a position to say that Brandom gives the correct interpretation of Hegel. But I think he establishes that it is worthy trying to find out what Hegel is saying - not just because I want to fill in a gap in my historical knowledge, but because I can see why it is worthwhile learning to think like Hegel (but not to write like Hegel).

I don’t think I’m alone in this. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that in twenty years time, we’ll be saying “2019 is the year when analytical philosophers in general began to think very hard about Hegel. Brandom was not the first analytical philosopher to write about Hegel, but it was his groundbreaking book that made Hegel impossible to ignore.”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dn3yqurka98vwxfo', 'title': 'What do analytic philosophers generally think about Hegel?', 'score': {'original': 0.4927, 'ai': 0.5073}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'When I was an undergraduate in Oxford, an interest in continental philosophy was viewed with suspicion.

Ian O'Grady,Nov 30,Who is your favourite ancient philosopher and why?,"Diogenes was a true representation of “Cynicism.” A man who felt no need for material things, and always found ways to simplify his life, His only possession being a wooden bowl that he discarded after he witnessed a peasant boy use his hands to drink water from a puddle.

When Diogenes was caught playing with himself in public, he said: “He only wished it was as easy to get rid of hunger by rubbing his stomach.

When he was exiled for defacing coins in his home town of Sinope, a coastal town in modern-day Turkey, he turned to his peers and told them: “I sentence you to remain in your city.”

While Diogenes was exiled to Athens, a member of the upper-class began throwing stones at him and called him a dog. In true cynical fashion, he pissed on the man’s leg, and when the upper-class man got angry he responded: “If I were a dog, why are you surprised?”

When Diogenes was asked why he was begging a statue for money, he said: “It’s to gain practice in rejection.”

When Plato defined humans as the only featherless biped, Diogenes walked into Plato’s lecture with a plucked chicken and declared: “ Behold, a man.”

When he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery, the auctioneer asked what jobs he was good at, and his response was: “Being a master.”

When Alexander the Great went to meet the cynic, he approached and asked him if there was anything he could do for him, to which he replied: “Yes, can you stand out of my sunlight?” Alexander was so impressed by the philosopher he told his friends: “If I were not Alexander, I’d want to be him.”

Benjamin Murphy,3y,What separates great philosophers like Descartes from wannabe “philosophers”? What makes them great and is there a modern day equivalent to a philosophy superstar?,"There are two kinds of philosophical superstar today. There are those who have won a large popular audience by presenting ideas that resonate with many people in a way that the public can understand - Sam Harris, for example. There are those whose work has been influential within the academy, who are sought after to speak at academic conferences, and who would be offered a job in any department in the world - Bob Hale would be an example. There are some figures who have managed to be academic superstars and also shown that they are capable of reaching a broader audience - Bertrand Russell is the most obvious example, one might also add Daniel Dennett and Jerry Fodor.

But will any of these be remembered centuries from now in the way that Descartes is? That’s hard to say.

People today study Descartes not because of what he got right, but because of what he got wrong. He’s seen as an important philosopher to understand because of the mistakes he made. That’s not quite a universal opinion, as I well know - my graduate work was supervised by one of the few defenders of Cartesian dualism - but the number of philosophers who agree with Descartes are tiny when compared with the number who read (at least some of) his works, teach classes about him and write books about him.

Descartes is a significant figure because he was an active participant in the modern scientific revolution, and he attempted to formulate explicitly the method that had opened up new intellectual horizons. He attempted to do so in a way that, he hoped, would require no knowledge of previous philosophy, starting off from a clean sheet. Subsequent philosophers (for example Leibniz, Locke and Spinoza) who wanted to delineate the limits of human knowledge could do so by reacting to Descartes, pointing out his errors and contrasting their ideas to his. This means that if you are trying to introduce students to early modern philosophy, Descartes’ works are a great place to begin. You can read The Meditations in a day, and while you would be unlikely to come away with a complete understanding, the chances are that you’d have a pretty good grasp of the main ideas. A. J. Ayer said of his own early work, Language, Truth and Logic, that its success was not entirely due to its virtues. Indeed, its huge success may be due in part to its flaws: when he wrote it, Ayer really believed that a few simple ideas could solve all the problems of philosophy. It wasn’t Ayer’s best book, it wasn’t original, and it isn’t the best presentation of the case for logical positivism, yet it did become a classic. It turned out to be the right book in the right time.

Now, I know what I have to do if I aspire to be a star in the way that Bob Hale is a star: immerse myself in technical philosophy, apply myself to interesting and unresolved problems, approach them rigorously and work out a theory in detail. I know what I have to do if I want to be a star in the way that Sam Harris is a star: take on a problem that the general public is really concerned with, don’t be afraid of controversy, express myself clearly without resorting to technical jargon. I’m not saying I would succeed, but I would know how to try.

But if I were to try to achieve the kind of success of Descartes’ Meditations, or, in a lesser way, of Language, Truth and Logic, I wouldn’t know where to begin. I’d have to be lucky in my choice of subject matter, become an expert in a field that would remain relevant for a long time, and I’d have to make mistakes that would turn out to be interesting mistakes. How do you try to be lucky?

I’m not a mathematician, but I have read Simon Singh’s excellent book about Fermat’s Last Theorem, in which he describes the important partnership between Shimura and Taniyama. After Taniyama’s tragic suicide, Shimura said of him:

He was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to imitate him.

Eleftherios Tserkezis,4y,Who is the coolest philosopher in world history and why?,"Diogenes of Sinope, also known as Diogenes the Dog or Diogenes the Cynic (Gr. kunikos ‘doglike’).

Diogenes was born ca. 412 BC and died in 323 BC. He was born in the Greek city of Sinope on the south coasts of the Black Sea, but spent most of his life in mainland Greece (Athens and Corinth). Diogenes is considered one of the first and major Cynic philosophers. His philosophy revolved around the values of simplicity, frugality, natural life, contempt of authority and criticism of organized societies and lofty idealism like that of Plato.

But what makes Diogenes really cool is his personal life and attitude, as recorded by Diogenes Laërtius and other writers (his own works have all been lost). Acting in accordance with his ideas, Diogenes lived in a jar(!) and in the stories about him he comes up as provocative, ironic, witty, glib and sharp-tongued, a real thorn in the side of the smug and the powerful. For that and his other character traits, Plato called Diogenes “Socrates gone mad.” Some of the most cool and funny anecdotes about him are the following; they’re taken verbatim from Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius.

Diogenes and Alexander the Great

And now a general assembly of the Greeks was held at the Isthmus, where a vote was passed to make an expedition against Persia with Alexander, and he was proclaimed their leader. Thereupon many statesmen and philosophers came to him with their congratulations, and he expected that Diogenes of Sinope also, who was tarrying in Corinth, would do likewise.

But since that philosopher took not the slightest notice of Alexander, and continued to enjoy his leisure in the suburb Craneion, Alexander went in person to see him; and he found him lying in the sun. Diogenes raised himself up a little when he saw so many persons coming towards him, and fixed his eyes upon Alexander. And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, “Yes,” said Diogenes, “stand a little out of my sun.”

It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, “But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.”

Diogenes and Plato

Plato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, “Here is Plato’s man.”

Diogenes and his lamp

He lit a lamp in broad daylight and said, as he went about, “I am looking for a man.”

Diogenes as a slave

Further, when he was sold as a slave, he endured it most nobly. For on a voyage to Aegina he was captured by pirates under the command of Scirpalus, conveyed to Crete and exposed for sale. When the auctioneer asked in what he was proficient, he replied, “In ruling men.” Thereupon he pointed to a certain Corinthian with a fine purple border to his robe, the man named Xeniades above-mentioned, and said, “Sell me to this man; he needs a master.” Thus Xeniades came to buy him, and took him to Corinth and set him over his own children and entrusted his whole household to him. And he administered it in all respects in such a manner that Xeniades used to go about saying, “A good genius has entered my house.”

[…]

To Xeniades, who purchased him, he said, “Come, see that you obey orders.”

Diogenes and Perdiccas

Perdiccas having threatened to put him to death unless he came to him, “That’s nothing wonderful,” quoth he, “for a beetle or a tarantula would do the same.”

Diogenes and his countrymen

When some one reproached him with his exile, his reply was, “Nay, it was through that, you miserable fellow, that I came to be a philosopher.” Again, when some one reminded him that the people of Sinope had sentenced him to exile, “And I them,” said he, “to home-staying.”

George Etteridge,Updated 1y,How can you teach me the whole history of the world in a precise summary?,"Here is the history of the world.

In the beginning, there was nothing. Literally nothing. This was presumably rather boring and so the Big Bang happened, flinging stuff in all directions. Nobody is sure why this occurred. A few billion years later, there was an enormous cloud of dust and gas which began to spin, pulling it together and forming planets (and the sun). One of these planets was earth. Fairly early on it got run into by another planet roughly the same size (which presumably wasn’t looking where it was going) and the collision flung debris out into space. This debris began to spin around the earth and formed another, smaller body orbiting it.

Because there were a lot more meteorites back then, they hit the earth with alarming regularity and brought water, which because the earth had cooled down by then remained as water and didn’t just evaporate.

And then, 3.8 billion years ago, life began. Nobody knows how or why, but the first lifeforms on planet earth were single celled organisms called prokaryotes, which reproduced by splitting into two. It took another billion years for the first lifeforms to have more than one cell at a time. From then on, life expanded to fill out various niches in the environment.

There was the Paleozoic Era, where the first lifeforms to really leave a trace appeared. Life spread onto the land, and at one point in the Carboniferous period there were massive insects running and flying around as a result of the greater quantity of oxygen in the air. That was ended by a mass extinction event that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth, then came the Mesozoic Era, which saw the rise and fall of the dinosaurs and the appearance of the first mammals and birds.

Then the dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteorite and the Mammals rose to prominance in the Cenozoic era. One of these groups of mammals was the apes, and one particular subgroup of these was the hominids. Hominids evolved into various species of humans, such as Homo Habilis, Homo Erectus, Homo Neanderthalis and finally Homo Sapiens Sapiens (that’s us). Homo Sapiens Sapiens as we know us today first appeared around 250,000 years ago in Africa, where they stayed for another 200,000 years before migrating out to other continents.

They replaced the Neanderthals who had gone before them but it was a slow process; Humans only reached New Zealand 700 years ago. At first, these humans were hunter-gatherers, but people discovered that growing their own food was better than foraging for it and so could stay in one place, typically along a river.

The first cities, and then the first civilisations began to spring up, in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, China, Egypt and Mesoamerica. Mesoamerica, while complex socially, failed to keep up with the rest of the world technologically.

Eventually, a thriving trade network had sprung up around the Mediterranean, with Ancient Egypt, the Hittites, Assyria and the early Greeks all taking part. This however collapsed with incredible speed in about 1200 BC and nobody knows why.

Greece developed into a collection of city-states, including Athens, Sparta and Corinth. During the “Axial Age” many Greek philosophers introduced radical new ideas, though this was hardly limited to Greece; both India and China saw new religions and new philosophies during this period.

Then came the rise of Achamaenid Persia: Cyrus the Great and his descendants conquered possibly the largest empire ever up to that point. They were fairly hands off rulers, preferring to rely on local rulers called Satraps and letting their conquered people keep their own gods. They attempted to invade Greece, succeeded in invading Egypt (twice) before they were conquered by Alexander the Great, a Greek Macedonian King who then tried to invade India (though opinions are divided as to whether he was defeated in battle or simply overextended).

Meanwhile, the first Chinese Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, succeeded in unifying China for the first time, and in India a man named Chandragupta Maurya established the Mauryan Empire, which unified most of India.

Meanwhile, in Italy, a small town called Rome had been growing in power. It was first a Kingship, but the Kings were gits and were deposed in favour of a Republic. Their main competitor was a North African city-state called Carthage, which had been founded by Phoenicians, who were a seafaring and trading people.

Conflict of interest led to war, and the Romans ultimately won, even going so far as to raze Carthage to the ground. With Carthage out of the way they then invaded Gaul, tried to invade a small island they called Britannia, became an Empire under Augustus Caesar, took over Egypt after the last pharoah chose the wrong side in a Roman civil war, and proceeded to expand.

A new religion was also founded at around this time; it was originally regarded as a minor cult and its members were even actively oppressed at times, but eventually Christianity ended up becoming the dominant religion of the Roman Empire.

At the same time as Rome was at its peak, in China the very powerful Han dynasty. The two vaguely knew of one another, and at one point there was even a vague plan by one to ask the other to gang up on Parthia (a successor to the Achamaenid Empire wedged between them) though this never came to fruition. When the Han dynasty fell, China fractured into three, the famous Three Kingdoms of Wei, Han and Wu. Wei won but their dynasty did not last before their Emperor was forced to abdicate and the Jin dynasty took over.

Ultimately, the Roman Empire grew too big to sustain; it split into two, with the Western half governed from Rome and the Eastern half from the city of Constantinople.

The Western Romans fell shortly afterwards, but the East persisted. They were however locked into a bitter struggle with yet another Persian Empire, this time the Sassanid dynasty. This left them both open to attack from a third force, followers of another new religion called Islam. They pushed back the Byzantines and entirely destroyed the Sassanids. The Muslims then extended their reach across North Africa and even into Europe, conquering most of Iberia. The Christians would not kick them out again fully until 1492. Once they were established, the Muslim caliphates were famous for their scientific and cultural advancements.

In Europe, the Holy Roman Empire was established when the Pope crowned Charlemagne Roman Emperor. Charlemagne ruled a large empire encompassing most of modern France, Germany and modern Italy, but it did not last because succession laws required it be divided up amongst his grandsons (his son Louis the Pious still ruled the Carolingian Empire in its entirety). However, Europe was having Viking problems; they were Scandinavians who conducted highly successful raids; In England they managed to conquer and rule the country for a short period, while in France they occupied a part of Northern France called Normandy. They also raided as far as Rome itself, but they weren’t just raiders. They were also explorers, some of whom managed to cross the Atlantic and discover what would become America, and traders.

In 1066, the Normans successfully invaded England, which was by now back under Anglo-Saxon rule.

A few years later, responding to a plea for help from the Byzantines, the Pope called the First Crusade, the first attempt by Christian Europe to reconquer “the Holy Land” (basically modern Israel) from the Islamic Caliphates who ruled them. While they did manage to take cities in the Holy Land such as Jerusalem and Acre in the region, the Muslims eventually retook them each time and the Crusaders ended up doing more damage to the Byzantines. They even sacked Constantinople itself in 1204, a catastrophe from which the Byzantines never recovered.

In the East, on the Asian steppe, the previously disparate nomadic Mongol tribes were united by a man named Temujin, who then went on a rampage throughout Asia as Genghis Khan. He was lenient as long as his enemies surrendered on sight, but if not he came down on them like a tonne of bricks. He and his successors eventually ended up ruling the largest continuous land Empire the world has ever seen, stretching from China where they established their own Yuan dynasty in the East to Europe, where they fought Poland and Hungary, in the west. As a side effect, they also united and made safe the silk road, which allowed trade and European travellers such as Marco Polo down it. Polo travelled to China, met Kublai Khan, and returned, only to be part of a Venetian fleet that got defeated in battle by the Genoese and imprisoned. He met someone who wrote his stories down while there.

In Africa, lucrative trade routes across the Sahara desert were controlled by the Mali Empire. One of their kings sailed off into the sunset to go exploring and was never seen again, and his successor, Mansa Musa, was the richest man to have ever lived. So rich was he that on his hajj to Mecca he passed through Egypt and crashed its economy with sheer generosity.

However, while the unification of the silk road made if safer for trade and travel, it also made it easier for other things to travel. In around 1331, in the midst of a famine, a deadly disease hit China. From there, it travelled down the silk road to the Middle East, and from there on ships to Europe. The results were devastating. A massive proportion of the population was wiped out.

Meanwhile, a new regional power was rising in the Middle East; The Ottoman Empire, named after their founder Osman I. Despite an early defeat to the Timurid Empire, they rose again and conquered much of the middle east and the Balkans, sandwiching the remains of the Byzantine Empire (which was by now pretty much just the city of Constantinople itself) between its territories. Eventually, in 1453, the Ottomans successfully lay siege to and stormed Constantinople, ending the Roman Empire after about 1,500 years.

A few decades later, in 1492, Spain succeeded in defeating the last Muslim stronghold in Iberia, ending the Reconquista. In the same year, a Genoese explorer in their pay set out to find a faster trade route to the far east, but miscalculated the size of the earth and got the wrong continent. Christopher Columbus never knew that he had got the wrong place though. He claimed it for Spain and began oppressing the locals so badly that he was recalled.

This started the European age of imperialism; to begin with the dominant powers were Spain and Portugal, who divided the world between them with the Treaty of Tordesillas, negotiated with the Pope. Spain defeated the powerful Aztec and Inca empires and ended up ruling vast territories in the new world, while Portugal preferred to just take cities on the coast and trade with the locals. Spain was made more powerful by the fact they were ruled by a Hapsburg, the same Hapsburg, Charles V, who also ruled the Holy Roman Empire. Charles eventually decided that the job of ruling two empires was too much for any one man to bear and abdicated from both thrones, leaving them to two different people. The Spanish also lost the Spanish Netherlands to rebellion, though this Rebellion lasted 80 years.

In Germany, in response to what they saw as corrupt church practices, new forms of christianity sprang up which were under the collective banner of “Protestantism” though there were different types of protestantism like Calvinism or Lutheranism. The Catholics did not take this lying down and it initiated several decades of religious conflict in Europe, culminating in the 30 years war.

By this time, new colonial powers were rising; The Dutch, having broken free from Spanish rule, were establishing a trading empire across the world much as the Portuguese had done, and the English and French were also beginning to colonize. They were all in need of manpower to work the various plantations they had, which supplied luxuries such as sugar which were very much in demand in Europe. As a result, they tapped in to existing African slave networks, with African Kings trading slaves for European weapons and other European goods. The slaves were then taken in slave ships to the colonies and put to work doing whatever their master wanted.

In India too, new powers were rising; the Muslim Mughals rose to power in the 16th century, an offshoot of the Timurids, and by 1700 had risen to control all the Indian subcontinent. The Europeans were beginning to encroach there too though.

In Japan, central authority entirely broke down, leading to a period known as the Sengoku Jidai as warring clans vied for power. Ultimately, they unified, tried and failed to invade Korea, and then shut their borders in response to increased European influence causing unrest.

By the 1700s, Europe well and truly dominated the world, but no one European power had the edge over its competitors. A new type of thinking, known as the Enlightenment, also rose in this period. Enlightenment thinkers advocated ideas such as social, economic and governmental reforms. England, which unified with Scotland to become the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, ostensibly won when it won the Seven Years’ War in 1759, but swiftly had its enthusiasm well and truly curbed by the American Revolution. The French, who had assisted the Americans to get back at the British, had a revolution of their own in 1789, which descended into terror tactics before order was restored and the more radical revolutionaries reined in. The French Revolutionary armies defeated those of the European monarchies sent to crush their ideas, with the help of a brilliant Corsican general called Napoleon Bonaparte. Bonaparte then became essentially a dictator, and then in 1804, Emperor. He initially did very well, taking on and beating multiple Allied coalitions sent to stop him, but was ultimately defeated and in 1815 was sent to live in exile on the British Island of Saint Helena, where he died a few years later.

At around the same time, helped by the weakness of Spain and Portugal, both of whom had been invaded by Napoleon, their South American colonies began to break free, led among others by the famous Simon Bolivar, the Liberator. Brazil, meanwhile initially had a member of the Portuguese Royal Family as its Emperor, Pedro I. After he abdicated to go back to Portugal he was replaced by his son Pedro II, who had a long and by all accounts successful reign, which only ended when he was deposed in 1889.

After the loss of the 13 Colonies, Britain had turned its attention to other parts of the world; India was initially under the control of the British East India Company, but the main British government stepped in and took over after it bodged the Indian Mutiny. They also began colonising Australia, though the Dutch had actually discovered it.

The late 18th century saw a rising tide of abolitionist sentiment, though most countries did not act on it until the 19th century. One by one, countries began abolishing the practice; Britain even went as far as setting up a dedicated naval task force to hunt down slavers and free their slaves. Not everyone wanted slavery gone though. Britain only got their colonial slavers to free their slaves by paying them off, while the USA went through a civil war over it.

Industrialisation began, first in Britain and then spreading to the rest of the world. More and more people moved to cities to work in factories, and better agricultural practices meant that more people could be fed.

The Chinese, by now ruled by the Qing dynasty, were repeatedly humiliated by the European powers during the 19th century. They had rejected a British trade deal in the 1790s, so the British began trading opium instead. This led to two disastrous wars against Britain, and France joined in the second time too. In between that they also had time for the Taiping rebellion, in which at least 20 million people died. Many other Europeans also leased Treaty ports from China.

Japan was forced open by the United States, and they swiftly recognised that they had to industrialise and keep up with the West. So they did, with remarkable speed, and they also adopted western-style imperialism. They occupied Korea, and then fought a war against China.

The Europeans also began going deeper into the heart of Africa; previously they had had no real motive to and no way of doing it anyway, but now among other things the invention of the steamship allowed them to enter. The result was the Scramble for Africa, in which the vast majority of territory in Africa was swallowed by European powers.

There were two new European powers too; both Germany and Italy unified at roughly the same time and both wanted Empires. Germany took among others modern-day Namibia and Togo, and Italy lost to Ethiopia before successfully wrenching Libya away from Ottoman rule. This prompted the Balkan wars, further limiting Ottoman power.

Ultimately, rising tensions led to World War One; the German Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire were all extinguished, replaced by the Weimar Republic, Turkey, various small Central European nations, and the USSR respectively.

The Weimar Republic slid into right-wing extremism, as did Italy, and Japan fell out with the western powers such as Britain after Britain ended a treaty with them for fear of ending up at war with the USA. The Nazis took power in Germany and Mussolini in Italy, leading to World War Two, which left vast swathes of the world devastated and included Germany attempting to commit genocide on various ethnic groups that they didn’t like, most notably the Jews but also the Roma and others. Japan was also very brutal in China and to their allied PoWs.

They failed, fortunately, because they lost the war, and as a result calls for a Jewish homeland grew louder and louder; they got one in 1948 with the creation of the State of Israel, who immediately was attacked by all its neighbours and won.

Many European empires began to collapse after the war, some more willingly than others; India, though partitioned into India and Pakistan, became independent in 1947, followed by most of the rest of the British Empire shortly afterwards (and relatively peacefully too) though some countries such as Algeria, Vietnam (then French Indochina) and the Portuguese colonies had to fight for it.

All this was also played out in the context of the Cold War; though allies in World War Two, the USA and the USSR had entirely incompatible economic systems. However, they also both had nuclear weapons, and it would be a very bad day for humanity if they were ever used. They came close a few times but preferred to fight proxy wars. Korea, Vietnam and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan being the most notable. The USA also made sure to prop up anti-communist regimes in South and Central America- even if they were incredibly brutal. Examples include Augusto Pinochet of Chile and the Military Junta in Argentina. The Military Junta did though start a war with Britain in 1982, lose and get deposed as a result the following year.

The Communists didn’t have it their own way though; The Communists won the Chinese civil war, pushing the nationalists to the island of Taiwan, but the two communist regimes had a falling out such that when Communist Vietnam invaded Communist Cambodia (Cambodia started it and were ruled by Pol Pot who was in dire need of deposition) they backed opposite sides. Ultimately, China became slightly more capitalist and reconciled with the USA, while the USSR collapsed in 1991.

Germany was reunified, the members of the Eastern Bloc became independent, and the USA was considered to have won the Cold War. However, ten years later, as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, they and their allies went into Iraq and Afghanistan, causing chaos in those regions. In 2022, a revanchist Russia attacked Ukraine, wildly overestimating their own effectiveness and popularity in the process and condemning themselves to a slow grinding war of attrition.

And that brings us pretty much up to date.

At first, these humans were hunter-gatherers, but people discovered that growing their own food was better than foraging for it and so could stay in one place, typically along a river.\n\nThe first cities, and then the first civilisations began to spring up, in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, China, Egypt and Mesoamerica. Mesoamerica, while complex socially, failed to keep up with the rest of the world technologically.\n\nEventually, a thriving trade network had sprung up around the Mediterranean, with Ancient Egypt, the Hittites, Assyria and the early Greeks all taking part. This however collapsed with incredible speed in about 1200 BC and nobody knows why.\n\nGreece developed into', 'result': {'fake': 0.0327, 'real': 0.9673}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'a collection of city-states, including Athens, Sparta and Corinth. During the “Axial Age” many Greek philosophers introduced radical new ideas, though this was hardly limited to Greece; both India and China saw new religions and new philosophies during this period.\n\nThen came the rise of Achamaenid Persia: Cyrus the Great and his descendants conquered possibly the largest empire ever up to that point. They were fairly hands off rulers, preferring to rely on local rulers called Satraps and letting their conquered people keep their own gods. They attempted to invade Greece, succeeded in invading Egypt (twice) before they were conquered by Alexander the Great, a Greek Macedonian King who then tried to invade India (though opinions are divided as to whether he was defeated in battle or simply overextended).\n\nMeanwhile, the first Chinese Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, succeeded in unifying China for the first time, and in India a man named Chandragupta Maurya established the Mauryan Empire, which unified most of India.\n\nMeanwhile, in Italy, a small town called Rome had been growing in power. It was first a Kingship, but the Kings were gits and were deposed in favour of a Republic. Their main competitor was a North African city-state called Carthage, which had been founded by Phoenicians, who were a seafaring and trading people.\n\nConflict of interest led to war, and the Romans ultimately won, even going so far as to raze Carthage to the ground. With Carthage out of the way they then invaded Gaul, tried to invade a small island they called Britannia, became an Empire under Augustus Caesar, took over Egypt after the last pharoah chose the wrong side in a Roman civil war, and proceeded to expand.\n\nA new religion was also founded at around this time; it was originally regarded as a minor cult and its members were even actively oppressed at times, but eventually Christianity ended up becoming the dominant religion of the Roman Empire.\n\nAt the same time as Rome was at its peak, in China the very powerful Han dynasty. The two vaguely knew of one another, and at one point there was even a vague plan by one to ask the other to gang up on Parthia (a successor to the Achamaenid Empire wedged between them) though this never came to fruition. When the Han dynasty fell, China fractured into three, the famous Three Kingdoms of Wei, Han and Wu. Wei won but their dynasty did not last before their Emperor was forced to abdicate and the Jin dynasty took over.\n\nUltimately, the Roman Empire grew too big to sustain; it split into two, with the Western half governed from Rome and the Eastern half from the city of Constantinople.\n\nThe Western Romans fell shortly afterwards, but the East persisted. They were however locked into a bitter struggle with yet another Persian Empire, this time the Sassanid dynasty. This left them both open to attack from a third force, followers of another new religion called Islam. They pushed back the Byzantines and entirely destroyed the Sassanids. The Muslims then extended their reach across North Africa and even into Europe,', 'result': {'fake': 0.8385, 'real': 0.1615}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'conquering most of Iberia. The Christians would not kick them out again fully until 1492. Once they were established, the Muslim caliphates were famous for their scientific and cultural advancements.\n\nIn Europe, the Holy Roman Empire was established when the Pope crowned Charlemagne Roman Emperor. Charlemagne ruled a large empire encompassing most of modern France, Germany and modern Italy, but it did not last because succession laws required it be divided up amongst his grandsons (his son Louis the Pious still ruled the Carolingian Empire in its entirety). However, Europe was having Viking problems; they were Scandinavians who conducted highly successful raids; In England they managed to conquer and rule the country for a short period, while in France they occupied a part of Northern France called Normandy. They also raided as far as Rome itself, but they weren’t just raiders. They were also explorers, some of whom managed to cross the Atlantic and discover what would become America, and traders.\n\nIn 1066, the Normans successfully invaded England, which was by now back under Anglo-Saxon rule.\n\nA few years later, responding to a plea for help from the Byzantines, the Pope called the First Crusade, the first attempt by Christian Europe to reconquer “the Holy Land” (basically modern Israel) from the Islamic Caliphates who ruled them. While they did manage to take cities in the Holy Land such as Jerusalem and Acre in the region, the Muslims eventually retook them each time and the Crusaders ended up doing more damage to the Byzantines. They even sacked Constantinople itself in 1204, a catastrophe from which the Byzantines never recovered.\n\nIn the East, on the Asian steppe, the previously disparate nomadic Mongol tribes were united by a man named Temujin, who then went on a rampage throughout Asia as Genghis Khan. He was lenient as long as his enemies surrendered on sight, but if not he came down on them like a tonne of bricks. He and his successors eventually ended up ruling the largest continuous land Empire the world has ever seen, stretching from China where they established their own Yuan dynasty in the East to Europe, where they fought Poland and Hungary, in the west. As a side effect, they also united and made safe the silk road, which allowed trade and European travellers such as Marco Polo down it. Polo travelled to China, met Kublai Khan, and returned, only to be part of a Venetian fleet that got defeated in battle by the Genoese and imprisoned. He met someone who wrote his stories down while there.\n\nIn Africa, lucrative trade routes across the Sahara desert were controlled by the Mali Empire. One of their kings sailed off into the sunset to go exploring and was never seen again, and his successor, Mansa Musa, was the richest man to have ever lived. So rich was he that on his hajj to Mecca he passed through Egypt and crashed its economy with sheer generosity.\n\nHowever, while the unification of the silk road made if safer for trade and travel, it also made it easier for other things to travel.', 'result': {'fake': 0.9995, 'real': 0.0005}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'In around 1331, in the midst of a famine, a deadly disease hit China.

A massive proportion of the population was wiped out.\n\nMeanwhile, a new regional power was rising in the Middle East; The Ottoman Empire, named after their founder Osman I. Despite an early defeat to the Timurid Empire, they rose again and conquered much of the middle east and the Balkans, sandwiching the remains of the Byzantine Empire (which was by now pretty much just the city of Constantinople itself) between its territories. Eventually, in 1453, the Ottomans successfully lay siege to and stormed Constantinople, ending the Roman Empire after about 1,500 years.\n\nA few decades later, in 1492, Spain succeeded in defeating the last Muslim stronghold in Iberia, ending the Reconquista. In the same year, a Genoese explorer in their pay set out to find a faster trade route to the far east, but miscalculated the size of the earth and got the wrong continent. Christopher Columbus never knew that he had got the wrong place though. He claimed it for Spain and began oppressing the locals so badly that he was recalled.\n\nThis started the European age of imperialism; to begin with the dominant powers were Spain and Portugal, who divided the world between them with the Treaty of Tordesillas, negotiated with the Pope. Spain defeated the powerful Aztec and Inca empires and ended up ruling vast territories in the new world, while Portugal preferred to just take cities on the coast and trade with the locals. Spain was made more powerful by the fact they were ruled by a Hapsburg, the same Hapsburg, Charles V, who also ruled the Holy Roman Empire. Charles eventually decided that the job of ruling two empires was too much for any one man to bear and abdicated from both thrones, leaving them to two different people. The Spanish also lost the Spanish Netherlands to rebellion, though this Rebellion lasted 80 years.\n\nIn Germany, in response to what they saw as corrupt church practices, new forms of christianity sprang up which were under the collective banner of “Protestantism” though there were different types of protestantism like Calvinism or Lutheranism. The Catholics did not take this lying down and it initiated several decades of religious conflict in Europe, culminating in the 30 years war.\n\nBy this time, new colonial powers were rising; The Dutch, having broken free from Spanish rule, were establishing a trading empire across the world much as the Portuguese had done, and the English and French were also beginning to colonize. They were all in need of manpower to work the various plantations they had, which supplied luxuries such as sugar which were very much in demand in Europe.

The Europeans were beginning to encroach there too though.\n\nIn Japan, central authority entirely broke down, leading to a period known as the Sengoku Jidai as warring clans vied for power. Ultimately, they unified, tried and failed to invade Korea, and then shut their borders in response to increased European influence causing unrest.\n\nBy the 1700s, Europe well and truly dominated the world, but no one European power had the edge over its competitors. A new type of thinking, known as the Enlightenment, also rose in this period. Enlightenment thinkers advocated ideas such as social, economic and governmental reforms. England, which unified with Scotland to become the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, ostensibly won when it won the Seven Years’ War in 1759, but swiftly had its enthusiasm well and truly curbed by the American Revolution. The French, who had assisted the Americans to get back at the British, had a revolution of their own in 1789, which descended into terror tactics before order was restored and the more radical revolutionaries reined in. The French Revolutionary armies defeated those of the European monarchies sent to crush their ideas, with the help of a brilliant Corsican general called Napoleon Bonaparte. Bonaparte then became essentially a dictator, and then in 1804, Emperor. He initially did very well, taking on and beating multiple Allied coalitions sent to stop him, but was ultimately defeated and in 1815 was sent to live in exile on the British Island of Saint Helena, where he died a few years later.\n\nAt around the same time, helped by the weakness of Spain and Portugal, both of whom had been invaded by Napoleon, their South American colonies began to break free, led among others by the famous Simon Bolivar, the Liberator. Brazil, meanwhile initially had a member of the Portuguese Royal Family as its Emperor, Pedro I. After he abdicated to go back to Portugal he was replaced by his son Pedro II, who had a long and by all accounts successful reign, which only ended when he was deposed in 1889.\n\nAfter the loss of the 13 Colonies, Britain had turned its attention to other parts of the world; India was initially under the control of the British East India Company, but the main British government stepped in and took over after it bodged the Indian Mutiny. They also began colonising Australia, though the Dutch had actually discovered it.\n\nThe late 18th century saw a rising tide of abolitionist sentiment, though most countries did not act on it until the 19th century. One by one, countries began abolishing the practice; Britain even went as far as setting up a dedicated naval task force to hunt down slavers and free their slaves. Not everyone wanted slavery gone though. Britain only got their colonial slavers to free their slaves by paying them off, while the USA went through a civil war over it.\n\nIndustrialisation', 'result': {'fake': 0.977, 'real': 0.023}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'began, first in Britain and then spreading to the rest of the world. More and more people moved to cities to work in factories, and better agricultural practices meant that more people could be fed.\n\nThe Chinese, by now ruled by the Qing dynasty, were repeatedly humiliated by the European powers during the 19th century. They had rejected a British trade deal in the 1790s, so the British began trading opium instead. This led to two disastrous wars against Britain, and France joined in the second time too. In between that they also had time for the Taiping rebellion, in which at least 20 million people died. Many other Europeans also leased Treaty ports from China.\n\nJapan was forced open by the United States, and they swiftly recognised that they had to industrialise and keep up with the West. So they did, with remarkable speed, and they also adopted western-style imperialism. They occupied Korea, and then fought a war against China.\n\nThe Europeans also began going deeper into the heart of Africa; previously they had had no real motive to and no way of doing it anyway, but now among other things the invention of the steamship allowed them to enter. The result was the Scramble for Africa, in which the vast majority of territory in Africa was swallowed by European powers.\n\nThere were two new European powers too; both Germany and Italy unified at roughly the same time and both wanted Empires. Germany took among others modern-day Namibia and Togo, and Italy lost to Ethiopia before successfully wrenching Libya away from Ottoman rule. This prompted the Balkan wars, further limiting Ottoman power.\n\nUltimately, rising tensions led to World War One; the German Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire were all extinguished, replaced by the Weimar Republic, Turkey, various small Central European nations, and the USSR respectively.\n\nThe Weimar Republic slid into right-wing extremism, as did Italy, and Japan fell out with the western powers such as Britain after Britain ended a treaty with them for fear of ending up at war with the USA. The Nazis took power in Germany and Mussolini in Italy, leading to World War Two, which left vast swathes of the world devastated and included Germany attempting to commit genocide on various ethnic groups that they didn’t like, most notably the Jews but also the Roma and others. Japan was also very brutal in China and to their allied PoWs.\n\nThey failed, fortunately, because they lost the war, and as a result calls for a Jewish homeland grew louder and louder; they got one in 1948 with the creation of the State of Israel, who immediately was attacked by all its neighbours and won.\n\nMany European empires began to collapse after the war, some more willingly than others; India, though partitioned into India and Pakistan, became independent in 1947, followed by most of the rest of the British Empire shortly afterwards (and relatively peacefully too) though some countries such as Algeria, Vietnam (then French Indochina) and the Portuguese colonies had to fight for it.\n\nAll this was also played out in the context', 'result': {'fake': 0.3489, 'real': 0.6511}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'of the Cold War; though allies in World War Two, the USA and the USSR had entirely incompatible economic systems.

Korea, Vietnam and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan being the most notable. The USA also made sure to prop up anti-communist regimes in South and Central America- even if they were incredibly brutal. Examples include Augusto Pinochet of Chile and the Military Junta in Argentina. The Military Junta did though start a war with Britain in 1982, lose and get deposed as a result the following year.\n\nThe Communists didn’t have it their own way though; The Communists won the Chinese civil war, pushing the nationalists to the island of Taiwan, but the two communist regimes had a falling out such that when Communist Vietnam invaded Communist Cambodia (Cambodia started it and were ruled by Pol Pot who was in dire need of deposition) they backed opposite sides. Ultimately, China became slightly more capitalist and reconciled with the USA, while the USSR collapsed in 1991.\n\nGermany was reunified, the members of the Eastern Bloc became independent, and the USA was considered to have won the Cold War. However, ten years later, as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, they and their allies went into Iraq and Afghanistan, causing chaos in those regions. In 2022, a revanchist Russia attacked Ukraine, wildly overestimating their own effectiveness and popularity in the process and condemning themselves to a slow grinding war of attrition.\n\nAnd that brings us pretty much up to date.\n\nI am almost certain to have missed something, because this is the entire history of the world so of course I did, so just be polite when you point out whatever I missed.', 'result': {'fake': 0.1599, 'real': 0.8401}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 35, 'credits': 1976103, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'Here is the history of the world.\n\nIn the beginning, there was nothing. Literally nothing. This was presumably rather boring and so the Big Bang happened, flinging stuff in all directions. Nobody is sure why this occurred. A few billion years later, there was an enormous cloud of dust and gas which began to spin, pulling it together and forming planets (and the sun). One of these planets was earth. Fairly early on it got run into by another planet roughly the same size (which presumably wasn’t looking where it was going) and the collision flung debris out into space. This debris began to spin around the earth and formed another, smaller body orbiting it.\n\nBecause there were a lot more meteorites back then, they hit the earth with alarming regularity and brought water, which because the earth had cooled down by then remained as water and didn’t just evaporate.\n\nAnd then, 3.8 billion years ago, life began. Nobody knows how or why, but the first lifeforms on planet earth were single celled organisms called prokaryotes, which reproduced by splitting into two. It took another billion years for the first lifeforms to have more than one cell at a time. From then on, life expanded to fill out various niches in the environment.\n\nThere was the Paleozoic Era, where the first lifeforms to really leave a trace appeared. Life spread onto the land, and at one point in the Carboniferous period there were massive insects running and flying around as a result of the greater quantity of oxygen in the air. That was ended by a mass extinction event that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth, then came the Mesozoic Era, which saw the rise and fall of the dinosaurs and the appearance of the first mammals and birds.\n\nThen the dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteorite and the Mammals rose to prominance in the Cenozoic era. One of these groups of mammals was the apes, and one particular subgroup of these was the hominids. Hominids evolved into various species of humans, such as Homo Habilis, Homo Erectus, Homo Neanderthalis and finally Homo Sapiens Sapiens (that’s us).

This prompted the Balkan wars, further limiting Ottoman power.\n\nUltimately, rising tensions led to World War One; the German Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire were all extinguished, replaced by the Weimar Republic, Turkey, various small Central European nations, and the USSR respectively.\n\nThe Weimar Republic slid into right-wing extremism, as did Italy, and Japan fell out with the western powers such as Britain after Britain ended a treaty with them for fear of ending up at war with the USA. The Nazis took power in Germany and Mussolini in Italy, leading to World War Two, which left vast swathes of the world devastated and included Germany attempting to commit genocide on various ethnic groups that they didn’t like, most notably the Jews but also the Roma and others. Japan was also very brutal in China and to their allied PoWs.\n\nThey failed, fortunately, because they lost the war, and as a result calls for a Jewish homeland grew louder and louder; they got one in 1948 with the creation of the State of Israel, who immediately was attacked by all its neighbours and won.\n\nMany European empires began to collapse after the war, some more willingly than others; India, though partitioned into India and Pakistan, became independent in 1947, followed by most of the rest of the British Empire shortly afterwards (and relatively peacefully too) though some countries such as Algeria, Vietnam (then French Indochina) and the Portuguese colonies had to fight for it.\n\nAll this was also played out in the context of the Cold War; though allies in World War Two, the USA and the USSR had entirely incompatible economic systems. However, they also both had nuclear weapons, and it would be a very bad day for humanity if they were ever used. They came close a few times but preferred to fight proxy wars. Korea, Vietnam and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan being the most notable. The USA also made sure to prop up anti-communist regimes in South and Central America- even if they were incredibly brutal. Examples include Augusto Pinochet of Chile and the Military Junta in Argentina. The Military Junta did though start a war with Britain in 1982, lose and get deposed as a result the following year.\n\nThe Communists didn’t have it their own way though; The Communists won the Chinese civil war, pushing the nationalists to the island of Taiwan, but the two communist regimes had a falling out such that when Communist Vietnam invaded Communist Cambodia (Cambodia started it and were ruled by Pol Pot who was in dire need of deposition) they backed opposite sides. Ultimately, China became slightly more capitalist and reconciled with the USA, while the USSR collapsed in 1991.\n\nGermany was reunified, the members of the Eastern Bloc became independent, and the USA was considered to have won the Cold War. However, ten years later, as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, they and their allies went into Iraq and Afghanistan, causing chaos in those regions. In 2022, a revanchist Russia attacked Ukraine, wildly overestimating their own effectiveness and popularity in the process and condemning themselves to a slow grinding war of attrition.\n\nAnd that brings us pretty much up to date.\n\nI am almost certain to have missed something, because this is the entire history of the world so of course I did, so just be polite when you point out whatever I missed.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.42031428571429
Brian Overland,1y,How was Socrates executed?,"Socrates was, in effect, ORDERED to drink Hemlock by the jury of Athenians. Now, this raises an obvious question that no-one ever touches: Couldn’t Socrates simply refuse?

And the answer is, of course he could. However, Plato’s audience would’ve understood the situation, namely: If Socrates had refused to drink the hemlock, he would’ve shortly faced one of several alternatives, which would’ve been carried out by the guard, along with members of the Athenian army if necessary. The alternatives include: death by strangulation, death by being beaten to death, and death by being run through with a sword.

Therefore, being told to die through drinking hemlock was an act of mercy, because the obvious alternatives (strangulation, being bludgeoned, and being run through by.a sword) were generally more painful and humiliating — potentially a good deal more.

In actual fact, death by hemlock isn’t always the most pleasant death, either. Ideally, you would lose consciousness, lie down, and expire. In reality, hemlock — which is EXTREMELY poisonous — can involve vomiting and dizziness before death. All things considered, though, it was a more merciful execution than other methods the Athenians knew of.

So it would be wrong to conclude that Socrates committed suicide. He didn’t. He was told he had been condemned to death. Hemlock was chosen as a means of death, probably because he was an older man, not in great shape anyway (so he’d probably die quickly), and he’d already declared his intention not to struggle against the death penalty once it was imposed.

In fact, that question — Should Socrates have tried to evade the death penalty? — comes up in the Platonic dialogs dealing with Socrates’ final days. The students of Socrates, Plato among them, include rich young men, and they tell him they can bribe the guard and get Socrates out of town while the guard agrees to look the other way. I think the guard already indicated his willingness to do that deal.

But Socrates tells them he won’t go through with their plan… not because he’s suicidal (he’s not), but because of a Philosopher’s Reason that he gives. That is, only a Philosopher would give a reason like this.

Basically, he says that all his life he had benefitted from the laws of Athens, as do all citizens, and that it would be hypocritical to now simply disregard the laws (even though they had decreed his death), simply because it was convenient to break the law now.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/c8wtvxk6dj75imfs', 'title': 'How was Socrates executed?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Socrates was, in effect, ORDERED to drink Hemlock by the jury of Athenians.

Frederic Christie,3y,Is Western philosophy inherently patriarchal and monoracial?,"No.

I mean, by now “Western philosophy” includes the contributions of female and non-white philosophers. So unless we think that “Western philosophy” is some essentialist construct defined by some specific bad monoracial and sexist period, it pretty much can’t be.

There is a trend in Western culture in general and in philosophy as a corollary that does tend to trend toward patriarchal and white supremacist assumptions. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to have a soft postmodernist skepticism about ideas that may sound good that do come from a period where the philosophers were so deeply contaminated by the racism and sexism of their age. But it’s a genetic fallacy to reject an idea because of where it came from, and so ideas should be assessed on their own merits, even if that also means assessing the corpus of thought that they came from.

For example: A lot of the thinkers about democracy essentially assumed that the democracy could be buoyed by a large group of non-persons, women and racial minorities and in many cases the poor. But while a multiracial and diverse democracy has challenges that I don’t think the Framers would have predicted, I think it’s also fairly clear that such systems can still work.

This is of course a deep topic. Feminists write entire books about various underlying philosophical assumptions not only within philosophy but also the sciences and medicine that definitely can be seen as deriving from sexist assumptions. That doesn’t make science per se sexist: There’s nothing inherently masculine or feminine about testing a hypothesis. But there can be sexism in the way ideas are presented and framed, the solutions and approaches that are used for problems, and so forth. Take the paper that became infamous because a lot of people didn’t read 
it and so ended up with another case of foot-in-mouth syndrome, the feminist glaciology paper. The paper examined some interesting issues about how relations of local people to glaciers were poorly understood and how scientists missed out on key sources of information because of implicit sexist biases. This matches the very well-known problem of women being underrepresented in clinical trials
, in part because scientists who should know better and would if you pressed them on the topic have still done what is always so tempting to do and tried to limit a variable by basically using men as a control group and thinking of women as men with complicated hormones. And, of course, the fact that a lot of our psychology and social science is WEIRD 
(Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) also stems from some implicitly sexist and racist biases.

When I was in high school studying philosophy for debate, I really disliked postmodernism (despite swimming in it for Kritiks, a kind of philosophical argument in policy debate). But I’ve warmed up to the notion since then. I still would lean on the side of folks like Noam Chomsky, Michael Albert, Barbara Ehrenreich and others who view Western philosophy and the scientific method that we have worked on as a species (with increasingly global cooperation and involvement) in general, but I do think that postmodern approaches can help us remember to ask where ideas come from, what their assumptions are, and what we think we know, all of which are always important. So I ultimately still would not dismiss Western philosophy as inherently racist and sexist.

However, ultimately, these ideas did come from men (and very occasionally women) who were limited by the consciousness of their time. That means that one should always check the ideas from that philosophy for biases, just as one should always be attentive to biases of all kinds everywhere and try to account for and correct them.

The quote that I use as my e-mail signature, the one that has motivated me more than almost any other, comes from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a guy with a variety of very weird ideas and a complicated relationship with women. I remember this quote from an antiquated translation. It is “[W]hen I see multitudes of entirely naked savages scorn European voluptuousness and endure hunger, fire, the sword, and death to preserve only their independence, I feel it does not behoove slaves to reason about freedom”. Rousseau’s anthropology was limited, but he was right about something. The arrogance of people in the West in dismissing the people they were colonizing as not ready for freedom, when it was the Westerners proving their own contempt for freedom in the process, is humbling. I’m not going to reject a tradition that reminded me of that, and galvanized me to remember to respect liberty in all its forms for all people.

Pascal Morimacil,2y,Is non-violence a weapon of the weak or the strong?,"Power is pretty much unrelated to physical strength.

Frederick Dolan,2y,"As a 15 year old deeply interested in philosophy, should I begin to read some Jung, Freud, Nietzsche or Schopenhauer? I’ve been getting through Derrida and Deleuze’s work, but I feel as though I need to start reading more.","Cast your net a bit wider.

A good place to start would be one of Plato’s Socratic dialogues, such as Euthyphro or Theautetus. If the dialogue style and the content appeal to you, the Republic could come next. It can serve as a general introduction to philosophy because it explores a wide range of topics, including epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and aesthetics.

If you don't want to continue with Plato, try Descartes’s Meditations (1641). This treatise provided philosophers with food for thought for centuries, up to the present moment.

John Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689) or David Hume’s An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748) are good next steps.

Another approach is to read some modern works that deal with important problems but don’t require a great deal of prior knowledge to appreciate. One such is Thomas Nagel’s Mortal Questions
 (1979).

If by chance you’re drawn to logic and semantics, and want a challenging read that transformed the state of late 20th century philosophy, take a look at Saul Kripke’s Naming and Necessity
 (1980). The book is very technical and abstract, but it’s also a transcription of lectures and so is direct and conversational.

You might also enjoy Bryan Magee’s BBC television conversations with philosophers, which were broadcast from 1978–1987. Many of them are linked to here

Dr. Johnson’s famous refutation of Berkeley obviously incensed him enough to get up and go outside in order to find a stone to kick[3] but after that the debate settled down enough for Hume to go and play billiards[4].

Steven Ussery,3y,Why is Immanuel Kant considered a genius?,"Immanuel Kant (1724 – 1804) was a German idealist philosopher and one of the central Enlightenment thinkers. Kant's comprehensive and systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him one of the most influential figures in modern Western philosophy. No philosopher since Plato or Aristotle has had a bigger impact on subsequent philosophers.

In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, Kant argued that space and time are mere ""forms of intuition"" which structure all experience, and therefore that while “things-in-themselves” exist and contribute to experience, they are nonetheless distinct from the objects of experience. From this it follows that the objects of experience are mere “appearances”, and that the nature of things as they are in themselves is consequently unknowable to us.

In an attempt to counter the skepticism that he found in the writings of the British/Scottish philosopher David Hume, he wrote the Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787), one of his most well-known works. In it, he developed his theory of experience to answer the question of whether synthetic a priori (i.e. “before the fact”) knowledge is possible, which would in turn make it possible to determine the limits of metaphysical inquiry. Kant drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposal that the objects of the senses must conform to our spatial and temporal forms of intuition, and that we can consequently have a priori cognition of the objects of the senses.

I would personally rate Kant as the fourth greatest philosopher of all time, right after Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.

Rodney Vessels,3y,What are similarities between Socrates and Plato?,"The question presented:

“What are similarities between Socrates and Plato?”

There are no similarities between Socrates and Plato. Socrates was a True Messenger; Plato was not. Socrates did not write down his teachings. Plato, a student of Socrates, completely misconstrued and falsified Socrates’ message and teachings, for his own aggrandizement.

“Unfortunately, some of Socrates’ students misinterpreted his teachings in the presentation of their own. His few students found that they received value, prestige, and money in the community when they presented information that was politically and socially correct. So, they simply took some of Socrates’ information that wasn’t politically and socially correct and made it so. Whatever they learned from [Socrates], they changed it to conform to what their community wanted to hear, for which they were compensated handsomely (received a very good payment).”

This yields Plato’s wondrous theory of forms. It’s probably the greatest philosophical theory on the market.\n\nThen, throw in a ton of ethics (from Plato, and Kant) and political philosophy (see the Republic), and you’re good to go.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9913

Tamara M,3y,Who is the most underrated philosopher or intellectual of all time?,"Percy Shelley is so underrated that it hurts. Shelley was the first to encourage peaceful protests in overthrowing tyrannical governments and this had inspired Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and others. His legacy is being the first to pioneer peaceful protests that toppled regimes.

Portrait of Percy Bysshe Shelley.

Percy Shelley, a famous poet from the Romantic Era, was the first to advocate for peaceful protests and he inspired Gandhi to adopt non-violent resistance. Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violent resistance influenced Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama. They had all followed Shelley’s philosophy and it helped create a new world.

When Gandhi read Shelley’s poem, “The Masque of Anarchy” he was instantly captivated by its message for freedom through peace. It is known that Gandhi would often quote various passages from the poem to vast audiences during the campaign for India’s independence.

Percy Shelley wrote this poem after hearing of the tragic event known as Peterloo. More than a hundred working men, women and children were seriously injured when they staged a public meeting to determine how to achieve reform through “the most legal and effectual means.”

Like many others, Percy Shelley was furious over this naked governmental oppression and seized the opportunity to write what is now considered, “the greatest poem of political protest ever written in English.”

Sadly, during his lifetime his poem was considered too radical and never published until 1832, years after he died.

In 2020, this poem is still very relatable to modern events. We have seen many people throughout the world rising up in protest.

The BLM protests in response to police brutality, the Beirut explosion followed by mass protests against corruption and protests in Belarus against government oppression. The quote “Ye are many—they are few!"" in the Masque of Anarchy resonates even today.

Perchy Shelley’s poem had even influenced the Egyptian revolution 2011, with protestors chanting the lines, “Rise, like lions after slumber, In unvanquishable number!”

Percy Shelley is the most underrated intellectual who envisioned way ahead into the future and foresaw pacifism as the greatest weapon against despotism and injustice.

He really deserves some credit.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nlc9yzsh8b3gj4oe', 'title': 'Who is the most underrated philosopher or intellectual of all time?', 'score': {'original': 0.9963, 'ai': 0.0037}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Percy Shelley is so underrated that it hurts.

Frederick Dolan,Updated 2y,"I've been looking into some classic Greek philosophers, but I still can't understand the differences between Socrates, Platos, and Aristotle’s philosophies. Can someone help me?","Take a look at Raphael’s The School of Athens (1511).

In the center, walking side-by side, are Plato (left) and Aristotle (right).

To Plato’s right, we find Socrates.

I don’t know what the experts say, but this looks to me like a scene from the Meno in which Socrates leads a servant through the steps required to double the area of a square. Or perhaps it represents one of the arguments for the “forms” in the Republic, where Socrates asks Glaucon to consider three of his fingers, one of which is larger, one of which is smaller, and one of which is in between.

Either way, these moments occur in the context of a conversation about the nature of virtue (Meno) or justice (Republic), which are Socrates’ basic concerns. What is the essence of goodness? Socrates spent his time in the marketplace questioning people in order to undermine their confidence in the truth of their beliefs about goodness, which he thought were unlikely to survive scrutiny. He characterized himself as a “gadfly” who aimed to sting his fellow-citizens with his questions and disturb their complacency.

Going back to Plato, we see that he is looking at Aristotle and pointing upward.

He’s saying that reality consists of timeless, eternal, unchanging “forms” or ideas, and that the world our senses reveal to us is made up of imperfect reflections of the forms.

Plato carries a copy of his Timeaus, which presents the cosmos as having been modeled on the forms. The purpose of Platonic philosophy is to acquire knowledge of the basic constituents of reality, and this is best accomplished by withdrawing from society and devoting oneself to the contemplative life.

Aristotle is returning Plato’s gaze and gesturing towards the world around and in front of the two philosophers.

For him, the pursuit of knowledge consists of observing the great variety of things in the world, which are as real as can be, and classifying them in terms of common and distinguishing features. A philosopher employs observation as well as logic, and the standards of validity for an inquiry should accommodate the nature of its subject. We shouldn’t expect deductive truths in a treatise on politics.

Aristotle carries a copy of his Ethics, which argues that a virtuous life requires participation in society and politics. Knowledge of how to live well takes the form of “practical wisdom” or know-how, not that of a theory or scientific explanation.

Yannis Gaitanas,2y,"Was Socrates the birth name of the philosopher (I once read ""Socrates"" was an honorary title, given in young adulthood, but cannot now find that source)?","I haven’t heard of another name and Socrates was not a title, it was just a name. We know several other people named Socrates in antiquity.

In fact, his pupil Xenophon mentions another Socrates in his Anabasis of The Ten Thousand, some mercenary officer from Achaea. Xenophon makes no comments about the name. It goes like that:

Similarly two other friends, Sophaenetus the Stymphalian and Socrates the Achaean had orders to get together as many men as possible and come to him since he was on the point of opening a campain.

Sohpaenetus the Stymphalian with 1000 hoplites, Socrates the Achaean with 500 while the Megarion pasion came with 300 hoplites and 300 peltasts. This latter officer as well as Socrates belonged to the force angaged against Miletus.

They were Proxenus the Boetian, Menon the Thessalian, Agias the Arcadian, Clearchus the Laconian, and Socrates the Achaean, while the captains remained at the doors.

Agias the Arcadian and Socrates the Achaen were both among the sufferers who were put to death.

And then Xenophon mentions his teacher, Socrates:

Xenophon having read the letter consulted Socrates the Athenian, whether he should accept or refuse the invitation.

Xenophon recieving the invitation for a campaign in Persia under Cyrus. (401 BC, colorized photo)

Nothing about a title. Just common Greek names. For example there was also an officer in Alexander the Great’s army. Arrian mentions him a few times in his Anabasis of Alexander as a commander of a squadron of Macedonian cavalry.

He now sent scouts before the army of the Companion cavalry which came from Apollonia, under the captain Socrates, son of Sathon, and four squadrons of what were called prodromoi.

There were other people named Socrates, even other Athenian philisophers named Socrates such as the younger Socrates that Aristotle mentions in his Metaphysics (7.1036b):

And the analogy in the case of the living thing which the younger Socrates used to state is not a good one, for it leads one away from the truth and makes one suppose that it is possible for a man to exist without his parts.

Wait, would that be a body without organs?

So, no, it wasn’t a title, just a name. Besides, Socrates wasn’t anyone important and he was known as Socrates even early on. An early source we have about Socrates is from the theatrical writer Aristophanes. In his comedy, Clouds, produced in 423 BC when Plato was an infant, the character Socrates heads a group in which young men study the natural world. The actor wearing the mask of Socrates makes fun for traditional gods of Athens and gives naturalistic explanations of phenomena Athenians viewed as divinely directed. Also, he encourages young men to beat their parents(!) and teaches dishonest techniques for avoiding repayment of debt.

Not exactly things for an “honorary title”!

Perhaps you are confusing Socrates with his student, Plato because Plato wrote the works that describe the philosophy of Socrates.

Plato indeed probably wasn’t named “Plato” as a kid. it is said that Plato’s real childhood name was Aristocles. But Socrates’s name was just Socrates.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tyk8rgo7munw3p9s', 'title': 'Was Socrates the birth name of the philosopher (I once read ""Socrates"" was an honorary title, given in young adulthood, but cannot now find that source)?', 'score': {'original': 0.4905, 'ai': 0.5095}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I haven’t heard of another name and Socrates was not a title, it was just a name.

Ian Ward,3y,What is Stoicism?,"Among most people, Stoicism is either not known or misunderstood. This is my effort to restore Stoicism to its rightful place as a tool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance, and wisdom. In other words, something one uses to live a great life, rather than some esoteric field of academic inquiry. The philosophy asserts that virtue (meaning the virtues of self-control, courage, justice and wisdom) is happiness, and it is our perceptions of things, rather than the things themselves that cause most of our trouble.

Stoicism teaches that you cannot rely or control anything outside our “reasoned choice”, and to use our own ability, to use our own reasoning and choose how we respond and possibly reorient ourselves to any kind of external events. There are three important disciplines that form part of stoicism. These are:

Perception - how we see and how we perceive the world around us.
Action - the decisions and actions that we take.
Will - how we deal with the things we are unable to develop, a clear and convincing judgment, and come to a true peaceful understanding of what our place in this world is.

The underlying message is that Stoicism can help you with whatever challenges you may be going through.

The Discipline of Perception

The single most important practice in the Stoic philosophy is being able to differentiate between what a person can change and what they are unable to change. If they can focus on making clear what parts of their day are within their control, and what parts are not, they will be happier, and have a distinct advantage over any others who fail to realize that they are indeed fighting against an unwinnable battle.

A good tool is to imprint the following reminders, and verbalize them every day when necessary.

Control your perceptions.
Direct your actions properly.
Willingly accept what is outside your control.
Clarify who you are and what you stand for.

Serenity and stability are the positive results of your choices and wise judgment, not your environment. If you try to avoid all disruptions like other people, external events, stress , unfortunately you will never be successful. Your problems will follow you wherever you hide. However if you avoid the harmful and disruptive judgments that cause these problems, then you will be stable and steady wherever you go.

Passions and Emotions

Avoid being a puppet to your emotions. You are in control, and when you next feel anxious, you need to ask yourself, whether your anxiety is good for you. Impulses will always come, and your job or task is to control them. You must always think carefully before you act. If you are unable to control your impulses, you could be the source of the disasters you fear. Most things that upset us or make us anxious are only in our imaginations. They are similar to bad dreams and should be dealt with accordingly. That little thing that keeps provoking you isn't even real.

It is very dangerous to think that happiness will come at some later time. The ongoing yearning for more, better, someday is the major enemy of your contentment. Eagerly anticipating your future ruins your chances at happiness right now..

Awareness

The journey into philosophy begins when we are or become aware of our own ability to analyze our own minds. You need to work on and refine your ability to judge yourself accurately and honestly. You need to look inward to fully understand exactly what you are capable of and what it will take to unlock the enormous potential.

The gift of self-awareness is your own ability to be able to objectively evaluate yourself, by learning to question your own instincts, patterns and assumptions. You need to be very cautious and not rush to any kind of conclusions about anything. You will need to be completely aware of everything that’s going on, in order to make the right decision.

Your mind is your most powerful possession. You must maintain strict control of your mind at all times. It is important to remember that you are extremely blessed to have the capacity to use logic and reason, to navigate situations and circumstances. You have the ability to always control your mind and your feelings, and you have the ability to always decide to love, and also to accept what’s happening around you.

Unbiased Thoughts

You need to always be careful about what information you let into your mind. Life determines that unfortunately we will be exposed to bad influences, and when this happens we must not allow these thoughts to penetrate our minds. Wedo have the ability to decide what information we allow inside our minds. A great coping tool is to:

Quickly consider your own thoughts.
Always Trust your instincts, but always verify them
Test your impressions in order to avoid making a false move on based on false or biased information..

You will change your opinions from time to time as we are not as wise as we sometimes think we are. ’Always fight against your biases and preconceptions.

A great way to learn humility is to be willing to learn from anyone and everyone, regardless of their status in life.Unfortunately opinions are usually shaped by entitlements, expectations, and sometimes, ignorance. If we can find a way of getting them out of our lives, we will begin to feel less upset and angry.

The Right Action

A shooter will not be able to hit a target without aiming. Following on from this, you should spend some time thinking about what your priorities are, and only then work toward them and forsake everything else.

It is not good enough to just wish and then hope, you need to act , and act right. Time is an irreplaceable commodity, you will only get one shot at today, after that today is gone and lost forever. The question is, what will you manage to make of today, before it becomes the past?

You must indeed take pleasure from the right actions you take, rather than the results that may come from these actions. Our ambition must definitely not be to win, but more importantly to play with our full and best effort. By doing this and giving it our all, we will always find contentment and resilience. Start now, do not delay. If you focus on doing the right thing at the right time, you will succeed.

Do not spend any time thinking about what other people think, this means nothing. Think about what you think, think about the results, the impact, about whether it is the right thing to do right now.

Problem Solving

One of the guarantees of life is that there will be obstacles. The way to overcome this is by having a backup plan. Life is not easy or never fair, so no need to try to play the sympathy card. You always have a choice in how to respond. Use the gifts that you have been given and get the issue sorted. Get active in your own rescue and stop seeking a scapegoat.

There is absolutely no shame in needing help, and you do not have to face everything on your own. If you need help, don’t be proud and learn to ask. People want freedom, happiness and the respect of their peers. All of that is right in front of you, in the choices you make. There’s no need to take the long way to get there. Hold yourself to a high standard, but not an impossible one. And forgive yourself if and when you slip up.

Your Duties

The Stoics believed that every person, and animal and every little thing has a purpose or place in nature. Your job is to be good, so be good every day. We cannot be of service to other people unless we get up and get working. Rise and shine, and time to get going.

So questions to ponder are:

What are you committed to?
What are you doing and more important is what is the reason you are doing it?

If you carefully examine these questions you can discover what your calling is, and you can fulfill your duties. Once you discover it, you’ve moved a little closer to fulfilling it.

Everyone has the ability to be the master of their own affairs. You need to live your life in a way that doesn’t negatively impose on others. In addition you also need to be open-minded enough to allow others to do the same. We are made to cooperate with each other and everyone's purpose is to do this great work together.

Pragmatism

Often people say that they need the right environment to finally buckle down and get serious. A more wiser way is to be pragmatic and adaptable, the ability to do what we need to do anywhere, anytime. The place to do your work, to live the good life, is here.

There is much that can be done today, that will make the universe and world a better place. There are many little things to be done that will help move things forward. Don't make excuses from doing them because the conditions aren’t right or because a better opportunity might come along, do what you can now.

It is well known that man is never going to be perfect, so therefore our actions should be progress instead of perfection.

Fortitude and Resilience

The unpleasant experiences in life leave us with a much better knowledge of our own capacity and inner strength. You grow by knowing that in the future you can not only survive, but thrive when facing similar adversity..

Even under the worst torture and cruelties that can be inflicted on somebody, the persons power over their our own mind and their power to make their decisions can’t be broken, it can only be relinquished.

Should you spend a week or month personally experiencing the effects of poverty, hunger, isolation or other fearful things, ,the situation would start to feel normal, and no longer scary.

Virtue and Kindness

Any bad situation is made better by love, empathy, understanding and appreciation. This also is true for situations where you do not agree with the other person. Always love and always give people the benefit of doubt.

You have the choice to respond with kindness and love.. You always have the choice to be truthful, endure and to be happy. You can always choose to be kind to others, however goodness will require you to dig deep inside your own soul.

Acceptance

Every event in our life is objective. It is only our opinion that determines whether we think something is good or bad. You need to decide to make the most of everything, whatever it is that happens to us. We must not complain, but we need to try and to do the best we can to accept it and fulfill it.

We definitely are not able to control the external, but we do control our attitudes and our responses to those events.

Meditation on Mortality

People have an irrational fear of our own mortality. We avoid it, mostly because we think it will be a depressing thought. In fact it should be the opposite. If you were told you had one week to live, i am sure you would make some changes. The takeaway, be satisfied with what you have been given. We all face the same end, death is a radical equalizer as no one is better or worse. All our stories have the same ending. So even if today was your last day, would there still be plenty to be grateful for? Give thanks.

I hope that you have enjoyed this post. I have certainly learnt a lot while researching this post, which is a subject that interest me a lot. Lots of great principles and values by which to live your life.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ymw7tr31n0iuc2od', 'title': 'What is Stoicism?', 'score': {'original': 0.727675, 'ai': 0.272325}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Among most people, Stoicism is either not known or misunderstood.

This is my effort to restore Stoicism to its rightful place as a tool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance, and wisdom. In other words, something one uses to live a great life, rather than some esoteric field of academic inquiry. The philosophy asserts that virtue (meaning the virtues of self-control, courage, justice and wisdom) is happiness, and it is our perceptions of things, rather than the things themselves that cause most of our trouble.\n\nStoicism teaches that you cannot rely or control anything outside our “reasoned choice”, and to use our own ability, to use our own reasoning and choose how we respond and possibly reorient ourselves to any kind of external events. There are three important disciplines that form part of stoicism. These are:\n\nPerception - how we see and how we perceive the world around us.\nAction - the decisions and actions that we take.\nWill - how we deal with the things we are unable to develop, a clear and convincing judgment, and come to a true peaceful understanding of what our place in this world is.\n\nThe underlying message is that Stoicism can help you with whatever challenges you may be going through.\n\nThe Discipline of Perception\n\nThe single most important practice in the Stoic philosophy is being able to differentiate between what a person can change and what they are unable to change. If they can focus on making clear what parts of their day are within their control, and what parts are not, they will be happier, and have a distinct advantage over any others who fail to realize that they are indeed fighting against an unwinnable battle.\n\nA good tool is to imprint the following reminders, and verbalize them every day when necessary.\n\nControl your perceptions.\nDirect your actions properly.\nWillingly accept what is outside your control.\nClarify who you are and what you stand for.\n\nSerenity and stability are the positive results of your choices and wise judgment, not your environment. If you try to avoid all disruptions like other people, external events, stress , unfortunately you will never be successful. Your problems will follow you wherever you hide. However if you avoid the harmful and disruptive judgments that cause these problems, then you will be stable and steady wherever you go.\n\nPassions and Emotions\n\nAvoid being a puppet to your emotions. You are in control, and when you next feel anxious, you need to ask yourself, whether your anxiety is good for you. Impulses will always come, and your job or task is to control them. You must always think carefully before you act. If you are unable to control your impulses, you could be the source of the disasters you fear. Most things that upset us or make us anxious are only in our imaginations. They are similar to bad dreams and should be dealt with accordingly. That little thing that keeps provoking you isn't even real.\n\nIt is very dangerous to think that happiness will come at some later time. The ongoing yearning for more, better, someday is the major enemy of your contentment. Eagerly anticipating your future ruins your chances at happiness right now..\n\nAwareness\n\nThe journey into philosophy begins when we are or become aware of our own ability to analyze our own minds. You need to work on and refine your ability to judge yourself accurately and honestly. You need to look inward to fully understand exactly what you are capable of and what it will take to unlock the enormous potential.\n\nThe gift of self-awareness is your own ability to be able to objectively evaluate yourself, by learning to question your own instincts, patterns and assumptions. You need to be very cautious and not rush to any kind of conclusions about anything. You will need to be completely aware of everything that’s going on, in order to make the right decision.\n\nYour mind is your most powerful possession. You must maintain strict control of your mind at all times. It is important to remember that you are extremely blessed to have the capacity to use logic and reason, to navigate situations and circumstances. You have the ability to always control your mind and your feelings, and you have the ability to always decide to love, and also to accept what’s happening around you.\n\nUnbiased Thoughts\n\nYou need to always be careful about what information you let into your mind. Life determines that unfortunately we will be exposed to bad influences, and when this happens we must not allow these thoughts to penetrate our minds. Wedo have the ability to decide what information we allow inside our minds. A great coping tool is to:\n\nQuickly consider your own thoughts.\nAlways Trust your instincts, but always verify them\nTest your impressions in order to avoid making a false move on based on false or biased information..\n\nYou will change your opinions from time to time as we are not as wise as we sometimes think we are. ’Always fight against your biases and preconceptions.\n\nA great way to learn humility is to be willing to learn from anyone and everyone, regardless of their status in life.Unfortunately opinions are usually shaped by entitlements, expectations, and sometimes, ignorance. If we can find a way of getting them out of our lives, we will begin to feel less upset and angry.\n\nThe Right Action\n\nA shooter will not be able to hit a target without aiming. Following on from this, you should spend some time thinking about what your priorities are, and only then work toward them and forsake everything else.\n\nIt is not good enough to just wish and then hope, you need to act , and act right. Time is an irreplaceable commodity, you will only get one shot at today, after that today is gone and lost forever. The question is, what will you manage to make of today, before it becomes the past?\n\nYou must indeed take pleasure from the right actions you take, rather than the results that may come from these actions. Our ambition must definitely not be to win, but more importantly to play with our full and best effort. By doing this and giving it our all, we will always find contentment and resilience. Start now, do not delay. If you focus on doing the right thing at the right time, you will succeed.\n\nDo not spend any time thinking about what other people think, this means nothing. Think about what you think, think about the results, the impact, about whether it is the right thing to do right now.\n\nProblem Solving\n\nOne of the guarantees of life is that there will be obstacles. The way to overcome this is by having a backup plan. Life is not easy or never fair, so no need to try to play the sympathy card. You always have a choice in how to respond. Use the gifts that you have been given and get the issue sorted. Get active in your own rescue and stop seeking a scapegoat.\n\nThere is absolutely no shame in needing help, and you do not have to face everything on your own. If you need help, don’t be proud and learn to ask. People want freedom, happiness and the respect of their peers. All of that is right in front of you, in the choices you make. There’s no need to take the long way to get there. Hold yourself to a high standard, but not an impossible one. And forgive yourself if and when you slip up.\n\nYour Duties\n\nThe Stoics believed that every person, and animal and every little thing has a purpose or place in nature. Your job is to be good, so be good every day. We cannot be of service to other people unless we get up and get working. Rise and shine, and time to get going.\n\nSo questions to ponder are:\n\nWhat are you committed to?\nWhat are you doing and more important is what is the reason you are doing it?\n\nIf you carefully examine these questions you can discover what your calling is, and you can fulfill your duties. Once you discover it, you’ve moved a little closer to fulfilling it.\n\nEveryone has the ability to be the master of their own affairs. You need to live your life in a way that doesn’t negatively impose on others. In addition you also need to be open-minded enough to allow others to do the same. We are made to cooperate with each other and everyone's purpose is to do this great work together.\n\nPragmatism\n\nOften people say that they need the right environment to finally buckle down and get serious. A more wiser way is to be pragmatic and adaptable, the ability to do what we need to do anywhere, anytime. The place to do your work, to live the good life, is here.\n\nThere is much that can be done today, that will make the universe and world a better place. There are many little things to be done that will help move things forward. Don't make excuses from doing them because the conditions aren’t right or because a better opportunity might come along, do what you can now.\n\nIt is well known that man is never going to be perfect, so therefore our actions should be progress instead of perfection.\n\nFortitude and Resilience\n\nThe unpleasant experiences in life leave us with a much better knowledge of our own capacity and inner strength. You grow by knowing that in the future you can not only survive, but thrive when facing similar adversity..\n\nEven under the worst torture and cruelties that can be inflicted on somebody, the persons power over their our own mind and their power to make their decisions can’t be broken, it can only be relinquished.\n\nShould you spend a week or month personally experiencing the effects of poverty, hunger, isolation or other fearful things, ,the situation would start to feel normal, and no longer scary.\n\nVirtue and Kindness\n\nAny bad situation is made better by love, empathy, understanding and appreciation.

David Moore,3y,"Will there be an ""end of History"" in our lifetimes?","Let me tell you a brief story about one important thought.

A long time ago, as a junior doctor, I became severely depressed. It wasn’t necessarily that obvious to many people around me (they just knew things were ‘stressful’), but in my mind the world took on an incredibly profound nihilism. I was in the business of ‘chronicling demise’, I would sometimes say. Another way I would describe the role in which I tried to invest as much effort as I could (and I had no choice regarding how much time) was ‘working out all the things that eventually don’t work’.

In the context of studying a bit for exams outside the times I wasn’t working (I have a very understanding wife, who put up with me getting up at night etc.) a lot of stuff also started looking very deterministic. After all, pathology is predictable (that’s why we have ‘risk factors’) and even in scenarios where everything is optimised it is only a matter of time until we see senescence.

Hence, among the prevailing progress of cases of Parkinson’s, motor neurone disease, cardiac failure and various cancers dismantling individuals and families I liked it became relatively obvious that one of two things was likely. Either

I wasn’t doing the right things. People said this wasn’t so, but if I was really any good at anything then people would get better, right? I mean, a doctor that merely supervises morbidity and mortality rather than having an impact on them cannot be competent. If I was any good I’d be unemployed!
Even if I was doing things well, they were practically pointless. Today’s ‘success’ would merely be tomorrow’s disaster. It was only a matter of time.

Hence, I started becoming somewhat obsessed with time itself. It seemed to me that (based on some clinical projections) I could kind of see what was coming. Some of these clinical suspicions being confirmed didn’t help. Even if Dr Dave ‘got things right’ these weren’t good things.

Thus nihilism met determinism, and their fusion was deep and dark. Even more problematically, I concluded that sharing such an experience with anyone (despite my dear wife supporting me beautifully) was not only experientially impossible but also useless. They would all live their lives regardless. Why add to the suffering that was inevitable for them by adding my own complaints? Let them enjoy what little peace they have.

However, I felt my peace - my time - was ending. With loss of insight came increasing certainty. A particular pattern developed:

Since the beginning, one thing has followed another. Even if those things were probabilistic, the fact is that a coin flip causes an outcome. Just because one becomes many doesn’t mean there’s no ‘because’.

Hence, even though I knew I was depressed (and not necessarily thinking correctly) in this loop of logic even that error was meant to be. The Big Bang had brewed a primordial soup which just so happened to knock nucleotides together in a way that eventually gave me certain genes whose function was cultivated in a world that was the same set of consequences as the soup from the start. Even if my neurochemistry was a mess, it was the mess that it was always going to be. Candide was at least candid - this was ‘the best of all possible worlds’ - it was the only one.

Thus, The End of History. It’s eternally imminent. Everything has come to this, always. Obviously.

So, suicide made sense. Again, this was long ago and in a different time, but I want to explain how the logic works. Where everything is in its right place (as Thom Yorke might sing) it is so because where things are right now is the only place available to them.

“It is what it is”, as a man once said. He was describing the greatest international tragedy since the wars when he said so.

Why wait? One reaches a point where the only thing coming next is more of the same. Remember how I said it’s a loop? Well, the present is kind of like that, isn’t it. It’s always ‘now’, and ‘now’ is always what happens as a result of what happened.

You know you’re not safe when you continue trying to calculate what speed is required, what angle, and which telegraph pole is toughest when you’re driving at night on a country road. No-one feels responsible for an accident, right? The problem is, one cannot take chances. Failure is not an option.

It was during one of these drives - whilst ‘everything has come to this’ was on replay in my mind, egging me on to end it - that I realised something very helpful:

For the same reason as my fragmented sanity was trying to terminate its tribulation, the logical loop disproved itself. The one thing which it relied on - unchanging repetition of predictable similarity - cannot be the case. The Bang had blown out, the Soup had stirred life, and that fragile and seemingly futile string of minuscule little molecules had made it thus far: becoming something interesting enough to drive a contraption many times faster than it could run. As Heraclitus had said, the only constant was change.

Was I really stepping twice into the same river, as so many friends crossed the Styx? Was it really true that their time was always evidence of mine?

It couldn’t be. Because I could wait. When everything has come to this then ‘this’ is now, and there is nothing beyond it. The voice saying ‘do it’ didn’t even need to speak, because no command is required by what is inevitable. The deathly logic is lying. It must be.

So, I stopped the car. More than a decade ago. That, in itself, was proof enough. Everything came to that. I decided not to die. That was The End of History at that point. It has remained so ever since.

I went to my friend and colleague who cared for me as my GP and told him about the experience. He rightly told me to take some time off work and treated me well for the mental RSI that had wreaked some ruin. Things got better. Stuff that seemed so obvious became more malleable. Rigidity resolved somewhat. Flexibility returned. Eventually, so did fun.

Why tell this story? Because hopefully it helps. A number of people have heard versions of it, especially patients who I hear telling me similar ones. They seem encouraged by it. No one who has heard it is dead yet.

I know we all will be eventually, but after ten years of practice I suppose I’ve begun to appreciate the infinitesimal that makes up the curve rather than just the fatal formula.

Every instant is an end - but every end really is a beginning. That’s the loop - the alpha and the omega. We live within it - and it’s worth doing so.

Just wait, and you’ll see. Everything is always amounting to what is always unknown. Thus, in the future, there is always hope - and always good reason for it. What is apparent now is eroding, but what is ahead is infinitely renewed.

“So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.”

As Heraclitus had said, the only constant was change.\n\nWas I really stepping twice into the same river, as so many friends crossed the Styx? Was it really true that their time was always evidence of mine?\n\nIt couldn’t be. Because I could wait. When everything has come to this then ‘this’ is now, and there is nothing beyond it. The voice saying ‘do it’ didn’t even need to speak, because no command is required by what is inevitable. The deathly logic is lying. It must be.\n\nSo, I stopped the car. More than a decade ago. That, in itself, was proof enough. Everything came to that. I decided not to die. That was The End of History at that point. It has remained so ever since.\n\nI went to my friend and colleague who cared for me as my GP and told him about the experience. He rightly told me to take some time off work and treated me well for the mental RSI that had wreaked some ruin. Things got better. Stuff that seemed so obvious became more malleable. Rigidity resolved somewhat. Flexibility returned. Eventually, so did fun.\n\nWhy tell this story? Because hopefully it helps. A number of people have heard versions of it, especially patients who I hear telling me similar ones. They seem encouraged by it. No one who has heard it is dead yet.\n\nI know we all will be eventually, but after ten years of practice I suppose I’ve begun to appreciate the infinitesimal that makes up the curve rather than just the fatal formula.\n\nEvery instant is an end - but every end really is a beginning. That’s the loop - the alpha and the omega. We live within it - and it’s worth doing so.\n\nJust wait, and you’ll see. Everything is always amounting to what is always unknown. Thus, in the future, there is always hope - and always good reason for it. What is apparent now is eroding, but what is ahead is infinitely renewed.\n\n“So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.”\n\n2 Corinthians\u202c 4:16-18\u202c ESV\u202c\u202c', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.62743333333333
Eleftherios Tserkezis,4y,How did Plato and Aristotle meet?,"We don’t have any account of their first meeting, but we know it took place in Athens, most probably Plato’s Academia, around 365/4 BC.

Plato founded Academia in the mid 380s BC (probably 387 BC), when Aristotle was still a toddler in his home city of Stageira, Macedonia. Plato was about 40 years old by then and had a circle of friends and students who needed a place to study and discuss philosophy. Having inherited some property near the Academy gymnasium, he opened the first official, state-approved philosophical school of ancient Greece. Legally, it was a thiasos in honor of the Muses.

Aristotle came to Athens and enrolled in the Academia in the late spring or early summer of 367 BC. He was 17 or 18 years old and probably thirsty for knowledge. However, so it happened that Plato was not in the city: he had departed for Sicily a few months earlier, probably the early spring of 367 BC.

Plato had friends and acquaintances in Sicily, and had already visited it once in 388 BC, at the invitation of Dionysius I, tyrant of Syracuse. There, he befriended Dion, Dionysius’ brother-in-law, and tried to draw the tyrant to his theories about the philosopher-king, the enlightened monarch. Dionysius wouldn’t listen, though, and Plato was even in danger of losing his life. According to some sources, he was sold as a slave and managed to get back to Athens after quite an adventure.

In 367 BC, Dionysius I died and was succeeded by his son Dionysius II, who was initially under the supervision of Dion. The latter asked Plato to come visit them again, which he did, but this journey was a failure too. Dion and Plato were deemed too subversive by the establishment around the tyrant; Dion was exiled, and Plato was detained for some time, until the Pythagorean philosopher Archytas of Tarentum intervened on his behalf and arranged for his liberation.

In his absence, Plato had left Eudoxus of Cnidus in his place as scholarch ‘head of the school’ of the Academia. Eudoxus was an important thinker and scholar, dedicated mostly to astronomy and mathematics (he also occupied himself with ethics, according to Aristotle). It was under Eudoxus that Aristotle spent his first two or three years of study in the Academia. We can assume that was quite important for his later development, given that his personality was more like Eudoxus’ (positivist, science-oriented) than Plato’s (idealist, poetic).

Plato returned to Athens in 365/4 BC, at which point we can safely assume he met with Aristotle for the first time. Plato was more than 60 years old at the time, and Aristotle about 20. The relationship that started then would be long, fruitful and iconic in the history of philosophy. Aristotle remained in Academia for about 20 years; he left only after Plato’s death and the appointment of Speusippus as the new head of the school.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5d8vcps71jbo6a0w', 'title': 'How did Plato and Aristotle meet?', 'score': {'original': 0.9989, 'ai': 0.0011}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'We don’t have any account of their first meeting, but we know it took place in Athens, most probably Plato’s Academia, around 365/4 BC.\n\nPlato founded Academia in the mid 380s BC (probably 387 BC), when Aristotle was still a toddler in his home city of Stageira, Macedonia.

Benjamin Murphy,3y,Could anyone offer a good explanation for what Frege's Julius Caesar problem is?,"Simple Explanation:

Frege wants to provide a satisfactory definition of numbers. Frege was not a philosopher who became interested in mathematics, he was a mathematician who became interested in philosophy because he was annoyed that, in his opinion, mathematicians did not have a satisfactory answer to the question “What is a number?” Of course, Frege, like all mathematicians, knew what numbers are in the sense that he could use numbers to make calculations and so on, but he was dissatisfied with answer that mathematicians gave when asked to state an explicit definition of what a number is. That’s very important if we are going to understand why Frege cares so much about the Julius Caesar problem.

From a satisfactory definition of numbers, we should be able to derive truths about numbers, like “The number two is the square root of the number 4.” Frege has proposed what looks like a promising definition, because the reader can see that Frege’s definition will enable him to derive lots of truths about numbers. Yay! But then Frege points out that his definition does not enable us to derive the truth of a statement like “The number zero is not Julius Caesar.” Boo! Now of course I know, you know, and Frege knows that Julius Caesar is not the number zero or, indeed, any number. A definition of numbers that implied that Julius Caesar was a number would clearly be wrong. But Frege thinks that a definition of number that fails to imply that Julius Caesar is not a number is not complete.

Imagine a conversation about the number 6. Is it even? Yes, because it is divisible by two. Is it less than ten? Yes. Is it equal to three plus three? Yes. And imagine you can prove all of those things from the way you’ve defined each number. Then you’re asked “And is the number 6 the same as Julius Caesar?” You say “No”, but when I ask you to prove it, instead of using your definition, you say “Well, obviously Julius Caesar is not the number six, because obviously, Julius Caesar is not a number at all.” That’s fine - except the whole point of the definition was that it was supposed to provide us with proofs of the most obvious facts about numbers because it was, after all, supposed to tell us exactly what a number is and, therefore what a number is not. The definition Frege is considering when he advances the Julius Caesar objection fails to do that, and, therefore, he knows that his task is incomplete and there is more work to do.

What definition is being rejected as inadequate?

The previous section helps explain Frege’s motivation when he raises the Caesar problem. But what is the definition of number that he thinks is incomplete?

Frege argues that “the Number of A’s is equal to the Number of B’s” means that it is possible to partner every A with a single B, and every B with a single A. He has a definition of such a relationship between the A’s and B’s that does not make use of the concept of “number”, but rests on the concept of identity. When he introduces this idea, Frege credits the inspiration of David Hume, and so this is sometimes called “Hume’s Principle.” But then, since Frege did the perspiration, it has become more common to call it “Frege’s Theorem.” Anyway, it is a very useful definition. From this starting point, you can prove a lot of things about numbers, so much so that some philosophers have wondered why Frege wanted more.

One philosopher who has wondered about this is Richard Heck, and in answering this question I’m relying on their article “The Julius Caesar Problem” in Heck (ed.) Language, Thought and Logic, (Oxford, 1997). A bit of research revealed that Heck, an expert on philosophy of gender, prefers the pronoun “they”, and also that they sometimes answer questions on philosophy of mathematics on the Ask Philosophers website. AskPhilosophers.org
 They’ve written a couple of books about Frege since the 1997 article that I’m using, so don’t treat this as the latest word.

When he introduces his theorem, Frege compares it to the following definition of “direction.” “Two lines have the same direction if and only if those two lines are parallel.” Based on this definition we know exactly how to tell, when faced with a number of lines, whether those lines share the same direction. Couldn’t we then say that this tells us everything we need to know about directions? To make that claim would be to adopt a reductionist stance to directions, to say “Really, there are no such things as directions. Lines are real things, and some lines are parallel to each other. When we talk about directions, we are talking about nothing but lines and which lines are parallel and which lines are not. It might look as though we’ve introduced another kind of object, a “direction”, but we haven’t really.” Frege is not a reductionist about numbers. He thinks that numbers are real objects - the number 6 is just as real as Julius Caesar, or a line, even though it isn’t Julius Caesar. But, after all, we want to know why he thinks numbers are objects.

The point can be put this way. I can tell whether line A is the same line as line B. I can tell whether the direction of line A is the same as the direction of line B. Can I tell whether line A is the same as the direction of line A? Well, it sounds like I can just rule that out by saying “A line has a direction, but it cannot be a direction. Directions are ways of talking about lines, which are real, but the directions themselves are not real things like lines are.” Why can I not just say that Julius Caesar is an object, but the number 6 is not?

Frege’s answer is that we use numbers to count things, and one of the things that we count are numbers.

Consider the series (0,1,2,3,4). How many numbers are there in that series that are less than 4? The answer is that there are 4 numbers that are less than 4 - (0,1,2,3). So the number of numbers that are less than four is not a number that is less than four, but it is a number - the number 4.

Here then we see the breakdown of the analogy between directions and numbers. Directions are directions of lines. There are no directions of directions. We can say that lines are real and directions merely ways of talking about the lines. There are numbers of objects. But there are numbers of numbers. So that suggests that numbers themselves should be considered as objects.

If we don’t consider directions to be things, then we can say that “Is this line the same as its direction?” does not make sense. But if we are considering numbers to be objects (because what can be counted are objects) then it does make sense to ask whether this object - the number 0 - is the same as that object - Julius Caesar. We know that it is not, but Frege’s Theorem doesn’t tell us why it is not, and so Frege knows his quest is not complete.

Two more points

As Heck points out, for Frege, the fact that we can count numbers is important because he uses it in his proof that there are infinite logical objects.

Suppose we rely entirely on logic to determine how many things exist. We make no use of observations. So we don’t start by assuming anything exists. Maybe nothing exists. We start with nothing, and the number of things we have is 0. But then we now have one thing. We said that the number of things we know to exist is 0, and in saying that, we’ve introduced the number 0. But a number is, after all, a thing. So we’ve got two things, 0 itself and 1, because we said that 0 is 1 thing. But that means we have 3 things, 0,1 and 2 (because we said 0 and 1 were 2 things). But if we have 3 things, then we have 4. That idea - that we can count numbers, and that the number of numbers less than 4 is not a number that is less than 4 - was very important to Frege because it enabled him to advance to infinity. Russell showed why this idea, wonderful as it sounds, doesn’t work out. That leaves Russell and Whitehead with no way of proving the reality of infinity. Frege, when he posed the Julius Caesar question, did not know that Russell would demonstrate that his method of getting to infinity was flawed, he was relying on it. And, in order to rely on this, he has to treat numbers as objects. But if numbers are objects just as Julius Caesar is an object, then it is necessary to solve the Julius Caesar problem.

I should also note that - aside from the problem Russell pointed out - Heck also thinks that Frege is led to the Julius Caesar problem by fallacious reasoning.

Frege supposes that numbers are numbers of objects, and since there are numbers of numbers, numbers must be objects. But, responds Heck, we can use the same kind of numbers for different kinds of objects.

Getting back to those lines and directions. Lines have directions but they cannot be directions. Lines and directions are different types of objects, on different levels of reality. I can draw lines on a page, some parallel and some not, and ask how many different lines I have drawn, and ask you how many different directions I’ve drawn. Assuming some of the lines are parallel, the number of directions will be less than the total number of lines. The fact that I can count both lines and directions doesn’t show that lines and directions belong to the same type - it doesn’t show that it makes sense to ask whether a line is its own direction. But even though I acquired those two numbers - the number of lines and the number of directions - by counting two kinds of things, it doesn’t follow that I have two kinds of number. I already said, after all, that the number of lines would be greater than the number of directions, and I could calculate how many of the lines are parallel by subtracting one from the other.

The Caesar Problem Dispelled

So we can use numbers to count Roman Emperors, and we can use numbers to count numbers. But just because numbers and Roman Emperors are both things we can count, it doesn’t follow that they are both examples of objects, in any meaningful sense. So we don’t need to worry about the Julius Caesar problem any more.

Or maybe we do: “The Julius Caesar Objection” isn’t Heck’s last word on the topic, and I’m sure that many philosophers are not in agreement with Heck anyway. But it provides a neat ending to this particular post.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/w2mofznej9rvtcki', 'title': ""Could anyone offer a good explanation for what Frege's Julius Caesar problem is?"", 'score': {'original': 0.278525, 'ai': 0.721475}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Simple Explanation:\n\nFrege wants to provide a satisfactory definition of numbers.

Frege was not a philosopher who became interested in mathematics, he was a mathematician who became interested in philosophy because he was annoyed that, in his opinion, mathematicians did not have a satisfactory answer to the question “What is a number?” Of course, Frege, like all mathematicians, knew what numbers are in the sense that he could use numbers to make calculations and so on, but he was dissatisfied with answer that mathematicians gave when asked to state an explicit definition of what a number is. That’s very important if we are going to understand why Frege cares so much about the Julius Caesar problem.\n\nFrom a satisfactory definition of numbers, we should be able to derive truths about numbers, like “The number two is the square root of the number 4.” Frege has proposed what looks like a promising definition, because the reader can see that Frege’s definition will enable him to derive lots of truths about numbers. Yay! But then Frege points out that his definition does not enable us to derive the truth of a statement like “The number zero is not Julius Caesar.” Boo! Now of course I know, you know, and Frege knows that Julius Caesar is not the number zero or, indeed, any number. A definition of numbers that implied that Julius Caesar was a number would clearly be wrong. But Frege thinks that a definition of number that fails to imply that Julius Caesar is not a number is not complete.\n\nImagine a conversation about the number 6. Is it even? Yes, because it is divisible by two. Is it less than ten? Yes. Is it equal to three plus three? Yes. And imagine you can prove all of those things from the way you’ve defined each number. Then you’re asked “And is the number 6 the same as Julius Caesar?” You say “No”, but when I ask you to prove it, instead of using your definition, you say “Well, obviously Julius Caesar is not the number six, because obviously, Julius Caesar is not a number at all.” That’s fine - except the whole point of the definition was that it was supposed to provide us with proofs of the most obvious facts about numbers because it was, after all, supposed to tell us exactly what a number is and, therefore what a number is not. The definition Frege is considering when he advances the Julius Caesar objection fails to do that, and, therefore, he knows that his task is incomplete and there is more work to do.\n\nWhat definition is being rejected as inadequate?\n\nThe previous section helps explain Frege’s motivation when he raises the Caesar problem. But what is the definition of number that he thinks is incomplete?\n\nFrege argues that “the Number of A’s is equal to the Number of B’s” means that it is possible to partner every A with a single B, and every B with a single A. He has a definition of such a relationship between the A’s and B’s that does not make use of the concept of “number”, but rests on the concept of identity. When he introduces this idea, Frege credits the inspiration of David Hume, and so this is sometimes called “Hume’s Principle.” But then, since Frege did the perspiration, it has become more common to call it “Frege’s Theorem.” Anyway, it is a very useful definition. From this starting point, you can prove a lot of things about numbers, so much so that some philosophers have wondered why Frege wanted more.\n\nOne philosopher who has wondered about this is Richard Heck, and in answering this question I’m relying on their article “The Julius Caesar Problem” in Heck (ed.) Language, Thought and Logic, (Oxford, 1997). A bit of research revealed that Heck, an expert on philosophy of gender, prefers the pronoun “they”, and also that they sometimes answer questions on philosophy of mathematics on the Ask Philosophers website. AskPhilosophers.org\n They’ve written a couple of books about Frege since the 1997 article that I’m using, so don’t treat this as the latest word.\n\nWhen he introduces his theorem, Frege compares it to the following definition of “direction.” “Two lines have the same direction if and only if those two lines are parallel.” Based on this definition we know exactly how to tell, when faced with a number of lines, whether those lines share the same direction. Couldn’t we then say that this tells us everything we need to know about directions? To make that claim would be to adopt a reductionist stance to directions, to say “Really, there are no such things as directions. Lines are real things, and some lines are parallel to each other. When we talk about directions, we are talking about nothing but lines and which lines are parallel and which lines are not. It might look as though we’ve introduced another kind of object, a “direction”, but we haven’t really.” Frege is not a reductionist about numbers. He thinks that numbers are real objects - the number 6 is just as real as Julius Caesar, or a line, even though it isn’t Julius Caesar. But, after all, we want to know why he thinks numbers are objects.\n\nThe point can be put this way. I can tell whether line A is the same line as line B. I can tell whether the direction of line A is the same as the direction of line B. Can I tell whether line A is the same as the direction of line A? Well, it sounds like I can just rule that out by saying “A line has a direction, but it cannot be a direction. Directions are ways of talking about lines, which are real, but the directions themselves are not real things like lines are.” Why can I not just say that Julius Caesar is an object, but the number 6 is not?\n\nFrege’s answer is that we use numbers to count things, and one of the things that we count are numbers.\n\nConsider the series (0,1,2,3,4). How many numbers are there in that series that are less than 4? The answer is that there are 4 numbers that are less than 4 - (0,1,2,3). So the number of numbers that are less than four is not a number that is less than four, but it is a number - the number 4.\n\nHere then we see the breakdown of the analogy between directions and numbers. Directions are directions of lines. There are no directions of directions. We can say that lines are real and directions merely ways of talking about the lines. There are numbers of objects. But there are numbers of numbers. So that suggests that numbers themselves should be considered as objects.\n\nIf we don’t consider directions to be things, then we can say that “Is this line the same as its direction?” does not make sense. But if we are considering numbers to be objects (because what can be counted are objects) then it does make sense to ask whether this object - the number 0 - is the same as that object - Julius Caesar. We know that it is not, but Frege’s Theorem doesn’t tell us why it is not, and so Frege knows his quest is not complete.\n\nTwo more points\n\nAs Heck points out, for Frege, the fact that we can count numbers is important because he uses it in his proof that there are infinite logical objects.\n\nSuppose we rely entirely on logic to determine how many things exist. We make no use of observations. So we don’t start by assuming anything exists. Maybe nothing exists. We start with nothing, and the number of things we have is 0. But then we now have one thing. We said that the number of things we know to exist is 0, and in saying that, we’ve introduced the number 0. But a number is, after all, a thing. So we’ve got two things, 0 itself and 1, because we said that 0 is 1 thing. But that means we have 3 things, 0,1 and 2 (because we said 0 and 1 were 2 things). But if we have 3 things, then we have 4. That idea - that we can count numbers, and that the number of numbers less than 4 is not a number that is less than 4 - was very important to Frege because it enabled him to advance to infinity. Russell showed why this idea, wonderful as it sounds, doesn’t work out. That leaves Russell and Whitehead with no way of proving the reality of infinity. Frege, when he posed the Julius Caesar question, did not know that Russell would demonstrate that his method of getting to infinity was flawed, he was relying on it. And, in order to rely on this, he has to treat numbers as objects. But if numbers are objects just as Julius Caesar is an object, then it is necessary to solve the Julius Caesar problem.\n\nI should also note that - aside from the problem Russell pointed out - Heck also thinks that Frege is led to the Julius Caesar problem by fallacious reasoning.\n\nFrege supposes that numbers are numbers of objects, and since there are numbers of numbers, numbers must be objects. But, responds Heck, we can use the same kind of numbers for different kinds of objects.\n\nGetting back to those lines and directions. Lines have directions but they cannot be directions. Lines and directions are different types of objects, on different levels of reality. I can draw lines on a page, some parallel and some not, and ask how many different lines I have drawn, and ask you how many different directions I’ve drawn. Assuming some of the lines are parallel, the number of directions will be less than the total number of lines. The fact that I can count both lines and directions doesn’t show that lines and directions belong to the same type - it doesn’t show that it makes sense to ask whether a line is its own direction. But even though I acquired those two numbers - the number of lines and the number of directions - by counting two kinds of things, it doesn’t follow that I have two kinds of number. I already said, after all, that the number of lines would be greater than the number of directions, and I could calculate how many of the lines are parallel by subtracting one from the other.\n\nThe Caesar Problem Dispelled\n\nSo we can use numbers to count Roman Emperors, and we can use numbers to count numbers. But just because numbers and Roman Emperors are both things we can count, it doesn’t follow that they are both examples of objects, in any meaningful sense. So we don’t need to worry about the Julius Caesar problem any more.\n\nOr maybe we do: “The Julius Caesar Objection” isn’t Heck’s last word on the topic, and I’m sure that many philosophers are not in agreement with Heck anyway.

Frederick Dolan,3y,Are there any current philosophers similar to Bertrand Russell?,"What’s distinctive about Russell?

Who today resembles him in these essential respects?

Russell was the author, early in his career, of a groundbreaking work (Principia Mathematica) that helped establish a distinctive approach to philosophy (analytical philosophy) that has endured to the present day.

Not only was Russell a professional philosopher, he was part of the Bloomsbury group, which included many of the most important artists, novelists, poets, and essayists of his day (Clive Bell, Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, T.S. Eliot, and Duncan Grant, among others). The group explored ethical and aesthetic questions in ways inspired by Russell’s approach to philosophy and had a tremendous influence on the wider cultural world.

Russell was an active and well-known public intellectual and political activist. He published popular books on philosophy and other topics, advocated pacifism in World War I, and campaigned for nuclear disarmament and against the Vietnam War, sometimes going to prison as a result. Russell’s Nobel prize in literature (1950) was awarded in recognition, not of his technical philosophical contributions, but for “writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.”

As to living philosophers who are similar to Russell, I can’t think of any that combines each of these characteristics.

There are philosophers who are somewhat well-known for their political advocacy: Peter Singer, Cornel West, and perhaps Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum, and Judith Butler. But they have nothing approaching Russell’s philosophical achievements and influence to their credit, nor is any of them, so far as I know, intimately involved in literature or art.

I can’t identify a single philosopher who is part of a circle that exerts great cultural influence. Perhaps that’s because no such circles exist. Today’s equivalent of the Bloomsbury group would be whoever shapes popular entertainment and lifestyle choices. I don’t even know how to go about determining who those people would be, so I’m not the person to answer this part of the question. But I’m willing to bet that no philosophers will be found among them.

Has any philosopher now living done anything as important as Principia Mathematica and related works, and had as lasting an impact on the profession? Saul Kripke comes immediately to mind. But Kripke isn’t known for his political or artistic engagements, if any.

The answer to the question appears to be “no.”

Kevin Ranji,2y,What is Stoicism?,"There is a great saying that goes by, “You cannot control what happens in your life, but you can control how it affects your life”.

This phrase gives a perfect understanding to the word STOICISM. In a simpler way, every individual have hard times during their life, no matter the scale of their problems, involving finance, employment, race, family etc. Usually people tend to spend their entire energy procrastinating about the issue (not solving it) and end up being anxious and depressed about it. But there are few people who, despite of all the obstacles, care less about it and carry on with their happy life. This is the idea of Stoicism.

The very first idea of stoicism emerged during the Roman empire (Before Christ) by a famous Philosopher Zeno, who after reading the literature of Socrates, coined this Idea. Zeno was a wealthy merchant in Rome who went from riches to rags after his ship, that carried his entire life earning, sank in the ocean. Unlike any individual, after losing their entire fortune he didn’t went on complaining his fate but rather went on discovering the idea of STOICISM. His ideas spread famously around the globe and along the next generations by influencing numerous great individuals, including Nelson Mandela.

There’s no objection to the phrase, “Life is not bed of roses” because it’s 101% true. Everyone has their own problem, some may have hard time getting food on the table for his/her own family while some ,despite of all the wealth, may not have anyone to share it, some may not be able to find true love and some may have stopped believing in true love, some may be trying hard to make some friends while some may just be trying to get out of a toxic relationship, some may be failing continuously to achieve what they want in life while some may not able to decide their purpose. Any individual who would be in any of the above situation would most commonly complain and curse his/her life, complain and blame others for this dreadful experience and might even end their own life. But what comes after all these reactions? Does our life become any better?

A human without any problem is a myth. We care a lot about our emotions and external environment, which apparently makes us vulnerable to all the darkness of life. A person is unhappy not because of his trouble, but due to his judgement and outlook. But what’s the use of spending our entire energy on thinking about our problems. It never gets resolved by procrastination. Instead, try treating your obstacles, your worries with a sense of detachment. Don’t let the miseries that come to your life take control over you. You don’t have the capability to stop all the disasters that come to you, but you though have the ability to control the way you react to it. I heard a quote once stating, “The best revenge against anything, is to give no attention to it”. Whenever you have any problem, may it be in your relationship, work or personal, rather than brooding about it, devote your time and energy in either making it better again. Concentrate your locus of control on your emotions and actions and treat your obstacles as if they don’t affect you in anyways.

Many people might not agree with the idea of STOICISM and might rather consider it as a idea easy to preach but difficult to practice.

In what way did Socrates prove it?","The Oracle didn’t say that Socrates was “the smartest of all.” That’s how Socrates interpreted the Oracle, but it isn’t what she said.

The Oracle was asked whether anyone was wiser than Socrates, and she replied that no one was wiser than Socrates.

This statement is compatible with everyone being as wise as Socrates, with Socrates being no wiser than anyone, and with no one, including Socrates, being very wise at all.

Yet Socrates chose to understand the Oracle to say that he was “the wisest,” which launched him on his mission of questioning those who purported to have wisdom and led him to discover the sense in which he knew something that others didn’t.

Plato obviously knew that the statement he put into the mouth of the Oracle, and the one he put into the mouth of Socrates, were not equivalent. What he intended by this discrepancy is unclear.

Hubert Tremblay,Updated 2y,How do I get started with philosophy? Which books are the best to begin with?,"I have studied philosophy for six years at university and have been teaching philosophy for almost twenty years and I am sorry to say that I disagree with most of the answers given here.

Most of the works suggested here are undeniably important in the history of philosophy. But to this day, I, as a specialist, have a hard time figuring out most of them. Sure, Plato’s Republic and Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason are extremely important books. But a beginner will not be able to grasp the meaning of these works and will probably get bored very quickly and move on thinking that philosophy is hard and boring.

I will admit to something here that most people will not: even though I have been into philosophy for twenty-five years, I have yet to complete my reading of Plato’s Republic and Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. And that’s taking into account that I have completed forty-five-hour courses on each of these works individually as part of my bachelor’s degree in philosophy. That being the case, what chance would a beginner have?

I strongly believe that anyone interested in philosophy should work at cultivating their interest and avoid at all cost getting frustrated and turned off by actually reading philosophy. Hence, I would not recommend primary sources at the first stage of one’s journey. My advice would be:

Start with short contemporary books or articles about philosophy or the history of philosophy. The Oxford University Press Very Short Introductions
 series would be a good place to start.
Read a little bit of everything to find out what interests you the most. Once you have a better idea, start checking entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
 but try to keep an open mind and keep reading a little bit of everything anyway.
Once you feel like you’re interested enough into something more specific (an author or a subject) move on to something like the Cambridge Companions
 series. In these, you will find articles about specific subjects written by renowned specialists. They will mention primary sources that could be interesting for you to move on to next.
Slowly move to primary sources, trying not to go for the most difficult works at first. For example, reading Plato, start with shorter dialogues instead of going straight for Republic. Alternatively, you could start with specific chapters mentioned in the Companions instead of whole books. The same would go for any author.
From there, repeat the process with different subjects and authors. Your knowledge will slowly grow and you will eventually start making more and more connections between ideas, authors, eras and topics and be able to keep going on your own.

By making sure you don’t burn out right from the get-go because of the difficulties one can easily encounter while reading philosophy, you’ll have a better chance to keep at it for a long time and your initial curiosity will hopefully turn into something very satisfying.

Steven Ussery,3y,Who is your favorite philosopher in history?,"Interesting question. I like Diogenes the Cynic (circa 412 - 323 B.C.). It’s not that I subscribe to his philosophy, I’m more of a Platonist or an Aristotelian. However, Diogenes is the most colorful, unusual, and damn funny philosopher among those who ever lived. The following image is a painting of Diogenes in ancient Corinth by the British pre-raphaelite artist John Waterhouse. It depicts Diogenes being taunted by the Corinthian courtesans who were legendary for their beauty. (They were high-class prostitutes that were pursued by the wealthy and affluent.) It’s too bad that they didn’t know that they weren’t nearly as beautiful as the man they made fun of.

Let me give you some examples that show why I admire Diogenes.

After Alexander the Great had conquered much of the known world of his time he was visiting in Corinth and heard of the famous philosopher, Diogenes. So, he excitingly sought him out in the marketplace. He found Diogenes dressed in his usual rags, napping near the large wooden tub that he normally slept in, and sprawled across the open air steps of a temple. After standing there for a while, Diogenes finally noticed him and opened his eyes.

Alexander said: “Greetings, I am Alexander the Great.”

Diogenes answered, “And, I am Diogenes the dog (cynic, Greek for dog)”, after which he closed his eyes again.

Taken aback at this response, Alexander asked him: “Is there anything within my power that I can do for you?”

To which Diogenes opened his eyes and replied: “Yes, you can move to one side. You’re blocking my sun.” And, then he once again closed his eyes.

As he was leaving, Alexander said to his followers: “Now, that, gentlemen, is a truly great man!”

A further example: Diogenes would sometimes wander about the crowded marketplace in ancient Athens with a lighted lantern in broad daylight looking all around him as if looking for something. When someone asked him what he was looking for he would reply, “An honest man.”

And, yet another example: Hearing that Plato’s academy was teaching classification of animals and had defined man as a “featherless biped.” He went to the academy and shouted “Here is Plato’s man.” and then threw a plucked chicken over the wall.

And one more: After learning that the philosopher Zeno was teaching that motion was not really possible, he went to the lecture hall and started wandering around the hall in between the students and Zeno. When one of the students asked him to stop moving about he said, “How dare you dispute your master!”

And, there many other similar stories. He liked to make his points with humor.

After he died, the Corinthians erected a giant bronze statue of a dog that stood at the gates of the city over Diogenes’ tomb for 500 years. In fact, the Roman philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero wrote about seeing it 200 years later. It disappeared later in history with the destruction of the city just over a millennia ago.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1b9n8awsiz3vyjp0', 'title': 'Who is your favorite philosopher in history?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Interesting question.

Nick Nielsen,Updated 3y,Who are the all-time greatest philosophers of history?,"Who are the all-time greatest philosophers of history?

There is an ambiguity in the question (as with most Quora questions), as “all-time greatest philosophers of history” could mean the greatest philosophers ever, or it could mean the greatest philosophers of history, specifically, i.e., those philosophers who have focused on the explication of history and the philosophical problems of history. I will focus on this second sense, since the other answers to the question take the question in the first sense.

St. Augustine (above) represents the origin of the philosophy of history in the western tradition, and his City of God remains a classic in the philosophy of history.

Ibn Khaldun wrote a great treatise during the Middle Ages, The Muqaddimah, which is a philosophy of history, among other things.

Johann Gottfried Herder wrote several works on the philosophy of history that reflected the conflicting interests of the Enlightenment and the Romantic era. Herder is not much read today, but if you take the time to read him you will find some strikingly modern ideas.

G. W. F. Hegel has been, hands down, the most influential philosophy of history, and those whom Hegel influenced (like Marx) have gone on to leave their own influence upon the philosophy of history. Hegel’s Lectures on the Philosophy of History is a classic, even if today it appears rather implausible. Even if you don’t read the whole thing, the Introduction is still valuable, especially the distinction between original history, reflective history, and philosophical history, and how Hegel develops that distinction.

R. G. Collingwood has, in my opinion, produced one of the most sophisticated philosophies of history, and he represents something of an outlier as the philosophy of history has not been popular among Anglo-American philosophers.

Arthur Danto wrote one of the first analytical philosophies of history, and so made philosophy of history more palatable to Anglo-American philosophers in the analytical tradition. His work on the logic of narrative sentences is important and influential.

Some would count Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee as philosophers of history, rather than being historians simpliciter; I think that, of the two, Spengler has the better claim to have said something interesting and original.

W. H. Walsh and William Dray have been influential because both wrote introductory textbooks that have been widely used, and, as a result, are widely available.

There are, of course, many other philosophers of history, but the above names provide the basic framework within which others have worked.

Jim Langcuster,1y,Why should I read philosophy by Friedrich Nietzsche or Kant as opposed to the Bible or Quran? The holy books too offer some interesting view points as well as history.,"Friedrich Nietzsche

By all means read all of them - reading any text that has the potential to enhance one's knowledge of the moral and ethical underpinnings that we humans have improvised over eons is time well spent.

Indeed, that is why a reading of Kant and Nietzsche provide such interesting complementary reading to the Bible and the Koran. The writings of these two thinkers supply keen in insights into the genealogy of the human struggle to understand our place in existence. While they don't provide a complete genealogy, they do shed fascinating insights into the nature of this struggle and some of the challenges that we have encountered along the way.

Kant conceived his philosophy in an age of increasing doubt, albeit before the advent of Charles Darwin and David Strauss. Though not orthodox, despite being from a strict, observant Lutheran family, he nevertheless appreciated the values that religion historically had imparted to people. Yet, he believed that the times called for a new way of securing the benefits of religion, one based on a rational philosophy.

Neitzsche provides a remarkable contrast to Kant as the philosopher who followed Charles Darwin and David Strauss, both of whom had developed new disciplines - new modes of inquiry - that seriously challenged conventional narratives pointing to a reality that lies beyound human perception. Nietzsche even perceived these new insights as serving to erode the conventional bases of of ethics and morality, effectively resulting in the “death of God.” He even posited that this required the formation of a new system ethics and morality, one far removed from the “slave morality” of Christianity.

We in the 21st century still grapple with the challeges raised by these two men, both of whom in widely disparate ways, challenged the entreaties and enticements of conventional religion.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/t7k9y3fca6umjp8o', 'title': 'Why should I read philosophy by Friedrich Nietzsche or Kant as opposed to the Bible or Quran?

Oreste Papadopol,Updated 10mo,Why was the Greek the center of philosophy?,"Because unlike Sumerians, Romans, Israelites, Babylonians, Egyptians, Celts and others, Greeks had no priestly class, like druids or college of pontiffs for example. Their religion had no formal structure. Their religion was not recorded in sacred texts and hieroglyphs. In the Greek religion, anybody could become a priest without having to climb up the social ladder. Their religion was just transmitted through poets orally.

What does all that mean and how is this relevant to the question? People were free in Greece to turn to reason as the intellectual landscape in their society was not controled by an elite priestly class. It’s true that Socrates was killed by the Athenians accused of Atheism and for having preached against the traditional gods, but Socrates would have not lasted even that long till getting executed if he were to live in Egypt or Gaul instead of Greece. The druids or Egyptian priests would have killed him much earlier from the moment he uttered his first words against the gods. In Greece, searching a philosophical, rational, or natural explanation to the universe rather than conforming to the mythical one, was only a threat to poets who were just average Joes. If you did that in Egypt though, or Sumer, you were threatening the priestly elite and that would get you killed almost instantly.

Thus just because philosophy developed in Ancient Greece and not in Gaul, Egypt or Babylon doesn’t mean there were no philosophy inclined people there. It just means they were either keeping their thoughts private or that they had a much shorter life expectancy than those in Greece, not enough to spread their thoughts.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ygn5jexapmzws3h8', 'title': 'Why was the Greek the center of philosophy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Because unlike Sumerians, Romans, Israelites, Babylonians, Egyptians, Celts and others, Greeks had no priestly class, like druids or college of pontiffs for example.

Benjamin Murphy,3y,Can we consider Dostoevsky a philosopher?,"Definitely. Many philosophers write as though Ivan Karamazov, one of Dostoyevsky’s creations, were a real person and a significant figure who made an important contribution to philosophy. Of course, I don’t mean to imply that philosophers don’t know that Ivan was a fictional character, but that his fictional status doesn’t make him insignificant, just as it doesn’t matter whether or not Socrates actually said all the stuff that Plato has him say in The Republic. In fact, Dostoyevsky’s own views are quite different from Ivan’s, and you don’t understand The Brothers Karamazov (in my opinion) unless you see how the book as a whole is intended as a refutation of Ivan.

In my estimation, not only was Dostoyevsky a philosopher, he was a great philosopher.

Mats Andersson,1y,Was Karl Marx a genius even if he was wrong on the big picture?,"Marx had a brilliant analysis of the shortcomings of the capitalist system. Most economists agree on this. What many economists say he got wrong was the solutions.

And it’s not even certain that he was all that much off on the solutions. It’s just that people have insisted on implementing them in societies Marx would have said were eminently unsuited for it. And, of course, the technology and our societies have by now evolved to a point where some of it stops making sense.

Remember: Marx said that the revolution that would end in communism would probably start in the UK, since that was the most industrialised society in his day. He would have laughed at the idea that Russia or China could implement his solutions; they had agrarian societies that needed a bourgeois revolution first, and then a long transition before they were ready for communism.

In Marx’ eyes, we are most likely not yet ready for the revolution.

And, of course, the revolution is much less likely to be violent than Marx imagined. As it turns out, the ruling class does give up its power more or less willingly, as soon as they realise they can either lose their power, or lose both their power and their heads. The rise of the middle class was also something he didn’t anticipate.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/eal1db5z73iroc9j', 'title': 'Was Karl Marx a genius even if he was wrong on the big picture?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Marx had a brilliant analysis of the shortcomings of the capitalist system.

Caleb Beers,3y,Is Ayn Rand’s Objectivist philosophy basically recycled Nietzsche?,"No.

If you’re not terribly familiar with either thinker, it can be tempting to lump them together. Both are vaguely right-wing atheists with some degree of individualism. If you’re not right-wing yourself, they might look the same to you. “Nietzsche and Rand are both, like, evil capitalists, right?”

The thing is, besides being individualistic and inducing an allergic reaction in (some) left-wingers, there’s not much similarity between Nietzsche and Ayn Rand. In fact, it’s hard to even write this answer because it’s like trying to explain why an apple is different from a Ford Focus. They’re just… not the same thing at all, except that both of them are occasionally red.

Rand believes that rationality has all the answers and that all questions can be definitively answered rationally. Nietzsche does not. Nietzsche thinks that morality boils down to conflict and Will to Power. Rand does not. Rand thinks that her philosophy is obvious and anyone who thinks it through clearly will agree. Nietzsche thinks his philosophy is arcane and only people with fine minds can understand it. Rand believes that reality is exactly one really obvious thing that people deny out of moral turpitude. Nietzsche thinks that even talking about reality as “one thing” is a lost cause. Rand thinks that capitalism is obviously the best system. Nietzsche doesn’t really give a flying rat’s ass about the economy. Nietzsche had a moustache and Rand didn’t. Et cetera.

In the final analysis, I find Rand a tad superficial. Both of them were egotistical; Rand thought her philosophy was completely obvious and that if you disagreed, you were just in denial or stupid. Nietzsche thinks that there are no facts, only interpretations, which gives him an awful lot of room to make the interpretations he wants. They’re both arrogant pricks. It’s just that Nietzsche is much more subtle about it.

Anbazhagan Ambrose,3y,What are the best books on philosophy for beginners?,"Follow this sequence:

Sophie’s World by Jostein Gaarder - This is THE best book on philosophy for beginners. I would consider my life complete if I can write a book like this. This will be the first book I give to my daughter when she is old enough.
The Story of Philosophy, Will Durant - Gives a very detailed overview of Western philosophy.
History of Western Philosophy, Bertrand Russell - Once you have done the above, go for Russell. As a philosopher himself, Russell gives a CRITICAL commentary of Western philosophy.

These three books will be the base. Then you dive into individual areas of philosophy (of which there are many) and you can use “Very Short Introduction” series to get an excellent overview about them. I mean stuff like phenomenology, metaphysics, philosophy of science etc.

Once you complete these books, you will have a fair idea about your area of interest (mine is epistemology). Then you start picking up specialized books on that area.

When you are starting out, concentrate on secondary works on philosophy and get a good foundation. Primary works are very difficult to read for beginners and may frustrate and keep you away philosophy. Philosophers like Heidegger even scare off core philosophy students :)

If you are a science guy trying to get into philosophy, I strongly recommend Thomas Kuhn’s “Structure of Scientific Revolutions”.

Vaibhav Narula,2y,Are there more similarities or more differences between Indian philosophy and medieval philosophy?,"There are points of convergence and differences between the two. Indian philosophy like Western Medieval philosophy was dominated by religious considerations that shaped the development of philosophy accordingly. In the Hindu tradition contra Christianity, the world is not taken to have a first beginning, ex nihilo nihil fit holds true. The world is held to be eternal though it passes through cycles of submersion and emergence from time to time. And even Buddhism does not subscribe to the view that the world had a first beginning. Another important philosophical difference is regarding the nature of the soul. While Medievals could subscribe to the Aristotelian view that soul is the form of the body, the Hindu philosophers held the difference between soul and body to be of paramount importance since only if the soul could survive the destruction of the body could it transmigrate and be reborn in the next life with a different body. This is an important point of contention between Hindu and Buddhists philosophers, the latter even though they did not believe in a soul separate from the five skandhas or the body-mind complex, did believe in rebirth and karma nevertheless. Hindu philosophers emphasized against this view that till soul is not taken to be an independent substance that actually transmigrates all talk of karma and nirvana become meaningless because the same soul which is the agent of an action must reap the fruit of those actions in another birth or there will be a discrepancy between reward for the action and the one who deserves the reward or the punishment which is destructive of the moral order in the universe. Third, beginning with the influence of Asharites most on display in Al-Ghazzali’s Tahafut-Al-Falsifa Islam believed that the source of every action in the natural world is God himself who actually wills something to happen. There is nothing in the fire that makes it burn (note how this anticipates Hume), the two are rather associated together by God’s Will. At once this undermines the rationality of the universe and the cause-effect relation. However traces of this view are found even in Medieval Christian philosophy, more so in St Bonaventure and less in St Thomas Aquinas. The controversy as a matter of fact continues even in Modern Philosophy between occasionalists like Malebranche and other philosophers like Leibniz. Hindus and even Buddhists in this regard however believe that there is an autonomous moral order in the universe that is independent of God. In the Hindu tradition God is the regulator of this order rather than its creator. This fact is hardly appreciated among Hindus themselves. Shankaracharya in his commentary on the Brahma Sutras for instance says contra Buddhists that by themselves the fruits of an action cannot find the agent of the action and hence the regulation of the law is made possible by Ishvara or God. But it is the functioning of the order rather than the existence of the order that is due to God and even in this view he is not followed by other Hindu schools of thought most notably Purva Mimamsa, which believes that every karma creates a supernatural event which is self-implementing. This supernatural order is what they Dharma which beyond the purview of reason and perception. This can also be seen in two most prominent views of causation in Indian philosophy. First is Satkaryavada versions of which were subscribed by Vedanta schools of thought, the effect is pre-existent in the cause and is partly identical with the cause. It may be noted in this regard that the equality of cause and effect was an important theorem on the basis of which Leibniz argued against occasionalism. Asatkaryavada, different versions of this view were held by Nyaya and Buddhists philosophers. Its basic premise is Humean, the cause and effect are different from each other but Nyaya believed in universals and causation as a law that holds between two universals, fire and smoke for instance which explains the uniformity and regularity of the relation between cause and effect in the natural world. These laws are primitive and are not set up by God. Even the Jaina school believes that the world is eternal and self-sustaining and lacks a creator though they do believe in existence of God though not a creator God. The Jaina view is peculiar, they believe that all our philosophical problems arise from over emphasis on one aspect of reality like change over another like rest, reality as such is all inclusive and every proposition is valid from a point of view, the law of excluded middle notwithstanding.

The development of Indian philosophy was to a great extent due to the conflict between heterodox schools like Buddhism and Jainism and orthodox or Hindu schools of thought. With the advent of Dignaga a neutral sphere for discussion of logical and epistemological issues was created but nevertheless it was not uninfluenced by sectarian concerns. The challenge of Idealism was felt in the West only with the advent of Modern Philosophy with Descartes, to a lesser extent it was felt in the conflict with Latin Averroism with Siger of Brabant and Averroes’s own views to contend with. But in the context of Indian philosophy the realist-idealist controversy has a long history which began a few centuries post the birth of Buddhism and most prominently with Yogachara Buddhism. Also scepticism was taken a lot more seriously than it was in the Medieval philosophy in the West. The Madhyamaka school of Buddhism headed by Nagarjuna makes arguments very similar to Zeno of Elea and Sextus Empiricus. Add to that the materialist school of Charvakas whose arguments against inference reminds one of Hume and Mill.

But the most important issue for Medieval philosophy was the question of proving the existence of God and concomitant problem of the relation between reason and faith. Now it may be noted that in Indian philosophy there are no equivalent theories of pure-reason and difference between form and matter. There is no Sanskrit equivalent word for the thematic word reason and if later terminology be employed what Indian philosophy had was a theory of understanding. Since there is prama (right knowledge) there are pramanas (sources of right knowledge) and there is pramanya or that in virtue of which a cognitive state of consciousness qualifies as a pramana. The cause in this case is a particular empirical event like the contact of the axe that leads to the cutting of the tree and so is called karana or instrumental cause. In the case of perception for instance, the contact of the sense-organs with the object (sense-organs for these schools of thought did not mean the physical sense organ but a constitutive material stuff behind the physical organs that actually made contact with the object. Similar theories about vision were held as early as Al-Kindi in the Western world), is the karana or the cause of prama, pramana being the instrumental cause. Pramana by definition is the cause of right knowledge and so there cannot be deviating pramana. The epistemological aspect comes with theories of pramanya, questions arise, is valid knowledge produced intrinsically to a cognitive event or extrinsically, Mimamsa held that knowledge is self-valid, consciousness always reveals its object unerringly while Nyaya held that it is due to correspondence between a cognitive state and an external object which is a kind of a virtue, that leads to validity of knowledge. The question is what causes are implicated in the production of knowledge and in the validity of knowledge or whether the latter requires additional cause. Similar question arises regarding the apprehension of knowledge, whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic. Mimamsa holds since knowledge is accompanied by certainty and absence of doubt, validity is apprehended intrinsically at the moment of production of knowledge. For Nyaya school, it depends on an inference from successful action (in picking up a fruit in front of one for instance) to validity of knowledge. So the epistemological problems posed by Indian philosophers was 1. What is right knowledge and is there right knowledge? 2. What are the causes of right knowledge? 3. What are the causes of the validity of knowledge and how is it apprehended? 4. How many sources of right knowledge are there and how to determine whether they are independent sources of knowledge? 5. What are the prameyas or the object of right knowledge?

Now most schools of thought believed that perception, inference and scriptural testimony are sources of right knowledge. But inference cannot be an independent source of knowledge in the sense that its object is something beyond what senses can furnish. For instance in the inference wherever there is smoke, there is fire, the inference rests on observed concomitance between fire and smoke. Without this observation no inference is possible. Inference is still a different source of knowledge than perception because the mode of apprehension is different, there is fire on the hill, is inferred from smoke which is perceived whereas the fire is not so perceived. This naturally leads to a problem, what kind of rational connection is found between the probans and the probandum of an inference that allows us to infer one from another. The answer that comes closest to the rationalist spirit is Nyaya, that the universals are in these cases connected in a law-like manner. For Buddhism there are two relations, identity like between a particular genus of a tree and an individual instance and cause-effect. However Nyaya also admits regular association like between the presence of one star and another as a valid form of inference. Now similar restrictions are found on scriptural testimony which also is said to depend in one way or another on sense-perception. Scriptural testimony is a form is sentential or verbal cognition. When I hear the words of someone reliable who reports an event truthfully to me, then a verbal and valid cognition is formed within me even though I have not verified that information or given a second-order justification. The truthfulness of the words and the belief that the speaker is trustworthy are themselves sufficient for the hearer to have a valid cognition. But Mimamsa believes that the condition of an apta or a trustworthy person is unnecessary and specially so in the case of Vedas since they are authorless. Note that in Mimamsa epistemology the condition of validity of knowledge is not correspondence with an object which anyways in case of Scriptures in supernatural reality or an inference from successful action. Scriptures according to them are a distinct source of knowledge because they give us knowledge of an entirely different region of reality not accessible to us either by perception or inference. Their arguments you can consider are similar to William Alston’s which seek to justify religious experience and consider such experience to give us knowledge. Advaita Vedanta goes still further and regards that verbal knowledge can be perceptual, for instance in a story where a man counts nine members of the group but forgets to count himself and so mistakenly believes that there is a missing person, someone reminds him that you are the tenth man, which leads to perceptual knowledge that he is the missing person. Kashmir Shaivism is a school of thought that does believe that through reason and reflection knowledge of ultimate reality may become known and scriptures are merely a heuristic aid.

This also has repercussions on the topic of proof of existence of God. Even Vedanta school like Dvaita who holds similar monotheistic views like Christianity does not believe we can prove the existence of God through inference and scriptures are the sole authority in this regard. Vedanta schools of thought use reason to interpret scriptures together with hermeneutic rules of textual interpretation formulated by Purva Mimamsa school. Their problem is to solve the issue of the relation between God or Brahman and the soul and the world. Advaita Vedanta believes that Brahman is formless and the sole reality, individual selves and the world are an illusion - they are neither existence since the mark of existence is not being capable of sublation or non-contradiction but in the case of the world its end can be conceived, nor is the world non-existent since it is perceived to exist, its existence however is sublated by knowledge of Brahman like the snake in the rope-snake illusion. Vishishta-advaita believes that Brahman is the world soul and and individual souls and the world are its body. Dvaita believes that Brahman and the individual souls and the world are different from each other. God could have created the world from nothing but since prakriti or material stuff already exists co-eval with God, he merely sets it in motion to develop according to its inner constitution into the world we know. A similar view is held by Nyaya, only in this case there is no prakriti but atoms which have to be conjoined together and the start they get is from God. Nyaya is the only school of thought that believes that we can rationally prove the existence of God. The primary argument they give is what is called the design argument, the inference is just as we see that a pot must have been made from a human intelligent agency who knew how to manipulate the relevant materials to form a pot, the world is similarly made by an intelligent God who know the materials from which to create the world.

Medieval Western philosophers believed in the possibility of natural theology like Nyaya. St Thomas believes that the existence of God can be known through reason but God himself cannot be known because any essence can be known only through existence accessible to us through sense-perception. Since God’s essence is not given through sense-perception we cannot know it. God’s attributes can be inferred through analogy with the world. Maimonides did not however hold even as much arguing for radical incommensurability between creatures and creator similar to Advaita Vedanta’s manner of arguing though he did not regard the world as unreal like Advaitins did. For St Thomas philosophy leaves an angst that it cannot fulfill but which is fulfilled only in beautific vision of God. This view is similar to Dvaita’s except that the latter does not even grant the possibility of a natural theology. Even in the West there have been those who argue that God is inaccessible through reason but known only by faith. There is no conception of faith in Hinduism but the belief in supernatural validity of scriptures is similar. However belief in scriptures comes prior to what knowledge can be gained through them and so a is a pre-requisite for the study of scriptures. This much however is sufficient however to give a broad overview of the two traditions.

Why were ancient Indians not as much as critical thinker as the ancient Greek philosophers were, when Greek philosophers believed in demigods but still they looked for logical reason behind stuff?
Unfortunately two types of views are prevalent about Indian Philosophy both at two extremes. One sees it as devoid of rationality and completely spiritual and also dogmatic. Another sees every virtue between heaven and earth within it. The Ancient Indian Rishis according to them knew everything about everything. All modern scientific discoveries were already discovered by them and hence we have nothing to do today except study old scriptures for information - not knowledge. It is a peculiar situation where modern science strive to discover something new and these people strive to discover that something new is something old. They don’t know what next discovery would be made but they know that the scriptures already know about them. As a result they have no spirit of discovery of truth and no sense of independence. They only want to smart in someone’s else’s knowledge - abdicating all responsibilities for error. Unfortunately no one becomes great because he has great ancestors. You have to do something yourself. Both these views are evidently wrong yet very prevalent. As for the first one - a cursory glance at the primary literature is sufficient to prove it wrong. As for the second - these people too do not have much knowledge of primary literature either of the East or the West but usually rely on a third person to inform or misinform them about both. Since I have criticized the first view at length before (in the links given below); here I am going to concentrate on the second at the same time to bring to light the similarities and differences between Eastern And Western Philosophy and determine the limits of critical thinking in the former: Vaibhav Narula's answer to What is the essence of Indian philosophy? Vaibhav Narula's answer to Does Indian Philosophy resemble religious ways of thought (""ways of life"") more than Western Philosophy does? To begin with lets use two themes - transcendence and immanence. The former is the view that the ultimate truth about the world is beyond reason whereas the latter sees God or the ultimate reality to be not beyond reason but immanent or in the world and hence God is in a way not supernatural but part of nature but regarded as a whole. This will become clear in what follows. Here we may note that there much subtlety is possible here and different philosophers have tried to balance the demands of transcendence and immanence in different ways. If we look at the beginning of Indian Philosophy we find different views in Upanishads, Buddhism, Jaina and Materialists like Charvakas or Lokayatas or Ajivikas. This is however a broad classification. Upanishads seek to find that one ultimate reality beyond the visible world and hence their philosophy is largely transcendent. But the manner of exposition uses critical discussion between teacher and student and we find use of logic within the Upanishads especially in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. Buddha asked his disciples to weigh what he says but not simply through logic but also within experience. His philosophy is not a quest to search after the ultimate truth but to achieve cessation of suffering through nirvana. But nirvana and karma and rebirth are not views one acquires through ordinary empirical experience and hence we can see Buddhism too has an aspect of transcendence. That the Indian tradition as a whole is predisposed towards transcendence can be seen in the basic differences between Indian and Western Philosophy. The first difference - a) Indian Philosophy took philosophy to be exclusively a Moksha-Shastra and what led to Moksha was not reason or rational argumentation but practice of Yoga or something akin to it. Hence the role of reason was relegated to the interpretation of scriptures. In the Vedanta system specially ultimate truths could be known only though scriptural testimony. In other systems like Nyaya-Vaisesika which you expect to be more scientific and rational you find that the school classifies itself as a Moksha Shastra. Other schools of thought used to make jokes at the expense of Nyaya philosophers since a school of thought concerned with study of pramanas, logical fallacies, discussions could not have anything to do with Moksha. However in a later age referred to as the Sutra Period - the different schools of thought as we know today began to form and there was huge competition between these schools of thoughts. Debates used to be conducted and if an adherent of one school of thought could defeat a famous teacher of another school then the fame of that school used to spread throughout. Even though the study of logic was developed intricately in Nyaya and is a worthy topic of study even today - logic was used as a tool to further the interests of different sects and hence philosophers became scholars. Nyaya to some extent did attempt to use reason in an independent way and it is the only school of Indian philosophy that developed a proof of the existence of God. But these were unacceptable to Vedanta systems. Vedanta-Desika or Venkatanatha the famous scholar of Vishishta-advaita school criticizes both the Sankhya deduction of categories of Prakriti and the Nyaya proofs for the existence of God. Even though the Dvaita school conception of God and Nyaya’s theory are very similar even then Vyasatirtha in his Tarka-Tandava criticizes the Nyaya proof for the existence of God. We can notice in this case that over-emphasizing transcendence leads to shrinking the territory of philosophy while adding to that of religion where ultimately the former can co-exist with the latter by only becoming subordinate to it. The most classic case of transcendence in Indian Philosophy is the Advaita school of Vedanta. There is no rational connection between Brahman and the world and the nature of Brahman is identical to the absence of the world. Advaita does conceive Brahman to be the material cause of the world but by this it means that Brahman is the substratum of the world-illusion. However this character of being-the-substratum is also false like the world-illusion. In Nyaya-Amrita Vyasatirtha raises the objection - is the falsity of the world false or is it true? If false then through use of law of double-negation it is proved that the world is real and if true then there is something that exists besides Brahman and hence non-duality is violated. To this Madhusudana replies in his Advaita Siddhi that the falsity of the world is also false but this falsity is identical with the nature of Brahman and hence the law of double-negation does not apply in this case. To this Ramatirtha in his Tarangini rebukes that it is utterly inconceivable that Brahman which is of the nature of negation of the world can be its material cause. Advaita’s Brahman is completely transcendent that it cannot have any connection with the world without compromising its transcendence - hence the theory of Ajati-vada. Another effect that taking philosophy to be exclusively a Moksha-Shastra can be seen in this - Indian Mathematics and Indian Astronomy was well developed atleast before the beginning of the Medieval period and names like Aryabhatta and Brahmagupta are familiar to many. Dr Brajendranath Seal’s book ‘Positive Sciences Of The Hindus’ gives a very balanced picture of the achievement of Indian sciences. Even in the Medieval period while Indian science ceased to grow - mathematics was more fortunate as can be seen in the works of Kerala School of Mathematics. This later school is also credited to be the discoverer of the differential calculus that was discovered in the West by Leibniz and Newton. However the point is no school of Indian thought not even Nyaya-Vaisesika discuss the cosmological theories of Aryabhatta et al. Unlike Leibniz who used the differential calculus in his philosophy; no such attempt was made in Indian Philosophy. Why did these Moksha-Shastras neglect scientific advances of contemporary Indian scientists and mathematicians? The only reason is that sectarianism was becoming more and more rampant in Indian Philosophy. Its effect in epistemological sphere can be gleaned from Claus Oetke’s article ‘Limitations Of The Theories Of Pramanas’. Another effect this had was in the choice of topics. Indian philosophers hardly discuss secular matters of everyday life and political philosophies and also literary discussions (hardly any Indian philosoher discusses Kalidasa in a way Hegel does Antigone and also see that nothing stopped Aristotle from discussion Poetics and Rhetorics but these subjects did not concern Moksha for Indian philosophers) and their practical teachings all concern the mode of attaining Moksha. The only exceptions are Charaka-Samhita and the Mahabharata. But on the whole major Indian schools of thought did not discuss how to achieve a good life in this very world as the Greeks did. Also Indian philosophers despised claims of originality. They always attribute their innovations to the founders of the school of thought not just out of reverence to them but as a necessity. As an example I may cite that in his Nyaya-Amrita Vyasatirtha made a claim of some originality in matters of logic and epistemology. But as can be seen from the passages of some commentaries cited in Michael William’s article ‘Vyasatirtha And Navya Naiyayikas’, one can see that this did not go down well with his commentators who try to explain away any claims to originality since it implies that there was something that Madhva-Acharya did not know. Another example of rampant sectarianism in Indian philosophy can be seen in the work of someone no less than Adi Shankaracharya himself. In his commentary on his teacher’s teacher Gaudapada’s commentary on Mandukya Upanishad he deliberately twists a reference Gaudapada made about Buddha which said that the teachings of the Upanishads and the Buddha are in harmony. In his commentary Shankara changes it to the effect that the these Truths are not the same as taught by Buddha. Modern Advaitins go a step further and they struck a deal with the Vaishnava schools that Gaudapada was actually referring to Lord Vishnu and not to Buddha at all! As we come into the Medieval period we see that Indian philosophy is continuously becoming analytic. A predilection towards transcendence leads to depreciation in the function of reason and its activity becomes merely analytic. Hence the charge of scholasticism often leveled against such a philosophy. In West however reason had a synthetic function in addition to analytic. However this also happened to the West. The problem with scholasticism as Etienne Gilson notes is: “When scholasticism degenerated into a method of disputation, the stress was put on a certain acquired cleverness in the use of dialectical argument, which, although it was very useful in itself, invited its students to start from the first principles rather than to dwell upon them in view of deepening their interpretation. The time has now come for minds still interested in the acquisition of metaphysical wisdom to recapture the meaning of a fruitful method of philosophical investigation.” b) Indian theories of consciousness are peculiar also due to the theory of Moksha. Here we may cite Dr Surendranath Dasgupta’s article Dogmas Of Indian Philosophy: “This spiritual well-being was conceived in India as self-control, or control of desires on the negative side, and the philosophic wisdom which directly revealed our spiritual nature as being above all desires and cravings on the positive side. The logic which sought to connect this moral or religious dogma with philosophy, demanded that this ascent on the spiritual scale must lead us somewhere, must end somewhere and have a finality. It was probably owing to such kinds of consideration that it was conceived that there was a deep chasm between our psychological nature and our true spiritual nature. Having made this chasm, Indian philosophy has always found it extremely difficult to explain the intimate connection between the two that is revealed. in common experience. Philosophers have sought to explain it through the phenomenon of error, which is sometimes made to behave psychologically and at other times ontologically. There is a lot of confusion in this concept of error or ignorance, and the philosopher incapable of explaining it is content with leaving it untouched as the flourish of the irrational in experience. A necessary consequence of such a view is that ultimate spiritual attainment must mean the disruption of psychological experience. The moral conflict of the invasion of desires and their control and the strife for the ultimate spiritual attainment is the misery of all psychological experience which must' abnegate itself in favour of the rise of spiritual enlightenment.” The effect this has on theories of consciousness is this that it is seen completely different from mind and of the nature of pure illumination. Only Bhartrhari dissents to this on grounds that consciousness cannot illuminate anything or reveal an object (artha-prakasha) if it is not infused with a concept of Vak (speech). You can have no awareness of a cat on the table if you have no concepts of a cat and table. For Bhartrhari the ultimate reality is a Shabda-Brahman - the source of both consciousness and our concepts. This view was never accepted by the majority of Indian Philosophers. In Western Philosophy, more particularly in Greek, the soul has a capacity or a faculty (Nous) to grasp necessary and universal truths. The senses give us knowledge which is only contingent. Mathematics of the other hand supplies us with knowledge that is necessarily and universally valid and hence it cannot be empirical knowledge. Similar is the case with metaphysical knowledge. In Western Philosophy the emphasis is always to grasp the rational connection between God and the world. A science for Greeks unearths the universal and necessary principles governing a given subject matter that explain why a certain way empirical explanation holds and not another. A theory of pramanas on the other hand looks for authentic or valid factual knowledge and there is no place within this scheme of an epistemology of knowledge of explanations. It is enough if something can legitimately be said to be thus and so. Why it has to be so is however not a concern for Indian epistemologist. This feature is further evident from seeing the epistemological practice of Nyaya school. In Prashastapada Bhashya on Vaisesika Sutra you would find a complex psychological explanation of how we acquire mathematical concepts grounded in empirical knowledge which is quite similar to the account of such empiricists like John Stuart Mill. Secondly, consider what in West is called the problem of induction. Inference always moves from one set of facts to another. Take for instance fire inferred from smoke. Now from experience we have the knowledge that in the past wherever there was smoke there was fire. But on what grounds can we believe that even in the future all instances of smoke would be accompanied with fire? From sense experience we only know about particular instances of smoke and fire and hence from this we cannot infer that the entire class of smoke will always we accompanied with the class of fire. The problem could be solved if there was a-priori knowledge or knowledge independent of experience. But this was outside the horizon of Indian philosophers for whom reason cannot be an independent source of knowledge; it is always dependent on perception. But the problem with Nyaya is they want to draw metaphysical and rationalistic conclusions from a slim empirical base. Hence they came up with the theory of samanya-lakshana-pratyasatti. Ignorant of the theory of optics old Nyaya philosophers believed that senses (which were not the physical sense-organs but a subtle matter underlying them) can go outside our physical frames and come in actual contact with external objects. Buddhists believed that senses were passive but Nyaya due to sectarian concerns could never concede this. This external object was not a particular but also a universal inhering within a particular. So eyes came in contact with both and the sensory connection with the universal in the particular was called samanya-lakshana-pratyasatti that allowed senses to come in contact with all particular cases of fire 
and smoke because the senses came in contact with their universals in one particular. Thus they sought to solve the problem of necessity and universality in inference. But Shri-Harsha of the Advaita school justly criticized the theory that in such a way a person would become omniscient. This theory can well be contrasted with the theory of a-priori knowledge in Western Philosophy. See it like this - there are statements of facts and there are theoretical statements about statements of statements of facts. A theoretical statement is statement about principles and laws; that fire accompanies smoke is a fact but an effect is always a cause is not an empirical but a theoretical statement. But for Nyaya all these statements could be translated into statements about empirical facts. While for may Western philosophers they signify knowledge of principles that exceed what we can know empirically and is beyond that. Hence the theory of Ideas in a third realm outside empirical facts and the theory of Divine Intellect which contained Ideas or knowledge of principles through which the world was created. Thereby a rational connection between the Divine and the empirical was formed which was missing in Indian philosophy.

Indian philosophy like Western Medieval philosophy was dominated by religious considerations that shaped the development of philosophy accordingly. In the Hindu tradition contra Christianity, the world is not taken to have a first beginning, ex nihilo nihil fit holds true. The world is held to be eternal though it passes through cycles of submersion and emergence from time to time. And even Buddhism does not subscribe to the view that the world had a first beginning. Another important philosophical difference is regarding the nature of the soul. While Medievals could subscribe to the Aristotelian view that soul is the form of the body, the Hindu philosophers held the difference between soul and body to be of paramount importance since only if the soul could survive the destruction of the body could it transmigrate and be reborn in the next life with a different body. This is an important point of contention between Hindu and Buddhists philosophers, the latter even though they did not believe in a soul separate from the five skandhas or the body-mind complex, did believe in rebirth and karma nevertheless. Hindu philosophers emphasized against this view that till soul is not taken to be an independent substance that actually transmigrates all talk of karma and nirvana become meaningless because the same soul which is the agent of an action must reap the fruit of those actions in another birth or there will be a discrepancy between reward for the action and the one who deserves the reward or the punishment which is destructive of the moral order in the universe. Third, beginning with the influence of Asharites most on display in Al-Ghazzali’s Tahafut-Al-Falsifa Islam believed that the source of every action in the natural world is God himself who actually wills something to happen. There is nothing in the fire that makes it burn (note how this anticipates Hume), the two are rather associated together by God’s Will. At once this undermines the rationality of the universe and the cause-effect relation. However traces of this view are found even in Medieval Christian philosophy, more so in St Bonaventure and less in St Thomas Aquinas. The controversy as a matter of fact continues even in Modern Philosophy between occasionalists like Malebranche and other philosophers like Leibniz. Hindus and even Buddhists in this regard however believe that there is an autonomous moral order in the universe that is independent of God. In the Hindu tradition God is the regulator of this order rather than its creator. This fact is hardly appreciated among Hindus themselves. Shankaracharya in his commentary on the Brahma Sutras for instance says contra Buddhists that by themselves the fruits of an action cannot find the agent of the action and hence the regulation of the law is made possible by Ishvara or God. But it is the functioning of the order rather than the existence of the order that is due to God and even in this view he is not followed by other Hindu schools of thought', 'result': {'fake': 0.0006, 'real': 0.9994}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'most notably Purva Mimamsa, which believes that every karma creates a supernatural event which is self-implementing. This supernatural order is what they Dharma which beyond the purview of reason and perception. This can also be seen in two most prominent views of causation in Indian philosophy. First is Satkaryavada versions of which were subscribed by Vedanta schools of thought, the effect is pre-existent in the cause and is partly identical with the cause. It may be noted in this regard that the equality of cause and effect was an important theorem on the basis of which Leibniz argued against occasionalism. Asatkaryavada, different versions of this view were held by Nyaya and Buddhists philosophers. Its basic premise is Humean, the cause and effect are different from each other but Nyaya believed in universals and causation as a law that holds between two universals, fire and smoke for instance which explains the uniformity and regularity of the relation between cause and effect in the natural world. These laws are primitive and are not set up by God. Even the Jaina school believes that the world is eternal and self-sustaining and lacks a creator though they do believe in existence of God though not a creator God. The Jaina view is peculiar, they believe that all our philosophical problems arise from over emphasis on one aspect of reality like change over another like rest, reality as such is all inclusive and every proposition is valid from a point of view, the law of excluded middle notwithstanding.\n\nThe development of Indian philosophy was to a great extent due to the conflict between heterodox schools like Buddhism and Jainism and orthodox or Hindu schools of thought. With the advent of Dignaga a neutral sphere for discussion of logical and epistemological issues was created but nevertheless it was not uninfluenced by sectarian concerns. The challenge of Idealism was felt in the West only with the advent of Modern Philosophy with Descartes, to a lesser extent it was felt in the conflict with Latin Averroism with Siger of Brabant and Averroes’s own views to contend with. But in the context of Indian philosophy the realist-idealist controversy has a long history which began a few centuries post the birth of Buddhism and most prominently with Yogachara Buddhism. Also scepticism was taken a lot more seriously than it was in the Medieval philosophy in the West. The Madhyamaka school of Buddhism headed by Nagarjuna makes arguments very similar to Zeno of Elea and Sextus Empiricus. Add to that the materialist school of Charvakas whose arguments against inference reminds one of Hume and Mill.\n\nBut the most important issue for Medieval philosophy was the question of proving the existence of God and concomitant problem of the relation between reason and faith. Now it may be noted that in Indian philosophy there are no equivalent theories of pure-reason and difference between form and matter. There is no Sanskrit equivalent word for the thematic word reason and if later terminology be employed what Indian philosophy had was a theory of understanding. Since there is prama (right', 'result': {'fake': 0.2735, 'real': 0.7265}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'knowledge) there are pramanas (sources of right knowledge) and there is pramanya or that in virtue of which a cognitive state of consciousness qualifies as a pramana. The cause in this case is a particular empirical event like the contact of the axe that leads to the cutting of the tree and so is called karana or instrumental cause. In the case of perception for instance, the contact of the sense-organs with the object (sense-organs for these schools of thought did not mean the physical sense organ but a constitutive material stuff behind the physical organs that actually made contact with the object. Similar theories about vision were held as early as Al-Kindi in the Western world), is the karana or the cause of prama, pramana being the instrumental cause. Pramana by definition is the cause of right knowledge and so there cannot be deviating pramana. The epistemological aspect comes with theories of pramanya, questions arise, is valid knowledge produced intrinsically to a cognitive event or extrinsically, Mimamsa held that knowledge is self-valid, consciousness always reveals its object unerringly while Nyaya held that it is due to correspondence between a cognitive state and an external object which is a kind of a virtue, that leads to validity of knowledge. The question is what causes are implicated in the production of knowledge and in the validity of knowledge or whether the latter requires additional cause. Similar question arises regarding the apprehension of knowledge, whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic. Mimamsa holds since knowledge is accompanied by certainty and absence of doubt, validity is apprehended intrinsically at the moment of production of knowledge. For Nyaya school, it depends on an inference from successful action (in picking up a fruit in front of one for instance) to validity of knowledge. So the epistemological problems posed by Indian philosophers was 1. What is right knowledge and is there right knowledge? 2. What are the causes of right knowledge? 3. What are the causes of the validity of knowledge and how is it apprehended? 4. How many sources of right knowledge are there and how to determine whether they are independent sources of knowledge? 5. What are the prameyas or the object of right knowledge?\n\nNow most schools of thought believed that perception, inference and scriptural testimony are sources of right knowledge. But inference cannot be an independent source of knowledge in the sense that its object is something beyond what senses can furnish. For instance in the inference wherever there is smoke, there is fire, the inference rests on observed concomitance between fire and smoke. Without this observation no inference is possible. Inference is still a different source of knowledge than perception because the mode of apprehension is different, there is fire on the hill, is inferred from smoke which is perceived whereas the fire is not so perceived. This naturally leads to a problem, what kind of rational connection is found between the probans and the probandum of an inference that allows us to infer one from another. The answer that comes closest to the rationalist', 'result': {'fake': 0.175, 'real': 0.825}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'spirit is Nyaya, that the universals are in these cases connected in a law-like manner. For Buddhism there are two relations, identity like between a particular genus of a tree and an individual instance and cause-effect. However Nyaya also admits regular association like between the presence of one star and another as a valid form of inference. Now similar restrictions are found on scriptural testimony which also is said to depend in one way or another on sense-perception. Scriptural testimony is a form is sentential or verbal cognition. When I hear the words of someone reliable who reports an event truthfully to me, then a verbal and valid cognition is formed within me even though I have not verified that information or given a second-order justification. The truthfulness of the words and the belief that the speaker is trustworthy are themselves sufficient for the hearer to have a valid cognition. But Mimamsa believes that the condition of an apta or a trustworthy person is unnecessary and specially so in the case of Vedas since they are authorless. Note that in Mimamsa epistemology the condition of validity of knowledge is not correspondence with an object which anyways in case of Scriptures in supernatural reality or an inference from successful action. Scriptures according to them are a distinct source of knowledge because they give us knowledge of an entirely different region of reality not accessible to us either by perception or inference. Their arguments you can consider are similar to William Alston’s which seek to justify religious experience and consider such experience to give us knowledge. Advaita Vedanta goes still further and regards that verbal knowledge can be perceptual, for instance in a story where a man counts nine members of the group but forgets to count himself and so mistakenly believes that there is a missing person, someone reminds him that you are the tenth man, which leads to perceptual knowledge that he is the missing person. Kashmir Shaivism is a school of thought that does believe that through reason and reflection knowledge of ultimate reality may become known and scriptures are merely a heuristic aid.\n\nThis also has repercussions on the topic of proof of existence of God. Even Vedanta school like Dvaita who holds similar monotheistic views like Christianity does not believe we can prove the existence of God through inference and scriptures are the sole authority in this regard. Vedanta schools of thought use reason to interpret scriptures together with hermeneutic rules of textual interpretation formulated by Purva Mimamsa school. Their problem is to solve the issue of the relation between God or Brahman and the soul and the world. Advaita Vedanta believes that Brahman is formless and the sole reality, individual selves and the world are an illusion - they are neither existence since the mark of existence is not being capable of sublation or non-contradiction but in the case of the world its end can be conceived, nor is the world non-existent since it is perceived to exist, its existence however is sublated by knowledge of Brahman like the', 'result': {'fake': 0.9131, 'real': 0.0869}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'snake in the rope-snake illusion. Vishishta-advaita believes that Brahman is the world soul and and individual souls and the world are its body. Dvaita believes that Brahman and the individual souls and the world are different from each other. God could have created the world from nothing but since prakriti or material stuff already exists co-eval with God, he merely sets it in motion to develop according to its inner constitution into the world we know. A similar view is held by Nyaya, only in this case there is no prakriti but atoms which have to be conjoined together and the start they get is from God. Nyaya is the only school of thought that believes that we can rationally prove the existence of God. The primary argument they give is what is called the design argument, the inference is just as we see that a pot must have been made from a human intelligent agency who knew how to manipulate the relevant materials to form a pot, the world is similarly made by an intelligent God who know the materials from which to create the world.\n\nMedieval Western philosophers believed in the possibility of natural theology like Nyaya. St Thomas believes that the existence of God can be known through reason but God himself cannot be known because any essence can be known only through existence accessible to us through sense-perception. Since God’s essence is not given through sense-perception we cannot know it. God’s attributes can be inferred through analogy with the world. Maimonides did not however hold even as much arguing for radical incommensurability between creatures and creator similar to Advaita Vedanta’s manner of arguing though he did not regard the world as unreal like Advaitins did. For St Thomas philosophy leaves an angst that it cannot fulfill but which is fulfilled only in beautific vision of God. This view is similar to Dvaita’s except that the latter does not even grant the possibility of a natural theology. Even in the West there have been those who argue that God is inaccessible through reason but known only by faith. There is no conception of faith in Hinduism but the belief in supernatural validity of scriptures is similar. However belief in scriptures comes prior to what knowledge can be gained through them and so a is a pre-requisite for the study of scriptures. This much however is sufficient however to give a broad overview of the two traditions.\n\nYou can find more in the links below:\n\nVaibhav Narula\n · 3y\nWhy were ancient Indians not as much as critical thinker as the ancient Greek philosophers were, when Greek philosophers believed in demigods but still they looked for logical reason behind stuff?\nUnfortunately two types of views are prevalent about Indian Philosophy both at two extremes. One sees it as devoid of rationality and completely spiritual and also dogmatic. Another sees every virtue between heaven and earth within it. The Ancient Indian Rishis according to them knew everything about everything.

It is a peculiar situation where modern science strive to discover something new and these people strive to discover that something new is something old. They don’t know what next discovery would be made but they know that the scriptures already know about them. As a result they have no spirit of discovery of truth and no sense of independence. They only want to smart in someone’s else’s knowledge - abdicating all responsibilities for error. Unfortunately no one becomes great because he has great ancestors. You have to do something yourself. Both these views are evidently wrong yet very prevalent. As for the first one - a cursory glance at the primary literature is sufficient to prove it wrong. As for the second - these people too do not have much knowledge of primary literature either of the East or the West but usually rely on a third person to inform or misinform them about both. Since I have criticized the first view at length before (in the links given below); here I am going to concentrate on the second at the same time to bring to light the similarities and differences between Eastern And Western Philosophy and determine the limits of critical thinking in the former: Vaibhav Narula\'s answer to What is the essence of Indian philosophy? Vaibhav Narula\'s answer to Does Indian Philosophy resemble religious ways of thought (""ways of life"") more than Western Philosophy does? To begin with lets use two themes - transcendence and immanence. The former is the view that the ultimate truth about the world is beyond reason whereas the latter sees God or the ultimate reality to be not beyond reason but immanent or in the world and hence God is in a way not supernatural but part of nature but regarded as a whole. This will become clear in what follows. Here we may note that there much subtlety is possible here and different philosophers have tried to balance the demands of transcendence and immanence in different ways. If we look at the beginning of Indian Philosophy we find different views in Upanishads, Buddhism, Jaina and Materialists like Charvakas or Lokayatas or Ajivikas. This is however a broad classification. Upanishads seek to find that one ultimate reality beyond the visible world and hence their philosophy is largely transcendent. But the manner of exposition uses critical discussion between teacher and student and we find use of logic within the Upanishads especially in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. Buddha asked his disciples to weigh what he says but not simply through logic but also within experience. His philosophy is not a quest to search after the ultimate truth but to achieve cessation of suffering through nirvana. But nirvana and karma and rebirth are not views one acquires through ordinary empirical experience and hence we can see Buddhism too has an aspect of transcendence. That the Indian tradition as a whole is predisposed towards transcendence can be seen in the basic differences between Indian and Western Philosophy. The first difference -', 'result': {'fake': 0.1626, 'real': 0.8374}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'a) Indian Philosophy took philosophy to be exclusively a Moksha-Shastra and what led to Moksha was not reason or rational argumentation but practice of Yoga or something akin to it. Hence the role of reason was relegated to the interpretation of scriptures. In the Vedanta system specially ultimate truths could be known only though scriptural testimony. In other systems like Nyaya-Vaisesika which you expect to be more scientific and rational you find that the school classifies itself as a Moksha Shastra. Other schools of thought used to make jokes at the expense of Nyaya philosophers since a school of thought concerned with study of pramanas, logical fallacies, discussions could not have anything to do with Moksha. However in a later age referred to as the Sutra Period - the different schools of thought as we know today began to form and there was huge competition between these schools of thoughts. Debates used to be conducted and if an adherent of one school of thought could defeat a famous teacher of another school then the fame of that school used to spread throughout. Even though the study of logic was developed intricately in Nyaya and is a worthy topic of study even today - logic was used as a tool to further the interests of different sects and hence philosophers became scholars. Nyaya to some extent did attempt to use reason in an independent way and it is the only school of Indian philosophy that developed a proof of the existence of God. But these were unacceptable to Vedanta systems. Vedanta-Desika or Venkatanatha the famous scholar of Vishishta-advaita school criticizes both the Sankhya deduction of categories of Prakriti and the Nyaya proofs for the existence of God. Even though the Dvaita school conception of God and Nyaya’s theory are very similar even then Vyasatirtha in his Tarka-Tandava criticizes the Nyaya proof for the existence of God. We can notice in this case that over-emphasizing transcendence leads to shrinking the territory of philosophy while adding to that of religion where ultimately the former can co-exist with the latter by only becoming subordinate to it. The most classic case of transcendence in Indian Philosophy is the Advaita school of Vedanta. There is no rational connection between Brahman and the world and the nature of Brahman is identical to the absence of the world. Advaita does conceive Brahman to be the material cause of the world but by this it means that Brahman is the substratum of the world-illusion. However this character of being-the-substratum is also false like the world-illusion. In Nyaya-Amrita Vyasatirtha raises the objection - is the falsity of the world false or is it true? If false then through use of law of double-negation it is proved that the world is real and if true then there is something that exists besides Brahman and hence non-duality is violated. To this Madhusudana replies in his Advaita Siddhi that the falsity of the world is also false but this falsity is identical with the nature of Brahman and hence the law of double-negation does not', 'result': {'fake': 0.224, 'real': 0.776}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'apply in this case. To this Ramatirtha in his Tarangini rebukes that it is utterly inconceivable that Brahman which is of the nature of negation of the world can be its material cause. Advaita’s Brahman is completely transcendent that it cannot have any connection with the world without compromising its transcendence - hence the theory of Ajati-vada. Another effect that taking philosophy to be exclusively a Moksha-Shastra can be seen in this - Indian Mathematics and Indian Astronomy was well developed atleast before the beginning of the Medieval period and names like Aryabhatta and Brahmagupta are familiar to many. Dr Brajendranath Seal’s book ‘Positive Sciences Of The Hindus’ gives a very balanced picture of the achievement of Indian sciences. Even in the Medieval period while Indian science ceased to grow - mathematics was more fortunate as can be seen in the works of Kerala School of Mathematics. This later school is also credited to be the discoverer of the differential calculus that was discovered in the West by Leibniz and Newton. However the point is no school of Indian thought not even Nyaya-Vaisesika discuss the cosmological theories of Aryabhatta et al. Unlike Leibniz who used the differential calculus in his philosophy; no such attempt was made in Indian Philosophy. Why did these Moksha-Shastras neglect scientific advances of contemporary Indian scientists and mathematicians? The only reason is that sectarianism was becoming more and more rampant in Indian Philosophy. Its effect in epistemological sphere can be gleaned from Claus Oetke’s article ‘Limitations Of The Theories Of Pramanas’. Another effect this had was in the choice of topics. Indian philosophers hardly discuss secular matters of everyday life and political philosophies and also literary discussions (hardly any Indian philosoher discusses Kalidasa in a way Hegel does Antigone and also see that nothing stopped Aristotle from discussion Poetics and Rhetorics but these subjects did not concern Moksha for Indian philosophers) and their practical teachings all concern the mode of attaining Moksha. The only exceptions are Charaka-Samhita and the Mahabharata. But on the whole major Indian schools of thought did not discuss how to achieve a good life in this very world as the Greeks did. Also Indian philosophers despised claims of originality. They always attribute their innovations to the founders of the school of thought not just out of reverence to them but as a necessity. As an example I may cite that in his Nyaya-Amrita Vyasatirtha made a claim of some originality in matters of logic and epistemology. But as can be seen from the passages of some commentaries cited in Michael William’s article ‘Vyasatirtha And Navya Naiyayikas’, one can see that this did not go down well with his commentators who try to explain away any claims to originality since it implies that there was something that Madhva-Acharya did not know. Another example of rampant sectarianism in Indian philosophy can be seen in the work of someone no less than Adi Shankaracharya himself. In his commentary on his teacher’s teacher Gaudapada’s commentary on Mandukya Upanishad he deliberately twists a reference Gaudapada made about Buddha which', 'result': {'fake': 0.2958, 'real': 0.7042}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': ""said that the teachings of the Upanishads and the Buddha are in harmony. In his commentary Shankara changes it to the effect that the these Truths are not the same as taught by Buddha. Modern Advaitins go a step further and they struck a deal with the Vaishnava schools that Gaudapada was actually referring to Lord Vishnu and not to Buddha at all! As we come into the Medieval period we see that Indian philosophy is continuously becoming analytic. A predilection towards transcendence leads to depreciation in the function of reason and its activity becomes merely analytic. Hence the charge of scholasticism often leveled against such a philosophy. In West however reason had a synthetic function in addition to analytic. However this also happened to the West. The problem with scholasticism as Etienne Gilson notes is: “When scholasticism degenerated into a method of disputation, the stress was put on a certain acquired cleverness in the use of dialectical argument, which, although it was very useful in itself, invited its students to start from the first principles rather than to dwell upon them in view of deepening their interpretation. The time has now come for minds still interested in the acquisition of metaphysical wisdom to recapture the meaning of a fruitful method of philosophical investigation.” b) Indian theories of consciousness are peculiar also due to the theory of Moksha. Here we may cite Dr Surendranath Dasgupta’s article Dogmas Of Indian Philosophy: “This spiritual well-being was conceived in India as self-control, or control of desires on the negative side, and the philosophic wisdom which directly revealed our spiritual nature as being above all desires and cravings on the positive side. The logic which sought to connect this moral or religious dogma with philosophy, demanded that this ascent on the spiritual scale must lead us somewhere, must end somewhere and have a finality. It was probably owing to such kinds of consideration that it was conceived that there was a deep chasm between our psychological nature and our true spiritual nature. Having made this chasm, Indian philosophy has always found it extremely difficult to explain the intimate connection between the two that is revealed. in common experience. Philosophers have sought to explain it through the phenomenon of error, which is sometimes made to behave psychologically and at other times ontologically. There is a lot of confusion in this concept of error or ignorance, and the philosopher incapable of explaining it is content with leaving it untouched as the flourish of the irrational in experience. A necessary consequence of such a view is that ultimate spiritual attainment must mean the disruption of psychological experience. The moral conflict of the invasion of desires and their control and the strife for the ultimate spiritual attainment is the misery of all psychological experience which must' abnegate itself in favour of the rise of spiritual enlightenment.” The effect this has on theories of consciousness is this that it is seen completely different from mind and of the nature of pure illumination. Only Bhartrhari dissents to this on grounds that consciousness"", 'result': {'fake': 0.0127, 'real': 0.9873}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'cannot illuminate anything or reveal an object (artha-prakasha) if it is not infused with a concept of Vak (speech). You can have no awareness of a cat on the table if you have no concepts of a cat and table. For Bhartrhari the ultimate reality is a Shabda-Brahman - the source of both consciousness and our concepts. This view was never accepted by the majority of Indian Philosophers. In Western Philosophy, more particularly in Greek, the soul has a capacity or a faculty (Nous) to grasp necessary and universal truths. The senses give us knowledge which is only contingent. Mathematics of the other hand supplies us with knowledge that is necessarily and universally valid and hence it cannot be empirical knowledge. Similar is the case with metaphysical knowledge. In Western Philosophy the emphasis is always to grasp the rational connection between God and the world. A science for Greeks unearths the universal and necessary principles governing a given subject matter that explain why a certain way empirical explanation holds and not another. A theory of pramanas on the other hand looks for authentic or valid factual knowledge and there is no place within this scheme of an epistemology of knowledge of explanations. It is enough if something can legitimately be said to be thus and so. Why it has to be so is however not a concern for Indian epistemologist. This feature is further evident from seeing the epistemological practice of Nyaya school. In Prashastapada Bhashya on Vaisesika Sutra you would find a complex psychological explanation of how we acquire mathematical concepts grounded in empirical knowledge which is quite similar to the account of such empiricists like John Stuart Mill. Secondly, consider what in West is called the problem of induction. Inference always moves from one set of facts to another. Take for instance fire inferred from smoke. Now from experience we have the knowledge that in the past wherever there was smoke there was fire. But on what grounds can we believe that even in the future all instances of smoke would be accompanied with fire? From sense experience we only know about particular instances of smoke and fire and hence from this we cannot infer that the entire class of smoke will always we accompanied with the class of fire. The problem could be solved if there was a-priori knowledge or knowledge independent of experience. But this was outside the horizon of Indian philosophers for whom reason cannot be an independent source of knowledge; it is always dependent on perception. But the problem with Nyaya is they want to draw metaphysical and rationalistic conclusions from a slim empirical base. Hence they came up with the theory of samanya-lakshana-pratyasatti. Ignorant of the theory of optics old Nyaya philosophers believed that senses (which were not the physical sense-organs but a subtle matter underlying them) can go outside our physical frames and come in actual contact with external objects. Buddhists believed that senses were passive but Nyaya due to sectarian concerns could never concede this. This external object was not a particular but', 'result': {'fake': 0.1165, 'real': 0.8835}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'also a universal inhering within a particular. So eyes came in contact with both and the sensory connection with the universal in the particular was called samanya-lakshana-pratyasatti that allowed senses to come in contact with all particular cases of fire \nand smoke because the senses came in contact with their universals in one particular. Thus they sought to solve the problem of necessity and universality in inference. But Shri-Harsha of the Advaita school justly criticized the theory that in such a way a person would become omniscient. This theory can well be contrasted with the theory of a-priori knowledge in Western Philosophy. See it like this - there are statements of facts and there are theoretical statements about statements of statements of facts. A theoretical statement is statement about principles and laws; that fire accompanies smoke is a fact but an effect is always a cause is not an empirical but a theoretical statement. But for Nyaya all these statements could be translated into statements about empirical facts. While for may Western philosophers they signify knowledge of principles that exceed what we can know empirically and is beyond that. Hence the theory of Ideas in a third realm outside empirical facts and the theory of Divine Intellect which contained Ideas or knowledge of principles through which the world was created. Thereby a rational connection between the Divine and the empirical was formed which was missing in Indian philosophy.

Indian philosophy like Western Medieval philosophy was dominated by religious considerations that shaped the development of philosophy accordingly. In the Hindu tradition contra Christianity, the world is not taken to have a first beginning, ex nihilo nihil fit holds true. The world is held to be eternal though it passes through cycles of submersion and emergence from time to time. And even Buddhism does not subscribe to the view that the world had a first beginning. Another important philosophical difference is regarding the nature of the soul. While Medievals could subscribe to the Aristotelian view that soul is the form of the body, the Hindu philosophers held the difference between soul and body to be of paramount importance since only if the soul could survive the destruction of the body could it transmigrate and be reborn in the next life with a different body. This is an important point of contention between Hindu and Buddhists philosophers, the latter even though they did not believe in a soul separate from the five skandhas or the body-mind complex, did believe in rebirth and karma nevertheless. Hindu philosophers emphasized against this view that till soul is not taken to be an independent substance that actually transmigrates all talk of karma and nirvana become meaningless because the same soul which is the agent of an action must reap the fruit of those actions in another birth or there will be a discrepancy between reward for the action and the one who deserves the reward or the punishment which is destructive of the moral order in the universe. Third, beginning with the influence of Asharites most on display in Al-Ghazzali’s Tahafut-Al-Falsifa Islam believed that the source of every action in the natural world is God himself who actually wills something to happen. There is nothing in the fire that makes it burn (note how this anticipates Hume), the two are rather associated together by God’s Will. At once this undermines the rationality of the universe and the cause-effect relation. However traces of this view are found even in Medieval Christian philosophy, more so in St Bonaventure and less in St Thomas Aquinas. The controversy as a matter of fact continues even in Modern Philosophy between occasionalists like Malebranche and other philosophers like Leibniz. Hindus and even Buddhists in this regard however believe that there is an autonomous moral order in the universe that is independent of God. In the Hindu tradition God is the regulator of this order rather than its creator. This fact is hardly appreciated among Hindus themselves. Shankaracharya in his commentary on the Brahma Sutras for instance says contra Buddhists that by themselves the fruits of an action cannot find the agent of the action and hence the regulation of the law is made possible by Ishvara or God. But it is the functioning of the order rather than the existence of the order that is due to God and even in this view he is not followed by other Hindu schools of thought most notably Purva Mimamsa, which believes that every karma creates a supernatural event which is self-implementing. This supernatural order is what they Dharma which beyond the purview of reason and perception. This can also be seen in two most prominent views of causation in Indian philosophy. First is Satkaryavada versions of which were subscribed by Vedanta schools of thought, the effect is pre-existent in the cause and is partly identical with the cause. It may be noted in this regard that the equality of cause and effect was an important theorem on the basis of which Leibniz argued against occasionalism. Asatkaryavada, different versions of this view were held by Nyaya and Buddhists philosophers. Its basic premise is Humean, the cause and effect are different from each other but Nyaya believed in universals and causation as a law that holds between two universals, fire and smoke for instance which explains the uniformity and regularity of the relation between cause and effect in the natural world. These laws are primitive and are not set up by God. Even the Jaina school believes that the world is eternal and self-sustaining and lacks a creator though they do believe in existence of God though not a creator God. The Jaina view is peculiar, they believe that all our philosophical problems arise from over emphasis on one aspect of reality like change over another like rest, reality as such is all inclusive and every proposition is valid from a point of view, the law of excluded middle notwithstanding.\n\nThe development of Indian philosophy was to a great extent due to the conflict between heterodox schools like Buddhism and Jainism and orthodox or Hindu schools of thought. With the advent of Dignaga a neutral sphere for discussion of logical and epistemological issues was created but nevertheless it was not uninfluenced by sectarian concerns. The challenge of Idealism was felt in the West only with the advent of Modern Philosophy with Descartes, to a lesser extent it was felt in the conflict with Latin Averroism with Siger of Brabant and Averroes’s own views to contend with. But in the context of Indian philosophy the realist-idealist controversy has a long history which began a few centuries post the birth of Buddhism and most prominently with Yogachara Buddhism. Also scepticism was taken a lot more seriously than it was in the Medieval philosophy in the West. The Madhyamaka school of Buddhism headed by Nagarjuna makes arguments very similar to Zeno of Elea and Sextus Empiricus. Add to that the materialist school of Charvakas whose arguments against inference reminds one of Hume and Mill.\n\nBut the most important issue for Medieval philosophy was the question of proving the existence of God and concomitant problem of the relation between reason and faith. Now it may be noted that in Indian philosophy there are no equivalent theories of pure-reason and difference between form and matter. There is no Sanskrit equivalent word for the thematic word reason and if later terminology be employed what Indian philosophy had was a theory of understanding. Since there is prama (right knowledge) there are pramanas (sources of right knowledge) and there is pramanya or that in virtue of which a cognitive state of consciousness qualifies as a pramana. The cause in this case is a particular empirical event like the contact of the axe that leads to the cutting of the tree and so is called karana or instrumental cause. In the case of perception for instance, the contact of the sense-organs with the object (sense-organs for these schools of thought did not mean the physical sense organ but a constitutive material stuff behind the physical organs that actually made contact with the object. Similar theories about vision were held as early as Al-Kindi in the Western world), is the karana or the cause of prama, pramana being the instrumental cause. Pramana by definition is the cause of right knowledge and so there cannot be deviating pramana. The epistemological aspect comes with theories of pramanya, questions arise, is valid knowledge produced intrinsically to a cognitive event or extrinsically, Mimamsa held that knowledge is self-valid, consciousness always reveals its object unerringly while Nyaya held that it is due to correspondence between a cognitive state and an external object which is a kind of a virtue, that leads to validity of knowledge. The question is what causes are implicated in the production of knowledge and in the validity of knowledge or whether the latter requires additional cause. Similar question arises regarding the apprehension of knowledge, whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic. Mimamsa holds since knowledge is accompanied by certainty and absence of doubt, validity is apprehended intrinsically at the moment of production of knowledge. For Nyaya school, it depends on an inference from successful action (in picking up a fruit in front of one for instance) to validity of knowledge. So the epistemological problems posed by Indian philosophers was 1. What is right knowledge and is there right knowledge? 2. What are the causes of right knowledge? 3. What are the causes of the validity of knowledge and how is it apprehended? 4. How many sources of right knowledge are there and how to determine whether they are independent sources of knowledge? 5. What are the prameyas or the object of right knowledge?\n\nNow most schools of thought believed that perception, inference and scriptural testimony are sources of right knowledge. But inference cannot be an independent source of knowledge in the sense that its object is something beyond what senses can furnish. For instance in the inference wherever there is smoke, there is fire, the inference rests on observed concomitance between fire and smoke. Without this observation no inference is possible. Inference is still a different source of knowledge than perception because the mode of apprehension is different, there is fire on the hill, is inferred from smoke which is perceived whereas the fire is not so perceived. This naturally leads to a problem, what kind of rational connection is found between the probans and the probandum of an inference that allows us to infer one from another. The answer that comes closest to the rationalist spirit is Nyaya, that the universals are in these cases connected in a law-like manner. For Buddhism there are two relations, identity like between a particular genus of a tree and an individual instance and cause-effect. However Nyaya also admits regular association like between the presence of one star and another as a valid form of inference. Now similar restrictions are found on scriptural testimony which also is said to depend in one way or another on sense-perception. Scriptural testimony is a form is sentential or verbal cognition. When I hear the words of someone reliable who reports an event truthfully to me, then a verbal and valid cognition is formed within me even though I have not verified that information or given a second-order justification. The truthfulness of the words and the belief that the speaker is trustworthy are themselves sufficient for the hearer to have a valid cognition. But Mimamsa believes that the condition of an apta or a trustworthy person is unnecessary and specially so in the case of Vedas since they are authorless. Note that in Mimamsa epistemology the condition of validity of knowledge is not correspondence with an object which anyways in case of Scriptures in supernatural reality or an inference from successful action. Scriptures according to them are a distinct source of knowledge because they give us knowledge of an entirely different region of reality not accessible to us either by perception or inference. Their arguments you can consider are similar to William Alston’s which seek to justify religious experience and consider such experience to give us knowledge. Advaita Vedanta goes still further and regards that verbal knowledge can be perceptual, for instance in a story where a man counts nine members of the group but forgets to count himself and so mistakenly believes that there is a missing person, someone reminds him that you are the tenth man, which leads to perceptual knowledge that he is the missing person. Kashmir Shaivism is a school of thought that does believe that through reason and reflection knowledge of ultimate reality may become known and scriptures are merely a heuristic aid.\n\nThis also has repercussions on the topic of proof of existence of God. Even Vedanta school like Dvaita who holds similar monotheistic views like Christianity does not believe we can prove the existence of God through inference and scriptures are the sole authority in this regard. Vedanta schools of thought use reason to interpret scriptures together with hermeneutic rules of textual interpretation formulated by Purva Mimamsa school. Their problem is to solve the issue of the relation between God or Brahman and the soul and the world. Advaita Vedanta believes that Brahman is formless and the sole reality, individual selves and the world are an illusion - they are neither existence since the mark of existence is not being capable of sublation or non-contradiction but in the case of the world its end can be conceived, nor is the world non-existent since it is perceived to exist, its existence however is sublated by knowledge of Brahman like the snake in the rope-snake illusion. Vishishta-advaita believes that Brahman is the world soul and and individual souls and the world are its body. Dvaita believes that Brahman and the individual souls and the world are different from each other. God could have created the world from nothing but since prakriti or material stuff already exists co-eval with God, he merely sets it in motion to develop according to its inner constitution into the world we know. A similar view is held by Nyaya, only in this case there is no prakriti but atoms which have to be conjoined together and the start they get is from God. Nyaya is the only school of thought that believes that we can rationally prove the existence of God. The primary argument they give is what is called the design argument, the inference is just as we see that a pot must have been made from a human intelligent agency who knew how to manipulate the relevant materials to form a pot, the world is similarly made by an intelligent God who know the materials from which to create the world.\n\nMedieval Western philosophers believed in the possibility of natural theology like Nyaya. St Thomas believes that the existence of God can be known through reason but God himself cannot be known because any essence can be known only through existence accessible to us through sense-perception. Since God’s essence is not given through sense-perception we cannot know it. God’s attributes can be inferred through analogy with the world. Maimonides did not however hold even as much arguing for radical incommensurability between creatures and creator similar to Advaita Vedanta’s manner of arguing though he did not regard the world as unreal like Advaitins did. For St Thomas philosophy leaves an angst that it cannot fulfill but which is fulfilled only in beautific vision of God. This view is similar to Dvaita’s except that the latter does not even grant the possibility of a natural theology. Even in the West there have been those who argue that God is inaccessible through reason but known only by faith. There is no conception of faith in Hinduism but the belief in supernatural validity of scriptures is similar. However belief in scriptures comes prior to what knowledge can be gained through them and so a is a pre-requisite for the study of scriptures. This much however is sufficient however to give a broad overview of the two traditions.\n\nYou can find more in the links below:\n\nVaibhav Narula\n · 3y\nWhy were ancient Indians not as much as critical thinker as the ancient Greek philosophers were, when Greek philosophers believed in demigods but still they looked for logical reason behind stuff?\nUnfortunately two types of views are prevalent about Indian Philosophy both at two extremes.

Since I have criticized the first view at length before (in the links given below); here I am going to concentrate on the second at the same time to bring to light the similarities and differences between Eastern And Western Philosophy and determine the limits of critical thinking in the former: Vaibhav Narula\'s answer to What is the essence of Indian philosophy? Vaibhav Narula\'s answer to Does Indian Philosophy resemble religious ways of thought (""ways of life"") more than Western Philosophy does? To begin with lets use two themes - transcendence and immanence. The former is the view that the ultimate truth about the world is beyond reason whereas the latter sees God or the ultimate reality to be not beyond reason but immanent or in the world and hence God is in a way not supernatural but part of nature but regarded as a whole. This will become clear in what follows. Here we may note that there much subtlety is possible here and different philosophers have tried to balance the demands of transcendence and immanence in different ways. If we look at the beginning of Indian Philosophy we find different views in Upanishads, Buddhism, Jaina and Materialists like Charvakas or Lokayatas or Ajivikas. This is however a broad classification. Upanishads seek to find that one ultimate reality beyond the visible world and hence their philosophy is largely transcendent. But the manner of exposition uses critical discussion between teacher and student and we find use of logic within the Upanishads especially in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. Buddha asked his disciples to weigh what he says but not simply through logic but also within experience. His philosophy is not a quest to search after the ultimate truth but to achieve cessation of suffering through nirvana. But nirvana and karma and rebirth are not views one acquires through ordinary empirical experience and hence we can see Buddhism too has an aspect of transcendence. That the Indian tradition as a whole is predisposed towards transcendence can be seen in the basic differences between Indian and Western Philosophy. The first difference - a) Indian Philosophy took philosophy to be exclusively a Moksha-Shastra and what led to Moksha was not reason or rational argumentation but practice of Yoga or something akin to it. Hence the role of reason was relegated to the interpretation of scriptures. In the Vedanta system specially ultimate truths could be known only though scriptural testimony. In other systems like Nyaya-Vaisesika which you expect to be more scientific and rational you find that the school classifies itself as a Moksha Shastra. Other schools of thought used to make jokes at the expense of Nyaya philosophers since a school of thought concerned with study of pramanas, logical fallacies, discussions could not have anything to do with Moksha. However in a later age referred to as the Sutra Period - the different schools of thought as we know today began to form and there was huge competition between these schools of thoughts. Debates used to be conducted and if an adherent of one school of thought could defeat a famous teacher of another school then the fame of that school used to spread throughout. Even though the study of logic was developed intricately in Nyaya and is a worthy topic of study even today - logic was used as a tool to further the interests of different sects and hence philosophers became scholars. Nyaya to some extent did attempt to use reason in an independent way and it is the only school of Indian philosophy that developed a proof of the existence of God. But these were unacceptable to Vedanta systems. Vedanta-Desika or Venkatanatha the famous scholar of Vishishta-advaita school criticizes both the Sankhya deduction of categories of Prakriti and the Nyaya proofs for the existence of God. Even though the Dvaita school conception of God and Nyaya’s theory are very similar even then Vyasatirtha in his Tarka-Tandava criticizes the Nyaya proof for the existence of God. We can notice in this case that over-emphasizing transcendence leads to shrinking the territory of philosophy while adding to that of religion where ultimately the former can co-exist with the latter by only becoming subordinate to it. The most classic case of transcendence in Indian Philosophy is the Advaita school of Vedanta. There is no rational connection between Brahman and the world and the nature of Brahman is identical to the absence of the world. Advaita does conceive Brahman to be the material cause of the world but by this it means that Brahman is the substratum of the world-illusion. However this character of being-the-substratum is also false like the world-illusion. In Nyaya-Amrita Vyasatirtha raises the objection - is the falsity of the world false or is it true? If false then through use of law of double-negation it is proved that the world is real and if true then there is something that exists besides Brahman and hence non-duality is violated. To this Madhusudana replies in his Advaita Siddhi that the falsity of the world is also false but this falsity is identical with the nature of Brahman and hence the law of double-negation does not apply in this case. To this Ramatirtha in his Tarangini rebukes that it is utterly inconceivable that Brahman which is of the nature of negation of the world can be its material cause. Advaita’s Brahman is completely transcendent that it cannot have any connection with the world without compromising its transcendence - hence the theory of Ajati-vada. Another effect that taking philosophy to be exclusively a Moksha-Shastra can be seen in this - Indian Mathematics and Indian Astronomy was well developed atleast before the beginning of the Medieval period and names like Aryabhatta and Brahmagupta are familiar to many. Dr Brajendranath Seal’s book ‘Positive Sciences Of The Hindus’ gives a very balanced picture of the achievement of Indian sciences. Even in the Medieval period while Indian science ceased to grow - mathematics was more fortunate as can be seen in the works of Kerala School of Mathematics. This later school is also credited to be the discoverer of the differential calculus that was discovered in the West by Leibniz and Newton. However the point is no school of Indian thought not even Nyaya-Vaisesika discuss the cosmological theories of Aryabhatta et al. Unlike Leibniz who used the differential calculus in his philosophy; no such attempt was made in Indian Philosophy. Why did these Moksha-Shastras neglect scientific advances of contemporary Indian scientists and mathematicians? The only reason is that sectarianism was becoming more and more rampant in Indian Philosophy. Its effect in epistemological sphere can be gleaned from Claus Oetke’s article ‘Limitations Of The Theories Of Pramanas’. Another effect this had was in the choice of topics. Indian philosophers hardly discuss secular matters of everyday life and political philosophies and also literary discussions (hardly any Indian philosoher discusses Kalidasa in a way Hegel does Antigone and also see that nothing stopped Aristotle from discussion Poetics and Rhetorics but these subjects did not concern Moksha for Indian philosophers) and their practical teachings all concern the mode of attaining Moksha. The only exceptions are Charaka-Samhita and the Mahabharata. But on the whole major Indian schools of thought did not discuss how to achieve a good life in this very world as the Greeks did. Also Indian philosophers despised claims of originality. They always attribute their innovations to the founders of the school of thought not just out of reverence to them but as a necessity. As an example I may cite that in his Nyaya-Amrita Vyasatirtha made a claim of some originality in matters of logic and epistemology. But as can be seen from the passages of some commentaries cited in Michael William’s article ‘Vyasatirtha And Navya Naiyayikas’, one can see that this did not go down well with his commentators who try to explain away any claims to originality since it implies that there was something that Madhva-Acharya did not know. Another example of rampant sectarianism in Indian philosophy can be seen in the work of someone no less than Adi Shankaracharya himself. In his commentary on his teacher’s teacher Gaudapada’s commentary on Mandukya Upanishad he deliberately twists a reference Gaudapada made about Buddha which said that the teachings of the Upanishads and the Buddha are in harmony. In his commentary Shankara changes it to the effect that the these Truths are not the same as taught by Buddha. Modern Advaitins go a step further and they struck a deal with the Vaishnava schools that Gaudapada was actually referring to Lord Vishnu and not to Buddha at all! As we come into the Medieval period we see that Indian philosophy is continuously becoming analytic. A predilection towards transcendence leads to depreciation in the function of reason and its activity becomes merely analytic. Hence the charge of scholasticism often leveled against such a philosophy. In West however reason had a synthetic function in addition to analytic. However this also happened to the West. The problem with scholasticism as Etienne Gilson notes is: “When scholasticism degenerated into a method of disputation, the stress was put on a certain acquired cleverness in the use of dialectical argument, which, although it was very useful in itself, invited its students to start from the first principles rather than to dwell upon them in view of deepening their interpretation. The time has now come for minds still interested in the acquisition of metaphysical wisdom to recapture the meaning of a fruitful method of philosophical investigation.” b) Indian theories of consciousness are peculiar also due to the theory of Moksha. Here we may cite Dr Surendranath Dasgupta’s article Dogmas Of Indian Philosophy: “This spiritual well-being was conceived in India as self-control, or control of desires on the negative side, and the philosophic wisdom which directly revealed our spiritual nature as being above all desires and cravings on the positive side. The logic which sought to connect this moral or religious dogma with philosophy, demanded that this ascent on the spiritual scale must lead us somewhere, must end somewhere and have a finality. It was probably owing to such kinds of consideration that it was conceived that there was a deep chasm between our psychological nature and our true spiritual nature. Having made this chasm, Indian philosophy has always found it extremely difficult to explain the intimate connection between the two that is revealed. in common experience. Philosophers have sought to explain it through the phenomenon of error, which is sometimes made to behave psychologically and at other times ontologically. There is a lot of confusion in this concept of error or ignorance, and the philosopher incapable of explaining it is content with leaving it untouched as the flourish of the irrational in experience. A necessary consequence of such a view is that ultimate spiritual attainment must mean the disruption of psychological experience. The moral conflict of the invasion of desires and their control and the strife for the ultimate spiritual attainment is the misery of all psychological experience which must\' abnegate itself in favour of the rise of spiritual enlightenment.” The effect this has on theories of consciousness is this that it is seen completely different from mind and of the nature of pure illumination. Only Bhartrhari dissents to this on grounds that consciousness cannot illuminate anything or reveal an object (artha-prakasha) if it is not infused with a concept of Vak (speech). You can have no awareness of a cat on the table if you have no concepts of a cat and table. For Bhartrhari the ultimate reality is a Shabda-Brahman - the source of both consciousness and our concepts. This view was never accepted by the majority of Indian Philosophers. In Western Philosophy, more particularly in Greek, the soul has a capacity or a faculty (Nous) to grasp necessary and universal truths. The senses give us knowledge which is only contingent. Mathematics of the other hand supplies us with knowledge that is necessarily and universally valid and hence it cannot be empirical knowledge. Similar is the case with metaphysical knowledge. In Western Philosophy the emphasis is always to grasp the rational connection between God and the world. A science for Greeks unearths the universal and necessary principles governing a given subject matter that explain why a certain way empirical explanation holds and not another. A theory of pramanas on the other hand looks for authentic or valid factual knowledge and there is no place within this scheme of an epistemology of knowledge of explanations. It is enough if something can legitimately be said to be thus and so. Why it has to be so is however not a concern for Indian epistemologist. This feature is further evident from seeing the epistemological practice of Nyaya school. In Prashastapada Bhashya on Vaisesika Sutra you would find a complex psychological explanation of how we acquire mathematical concepts grounded in empirical knowledge which is quite similar to the account of such empiricists like John Stuart Mill. Secondly, consider what in West is called the problem of induction. Inference always moves from one set of facts to another. Take for instance fire inferred from smoke. Now from experience we have the knowledge that in the past wherever there was smoke there was fire. But on what grounds can we believe that even in the future all instances of smoke would be accompanied with fire? From sense experience we only know about particular instances of smoke and fire and hence from this we cannot infer that the entire class of smoke will always we accompanied with the class of fire. The problem could be solved if there was a-priori knowledge or knowledge independent of experience. But this was outside the horizon of Indian philosophers for whom reason cannot be an independent source of knowledge; it is always dependent on perception. But the problem with Nyaya is they want to draw metaphysical and rationalistic conclusions from a slim empirical base. Hence they came up with the theory of samanya-lakshana-pratyasatti. Ignorant of the theory of optics old Nyaya philosophers believed that senses (which were not the physical sense-organs but a subtle matter underlying them) can go outside our physical frames and come in actual contact with external objects. Buddhists believed that senses were passive but Nyaya due to sectarian concerns could never concede this. This external object was not a particular but also a universal inhering within a particular. So eyes came in contact with both and the sensory connection with the universal in the particular was called samanya-lakshana-pratyasatti that allowed senses to come in contact with all particular cases of fire \nand smoke because the senses came in contact with their universals in one particular. Thus they sought to solve the problem of necessity and universality in inference. But Shri-Harsha of the Advaita school justly criticized the theory that in such a way a person would become omniscient. This theory can well be contrasted with the theory of a-priori knowledge in Western Philosophy. See it like this - there are statements of facts and there are theoretical statements about statements of statements of facts. A theoretical statement is statement about principles and laws; that fire accompanies smoke is a fact but an effect is always a cause is not an empirical but a theoretical statement. But for Nyaya all these statements could be translated into statements about empirical facts. While for may Western philosophers they signify knowledge of principles that exceed what we can know empirically and is beyond that. Hence the theory of Ideas in a third realm outside empirical facts and the theory of Divine Intellect which contained Ideas or knowledge of principles through which the world was created. Thereby a rational connection between the Divine and the empirical was formed which was missing in Indian philosophy. An example will illus', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.81523636363636

Austin Mahir,1y,Is there a relationship between the medieval idea of voluntarism and post-Kantian irrationalist philosophy?,"Umm, voluntarism is a broad school of thought to discuss. But I guess by voluntarism you meant the theistic voluntarism? The theistic voluntarism which was common in Christian Augustinianism or even Muslim Asharites?

If yes, then yeah, there is. At least indirectly if not directly. For instance, the ethical voluntarism and the case of “divine command theory”. The divine command theory was a hotly debated topic among the Abrahamic theologians. And it created some controversies among them, particularly a lot later concerning the “Double Predestination” theory. It created enough conflicts between the theory of “natural law” and “divine law”.

After the renaissance and during the height of rationality, it seemed to rise again. Say for instance, the case of Kierkegaard. Who objected the uses of rationality in matters of “pure faith”. Kierkegaard writes,

The ethical is the universal, and as such it is also the divine. Thus it is proper to say that every duty is essentially duty to God, but if no more can be said than this, then it is also said that I actually have no duty to God. The duty becomes duty by being traced back to God, but in the duty itself I do not enter into relation to God. For example, it is a duty to love one’s neighbor. It is a duty by its being traced back to God, but in the duty I enter into relation not to God but to the neighbor I love. If in this connection I then say that it is my duty to love God, I am actually pronouncing only a tautology, inasmuch as “God” in a totally abstract sense is here understood as the divine—that is, the universal, that is, the duty. The whole existence of the human race rounds itself off as a perfect, self contained sphere, and then the ethical is that which limits and fills at one and the same time.
- Kierkegaard, Soren. 1843. Fear and Trembling. Part-2: Is there an Absolute Duty to God? (translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong)

A few lines later he writes,

Recent philosophy has allowed itself simply to substitute the immediate for “faith.” If that is done, then it is ridiculous to deny that there has always been faith. This puts faith in the rather commonplace company of feelings, moods, idiosyncrasies, vapeurs [vagaries], etc. If so, philosophy may be correct in saying that one ought not to stop there. But nothing justifies philosophy in using this language. Faith is preceded by a movement of infinity; only then does faith commence, necopinate [unexpected], by virtue of the absurd…….
……. The story of Abraham contains such a paradox. The ethical expression for his relation to Isaac is that the father must love the son. This ethical relation is reduced to the relative [III 120] in contradistinction to the absolute relation to God. To the question “Why?” Abraham has no other answer than that it is an ordeal, a temptation that, as noted above, is a synthesis of its being for the sake of God and for his own sake. In fact, these two determinants correspond in ordinary language. For instance, if we see someone doing something that does not conform to the universal, we say that he is hardly doing it for God’s sake, meaning thereby that he is doing it for his own sake. The paradox of faith has lost the intermediary, that is, the universal. On the one side, it has the expression for the highest egotism (to do the terrible act, do it for one’s own sake), on the other side, the expression for the most absolute devotion, to do it for God’s sake. Faith itself cannot be mediated into the universal, for thereby it is canceled.

Kierkegaard also writes in the first part,

If this is the case, then Hegel is right in “The Good and Conscience,” where he qualifies man only as the individual and considers this qualification as a “moral form of evil” which must be annulled [ophævet] in the teleology of the moral in such a way that the single individual who remains in that stage either sins or is immersed in spiritual trial. But Hegel is wrong in speaking about faith; he is wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against Abraham’s enjoying honor and glory as a father of faith when he ought to be sent back to a lower court and shown up as a murderer. Faith is namely this paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal—yet in such a way that the movement repeats itself, so that after having been in the universal he as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world precisely because it has always existed.

Kierkegaard actually acknowledges ethics, or more precisely universal ethics (probably the Kantian rational ethics) but when one gets to choose between the dilemma of ethics and faith, then what should he choose? The universal faith or the universal ethics? For Kierkegaard, faith in God precedes the universal ethics, therefore Abraham is seen as the Knight of Faith. If that’s not the case then faith is lost. Abraham no longer remains the knight. So, either its a choice of Greek rationality or God? Kierkegaard places faith in a special position which develops his idea of an individual living three stages of life.

This is probably the response of Kierkegaard from rationalistic tendency of Kant and possibly post-Kantian philosophers including the materialists. Anyway, what I was saying, if talking from a theological perspective, then Kierkegaard most likely took the Augustinian position of faith and the “divine law”. Ironically, I even saw Thomas Aquinas, who is considered the most important writer for natural law, taking a similar position.

St. Thomas Aquinas writes,

Article 6. Whether it is lawful to kill the innocent?

Objection 1. It would seem that in some cases it is lawful to kill the innocent. The fear of God is never manifested by sin, since on the contrary ""the fear of the Lord driveth out sin"" (Sirach 1:27). Now Abraham was commended in that he feared the Lord, since he was willing to slay his innocent son. Therefore one may, without sin, kill an innocent person.

Reply to Objection 1. God is Lord of death and life, for by His decree both the sinful and the righteous die. Hence he who at God's command kills an innocent man does not sin, as neither does God Whose behest he executes: indeed his obedience to God's commands is a proof that he fears Him.[1]

This is where it gets interesting. St. Thomas Aquinas, unlike Kierkegaard, was more of an analytic philosopher. He places value in reasoning and believes the reason serves the justification of the divine. Yet, Aquinas says, if God commands then killing an innocent does not become a sin since God is the giver of life. Either way, Kierkegaard and Aquinas, both justified the divine command theory. But Aquinas uses it from a rational approach whereas Kierkegaard from an absurdist/irrationalist approach. If I am not wrong then Fyodor Dostoyevsky also seemed attack the Catholic Church in a similar manner in the same case.

Nevertheless, I guess yeah, the post-Kantian irrationalism and medieval voluntarism may be connected, especially in case of the theistic approach. But their reasoning may be different. While in the medieval era, it was meant to justify a theological position, in the post Kantian era it became a serious matter against the rationalists including the rejection of theology which some people saw it corrupt as opposed to pure religion [faith].

Thanks for the a2a :)

If in this connection I then say that it is my duty to love God, I am actually pronouncing only a tautology, inasmuch as “God” in a totally abstract sense is here understood as the divine—that is, the universal, that is, the duty. The whole existence of the human race rounds itself off as a perfect, self contained sphere, and then the ethical is that which limits and fills at one and the same time.\n- Kierkegaard, Soren. 1843.

Hong)\n\nA few lines later he writes,\n\nRecent philosophy has allowed itself simply to substitute the immediate for “faith.” If that is done, then it is ridiculous to deny that there has always been faith.

The story of Abraham contains such a paradox. The ethical expression for his relation to Isaac is that the father must love the son. This ethical relation is reduced to the relative [III 120] in contradistinction to the absolute relation to God.

On the one side, it has the expression for the highest egotism (to do the terrible act, do it for one’s own sake), on the other side, the expression for the most absolute devotion, to do it for God’s sake. Faith itself cannot be mediated into the universal, for thereby it is canceled.\n\nKierkegaard also writes in the first part,\n\nIf this is the case, then Hegel is right in “The Good and Conscience,” where he qualifies man only as the individual and considers this qualification as a “moral form of evil” which must be annulled [ophævet] in the teleology of the moral in such a way that the single individual who remains in that stage either sins or is immersed in spiritual trial. But Hegel is wrong in speaking about faith; he is wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against Abraham’s enjoying honor and glory as a father of faith when he ought to be sent back to a lower court and shown up as a murderer. Faith is namely this paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal—yet in such a way that the movement repeats itself, so that after having been in the universal he as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world precisely because it has always existed.\n\nKierkegaard actually acknowledges ethics, or more precisely universal ethics (probably the Kantian rational ethics) but when one gets to choose between the dilemma of ethics and faith, then what should he choose? The universal faith or the universal ethics? For Kierkegaard, faith in God precedes the universal ethics, therefore Abraham is seen as the Knight of Faith. If that’s not the case then faith is lost. Abraham no longer remains the knight. So, either its a choice of Greek rationality or God? Kierkegaard places faith in a special position which develops his idea of an individual living three stages of life.\n\nThis is probably the response of Kierkegaard from rationalistic tendency of Kant and possibly post-Kantian philosophers including the materialists.

Hence he who at God's command kills an innocent man does not sin, as neither does God Whose behest he executes: indeed his obedience to God's commands is a proof that he fears Him.[1]\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. St. Thomas Aquinas, unlike Kierkegaard, was more of an analytic philosopher. He places value in reasoning and believes the reason serves the justification of the divine. Yet, Aquinas says, if God commands then killing an innocent does not become a sin since God is the giver of life. Either way, Kierkegaard and Aquinas, both justified the divine command theory.

At least indirectly if not directly. For instance, the ethical voluntarism and the case of “divine command theory”. The divine command theory was a hotly debated topic among the Abrahamic theologians. And it created some controversies among them, particularly a lot later concerning the “Double Predestination” theory. It created enough conflicts between the theory of “natural law” and “divine law”.\n\nAfter the renaissance and during the height of rationality, it seemed to rise again. Say for instance, the case of Kierkegaard. Who objected the uses of rationality in matters of “pure faith”. Kierkegaard writes,\n\nThe ethical is the universal, and as such it is also the divine. Thus it is proper to say that every duty is essentially duty to God, but if no more can be said than this, then it is also said that I actually have no duty to God. The duty becomes duty by being traced back to God, but in the duty itself I do not enter into relation to God. For example, it is a duty to love one’s neighbor.

Tobias Jonch,2y,Who have been the most badass philosophers?,"The ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes is a strong contender I think.

He was the archetypal Cynic, which was very different from the modern understanding of being a cynic (i.e. disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions). [1]

Diogenes believed that man should live in accordance with nature; free of material possessions, shameless and indifferent to conventional desires for fame, respect and social status.

He famously went around in broad daylight with a lantern, “looking for a man”, thereby denouncing all social norms and how other men adhered to them.

He slept in a great clay jar in Athens and at the market he both ate and masturbated in public, both of which were frowned upon.

He was captured by pirates and sold as a slave in Corinth, to a master who was impressed with his reply to being questioned about his skills, “that he knew no trade but that of governing men, and that he wished to be sold to a man who needed a master”.

While basking in the sun in Corinth he met Alexander the Great, who knew of Diogenes and asked what favour he might bestow upon him, to which Diogenes replied that Alexander should step out of his sun!
Alexander said that had he not been Alexander, he would wish to be Diogenes, to which Diogens replied that had he not been Diogenes, he would still wish to be Diogenes.
If nothing else, dismissing the de-facto ruler of the known world like that makes Diogenes a total badass.

Diogenes passed on his philosophy of Cynicism to Crates, who taught Zeno of Citium, the founder of one of the most enduring philosophies ever, Stoicism.

I think modern society would benefit greatly from adopting some of the tenets of ancient Cynicism (even if jerking off should probably remain a private affair).
Our modern craving for attention and fame is litterally sickening to many young, and our incoherent link between material possession and social status is driving our climate and environment to the point of no return.

Certainly we could benefit from a harsh review of our values as Diogenes did.

Frederick Dolan,2y,Why have there been no huge shifts in philosophical thinking in decades?,"There’s been a shift over the last few decades from moral relativism to moral realism.
 Whether that qualifies as “huge” is difficult to say, but it seems significant.*

There’s been a shift in the extent to which philosophers take religious belief seriously – a shift from less to more.

If “philosophical thinking” is meant in a methodological sense, should we expect or desire huge shifts? (The rise of experimental philosophy might be an example of a small shift in this sense.) If “philosophical thinking” is meant substantively, rarely if ever do we find general philosophical agreement with respect to what to think about something. The shifts that occur have more to do with what’s controversial and how controversies are framed.

Here’s an up-to-date series of books on the latter:

Current Controversies in Philosophy
.

*According to a survey
 conducted in 2014 by David Bourget and David J. Chalmers, 56.4% of philosophers are moral realists, 27.7% are moral anti-realists, and 17.3% are neither.

Mutih Skeini,2y,Why was Schopenhauer such a lacklustre philosopher?,"I do not think that Schopenhauer was a lackluster philosopher! Nietzsche admired Schopenhauer for being a passionate philosopher who nevertheless scorned professional philosophy. He was a creative thinker, not merely a scholar, and he had never been a university professor. Schopenhauer took the meaning of life itself, and not just a few arcane texts, as his field of inquiry. Schopenhauer’s impact upon Nietzsche’s thinking and some of Nietzsche’s colleagues remained decisive. Several of the most basic ideas in Nietzsche’s life affirming philosophy are versions of ideas that preoccupied Schopenhauer: the view that what we can know of the world is only appearance, and the conviction that the will is the most fundamental reality.

Schopenhauer’s philosophy presented in books three and four of The World as Will and Representation, not only greatly impressed Nietzsche but also the composer Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima. Schopenhauer enters upon the ethical implications of his view of the human subject as a willing and representing being. And he explains why the representation of different individuals can never coincide on the most important matters, and how the divergent practical interests of in dividual will lead them into conflict. This is perhaps what lacks some brightness and is the problem for which his theory of willing not to will is the solution.

Schopenhauer was a precocious philosopher himself. He published his first book in 1813 at the age of 25, On the Fourfold Root of Sufficient Reason. This earned him the doctorate in philosophy; and it presaged the entire system of philosophy that he presented to the world in 1819 in his major work, The World as Will and Representation, when he was a mere thirty-one years old. Throughout his career as an author, Schopenhauer remained unconcerned with universities or the philosophical establishment, and largely unrecognized in German literary magazines.

Schopenhauer did not remain permanently unrecognized. John Oxford, an English author discovered Schopenhauer’s the Parerga and Paralipomena for which he received a favorable review. This led to a sudden surge of interest in Schopenhauer’s works in Germany, which he enjoyed until his death in 1860.

Ordinary people, according to Schopenhauer, perceive the world from egotistic points of view, each governed by his particular will and its practical, purposive interests. This is what Schopenhauer (and after him Nietzsche) referred to in Latin as the principium individuationis—the principle of individuation: human beings are alienated from each other in their very perception of the world by their conflicting wills. They seldom if ever transcend the purposive striving of daily existence, and can therefore never see the world disinterestedly, but only in terms of utility. The genius, however, has intellect to spare. As Schopenhauer wrote in one place, if an ordinary person is composed of one-third intellect and two-thirds will, the genius is two-thirds intellect. As a result, the genius may be less practical and perhaps more unhappy. But his surfeit of intellect permits him to apprehend the world unencumbered by his will, i.e., by his practical purposes and interests.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/p2tvci6nq5e83y9x', 'title': 'Why was Schopenhauer such a lacklustre philosopher?', 'score': {'original': 0.9949, 'ai': 0.0051}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I do not think that Schopenhauer was a lackluster philosopher!

Daniel Wagnon,Updated 1y,"What was Theodore Adorno’s critique of Martin Heidegger’s philosophy, and what Adorno called “the jargon of authenticity”?","Going all the way back - Adorno’s dissertation (1924) was on Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology, where from the very beginning he had a quite sophisticated understanding of, and more to the point, internal/external set of criticisms of Phenomenology as a research program. These criticisms are said to be endemic to this methodology as such, and are levelled in the 1960’s against Husserl’s most famous, and influential student, Martin Heidegger - the figure from whom the Jargon of Existentialist Authenticity had first arisen.

—— go to “B” for the immediate answer / if all you want is the skinny of it

A. As for The Jargon of Authenticity itself, here are some key contextual points that will open up the text for people.

Lets start simply - What is the “jargon of authenticity” - In the shortest and clearest sense it comes from Martin Heidegger’s reading of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Luther, St. Paul, etc., in the 1920’s, and it basically argues that the core point of human life is to become Authentic, to take self-ownership of one’s life by formulating clearly one’s own projects and engaging in a life of self-criticism and self-expression - to be resolute in one’s choices and doings. Here a healthy or good person is a person who is true to themselves, follows their own set of values, and focuses on giving their own life the meaning they so want. In being authentic I become a true individual and so therein come to separate myself from the herd, crowd, or masses of people, the bulk of which are inauthentic followers who mimic and copy other people.
Heidegger’s famed Being and Time (1927) had established “Existential Phenomenology” as an very important moment of theoretical reorientation, one as significant to the history of human thought as the work of Kant or Hegel, or Hobbes and Descartes, as Heidegger’s book lead to a complete Gestalt shift in how theorists in Europe approached an interpretation of the human being/world. Here the Jargon of Authenticity was born (i.e. out of Heidegger’s reading of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche). However, it was Heidegger’s incorporation by the French Phenomenologists in the 1940’s (Sartre, Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty, Camus, etc.), that led to Existentialism becoming a “Cool” or “Hot” social topic in broader public life. This European Boom to Existentialism was furthered through a series of books by Anglo-American Writers in the 1950’s and 1960’s which were popularizations and translations of existentialist themes that were geared towards the larger illiterati of the general public - see: Colin Wilson’s “The Outsider,” David Reissman’s “The Lonely Crowd,” Marshall Berman’s “The Politics of Authenticity,” William Barlett’s “The Irrational Man,” etc. This culminated concretely in social movements like the early beat movement, the folk greenwich village scene, the early haight ashbury, the american expressionist movement, early second wave feminism, black/latino cultural revolutions of the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. Recall the summer of love will be just THREE years after Adorno’s book in mention is written! So, by the time Adorno is writing his book (1964) he is thinking of a much broader social movement of “existentialist thinking” which Heidegger had given rise to, and by attacking the later, he is in fact taking aim at the generally accepted and in fashion existentialist vocabulary of his day and the larger social movement it created in the West (the so-called “Jargon of Authenticity”) — which as we will see shortly, de-politicizes capital and individualizes social struggle.
This is one of the few books published by anyone at the so-called “Frankfurt School for Social Research” (by now Adorno is in America), that was produced in a manner closest to the actual concrete sociological research of the institute itself. Namely, during the 50’s-60’s Adorno, Horkheimer, Eric Fromm, Marcuse, and others began to look back at WWII and the Holocaust, and view this event as the result of a kind of Mass Psychosis, where a certain “personality trait” had developed that made the public susceptible to accepting Fascism, Nazism, Hitler, the Concentration Camps, and the like. See here the famous F-Scale, and the measurement of the Fascist Personality - published in total as the giant, multi-author, empirical-researched backed-text - “The Authoritarian Personality” (1950) - of which Adorno was a co-author. As we will see shortly, the “Jargon of Authenticity” fits into the period of this work as a kind of theoretical compendium that hopes to explain the mechanisms whereby a population became susceptible to the “Authoritarian” leader. In other words, this book is part of a deeper sociological study on the attitudes of mass groups of individuals which make up Fascism and so enable it. So to be brief - Authenticity and Existentialism are in some sense connected to Totalitarianism and Fascism. Lest we forget that Heidegger was himself a Nazi after all.

Now to the point -

B. Adorno’s critique of the Jargon of Authenticity

That said, Adorno critiques Heidegger, and the existentialism he spawned, for reducing our understanding of reality down to a “Concept,” one that moreover, leaves many important aspects of human reality out of the picture. More importantly, Existentialism, and its Jargon, that of “Authenticity” - being authentic, being yourself, owning your self, looking inward, being self-sufficient, focusing on exercising your will, focusing on your own projects and life, etc. (or in Heidegger-speak: resoluteness, thrownness, fallenness, projection, facticity, etc.) - leads to a situation that in fact further enhances, defends, protects, and enshrines the violence, exploitation, immiseration, alienation, reification, and destruction of Industrial-Consumer Capitalism, its handmaiden, Objective-Instrumentalist Scientism, and its political enabler-controller, Totalitarianism (whether Fascism or Neo-Liberalism).

To begin, instead of looking for systemic, social, institutional, and structural causes of the problems of alienation, self-immiseration, depression, anxiety, ennui, etc., existentialism says look inside, and so therein sells a philosophy of “adjusting yourself to your circumstances,” in lieu of acting in a collective-social manner to efficaciously and permanently change and alter those circumstances. Moreover it locks human thought into a theocratic-moralizing discourse of “being authentic,” a concept that under analysis becomes rather vacuous and empty. What is being “authentic,” after all, cant a Nazi be Authentic, and if a Nazi can be Authentic, or if a rapacious industrial capitalist, or corrupt politician, or even serial killer be “authentic” then how effective is your philosophical position. Being authentic is not enough, if it is anything at all, and so it doesnt in fact get at the important aspects of human evaluation.

Furthermore, as stated, instead of talking economics and politics, talking about our individual authenticity leads us into a moralizing discourse, where everything is viewed in terms of “individuals” and whether we should “judge” them as being “good” or “bad,” and how we can castigate them to then shape their behavior. This is religion 2.0 - with its codes, priests, precepts, etc., where the very concept of “Authenticity” becomes seen as in fact just another way of managing a herd!!! Here authentic jargon becomes a tool of totalitarianism (in all its forms), as it erects a new interpretative scheme that overlays actual-actuality and when inculcated into one’s life re-renders an individuals existence/experience into a internalized pre-set script of self-discipline, guilt, self-correction, guilt, repentance, and the like.

From another angle, all of this is merely a form of rhetoric, a superficial-vocabulary that takes structural and institutional problems as well as concrete actual reality and remakes them into a narrative of individual issues and conscience-critique mentioned above. To see the absurdity of this line of thought take the following sentence: “ITS not that slavery is wrong, just that inauthentic slave masters are the problem.” This shows the poverty of existentialist analysis, how it in fact gets at nothing important, as the issue of slavery was not an issue of slaves not being authentic enough, or bad slave masters being inauthentic, but of the ECONOMIC-POLITICAL Institution of Slavery as such, and to change that requires collective-social action, ie. it requires revolutionary political activity. Instead of this what we get today is a collection of individuals, all anxious and depressed, all looking inwards, all focusing on “building themselves” while the world burns and people suffer.

So-too today with the hippie cult-of-self, the rise of spiritual worship and spiritualism, the focus on building your gym body, eastern-religion fetishization, tattoo-my-way to individuality mindset, meditation-yoga eat-organic, blah blah hipster culture of which we currently exist. Here I highly highly highly recommend Adam Curtis’ documentary - “the Century of Self” (its free on youtube) - as a wonderful popularization of Adorno’s basic criticism. Existentialism and being authentic doesnt solve our political, social and economic problems, it is in fact merely a JARGON that re-writes these problems in ways that help the systems of power and domination continue to function - how does it achieve this you ask - by rendering its socially-created problems into individualistic-seeming problems, wherein the problem is actually YOU, and NOT the society that produced and surrounds you. Rendered as such, this further mystifies our sense or grasp of reality, and ourselves, and so leads us into an abstract-idealized depiction of our life. And guess what!!!!!???? We have good news: To be authentic, we simply must now BUY X, Y, Z commodities, and purchase A, B, C memberships, and Shop at P, Q, R stores, and follow 1, 2, 3 kinds of celebrities who tell us about their authenticity in the commodities they sling, all while we all pretend authentic on instagram and tik tok by displaying our commodities proudly. And yet, despite all this focus of 70 years of attention onto the question of Authenticity, people dont seem to be much happier….. let alone authentic…… in fact, all authenticity jargon has seemed to do is serve as an outlet for consumer capitalism and our self-commodification……

For Adorno the holocaust never ended, and today the concentration camp is the wild west of American Consumer Capitalism and Neo-Liberal politics, two Concepts, that enslave our mind and destroy our souls while devastating our planet and future. The Jargon of Authenticity feeds right into this by de-politicizing social problems, and de-collectivizing political action, which it accomplishes by rendering us into a mode of thinking of ourselves as isolated and atomistic units, where we respond to this mystifying jargon by following the commands of preachers of authenticity (capitalists or fascists) therein blinding us to our true social power, all while this forms the advertising bedrock that drives late capitalist consumer culture. The goal isnt to be authentic (which today is actually a form of self-enslavement) it is to be free, the first is the pathway of individualism, neo-stoicism, and a philosophy by slaves for slaves (e.g. nazi fascism in one case, industrialized consumer capitalism in the other), and the second is the pathway of collective action, of political engagement, and of revolutionary economic transformation.

As for The Jargon of Authenticity itself, here are some key contextual points that will open up the text for people.\n\nLets start simply - What is the “jargon of authenticity” - In the shortest and clearest sense it comes from Martin Heidegger’s reading of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Luther, St. Paul, etc., in the 1920’s, and it basically argues that the core point of human life is to become Authentic, to take self-ownership of one’s life by formulating clearly one’s own projects and engaging in a life of self-criticism and self-expression - to be resolute in one’s choices and doings. Here a healthy or good person is a person who is true to themselves, follows their own set of values, and focuses on giving their own life the meaning they so want. In being authentic I become a true individual and so therein come to separate myself from the herd, crowd, or masses of people, the bulk of which are inauthentic followers who mimic and copy other people.\nHeidegger’s famed Being and Time (1927) had established “Existential Phenomenology” as an very important moment of theoretical reorientation, one as significant to the history of human thought as the work of Kant or Hegel, or Hobbes and Descartes, as Heidegger’s book lead to a complete Gestalt shift in how theorists in Europe approached an interpretation of the human being/world. Here the Jargon of Authenticity was born (i.e. out of Heidegger’s reading of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche). However, it was Heidegger’s incorporation by the French Phenomenologists in the 1940’s (Sartre, Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty, Camus, etc.), that led to Existentialism becoming a “Cool” or “Hot” social topic in broader public life. This European Boom to Existentialism was furthered through a series of books by Anglo-American Writers in the 1950’s and 1960’s which were popularizations and translations of existentialist themes that were geared towards the larger illiterati of the general public - see: Colin Wilson’s “The Outsider,” David Reissman’s “The Lonely Crowd,” Marshall Berman’s “The Politics of Authenticity,” William Barlett’s “The Irrational Man,” etc. This culminated concretely in social movements like the early beat movement, the folk greenwich village scene, the early haight ashbury, the american expressionist movement, early second wave feminism, black/latino cultural revolutions of the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. Recall the summer of love will be just THREE years after Adorno’s book in mention is written! So, by the time Adorno is writing his book (1964) he is thinking of a much broader social movement of “existentialist thinking” which Heidegger had given rise to, and by attacking the later, he is in fact taking aim at the generally accepted and in fashion existentialist vocabulary of his day and the larger social movement it created in the West (the so-called “Jargon of Authenticity”) — which as we will see shortly, de-politicizes capital and individualizes social struggle.\nThis is one of the few books published by anyone at the so-called “Frankfurt School for Social Research” (by now Adorno is in America), that was produced in a manner closest to the actual concrete sociological research of the institute itself. Namely, during the 50’s-60’s Adorno, Horkheimer, Eric Fromm, Marcuse, and others began to look back at WWII and the Holocaust, and view this event as the result of a kind of Mass Psychosis, where a certain “personality trait” had developed that made the public susceptible to accepting Fascism, Nazism, Hitler, the Concentration Camps, and the like. See here the famous F-Scale, and the measurement of the Fascist Personality - published in total as the giant, multi-author, empirical-researched backed-text - “The Authoritarian Personality” (1950) - of which Adorno was a co-author. As we will see shortly, the “Jargon of Authenticity” fits into the period of this work as a kind of theoretical compendium that hopes to explain the mechanisms whereby a population became susceptible to the “Authoritarian” leader. In other words, this book is part of a deeper sociological study on the attitudes of mass groups of individuals which make up Fascism and so enable it. So to be brief - Authenticity and Existentialism are in some sense connected to Totalitarianism and Fascism. Lest we forget that Heidegger was himself a Nazi after all.\n\nNow to the point -\n\nB. Adorno’s critique of the Jargon of Authenticity\n\nThat said, Adorno critiques Heidegger, and the existentialism he spawned, for reducing our understanding of reality down to a “Concept,” one that moreover, leaves many important aspects of human reality out of the picture. More importantly, Existentialism, and its Jargon, that of “Authenticity” - being authentic, being yourself, owning your self, looking inward, being self-sufficient, focusing on exercising your will, focusing on your own projects and life, etc. (or in Heidegger-speak: resoluteness, thrownness, fallenness, projection, facticity, etc.) - leads to a situation that in fact further enhances, defends, protects, and enshrines the violence, exploitation, immiseration, alienation, reification, and destruction of Industrial-Consumer Capitalism, its handmaiden, Objective-Instrumentalist Scientism, and its political enabler-controller, Totalitarianism (whether Fascism or Neo-Liberalism).\n\nTo begin, instead of looking for systemic, social, institutional, and structural causes of the problems of alienation, self-immiseration, depression, anxiety, ennui, etc., existentialism says look inside, and so therein sells a philosophy of “adjusting yourself to your circumstances,” in lieu of acting in a collective-social manner to efficaciously and permanently change and alter those circumstances. Moreover it locks human thought into a theocratic-moralizing discourse of “being authentic,” a concept that under analysis becomes rather vacuous and empty. What is being “authentic,” after all, cant a Nazi be Authentic, and if a Nazi can be Authentic, or if a rapacious industrial capitalist, or corrupt politician, or even serial killer be “authentic” then how effective is your philosophical position. Being authentic is not enough, if it is anything at all, and so it doesnt in fact get at the important aspects of human evaluation.\n\nFurthermore, as stated, instead of talking economics and politics, talking about our individual authenticity leads us into a moralizing discourse, where everything is viewed in terms of “individuals” and whether we should “judge” them as being “good” or “bad,” and how we can castigate them to then shape their behavior. This is religion 2.0 - with its codes, priests, precepts, etc., where the very concept of “Authenticity” becomes seen as in fact just another way of managing a herd!!! Here authentic jargon becomes a tool of totalitarianism (in all its forms), as it erects a new interpretative scheme that overlays actual-actuality and when inculcated into one’s life re-renders an individuals existence/experience into a internalized pre-set script of self-discipline, guilt, self-correction, guilt, repentance, and the like.\n\nFrom another angle, all of this is merely a form of rhetoric, a superficial-vocabulary that takes structural and institutional problems as well as concrete actual reality and remakes them into a narrative of individual issues and conscience-critique mentioned above. To see the absurdity of this line of thought take the following sentence: “ITS not that slavery is wrong, just that inauthentic slave masters are the problem.” This shows the poverty of existentialist analysis, how it in fact gets at nothing important, as the issue of slavery was not an issue of slaves not being authentic enough, or bad slave masters being inauthentic, but of the ECONOMIC-POLITICAL Institution of Slavery as such, and to change that requires collective-social action, ie. it requires revolutionary political activity. Instead of this what we get today is a collection of individuals, all anxious and depressed, all looking inwards, all focusing on “building themselves” while the world burns and people suffer.\n\nSo-too today with the hippie cult-of-self, the rise of spiritual worship and spiritualism, the focus on building your gym body, eastern-religion fetishization, tattoo-my-way to individuality mindset, meditation-yoga eat-organic, blah blah hipster culture of which we currently exist. Here I highly highly highly recommend Adam Curtis’ documentary - “the Century of Self” (its free on youtube) - as a wonderful popularization of Adorno’s basic criticism. Existentialism and being authentic doesnt solve our political, social and economic problems, it is in fact merely a JARGON that re-writes these problems in ways that help the systems of power and domination continue to function - how does it achieve this you ask - by rendering its socially-created problems into individualistic-seeming problems, wherein the problem is actually YOU, and NOT the society that produced and surrounds you. Rendered as such, this further mystifies our sense or grasp of reality, and ourselves, and so leads us into an abstract-idealized depiction of our life. And guess what!!!!!???? We have good news: To be authentic, we simply must now BUY X, Y, Z commodities, and purchase A, B, C memberships, and Shop at P, Q, R stores, and follow 1, 2, 3 kinds of celebrities who tell us about their authenticity in the commodities they sling, all while we all pretend authentic on instagram and tik tok by displaying our commodities proudly. And yet, despite all this focus of 70 years of attention onto the question of Authenticity, people dont seem to be much happier….. let alone authentic…… in fact, all authenticity jargon has seemed to do is serve as an outlet for consumer capitalism and our self-commodification……\n\nFor Adorno the holocaust never ended, and today the concentration camp is the wild west of American Consumer Capitalism and Neo-Liberal politics, two Concepts, that enslave our mind and destroy our souls while devastating our planet and future. The Jargon of Authenticity feeds right into this by de-politicizing social problems, and de-collectivizing political action, which it accomplishes by rendering us into a mode of thinking of ourselves as isolated and atomistic units, where we respond to this mystifying jargon by following the commands of preachers of authenticity (capitalists or fascists) therein blinding us to our true social power, all while this forms the advertising bedrock that drives late capitalist consumer culture. The goal isnt to be authentic (which today is actually a form of self-enslavement) it is to be free, the first is the pathway of individualism, neo-stoicism, and a philosophy by slaves for slaves (e.g. nazi fascism in one case, industrialized consumer capitalism in the other), and the second is the pathway of collective action, of political engagement, and of revolutionary economic transformation.\n\nYou put A and B together (how they play off and weave into one another, and ultimately relate to 3 or the question of Fascism) and you begin to get the essential thrust of his critique….', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.95335

Steven Ussery,3y,How did Kant define knowledge?,"Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804) was the founder of the school of philosophy of what was later to become known as “German Idealism.” The German philosophers Fichte, Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer each separately picked up where Kant left off and tried to continue his work in epistemology, the formal study of what it means “to know”, or more properly “the study of knowledge.”

In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, Kant argued that space and time are mere “forms of intuition” which structure all experience, and therefore that while “things-in-themselves” exist and contribute to experience, they are nonetheless distinct from the objects of experience. From this it follows that the objects of experience are mere ""appearances"", and that the nature of things as they are in themselves is consequently unknowable to us.

In an attempt to counter the skepticism he found in the writings of philosopher David Hume, he wrote the Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787), one of his most well-known works. In it, he developed his theory of experience to answer the question of whether synthetic a priori (i.e. before the fact) knowledge is possible, which would in turn make it possible to determine the limits of metaphysical inquiry. Kant drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposal that the objects of the senses must conform to our spatial and temporal forms of intuition, and that we can consequently have a priori cognition of the objects of the senses.

Kant believed that reason is also the source of morality, and that aesthetics arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment.

He attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond what he believed to be the failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics. He wanted to put an end to what he saw as an era of futile and speculative theories of human experience, while resisting the skepticism of thinkers such as Hume.

Furthermore, Socrates had made some enemies among the Athenian elite, including some of the jurors who sat on his trial, by openly criticizing them and their beliefs. These individuals saw his questioning as a threat to their authority and a corrupting influence on the young people of Athens.

Socrates was brought to trial on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth. The prosecution argued that he was guilty of both charges because he did not believe in the Athenian gods and was teaching young people to do the same, and that his questioning was leading the youth to question and reject the authority of the city.

Despite his defense, which included arguments that his questioning was a form of seeking truth and that he was not guilty of the charges against him, Socrates was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.

Frederick Dolan,1y,What is the least understood aspect of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant among philosophers?,"One of the murkier questions for me is the status of the transcendental conditions of experience. Just what are they, exactly? They’re the conditions of the intelligibility or meaning of anything we can know, but what, so to speak, are they made of? Where are they located? Again, what are they?

The answer to which I’m inclined is that they are the Background – the Heideggerian understanding of being, that on the basis of which entities are disclosed.

Terry Vestal,1y,What were Immanuel Kant's contributions to philosophy?,"Much of the following can be checked by reading Schopenhauer’s praise of Kant that was the lead up to his very wicked criticism. VII of his masterpiece.

We are told by. Schopenhauer that “Kant has a threefold relation to that of his predecessors:

The philosophy of Locke was confirmed and extended.
The philosophy of Hume was confirmed and made use of.
The first two are relatively easy in comparison to the third; Kant had a decidedly polemical and destructive relation to the Leibniz-Wolf philosophy.

The first relation can be boiled down to this:

Locke showed that the secondary qualities of things, those the senses pickup, do not belong to the real/the thing in itself. Only the primary qualities, those that require space and impenetrability for their existence, did he attribute to the thing in itself.

Schopenhauer characterized this as a “youthful introduction to the distinction of Kant.”

From a “higher standpoint” Kant explained that “the phenomenal appearance in our faculty of apprehension” contained the secondary qualities by our senses [and] the primary qualities by our a priori reason. This is “because the conditions of this faculty, space, time, and causality are known by us a priori.”

Thus Locke abstracted from the real only what the senses gave. Kant abstracted this [and] the primary qualities given by “brain-functions.”

Kant’s “separation of our a priori from our a posterior knowledge, which before him had never been carried out with adequate strictness and completeness nor with distinct consciousness”, was his chief accomplishment.

This is “the principle subject of his profound investigations.”

It is immediately after this point that he remarks “Kants philosophy has a threefold relation to that of his predecessors.”

He brings to mind the idea of Kant’s discussion within the bigger discussion whereby there is the idea of belonging. Of course it is not possible to list all and there are serious differences within the group but there is no overt “empty boast” “masked under bombast and nonsense” within.

The point is he has ousted Hegel from the discussion. Not saying he has proven it right to do so or that it is actually provable only that Hume’s idea that our genius depends upon how accurate our sentiments [should] be brought to mind.

It is simply “what is” that some sentiences gather a more accurate world than others - it was simply in the cards that this would be so. This is simply a caution. Thats all.

The other thing is he clearly says Kant’s separation was a [marked] progress in the record and explained that “the empty boast masked under bombast and nonsense, and the imposing impression of an air of importance” that was “the starting point for the still grosser nonsense of the clumsy and stupid Hegel” had ruined what Kant accomplished.

According to Schopenhauer the thread of thought from which Kant rose above to set philosophy on a right course was immediately (1780s) infiltrated with a noticeable sloppy with purpose to undo his accomplishment. Hegel fell into this practice, think recruited, and actually completed the critical coming undone of Kant’s chief accomplishment;“the doctrine of the complete diversity of the ideal and the real”.

Schopenhauer was absolutely lividly obsessed with this. He actually got poetic, brought in Goethe, in order make sure this very negative mark in the record would be recognized as such:

“If now, according to the above, the distinction of the phenomenon from the thing in itself, thus the doctrine of the complete diversity of the ideal and the real, is the fundamental characteristic of the Kantian philosophy, then the assertion of the absolute identity of these two which appeared soon afterwards is a sad proof of the saying of Goethe quoted above; all the more so as it rested upon nothing but the empty boast of intellectual intuition, and accordingly was only a return to the crudeness of the vulgar opinion, masked under bombast and nonsense, and the imposing impression of an air of importance. It became the fitting starting-point for the still grosser nonsense of the clumsy and stupid Hegel.”

I just wanted to give the whole quote that was at Hegel’s quackery. I believe it is his best at his arch enemy.

The importance of this discussion is it shows just how small the world had become. The kernel of idealism as it states that ideas of the mind to be adopted for peace, was inadvertently by history and Schopenhauer’s sentience, provable to a correct complex sentience that is simply to be.

Smith’s world was fascinating immediately after it was introduced yet in two years (1778) it was officially marked marked for destruction just as Kant’s chief achievement. There is only one thing capable of this - Smith’s “incorporation spirit.”

Hume documents the stiff competition between Scotland and England proper. Others have explained that Hume and Smith were the pride and joy of the Scotts because they got more world attention than their peers that resided in the original kingdom.

If we study Schopenhauer on the sloppy that ultimately undid Kant’s chief accomplishment, an accomplishment that inadvertently provides proof on top of proof of the value of Smith’s world, we understand the demotion of the Scottish world made it a necessary consequence. The world was connected then.

Just to be clear, I am saying you can’t have Smith’s world nor Kant’s chief accomplishment in the world. If one stayed it would be a constant reminder of the other; it would create an incorruptible intellectualism.

This is not totally accurate because it is not really possible to corrupt all minds. Reality is never going to be destroyed altogether. This official dual elimination has only ensured that the corrupted far out number those not; it is a numbers game; the non-corrupted are drowned out and this allows what ever business is necessary.

Just follow the necessary changing trends that paints the picture:

During TE The Britts and the Scots were embroiled in fierce competition.
In the work of Hume and Smith the Scotts were triumphant - Smith’s world was adopted by all great intellects in 1776.
Immediately after this (1778) there was a dictate whereby this world was declared invalid and all intellectuals of the whole kingdom agreed; the Scotts themselves didn’t put up an argument. In a nut, this was the cause of the loss of the colonies.
If we turn to the place on the continent where an important [it] happened, a complementing it for the Scottish it and vice versa, we see it immediately (early 1780s) attacked by a fishy sloppy.
Schopenhauer documents the sloppy that terminated in Hegel that actually destroyed Kant’s chief accomplishment (early 1800s).
I need to stress that Smith’s world was not actually demoted nor was Kant’s central idea actually destroyed. The better minds within MIND have preserved it. The problem is MIND is discombobulated and this will eventually cause the betters to come out of the shadows or that is the plan.
If we return to the big island we find that the win the Scotts achieved by Hume was forgotten because they, with their competitors, adopted Hegel just as the Germans did; Hegel conquered the whole of Europe. Though I see some intellectuals supporting Schopenhauer today, I don’t believe he has been established as winner yet.
On the big island where the basics of philosophy was perfected by Hume which subsequently led to phenomenal world of Smith, we see Hegel, who had destroyed Kant, replace Hume, who had primed Kant, because Smith’s world had been demoted. All I am saying is everything has to jive. If one critical part of the whole is destroyed then other critical parts have to be destroyed lest [real] minds would get suspicious. I am example beyond real; I can’t be fooled; I am the one meant to sound the alarm - the canary in the coal mind.
The contemplation of minds that have been destroyed, over the centuries mind you - an ungodly amount of stupidity, from this whole ordeal by the ones that [are] healthy (good thinking caused by artsy reading), gives [the] plan.

If we can recreate the atmosphere of competition that existed between the Scotts and the Brits we can prime the two MINDS whereas the best of each will surface.

It doesn’t take a lot of minds to understand what went wrong. That is what I have proven; a 70 percent mind has actually stumped the whole MIND of America and Europe. The nonsense has progressed so long that now it only takes an average human mind to give a sketch of what happened. Actually the sketch was already there, the above Schopenhauer, it only had to be found - I found it.

If a 100 percent mind argues with my 70 percent all I have to do is do an idea search on my massive computer - I have one megabyte of prime ideas that can whip the hump teen terabytes of my opponents - to show idiocy. Because no genius is going to allow a mediocre mind to get the best of them they are stumped. All I am saying is even in our times of extreme intellectual drought they instinctively know a good argument when they hear it. Their caution will cause a quietude and this will allow an associated argument thus an associated quietude.

Since the modern world was invented in England whereas the stiff competition between the Scotts and the Brits, the intellectuals, was [a] chief cause, this natural happening of nature could be recreated.

I have proven what one mediocre mind can do, that is, stump the whole world of intellect. What could the whole intellect of either the tribe of Scotland or that of England do.

If they were once in fierce competition it can happen again. All that has to be done is rag the British by reminding them that they lost the biggest battles; what is metaphysics and what is the prime world of ideas or that that defines idealism proper. Now they have the opportunity to set the world straight.

As I think the Germans should be brought in on this as well. After all, as my answer explains, it was a German that developed Hume’s metaphysics. It was a German that destroyed it yet a German restored what was lost. It seems to me that Germany is not claiming their intellectual heritage.

German intellectualism would have to do this through Adam Smith. The way the world is now that is the only way.

I will end by explaining this in one paragraph.

David Hume, probably the fiercest Scot the British faced, opened the way for Smith’s world. In addition, he was a critical precursor to Kant. Because the metaphysical principles of Hume that Kant adopted (Schopenhauer as well) were worked up by Smith to give his easy philosophy, his world of ideas, he is heavily involved in the restoration of Kant that Schopenhauer alerted the need. This is because Kant’s chief doctrine if followed to its natural end, just let the logic flow, incriminates Smith’s as idealism itself. Since the idealism of Smith is easy in comparison to the metaphysics that backs it, it can be used to verify the metaphysics by following Smith as he explains the “abstruse principles” in their role of policy; he was a metaphysician before he was an easy philosopher; he gives examples of how to use metaphysics to create great practical art. Because his art explained by his metaphysics can, if presented accurately, stump [any] contrarian the proud German only has to work with Smith to form a critical quietude. From this he can move into Schopenhauer as he documented the destruction of Kant. This is an incredibly smooth transition, so, the quietude established from Smith’s wisdom followed by that that is established by Schopenhauer’s wisdom would be a very long very uneasy quietude, from the feelings of the forced silent. After so much of this others would step in and end the debate. No intellectual would allow a fellow intellectual to be mentally tortured. The debate would end and all would know complex reality - intellectualism would know how to save the world.

I realize this is not possible. In our world dumb asses are protected. They don’t have to debate Smith or Schopenhauer.

If I was the education czar I would force them to do this.

I would begin with critical intellectuals of social science. I would establish a good debate and force an intellectual to debate. If he wouldn’t debate I would throw him into the bread lines.

After a time of dropping intellects or moving them to the breadlines a fierce, very competitive, intellect in all the social sciences would result.

This is what would make America great again.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ev5z604kpywcbd9j', 'title': ""What were Immanuel Kant's contributions to philosophy?"", 'score': {'original': 0.78088, 'ai': 0.21912}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Much of the following can be checked by reading Schopenhauer’s praise of Kant that was the lead up to his very wicked criticism.

Not saying he has proven it right to do so or that it is actually provable only that Hume’s idea that our genius depends upon how accurate our sentiments [should] be brought to mind.\n\nIt is simply “what is” that some sentiences gather a more accurate world than others - it was simply in the cards that this would be so. This is simply a caution. Thats all.\n\nThe other thing is he clearly says Kant’s separation was a [marked] progress in the record and explained that “the empty boast masked under bombast and nonsense, and the imposing impression of an air of importance” that was “the starting point for the still grosser nonsense of the clumsy and stupid Hegel” had ruined what Kant accomplished.\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer the thread of thought from which Kant rose above to set philosophy on a right course was immediately (1780s) infiltrated with a noticeable sloppy with purpose to undo his accomplishment. Hegel fell into this practice, think recruited, and actually completed the critical coming undone of Kant’s chief accomplishment;“the doctrine of the complete diversity of the ideal and the real”.\n\nSchopenhauer was absolutely lividly obsessed with this. He actually got poetic, brought in Goethe, in order make sure this very negative mark in the record would be recognized as such:\n\n“If now, according to the above, the distinction of the phenomenon from the thing in itself, thus the doctrine of the complete diversity of the ideal and the real, is the fundamental characteristic of the Kantian philosophy, then the assertion of the absolute identity of these two which appeared soon afterwards is a sad proof of the saying of Goethe quoted above; all the more so as it rested upon nothing but the empty boast of intellectual intuition, and accordingly was only a return to the crudeness of the vulgar opinion, masked under bombast and nonsense, and the imposing impression of an air of importance. It became the fitting starting-point for the still grosser nonsense of the clumsy and stupid Hegel.”\n\nI just wanted to give the whole quote that was at Hegel’s quackery. I believe it is his best at his arch enemy.\n\nThe importance of this discussion is it shows just how small the world had become. The kernel of idealism as it states that ideas of the mind to be adopted for peace, was inadvertently by history and Schopenhauer’s sentience, provable to a correct complex sentience that is simply to be.\n\nSmith’s world was fascinating immediately after it was introduced yet in two years (1778) it was officially marked marked for destruction just as Kant’s chief achievement. There is only one thing capable of this - Smith’s “incorporation spirit.”\n\nHume documents the stiff competition between Scotland and England proper. Others have explained that Hume and Smith were the pride and joy of the Scotts because they got more world attention than their peers that resided in the original kingdom.\n\nIf we study Schopenhauer on the sloppy that ultimately undid Kant’s chief accomplishment, an accomplishment that inadvertently provides proof on top of proof of the value of Smith’s world, we understand the demotion of the Scottish world made it a necessary consequence. The world was connected then.\n\nJust to be clear, I am saying you can’t have Smith’s world nor Kant’s chief accomplishment in the world. If one stayed it would be a constant reminder of the other; it would create an incorruptible intellectualism.\n\nThis is not totally accurate because it is not really possible to corrupt all minds. Reality is never going to be destroyed altogether. This official dual elimination has only ensured that the corrupted far out number those not; it is a numbers game; the non-corrupted are drowned out and this allows what ever business is necessary.\n\nJust follow the necessary changing trends that paints the picture:\n\nDuring TE The Britts and the Scots were embroiled in fierce competition.\nIn the work of Hume and Smith the Scotts were triumphant - Smith’s world was adopted by all great intellects in 1776.\nImmediately after this (1778) there was a dictate whereby this world was declared invalid and all intellectuals of the whole kingdom agreed; the Scotts themselves didn’t put up an argument. In a nut, this was the cause of the loss of the colonies.\nIf we turn to the place on the continent where an important [it] happened, a complementing it for the Scottish it and vice versa, we see it immediately (early 1780s) attacked by a fishy sloppy.\nSchopenhauer documents the sloppy that terminated in Hegel that actually destroyed Kant’s chief accomplishment (early 1800s).\nI need to stress that Smith’s world was not actually demoted nor was Kant’s central idea actually destroyed. The better minds within MIND have preserved it. The problem is MIND is discombobulated and this will eventually cause the betters to come out of the shadows or that is the plan.\nIf we return to the big island we find that the win the Scotts achieved by Hume was forgotten because they, with their competitors, adopted Hegel just as the Germans did; Hegel conquered the whole of Europe. Though I see some intellectuals supporting Schopenhauer today, I don’t believe he has been established as winner yet.\nOn the big island where the basics of philosophy was perfected by Hume which subsequently led to phenomenal world of Smith, we see Hegel, who had destroyed Kant, replace Hume, who had primed Kant, because Smith’s world had been demoted. All I am saying is everything has to jive. If one critical part of the whole is destroyed then other critical parts have to be destroyed lest [real] minds would get suspicious. I am example beyond real; I can’t be fooled; I am the one meant to sound the alarm - the canary in the coal mind.\nThe contemplation of minds that have been destroyed, over the centuries mind you - an ungodly amount of stupidity, from this whole ordeal by the ones that [are] healthy (good thinking caused by artsy reading), gives [the] plan.\n\nIf we can recreate the atmosphere of competition that existed between the Scotts and the Brits we can prime the two MINDS whereas the best of each will surface.\n\nIt doesn’t take a lot of minds to understand what went wrong. That is what I have proven; a 70 percent mind has actually stumped the whole MIND of America and Europe. The nonsense has progressed so long that now it only takes an average human mind to give a sketch of what happened. Actually the sketch was already there, the above Schopenhauer, it only had to be found - I found it.\n\nIf a 100 percent mind argues with my 70 percent all I have to do is do an idea search on my massive computer - I have one megabyte of prime ideas that can whip the hump teen terabytes of my opponents - to show idiocy. Because no genius is going to allow a mediocre mind to get the best of them they are stumped. All I am saying is even in our times of extreme intellectual drought they instinctively know a good argument when they hear it. Their caution will cause a quietude and this will allow an associated argument thus an associated quietude.\n\nSince the modern world was invented in England whereas the stiff competition between the Scotts and the Brits, the intellectuals, was [a] chief cause, this natural happening of nature could be recreated.\n\nI have proven what one mediocre mind can do, that is, stump the whole world of intellect. What could the whole intellect of either the tribe of Scotland or that of England do.\n\nIf they were once in fierce competition it can happen again. All that has to be done is rag the British by reminding them that they lost the biggest battles; what is metaphysics and what is the prime world of ideas or that that defines idealism proper. Now they have the opportunity to set the world straight.\n\nAs I think the Germans should be brought in on this as well. After all, as my answer explains, it was a German that developed Hume’s metaphysics. It was a German that destroyed it yet a German restored what was lost. It seems to me that Germany is not claiming their intellectual heritage.\n\nGerman intellectualism would have to do this through Adam Smith. The way the world is now that is the only way.\n\nI will end by explaining this in one paragraph.\n\nDavid Hume, probably the fiercest Scot the British faced, opened the way for Smith’s world. In addition, he was a critical precursor to Kant. Because the metaphysical principles of Hume that Kant adopted (Schopenhauer as well) were worked up by Smith to give his easy philosophy, his world of ideas, he is heavily involved in the restoration of Kant that Schopenhauer alerted the need. This is because Kant’s chief doctrine if followed to its natural end, just let the logic flow, incriminates Smith’s as idealism itself. Since the idealism of Smith is easy in comparison to the metaphysics that backs it, it can be used to verify the metaphysics by following Smith as he explains the “abstruse principles” in their role of policy; he was a metaphysician before he was an easy philosopher; he gives examples of how to use metaphysics to create great practical art. Because his art explained by his metaphysics can, if presented accurately, stump [any] contrarian the proud German only has to work with Smith to form a critical quietude. From this he can move into Schopenhauer as he documented the destruction of Kant. This is an incredibly smooth transition, so, the quietude established from Smith’s wisdom followed by that that is established by Schopenhauer’s wisdom would be a very long very uneasy quietude, from the feelings of the forced silent. After so much of this others would step in and end the debate. No intellectual would allow a fellow intellectual to be mentally tortured. The debate would end and all would know complex reality - intellectualism would know how to save the world.\n\nI realize this is not possible. In our world dumb asses are protected. They don’t have to debate Smith or Schopenhauer.\n\nIf I was the education czar I would force them to do this.\n\nI would begin with critical intellectuals of social science. I would establish a good debate and force an intellectual to debate. If he wouldn’t debate I would throw him into the bread lines.\n\nAfter a time of dropping intellects or moving them to the breadlines a fierce, very competitive, intellect in all the social sciences would result.\n\nThis is what would make America great again.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.78088

Frederick Dolan,2y,Which philosopher is widely considered the founder of modern philosophy?,"Some argue that this honor should be given to Giordano Bruno (1548–1600).

The concept of the modern goes back to the 14th and 15th centuries. The medieval Scholastics distinguished between the via antiqua and the via moderna in logic and philosophy. The devotio moderna was a new religious practice that emphasized shared labor and communal living (what we call “monasticism”). Modernus or moderno characterized the new artistic styles of 14th-15th century Italy, culminating in the maniera moderna of Leonardo and Michelangelo.[1]

But it was Bruno who formulated, and loudly proclaimed, the concept of the universe as infinite, expanding, decentered, and populated by a variety of worlds. Bruno’s campaign for a modern reformation ended when he was burned at the stake in the Campo de’ Fiori in 1600, and the scientific revolution that eventually succeeded gave us a picture of reality that is far removed from his “magical” unity of macrocosm and microcosm. Still, Bruno furnished the idea of a universe that would always present new things to discover, and hence the idea of an inquiry that would never be complete and to which new knowledge could always be added.

Michales Loukovikas,3y,"Why were Plato and Aristotle far more influential than their contemporary philosophers? I'm thinking of Democritus, Epicurus, the Cynics, the Skeptics, etc.","Because Plato
 and Aristotle
 were idealists
, while Democritus
 and Epicurus
 were materialists
. The monotheists, who destroyed the Classical Antiquity, still rule the world. Thus they preserved the teleologist
 idealists and erased (literally) the atomist
 materialists. You can find the reason why in the other answers, as well. I choose a more direct approach.

Plato and Aristotle: teleologist idealists. Democritus and Epicurus: atomist materialists.

Democritus (c. 460 – c. 370 or 357 BCE) is now the “father of modern science”. His master, Leucippus
, and him formulated an atomic theory
 of the universe, adopted later by Epicurus: the idea that everything is composed of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms
. Their early views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms appear to be more aligned with those of modern science than any other theories of antiquity. Democritus was a determinist
 scientist philosopher, believing everything to be the result of natural laws. Unlike Aristotle or Plato, he tried to explain the world without reasoning to a purpose, or final cause. Instead, the idealists became so pre-occupied for centuries with the teleological question that hindered progress.

The idealists did everything to discredit the atomists: they claimed that Democritus, born in Abdera, Thrace
, laughed at the foolishness of men. So, they described him as the laughing philosopher, an Abderite (scoffer, mocker), with Abderitan (incessant) laughter. Cicero
 claimed that the air of Ábdera was proverbial in Athens as causing stupidity. The result of all this slander was the so-called “exile of atomism”, after its rejection by authorities such as Aristotle, Plato, and the Christian Church, that lasted too long, until the 17th century, when it was resurrected by Gassendi
 and Descartes
. In the meantime, all writings by Leucippus and Democritus, and most of Epicurus, were “lost”. The loss is irreplaceable if we take into account the vast scope of the Democritean work regarding ethics, natural science, mathematics, cosmology, music, art and literature, etc.

According to Diogenes Laërtius
 (Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers
), Aristotle’s disciple, “Aristoxenus
, in his Historical Notes, affirms that Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that he could collect, but Amyclas and Cleinias
, the Pythagoreans
, prevented him, as it would be of no use, for the books were already widely circulated… Plato, though he mentions almost all the early philosophers, never once alludes to Democritus, not even where it would be necessary to controvert him, obviously because he knew he would have to match himself against the greatest of philosophers”…

Conclusion: Diogenes thought that a) Democritus was ”the greatest of philosophers”, greater than Plato or Aristotle; b) Plato was afraid to confront Democritus, that’s why he never mentioned him. On the contrary, Plato devoted a dialogue on Protagoras
, who was also born in Abdera. Due to his inferiority complex, being unable to controvert Democritus, Plato wished to burn his books!

Avoiding the encounter, Plato passed the torch to Aristotle who wrote a monograph on Democritus, praising him for arguing from sound considerations appropriate to natural philosophy, and regarding him as an outstanding rival. This may be the reason why this monograph, albeit Aristotelian, was also “lost”; only a few passages quoted in other sources have survived. The predominance of Platonic philosophy
 in the 4th century BCE, and the spread of Platonic schools must be the reason why Democritean thought and work was brushed aside and vanished. What survived could not pass through the “Symplegades
” of Christian “zealots”; and what has been brought down to us includes many fragments, most of which, however, are on ethics and not physics.

● The atomist view on the cosmos
: the world is born when many atoms of various shapes gather and produce a whirl, separating the fine bodies, while bringing together the heavier bodies at the centre in a first sphere (earth). As long as the atoms are infinite, and the void is also infinite, our world is anything but a unique phenomenon. Thus, the atomists are the first thinkers to have clearly put forward the idea that there are infinite worlds. In their system there are three eternally existing elements: the atoms, the void, and motion-change (kinesis). Proposing that motion-change is eternal, Democritus was aware that in this way he removed all anthropomorphic elements from the natural world.

The mechanisms of nature function without being regulated by any higher power. Can it be that everything in nature happens without order, or by chance? Judging by Plato and Aristotle, many after Democritus have interpreted the atomist theory in this way. Plato launches a harsh attack in his Laws
 against Democritus (without mentioning his name), and the “wicked, disrespectful” philosophers, who claim that the greatest and finest things came to be with no intervention of some intellect or god, and are works of nature and chance. These philosophers, claims Plato, are wrong in underestimating the role of the soul, to which they attribute a material substance, but also of the “intelligent purposefulness” governing the universe. The controversy with Democritus must be the motive for the late Plato to write Timaeus
, in an attempt to construct a teleological cosmology in contrast to the supposedly “mechanistic” Democritean universe. Once more, Plato does not mention his rival directly, not even when he adopts a peculiar system of mathematical atomism, in which the atoms of Democritus are replaced by elementary triangles.

Medieval scribe copying manuscripts and book burning by the Church: the two methods of Christian censorship.

Medieval Obscurantism
. The Christians adopted two methods of censorship: Book burning
, and copying classical works in the medieval monasteries. According to Catherine Nixey
 (The Darkening Age
 / The Christian Destruction of the Classical World):(*)

(*) Catherine Nixey – how ironic! – is the daughter of a nun and a monk. Yet, her parents were anything but dogmatic (a rare exception); thus she was not indoctrinated (brainwashed).

“Unsurprisingly, the works of despised authors suffered. At a time in which parchment
 was scarce, many ancient writers were simply erased, scrubbed away so that their pages could be reused for more elevated themes… The work of Democritus… was entirely lost.”

“This theory… offered an alternative view to the idea of a ‘Creation myth’, and stated that everything in the world was made not by any divine being but by the collision and combination of atoms… These particles were invisible to the naked eye but had their own structure and could not be cut (temno [τέμνω > ἄ-τομον, a-tom]) into any smaller particles… Everything that you see or feel, these materialists argued, is made up of two things: atoms and space… The distinct species of animals were explained by a form of proto-Darwinism
… ‘No thing is ever by divine power produced from nothing’, wrote Lucretius
 in his great poem, On the Nature of Things; ‘no single thing returns to nothing’. Atomic theory thus neatly did away with the need for and possibility of Creation, Resurrection, the Last Judgement, Hell, Heaven and the Creator God himself.

“In the ensuing centuries, texts that contained such dangerous ideas paid a heavy price for their ‘heresy’… Some of the greatest figures in the early Church rounded on the atomists. Augustine
 disliked atomism for precisely the same reason the atomists liked it: it weakened mankind’s terror of divine punishment and Hell.(**)

(**) This is exactly the reason why Plato and Aristotle were far more influential than their contemporary philosophers after the Classical Antiquity had been destroyed. Would anybody expect the monotheists (mainly the Christians, but also the Muslims) to preserve Democritus and the pre-Socratics
, Epicurus and all the rest?

“Democritus was an astonishing polymath who had written works on a breathless array of other topics… Today his most famous theory is his atomism. What did the other theories state? We have no idea: every single one of his works was lost in the ensuing centuries. As the eminent physicist Carlo Rovelli
 wrote, after citing a long list of the philosopher’s titles: ‘the loss of the works of Democritus in their entirety is the greatest intellectual tragedy to ensue from the collapse of the old classical civilisation’.

“Democritus’s atomic theory did, however, come down to us – but on a very slender thread: it was contained in one single volume of Lucretius’s great poem, that was held in one single German library, that one single intrepid book hunter would eventually find and save from extinction. That single volume would have an astonishing afterlife: it became a literary sensation; returned atomism to European thought; created what… was called ‘an explosion of interest in pagan antiquity’, and influenced Newton
, Galileo

His master, Leucippus\n, and him formulated an atomic theory\n of the universe, adopted later by Epicurus: the idea that everything is composed of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms\n. Their early views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms appear to be more aligned with those of modern science than any other theories of antiquity. Democritus was a determinist\n scientist philosopher, believing everything to be the result of natural laws. Unlike Aristotle or Plato, he tried to explain the world without reasoning to a purpose, or final cause. Instead, the idealists became so pre-occupied for centuries with the teleological question that hindered progress.\n\nThe idealists did everything to discredit the atomists: they claimed that Democritus, born in Abdera, Thrace\n, laughed at the foolishness of men. So, they described him as the laughing philosopher, an Abderite (scoffer, mocker), with Abderitan (incessant) laughter. Cicero\n claimed that the air of Ábdera was proverbial in Athens as causing stupidity. The result of all this slander was the so-called “exile of atomism”, after its rejection by authorities such as Aristotle, Plato, and the Christian Church, that lasted too long, until the 17th century, when it was resurrected by Gassendi\n and Descartes\n. In the meantime, all writings by Leucippus and Democritus, and most of Epicurus, were “lost”. The loss is irreplaceable if we take into account the vast scope of the Democritean work regarding ethics, natural science, mathematics, cosmology, music, art and literature, etc.\n\nAccording to Diogenes Laërtius\n (Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\n), Aristotle’s disciple, “Aristoxenus\n, in his Historical Notes, affirms that Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that he could collect, but Amyclas and Cleinias\n, the Pythagoreans\n, prevented him, as it would be of no use, for the books were already widely circulated… Plato, though he mentions almost all the early philosophers, never once alludes to Democritus, not even where it would be necessary to controvert him, obviously because he knew he would have to match himself against the greatest of philosophers”…\n\nConclusion: Diogenes thought that a) Democritus was ”the greatest of philosophers”, greater than Plato or Aristotle; b) Plato was afraid to confront Democritus, that’s why he never mentioned him. On the contrary, Plato devoted a dialogue on Protagoras\n, who was also born in Abdera. Due to his inferiority complex, being unable to controvert Democritus, Plato wished to burn his books!\n\nAvoiding the encounter, Plato passed the torch to Aristotle who wrote a monograph on Democritus, praising him for arguing from sound considerations appropriate to natural philosophy, and regarding him as an outstanding rival.

As long as the atoms are infinite, and the void is also infinite, our world is anything but a unique phenomenon. Thus, the atomists are the first thinkers to have clearly put forward the idea that there are infinite worlds. In their system there are three eternally existing elements: the atoms, the void, and motion-change (kinesis). Proposing that motion-change is eternal, Democritus was aware that in this way he removed all anthropomorphic elements from the natural world.\n\nThe mechanisms of nature function without being regulated by any higher power. Can it be that everything in nature happens without order, or by chance? Judging by Plato and Aristotle, many after Democritus have interpreted the atomist theory in this way. Plato launches a harsh attack in his Laws\n against Democritus (without mentioning his name), and the “wicked, disrespectful” philosophers, who claim that the greatest and finest things came to be with no intervention of some intellect or god, and are works of nature and chance. These philosophers, claims Plato, are wrong in underestimating the role of the soul, to which they attribute a material substance, but also of the “intelligent purposefulness” governing the universe. The controversy with Democritus must be the motive for the late Plato to write Timaeus\n, in an attempt to construct a teleological cosmology in contrast to the supposedly “mechanistic” Democritean universe.
