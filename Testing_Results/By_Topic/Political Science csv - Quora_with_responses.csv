Jeremy Glenesk,Updated 4y,"As a liberal, is there anything that bothers you about other liberals?","I think, for me, it would be the ‘outrage culture’ of the left. It seems that every single day, there is something new and terribly heinous to get offended and enraged about. Now, there is definitely a lot of shitty things going on out there, and there are real, legitimate issues in need of fixing, without a doubt.

But I feel we need to pick our battles. It’s really hard to get opponents to see our viewpoints, when all they see is us throwing a fit over every little thing. And that, further, if they don’t support us in every fight, then they are the enemy.

Case in point? Nike releasing a new shoe for LGBT Pride month:

Nike stirs controversy by using a pink triangle on shoes in their Pride collection

And my Facebook feed blows up with people decrying Nike for using a symbol originally used to mark gay men during the Holocaust. I had people all over my feed going “omg, how could they not know this?! Did they not talk to a single gay person before making this shoe?! Boycott Nike!” Then it turns out, yes, they actually did talk to people in the LGBT community, and that that symbol had been reclaimed and repurposed. Then the hysteria instead turns to Nike attempting to make a buck off the LGBT community.

Is this what we need to be fighting for? A fucking shoe? Or are there not more important issues to be discussing?

I don’t know, I just feel sometimes, it’s hard to be continually enraged. Sometimes, just sometimes, I want to be able to relax without needing to get upset over the latest slight, and choose to fight over the more important issues instead when necessary.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gldnpytomf6ie8j0', 'title': 'As a liberal, is there anything that bothers you about other liberals?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think, for me, it would be the ‘outrage culture’ of the left.

Aman Gupta,Updated 4y,What is wrong with Indian Politics?,"We Indians don't deserve this country.

Indian Airlines Flight 814, commonly known as IC 814 was an Indian Airline's Airbus A300 en route from Tribhuvan 
International 
Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal to Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, India on Friday, 24 December 1999, when it was hijacked and flown to several locations before landing in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen
 was accused of the hijacking with the support and active assistance from ISI
.[1]

[3]

The demands of terrorists were 1400 crores and release of 36 terrorist who were in jail.

The hijack forced the Indian government release three captive islamic terrorist- Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, Ahmed Omar Saed Sheik and Maulana Masood Azhar(founder of terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad).

When people were protesting after kandhar hijack to force government to full fill every demand of the terrorists then widow of squadron commander Ajay Ahuja who martyred in Kargil war came voluntarily to make the country understand that nation is more important than the family, government is trying its best to handle and negotiate with the terrorists and we should not pressurize the government to accept the demands of the terrorists.

People shouted:

“Ye pagal vidhwa sabko vidhwa karana chahti hai”

“Are kargil kya kashmir bhi dena pade to de do”

“Bhag ja yaha se vidhwa”

(Translation: if kashmir is required to give then give it also, this mad widow wants everyone to become a widow, go away from here you widow)

This is how some Indians treated the family members of a martyr who died for our security when our own family was in danger.

Selfish citizens and opportunist politicians made the country to bow down and accept their demands after some negotiations.

Atul Chauhan,Updated 3y,How bad is politics in India?,"This man needs no introduction. Well versed in 15 languages. This is the only man in congress party for whom I have loads of respect. For those who don't know him, he is P.V Narasimha Rao, the 9th Prime Minister of India from 1991–1996.

He led an important administration, overseeing a major economic transformations and several home incidents affecting national security of India. He ended the License Raj and lead India towards an economic stability. He appointed Manmohan Singh as his FM. He is often referred to as the ""Father of Indian Economic Reforms"" . He was the real implementer of LPG model.

APJ Abdul Kalam described Rao as a ""patriotic statesman who believed that the nation is bigger than the political system"". Kalam acknowledged that Rao in fact asked him to get ready for nuclear tests in 1996 but they were not carried out as government at center
 got changed due to 1996 general election
. The tests were later conducted by Vajpayee-led NDA
government. In fact Rao briefed Vajpayee on nuclear plans.

His name was also tossed against the demolition of Babri structure. He was criticised by many to let the demolition happen and all the blamed alone for the incident. the blot which he carried till his death. But that’s a different story altogether.

That was a brief introduction about him. He was an honest politician who always lived for Nation and and his party. He was so loyal for Congress. But what congress did with him is not worth discussing . Yet you all should know. ”

Rao suffered a heart attack on 9 December 2004, and was taken to the AIIMS DELHI where he died 14 days later at the age of 83. Below is the excerpt from the famous book Half lion, which describes the cut to cut actions taken after his demise.

His family wanted the body cremated in Delhi. But unfortunately he was not from Nehru family and was not so good at bootlicking the Gandhi dynasty. So he was a huge pain the ass for “Madam Gandhi”. Moreover the cremation at Lutyens Zone in Capital region is the right only conferred to Gandhi family whether they are politician or not. Have a look at the hypocrisy.

The corpse was clad in white dhoti and golden silk kurta. At 2.30 p.m., it was brought from Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences to 9 Motilal Nehru Marg. P.V. Narasimha Rao, prime minister of India from 1991 to 1996, had died at around 11 a.m., 23 December 2004. The doctors had needed a couple of hours to dress the body before sending it back home.

One of the first people to arrive at Rao’s house was Chandraswami, the bearded guru who had known him since 1971. Also present were his eight sons and daughters —whom he had kept at a distance — as well as the nephews and grandchildren he had been closer to. Eldest son, Ranga Rao — who had fought bitterly with his father — inconsolable.

Then began the politics.

The home minister, Shivraj Patil, suggested to Rao’s youngest son, Prabhakara, that ‘the body should be cremated in Hyderabad’. But the family preferred Delhi. After all, Rao had last been chief minister of Andhra Pradesh more than thirty years ago, and had since worked as Congress general secretary, Union minister, and finally Prime Minister — all in Delhi. On hearing this, the usually decorous Shivraj Patil snapped, ‘No one will come.’

Kashmiri Congressman Ghulam Nabi Azad, another aide of party president Sonia Gandhi, arrived. He too requested the family to move the body to Hyderabad. An hour later, Prabhakara received a call on his mobile phone. It was Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, the Congress chief minister of Andhra Pradesh and no friend of Narasimha Rao’s. ‘I just heard about it,’ Reddy said, ‘I am near Anantapur, and I’ll be in Delhi by this evening. Take it from me. We will give him a grand funeral [in Hyderabad].’

At 6.30 p.m., Sonia Gandhi entered the house in Motilal Nehru Marg, named after her great-grandfather-in-law. Prime minister Manmohan Singh followed, along with Pranab Mukherjee. They walked through the long corridor to the room at the end where Rao’s body, now decked in flowers, was displayed. ‘What do you want to do with the body?’ the prime minister asked Prabhakara. ‘These people say it should be in Hyderabad.’ ‘This [Delhi] is his karmabhoomi,’ Prabhakara replied, ‘you should convince your Cabinet colleagues.’ Manmohan nodded. Sonia Gandhi was standing nearby. She said little.

The journalist Sanjaya Baru arrived. His bureaucrat father knew Rao from the 1960s. As Baru entered the corridor, Sonia’s political secretary tapped him on the shoulder. ‘You know the family,’ Ahmed Patel said. ‘The body should be taken to Hyderabad. Can you convince them?’ Baru continued walking towards the end of the corridor, when he heard someone cry. He turned left to see Kalyani Shankar sobbing in a sideroom. Kalyani had been Rao’s most trusted friend for the last two decades.

Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had by now reached Delhi. ‘It is our government, trust me,’ he told Rao’s family. ‘Let him be moved to Hyderabad. We will build a grand memorial for him there.’ Rao’s daughter S. Vani Devi says, ‘YSR was playing a major role in convincing [the] family to get the dead body to Hyderabad.’

The family wanted a commitment that a memorial would be built for Rao in Delhi. The Congress leaders present said yes. But considering how the party had treated Rao in his retirement, the family wanted to make doubly sure. At 9.30 p.m., they paid a visit to the one man who had stood by Narasimha Rao in the last years of his life. Manmohan Singh was wearing his nightdress, a white kurta-pyjama, when Rao’s family met him at his official residence on Race Course Road. When Shivraj Patil explained the demand for a memorial in Delhi, Manmohan replied, ‘No problem, we will do it.’ Prabhakara recalls, ‘We sensed even then that Sonia-ji did not want Father’s funeral in Delhi. She did not want a memorial [in Delhi] . . . She did not want him [to be seen] as an all-India leader . . . [But] there was pressure.’

‘We agreed.’

The next day, 24 December 2004, leaders from across the political spectrum —from communists to BJP leaders — all came to pay their respects. At 10 a.m., the body was draped in the national flag, put on a flower-decked carriage pulled by an army vehicle, and escorted by military personnel in a slow procession towards the airport. Along the way, they planned to stop at 24 Akbar Road, the Congress party headquarters. Ever since Narasimha Rao had first moved into 9, Motilal Nehru Marg in 1980, he had made this journey countless times.

As the body approached 24 Akbar Road, located adjacent to Sonia Gandhi’s residence, the funeral procession slowed. The entrance gate to the compound looked firmly shut. There were several senior Congressmen present, but hardly any cadres had been rustled up. No slogans filled the air, just deathly silence. The carriage stopped on the pavement outside, as Sonia Gandhi and others came out to pay their respects.

It was customary for the bodies of past Congress presidents to be taken inside the party headquarters so that ordinary workers could pay their respects. The family was somewhat dazed when this did not happen. A friend of Rao’s asked a senior Congresswoman to let the body in. ‘The gate does not open,’ she replied. ‘This was untrue,’ the friend remembers.‘When Madhavrao Scindia died [some years earlier] the gate was opened for him.’ Manmohan Singh now lives in a guarded bungalow a few minutes from Akbar Road. When asked why Rao’s body wasn’t allowed into the Congress headquarters, he replies that he was present, but has no knowledge of this. Another Congressman is more forthcoming. ‘We were expecting the gate to be opened . . . but no order came. Only one person could give that order.’

He adds, ‘She did not give it.’

After this final humiliation, P V Narasimha Rao left New Delhi for Hyderabad, this time for good.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was reportedly unhappy with the treatment meted out to Rao in death. He was present at the funeral in Hyderabad on the banks of Hussain Sagar Lake. So were his Cabinet colleagues and BJP leader Advani, writes Sitapati. But Sonia Gandhi chose to stay away.

“When the dignitaries left a couple of hours later, the body was still burning. That night, (local) television channels showed visuals of the half-burnt body, skull still visible, lying abandoned. Stray dogs were pulling at the funeral pyre”. (Half Lion, Page 119)

The state government (run by Congress chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy) was apparently unhappy with the TV channels for beaming pictures that “disrespected the great man”.

Rao was a stalwart. He was one of India’s best prime ministers. His death should have occasioned national mourning and a tribute matching one of India’s greatest leaders. Instead, he was denied even basic human dignity and in death, endured the final act of humiliation authored by a vengeful party that was desperate to erase his name and legacy.

Eldest son, Ranga Rao — who had fought bitterly with his father — inconsolable.\n\nThen began the politics.\n\nThe home minister, Shivraj Patil, suggested to Rao’s youngest son, Prabhakara, that ‘the body should', 'result': {'fake': 0.0205, 'real': 0.9795}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'be cremated in Hyderabad’. But the family preferred Delhi. After all, Rao had last been chief minister of Andhra Pradesh more than thirty years ago, and had since worked as Congress general secretary, Union minister, and finally Prime Minister — all in Delhi. On hearing this, the usually decorous Shivraj Patil snapped, ‘No one will come.’\n\nKashmiri Congressman Ghulam Nabi Azad, another aide of party president Sonia Gandhi, arrived. He too requested the family to move the body to Hyderabad. An hour later, Prabhakara received a call on his mobile phone. It was Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, the Congress chief minister of Andhra Pradesh and no friend of Narasimha Rao’s. ‘I just heard about it,’ Reddy said, ‘I am near Anantapur, and I’ll be in Delhi by this evening. Take it from me. We will give him a grand funeral [in Hyderabad].’\n\nAt 6.30 p.m., Sonia Gandhi entered the house in Motilal Nehru Marg, named after her great-grandfather-in-law. Prime minister Manmohan Singh followed, along with Pranab Mukherjee. They walked through the long corridor to the room at the end where Rao’s body, now decked in flowers, was displayed. ‘What do you want to do with the body?’ the prime minister asked Prabhakara. ‘These people say it should be in Hyderabad.’ ‘This [Delhi] is his karmabhoomi,’ Prabhakara replied, ‘you should convince your Cabinet colleagues.’ Manmohan nodded. Sonia Gandhi was standing nearby. She said little.\n\nThe journalist Sanjaya Baru arrived. His bureaucrat father knew Rao from the 1960s. As Baru entered the corridor, Sonia’s political secretary tapped him on the shoulder. ‘You know the family,’ Ahmed Patel said. ‘The body should be taken to Hyderabad. Can you convince them?’ Baru continued walking towards the end of the corridor, when he heard someone cry. He turned left to see Kalyani Shankar sobbing in a sideroom. Kalyani had been Rao’s most trusted friend for the last two decades.\n\nY.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had by now reached Delhi. ‘It is our government, trust me,’ he told Rao’s family. ‘Let him be moved to Hyderabad. We will build a grand memorial for him there.’ Rao’s daughter S. Vani Devi says, ‘YSR was playing a major role in convincing [the] family to get the dead body to Hyderabad.’\n\nThe family wanted a commitment that a memorial would be built for Rao in Delhi. The Congress leaders present said yes. But considering how the party had treated Rao in his retirement, the family wanted to make doubly sure. At 9.30 p.m., they paid a visit to the one man who had stood by Narasimha Rao in the last years of his life. Manmohan Singh was wearing his nightdress, a white kurta-pyjama, when Rao’s family met him at his official residence on Race Course Road. When Shivraj Patil explained the demand for a memorial in Delhi, Manmohan replied, ‘No problem, we will do it.’ Prabhakara recalls, ‘We sensed even then that Sonia-ji did not want Father’s funeral in Delhi.

At 10 a.m., the body was draped in the national flag, put on a flower-decked carriage pulled by an army vehicle, and escorted by military personnel in a slow procession towards the airport. Along the way, they planned to stop at 24 Akbar Road, the Congress party headquarters. Ever since Narasimha Rao had first moved into 9, Motilal Nehru Marg in 1980, he had made this journey countless times.\n\nAs the body approached 24 Akbar Road, located adjacent to Sonia Gandhi’s residence, the funeral procession slowed.

The carriage stopped on the pavement outside, as Sonia Gandhi and others came out to pay their respects.\n\nIt was customary for the bodies of past Congress presidents to be taken inside the party headquarters so that ordinary workers could pay their respects. The family was somewhat dazed when this did not happen. A friend of Rao’s asked a senior Congresswoman to let the body in. ‘The gate does not open,’ she replied. ‘This was untrue,’ the friend remembers.‘When Madhavrao Scindia died [some years earlier] the gate was opened for him.’ Manmohan Singh now lives in a guarded bungalow a few minutes from Akbar Road. When asked why Rao’s body wasn’t allowed into the Congress headquarters, he replies that he was present, but has no knowledge of this. Another Congressman is more forthcoming. ‘We were expecting the gate to be opened . . . but no order came. Only one person could give that order.’\n\nHe adds, ‘She did not give it.’\n\nAfter this final humiliation, P V Narasimha Rao left New Delhi for Hyderabad, this time for good.\n\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh was reportedly unhappy with the treatment meted out to Rao in death.

Michael,Updated 5y,What are some anti-science views held by the political left?,"Anti-Nuclear energy.

Despite the popular misconception, nuclear energy is actually much cleaner than renewables.

Specifically, solar panels produce around 300 times more waste than nuclear reactors for the same amount of energy harvested.

But what kind of waste, exactly?

For starters, the production and renewal of solar panels produce dangerous amounts of lead, chromium, cadmium and arsenic.

With the average lifespan of solar panels being 20 ~ 30 years, they have to be constantly replaced and renewed to work properly. This creates a ton of waste.

How about other types of renewables? Hydro and wind must surely be better than nuclear?

Well, not really.

As you can see, nuclear power plants require significantly less construction materials than renewable power plants.

Okay, so we get it. Nuclear is cleaner than renewables. But it’s certainly dangerous, right? After all, it’s a bomb inside a drum.

Eh… not really.

Obviously, the fission process of a nuclear bomb is different from the fission process of a power plant.

But still… there can be accidents, right?

Yes, but accidents are almost guaranteed to not happen.

If well-maintained and regulated, nuclear power plants are extremely safe.

Especially if regulated by A.I. rather than people, there is virtually no chance of a meltdown.

Even in the face of natural disasters, nuclear power plants can be given safety measures to shut down before it unleashes harm.

Edit:

People have pointed out Chernobyl in the comments.

I understand the worry, but it’s really pointless. Seriously. Chernobyl happened in 1986. We shouldn’t even compare those outdated reactors from 1986 to modern day reactors.

It’s literally like comparing a 1986 Macintosh Plus to a 2018 Macbook Pro.

It’s the same with Fukushima. It happened in 2011!

Nuclear technology has evolved since then, and countermeasures to natural disasters have been developed.

People have also pointed out that even if a system is 99.9999% safe, if it isn’t 100% safe, we shouldn’t use it.

News flash: nothing in this world is perfect.

Literally.

Cars? 1.25 million die per year. On average, 3,200 people die per day. And this is excluding the 20 ~ 50 million who are injured or disabled.

Sleeping? Who knows, there’s a chance that a murderer will break into your house and kill you.

Living on planet Earth? Believe it or not, there’s always a chance of a gamma ray burst striking Earth at any moment. And there’s nothing we can do to prevent it.

Nuclear power plants are actually on the safe side. Meltdowns are likely to never happen, especially if regulated by computers rather than humans.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wz5rs9e76b842k0v', 'title': 'What are some anti-science views held by the political left?', 'score': {'original': 0.9973, 'ai': 0.0027}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Anti-Nuclear energy.\n\nDespite the popular misconception, nuclear energy is actually much cleaner than renewables.\n\nSpecifically, solar panels produce around 300 times more waste than nuclear reactors for the same amount of energy harvested.\n\nBut what kind of waste, exactly?\n\nFor starters, the production and renewal of solar panels produce dangerous amounts of lead, chromium, cadmium and arsenic.\n\nWith the average lifespan of solar panels being 20 ~ 30 years, they have to be constantly replaced and renewed to work properly.

Chris O'Leary,Dec 19,Why does the right wing say fascism is left wing? Is there any truth to it?,"It’s called the “I know you are, but what am I?” defense. And no, it never actually worked on the Kindergarten playground.

This is something you started to see 4 or 5 years ago: a push from right-wingers to redefine the word fascism as a left-wing thing. If you’ve been paying attention, according to the right-wing, all good things are us, and all bad things are them; fascism is bad, therefore, it must be them. This is a pretty clear-cut template of right-wing messaging today.

“Nazis were really left wing because the word “Socialist” is in the party name; just ignore what they actually did and said about socialists and socialism.” “Democrats are the real fascists,” “Democrats are the real racists, misogynists, etc, etc, etc.”

When you look at it in reality, it’s clear the people who blowhard about it have as much trouble defining “fascism” as they do “socialism,” and without fail, they are mixing up the terms “fascism” and “authoritarianism” which are not synonyms, that’s like saying “face” and “nose” are the same thing because a nose is a typical feature of a face.

The fact of the matter is that in and of itself, Fascism is not expressly “right-wing” or even conservative, but it is associated with the far right because fascists have always risen by espousing right-wing favored ideology and gaining power through the right. Similarly, Left-wing authoritarian dictatorships have typically risen through communism.

Fascism is an authoritarian ideology emphasizing extreme nationalism, ethnic exceptionalism, militarism, and the supremacy of the nation represented in a single authoritarian leader vested with all the political power in one voice. Do ANY of those things sound like left-wing ideas? If so, why do Trumpists keep accusing Democrats of “hating America,” “Hating the troops,” and “Hating Trump” while claiming America “isn’t a democracy.”

When you hear:

“My country before all other countries, my country first,” “We were great before we stopped following our traditional (esp. religious) values; everything else is socialism” “this isn’t a democracy” “Everyone who isn’t us is socialist and socialism is destroying everything” “Only our leader can return us to greatness, everyone else should get out of his way,” “Everyone who isn’t us hates our country” “Everyone who doesn’t love our leader hates our country” “The biggest problem is THOSE people (*pointing to a typically marginalized segment of society that is easy to categorize) our leader will do something about them” “Everyone who criticizes our leader just hates him because they’re evil and they know he will stop them” “the elites who control our schools and our media are the problem, something has to be done about them”

You’re listening to fascists.

What Is Fascism?
In this free resource, learn how Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler rose to power and the lessons their political journeys hold for today.
https://world101.cfr.org/contemporary-history/world-war/what-fascism

Historically, fascism has risen in a predictable pattern.

Fascism doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it typically rises from disillusionment and polarization. Francisco Franco rose to power in Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, leading the Spanish Nationalists against the left-wing “Popular Front.” Mussolini and Hitler rose to power by capitalizing on the political and economic fallout from World War 1, as did Ferenc Szalasi of Hungary.

In Russia, the closest thing to a fascist government today, Vladimir Putin’s rise occurred in the shadow of economic turmoil dating back to the fall of communism and the USSR.

Historically fascist political parties, like Mussolini’s Fascist Party Franco’s Falange Espanola, or the Nazis have used periods of turmoil to gain legitimacy and used the typical “traditional values and socialism is the greatest threat to our existence” calling card to partner with conservatives speaking the same language to gain the foothold needed to gain enough power not so much to tear the institutions that balance power in a free society down, but to overtake them. While Mussolini left certain institutions, like the Catholic Church alone, the Nazis dominated everything, ripping anyone who wasn't a Nazi or at least publicly pro-Nazi out of the universities, the media, the bureaucracy, the judiciary, Effectively within a few short years turning Germany into a one-party country, and eventually discarding even the pretense of elections.

Once fully in power, all those things apologists would say “Oh, he doesn’t really mean THAT” about start to come to pass. Say goodbye to freedom of speech, the free press, and dissenting voices disappear. Inconvenient things like written laws fall in favor of the whim of the leader. Yes, he really DID mean that when he said what he said about “those people.” Yes, he meant what they said he meant about human rights and silly little Constitutions. And suddenly… those people he’s after….that’s starting to sound like me.

It isn’t easy for fascists to get into power. it happens over decades of backsliding away from democratic norms, and piles upon piles of BULLSHIT. Fascists don’t gain power by telling the truth. The do it by lying.

Ian Lang,Tue,"What comes first, economics or political science?","Ah.

Given the way the question is phrased, my immediate answer would be “screw them both, and let’s find out” but I suppose one of the haute-bourgeois soi-disant intellectuals on here will accuse me of being a vulgarian for it. Not that I’m not a vulgarian, of course, so they would be quite right, but hey-ho, vulgar just means “of the common people” and since if oikism was an Olympic event I’d probably get at least the bronze it’s rather pointless to point it out.

Er……was there not a question? Was it “how much of a dirty joke can you make from an innocent question?” No? Damn. Better go and look again, then: oh, that.

Political Science may claim to be a science but it is so in the same way that I can put on a tutu and claim to be Tatyana Prancallova, a Prima Ballerina Assoluta at the Bolshoi. It’s one of the social sciences. Now, social sciences are what you do when you aren’t good enough at maths for proper sciences, you aren’t good enough at practical things for engineering or design, you can’t draw or paint well enough for art, and you haven’t got the patience to plough through any of the Humanities. So it’s either SocSci or Geography (which gets lumped in with humanities, true, because although it is actually very slow physics with trees stuck on, the physicists really do not want any truck with it, and the geographers themselves don’t want to be stuck with Humanities, and again all the geographers are far too bright to want to be regarded as social science; so Humanities, who think it a bit too mathsy to be a proper humanities subject, get stuck with it as they are a bunch of arty-fairies and they don’t want to be shouted at for refusing) and if you can’t grasp the hang of trigonometry then you’re not going to get very far in map-juggling, so SocSci it is for you and you should have worked a bit harder at French, or History, or even Geography, at whatever it is you did instead of O level at school, shouldn’t you?

Er, again…..oh, yes. That. The practical upshot is that SocSci attracts the dull-brained kids. No, really, y’know the ones. The ones that have read works of philosophy that they only half-understand but they’re going to cite them until the cows come home and it doesn’t matter that the essays are full of citations of half-understood works and nothing original because all the people who teach it are like that too. The ones who write using simple words in a monotone and very, odd punctuation because the talent for creating interesting work is not, one they have and suddenly they will at, random intervals insert a buzzword because it is, a consensus. Nietzsche says so.

But even in the dull-brained kids there is a hierarchy (Maslow) and right up the top there, as kings of this dismal netherworld, for “better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven” (Milton, Paradise Lost, 1.263), are the economists. No. Really. They are. Yes indeed. Think about that. Economists are the brightest of them. What must the others be like?

I will tell you. Second in line are the politics students. They are the unoriginal thinkers who can’t do long division, which precludes their getting on an economics course. A looooong way down from that are the psychology students, who can’t add, subtract, or multiply, which is why they do psychology and not politics. I don’t recommend it as a practical course of action, but you can go deeper down into the infernal circles, and there you will discover sociologists. They are doing this degree because their English isn’t good enough for psychology.

Whisper it gently, and if you are of a nervous disposition, you may want to bail out here on this paragraph, because there is a level lower than Sociology. No, it isn’t tapeworms. They’re roughly on a par. That which we are talking about here is a subject that few men dare to countenance, and should you be eating or drinking swallow it now, for I do not wish you to choke as I mention that which, in polite circles, and even most impolite ones, is considered taboo- the matter of Gender Studies. The reason that few men dare to countenance it is that it is the demesne of the sort of person that has been described as “a bunch of hairy-legged vegan lesbian crackpots and dreadful old harpies” (Descartes’ final letter to Hobbes) where misandry is not only the norm but the expected. Seriously, if you are in possession of a bulge in your trousers rather than your blouses avoid them like the plague; Captain Kirk wouldn’t boldy go there, and even Picard is on record as saying he’d rather face the Borg.

Well, I had an economist look over this piece and he reckons that it should upset about fifty-five percent of everybody who reads it and so my work here is done. Although since it’s an economist that’s made that prediction, I’ve weighted it for how wrong they usually are and I reckon it’s going to be more like eighty-seven. Bwuhahaha!

I blame the EU.

Habib F,4y,"How do American voters view the current philosophy of the Democratic Party, moderate, liberal, progressive or other?","It depends on who they are.

Many liberals view the party as being too beholden to corporate interests.
Moderate Democrats think the party is moving too far to the left.
People on the right think the party has become “socialist.” This rhetoric is usually followed by admonitions against turning the country into Venezuela.

But if you look at the ideology of Democratic Partisans, this is what you see:[1]

The ideological center of gravity is center-left. Moderates are still nearly as numerous as liberals. And as recently as 2014, there were more moderates than liberals.

Still, people are noticing a change. What the graph above shows is that the party members are center left on average. It doesn’t say anything about the policies proposed by the party. And on that score, what we have seen since Clinton’s defeat was that most of the contenders for the Democratic nomination are much closer to Bernie Sanders than to Hillary Clinton. This puzzles many people on the right. Shouldn’t Democrats feel chastened by losing in 2016? Shouldn’t they move to the center to try to recapture the votes they lost?

This speaks to a difference in perception on the meaning of 2016. To many conservatives and right-leaners, the verdict was clear: a repudiation of Obama and of the perceived excesses of liberalism. This diagnosis being made, the cure is simple and straightforward: less liberalism.

But liberals see it differently:

Hillary was supported by 3 million more people. Her loss hardly amounts to a repudiation of liberalism.
Trump’s victory was extremely close, so close in fact that it was basically a fluke, a freak event unlikely to be replicated in the future. The fact that this very close thing was the only thing Republicans could manage after 8 years of supposed Obama fatigue means that they are in no position to lecture anyone on what it takes to achieve electoral success.
There was an intra-Democratic fight over strategy. The years spent in the Wilderness between LBJ and Clinton—with a brief 4 year interlude in power—had convinced a generation of liberals that only moderate liberalism could win. In 2016, many voters, adhering to this theory, voted for the centrist. But the centrist lost the general election. This robbed centrism of its only appeal for many voters, namely, that it was the winning formula. It’s not surprising that many more voters should be open to voting for the candidates they actually prefer.
Trump himself demonstrated that a party doesn’t have to tack to the center after an electoral defeat. Republicans certainly didn’t moderate their positions after 2012. Yet they won big in 2014, and they recaptured the presidency in 2016. If what we are witnessing is just the ebb and flow of partisan power, some liberals reason that it is better to wait until power falls into the hands of a more committed liberal.

Returning to the original question, perceptions of the ideology of the Democratic Party vary, with some viewing it as still too conservative and others viewing at likely to transform the nation into Venezuela. But what the voters want is a center-left party bringing US governance more in line with that of other Western nations.

Moderates are still nearly as numerous as liberals. And as recently as 2014, there were more moderates than liberals.\n\nStill, people are noticing a change. What the graph above shows is that the party members are center left on average. It doesn’t say anything about the policies proposed by the party. And on that score, what we have seen since Clinton’s defeat was that most of the contenders for the Democratic nomination are much closer to Bernie Sanders than to Hillary Clinton. This puzzles many people on the right. Shouldn’t Democrats feel chastened by losing in 2016? Shouldn’t they move to the center to try to recapture the votes they lost?\n\nThis speaks to a difference in perception on the meaning of 2016. To many conservatives and right-leaners, the verdict was clear: a repudiation of Obama and of the perceived excesses of liberalism. This diagnosis being made, the cure is simple and straightforward: less liberalism.\n\nBut liberals see it differently:\n\nHillary was supported by 3 million more people. Her loss hardly amounts to a repudiation of liberalism.\nTrump’s victory was extremely close, so close in fact that it was basically a fluke, a freak event unlikely to be replicated in the future. The fact that this very close thing was the only thing Republicans could manage after 8 years of supposed Obama fatigue means that they are in no position to lecture anyone on what it takes to achieve electoral success.\nThere was an intra-Democratic fight over strategy. The years spent in the Wilderness between LBJ and Clinton—with a brief 4 year interlude in power—had convinced a generation of liberals that only moderate liberalism could win. In 2016, many voters, adhering to this theory, voted for the centrist. But the centrist lost the general election. This robbed centrism of its only appeal for many voters, namely, that it was the winning formula. It’s not surprising that many more voters should be open to voting for the candidates they actually prefer.\nTrump himself demonstrated that a party doesn’t have to tack to the center after an electoral defeat. Republicans certainly didn’t moderate their positions after 2012. Yet they won big in 2014, and they recaptured the presidency in 2016. If what we are witnessing is just the ebb and flow of partisan power, some liberals reason that it is better to wait until power falls into the hands of a more committed liberal.\n\nReturning to the original question, perceptions of the ideology of the Democratic Party vary, with some viewing it as still too conservative and others viewing at likely to transform the nation into Venezuela.

Dima Vorobiev,1y,Does propaganda still work these days?,"Propaganda is about aligning other people’s worldviews with your agenda.

As such, propaganda is as effective (or as ineffective, no one really knows for certain) as it has been since the invention of human speech.

The reason why so many people question propaganda nowadays is the creeping erosion of the cornerstones of Enlightenment.

Fewer and fewer people trust rationality. It is usurped by scientists, and scientists are a selfish, arrogant bunch. More and more embrace instead conviction. Conviction takes control from scientists and gives it back to common people.
People are tired of facts. If facts don’t care about people’s feelings, why should people care about facts? We need alternative facts, the ones that care about people.
People are sick and tired of knowledge. All too often knowledge makes us feel miserable. As we say in Russia, “the less you know, the better you sleep”. More and more of us go instead for meaning. And as religious people can confirm,
 meaning makes us free from the yoke of cold, impersonal knowledge.

The propaganda landscape around us is populated by pulsing beacons of belonging. The breakneck technological progress and crumbling of traditional social networks make us confused about who we are and where we belong. The beacons of propaganda bring us to our soulmates scattered across the world.

Before the Internet, you thought you were alone. Now, you know you’re not.

This is the era of new tribalism. Tribalism doesn't simply loves propaganda. It is proud of it.

Below, an art piece by Ildár Khánov, from 1967, “Lenin explaining simple things”.

Modernity brought the first wave of New Tribalism. Millions of confused souls thrown up in the air by the crumbling of traditional societies found a new home with their class comrades (Communism), or brothers and sisters in blood and soil (Fascism).

Now comes the flood of its second coming. This New Tribalism is kaleidoscopic in its variety and sophistication. Anti-vaxxing, LGTB+, Brexit, green activism, anti-globalism, anything your heart desires.

Franklin Veaux,1y,In what ways do the political left and right virtue signal?,"This is a complicated question with a complicated answer. Hang on, this might get a little long.

One key difference between the left and the right is often the way they feel about hierarchy. Political conservatives tend (with some exceptions, of course) to lean toward vertical hierarchies; political liberals, toward flat egalitarian social structures.

This isn’t just an American thing. Peer-reviewed, published studies have observed this difference across different societies.[1][2][3] There appears to be a structural, neurological basis for this division.[4] [5]

So how does this play out in virtue signaling?

The simple answer is: While both liberals and conservatives frequently virtue-signal by denouncing external threats or perceived threats—members of the out-group—liberals are far more likely to turn on their own, virtue-signaling by attacking members of the in-group seen as violating the norms and standards of the in-group.

That might seem contradictory at first. If conservatives value hierarchy, and with it conformity, doesn’t that mean conservatives would be likely to turn on people perceived to be insufficiently adhering to the group’s thinking?

And the answer is no.

When you are part of a hierarchy and have strongly hierarchical views, it seems like a natural consequence of that hierarchical thinking is a set of double standards for those at the bottom of the hierarchy vs those at the top. This is how conservatives can claim to support “family values” while worshipping—sometimes literally—a twice-divorced serial adulterer who’s had five children from three different women.

Adherence to the hierarchy itself is what’s important. The people at the top aren’t subject to the rules.

Liberals don’t accept this. Liberals are biased toward egalitarianism; the same rules apply to everybody.

On the one hand, that makes liberals far less likely to overlook transgressions on the part of those at the top. Al Franken was urged to resign when a photo showing him pretending to grope a woman (without touching her) started circulating; on the other side, Matt Gaetz is the subject of a criminal investigation for statutory rape, pandering of a minor, sex trafficking of minors, and obstruction of justice—an investigation that has already resulted in the criminal conviction of a co-conspirator—and conservatives are like “eh, whatever.”

This difference in reaction comes directly from differences in attitude toward hierarchy and egalitarianism.

What this means is that liberals and conservatives both virtue signal, and in many of the same ways, but when they, for example, crank up the Twitter rage machine, conservatives are more likely to target members of out-groups, whereas liberals are much more likely than conservatives to eat their own.

Which is not to say that conservatives never target their own or liberals never target the out-group, of course. One of the biggest modern examples in American history of cancel culture was the conservative rage at the Dixie Chicks, which resulted in employees of radio stations that played their music being stalked and receiving death threats, and venues that hosted Dixie Chicks concerts getting bomb threats.

But the Dixie Chicks committed a crime against hierarchy; they questioned George W. Bush’s rationale for war in Iraq.

This is a big part of the disconnect between liberals and conservatives about cancel culture and free speech. Conservatives will cry about “Liberal cancel culture! Liberals don’t care about free speech!” But when liberals are like “wait, isn’t that what you did with the Dixie Chicks?” conservatives will say “no,” leaving liberals thinking “what a lying pack of hypocrites.” But from the conservative perspective, they aren’t lying and aren’t hypocrites. The Dixie Chicks were attacked for undermining the hierarchy, not for speech. The fact that speech was the tool they used to undermine the hierarchy is an irrelevant detail.

Liberals, on the other hand, turn their virtue-signaling on their own, often for “offenses” that seem inexplicably petty and stupid to conservatives.

This happens to an extraordinary degree in small liberal subcommunities—often, the smaller the subcommunity, the more vicious the virtue-signalling and infighting. I’m reminded of the Henry Kissenger quote, “The reason that university politics is so vicious is because stakes are so small.”

A real-life example:

Some years ago, a woman complained on Tumblr that she didn’t like polyamorous people because polyamorous people would talk about being “poly” on Tumblr posts, and it made it harder for her to search Tumblr with “poly” to find Polynesian Tumblr users.

Now, this was one person on one social media platform, not Polynesian people in general (and in fact “poly” is not generally used as a self-identifier by Polynesian people).

But the polyamory scene, or parts of it, started to turn—sometimes with incredible viciousness—on polyamorous people who used the word “poly,” demanding that they use “polya” or “polyam” instead.

To polyamorous people, those who use the term “poly” committed a crime against the marginalized.

This, too, is a big part of the disconnect between liberals and conservatives about cancel culture and free speech. Liberals will cry about “Conservative cancel culture! Conservatives don’t care about free speech!” But when conservatives are like “wait, isn’t that what you do when you police language around minority groups?” liberals will say “no,” leaving conservatives thinking “what a lying pack of hypocrites.” But from the liberal perspective, they aren’t lying and aren’t hypocrites. The people using the word “poly” were attacked for undermining a historically disenfranchised group, not for speech. The fact that speech was the tool they used to undermine this group is an irrelevant detail.

This kind of policing of the “insufficiently woke” is far more common in liberal than conservative scenes, and it turns easily into virtue signaling when people uninvolved with the original whatever-it-was start to pile on because piling on is an easy, no-cost way to be seen on the side of the righteous. (There’s another pile-on starting up these days about people who use “consensual non-monogamy” vs “ethical non-monogamy” to describe polyamory; the idea is that consent isn’t necessarily ethical, so the people who use “consensual non-monogamy” clearly don’t really care about ethics.)

The pile-on is kind of the definer of virtue signaling. Once it becomes socially acceptable within a certain group to attack a certain person or subset of people, those without any dog in the fight will pile on merely for the admiration of their peers.

Well, also to congratulate themselves for being moralistic too, I suppose, but I gotta say, when you express your virtues only when it’s safe and easy to do so, costs you nothing, and there’s no risk…are they really virtues?

Left and right virtue signaling is generally quite similar:

It involves attacks on perceived threats to the orthodoxy. In conservative circles, the orthodoxy is likely to be the current hierarchy, or dominant religious or social tradition. In liberal circles, the orthodoxy is likely to focus on perceptions of egalitarianism and power imbalances: men always have more power than women (hence “believe all women”), and so forth.
It is an easy tool of bullies to use to exert authority and control. Bullies skilled in whipping up outrage can direct that outrage against targets of their choosing by manipulating the values of their social group.
It is safe, risk-free, and no-cost for those who jump in. Hopping on a bandwagen is pretty much the safest thing you can possibly do; in fact, the person who stands up against bandwagoning is the one who risks more. (Ask anyone who refused to name “Communists” during the McCarthy witch hunts!) The real determinator of your virtue is not what you do when proclaiming your virtue costs you nothing, but what you do when holding to your ideals costs you something.

Where they differ is in the common targets, and of course in the rhetoric used to justify the virtue signaling.

President Putin’s special military operation in Ukraine. Before Feb 24, 2022, he was on his way to history books as a peacemaker and benevolent ruler, the best in Russia’s millennial history. Compare that to the real prospect we’re facing now of his and Russia’s demise within a decade or so.

Misha Firer,Feb 2,Why is Vladimir Putin so popular?,"Tatyana Golikova, Russia’s minister of Social Development, literally walked on Mariupol resident’s bones after the Russian Armed Forces had shelled the city under siege from battle tanks and artillery.

If there is hell, this woman, Tatyana Golikova, will be there.

As a Minister of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, Golikova has been in theory responsible for providing care to the sick, orphans, destitute, poor, and elderly, but she has been blatantly stealing from them - the most vulnerable members of society.

Golikova’s known for coming to Monaco and popping into a Dior store with her assistants and requesting to bring the most expensive merchandise they got to fill up the shopping bags. She’s the kind of person who has no problem wearing a rare, million-dollar Swiss wristwatch to a meeting with retirees who have to choose whether to buy meds or pay utility bills with meager pensions.

Golikova owns golf courses and villas in Spain and Portugal and flies on a private jet, but it all started with Arbidol, an antiviral medication for the treatment of influenza and COVID-19 popularly known as Fakebidol.

The head of Pharmstandard Viktor Kharitonin is a friend of Golikova’s husband, a businessman, and the head of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission Khristenko. As Minister of Health, Golikova included Arbidol, a dodgy Soviet-era placebo in the list of life-saving medicines, and stocked pharmacies with millions of packs.

Pharma-2020 was Putin’s patriotic project to develop local innovative medications to substitute Western pharma. This five-year plan was updated for another five years in 2020.

In the year 2024, a year before the completion of the second five-year plan, the results are astounding: the share of Western medications in the Russian government procurement market has reached a record high of 63%, the highest since, try not to laugh, the year when Putin launched his ambitious Pharma-2020.

Nine years of “work” and billions of dollars embezzled have yielded ZERO results.

Golikova and Kharitonin have generously contributed to this “success”, taking advantage of government funds to fake the development of innovative drugs and pose placebos or medicines that had long been available as new meds. This scheme has involved thousands of corrupt Ministry of Health officials, all acting with absolute impunity as copycats of their boss, Golikova. The entire Russia’s pharma industry is a scam.

I have tutored the children of a pharma company co-founder, at the time it was the second largest in Russia, that took advantage of Pharma-2020 funds to “develop” medicines that it already had in cooperation with the above-mentioned Kharitonov, a go-to man when you have a good idea for a scheme. This former employer then moved to Hong Kong where he bought a villa and his two boys graduated from Harrow school.

When the pandemic began, sales of Arbidol under the name Umifenovir increased by 200% - in just a month 6 million packages were sold. The reason for explosive growth was the recommendation of the Ministry of Health. Golikova inscribed her golden egg-laying drug on page 11 of the manual for the treatment for COVID-19. TV advertisements blared from millions of screens that Umifenovir developed in the Soviet Union was effective in the fight against coronavirus. Golikova pitched Arbidol to China.

Kharitonin and the Golikovs had a stake in the company that produced Covid express tests and owned two hospitals for the treatment of elite patients with coronavirus. The K+31 clinic is located on the site of maternity hospital No. 72 which was shut down during the government program of “optimization” of the healthcare.

The K+31 provided the most expensive treatment for COVID-19 among private clinics in Russia and required a downpayment of 500,000 rubles just to get taken there in an ambulance. In comparison, the most expensive public hospital for COVID patients in Komunarka, the Moscow area used to be daily shown on federal TV channels to make believe that all other hospitals in Russia were as nice and shiny and modern, demanded 300,000 rubles ($5,000) downpayment to reserve a cot plus extra expenses.

As for the rest of the population of the Russian Federation, Golikova sold them Arbidol, a Soviet placebo. And advised to pay 500 rubles per prayer to an officially ordained priest of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Golikova has a product to sell for every purse.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9bn1pe8j63wtgh45', 'title': 'Why is Vladimir Putin so popular?', 'score': {'original': 0.54605, 'ai': 0.45395}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Tatyana Golikova, Russia’s minister of Social Development, literally walked on Mariupol resident’s bones after the Russian Armed Forces had shelled the city under siege from battle tanks and artillery.\n\nIf there is hell, this woman, Tatyana Golikova, will be there.\n\nAs a Minister of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, Golikova has been in theory responsible for providing care to the sick, orphans, destitute, poor, and elderly, but she has been blatantly stealing from them - the most vulnerable members of society.\n\nGolikova’s known for coming to Monaco and popping into a Dior store with her assistants and requesting to bring the most expensive merchandise they got to fill up the shopping bags.

Bala Senthil Kumar,4y,What is the biggest political tragedy now in India?,"The so called Opposition’s utter inability to mount any credible challenge to the ruling dispensation.

Of course I make fun of RaGha and the whole bunch of clowns that stood in oppositon to the BJP and its allies, but that does not make me impervious to simple fact - this dominance is lousy for democracy. It gives the BJP too much room to screw up, and not even be bothered.

It isn’t the BJP’s fault - they know their game, and play it relentlessly well. I love them for it.

This is a tragedy? I think it is ignorance, incompetence and utter lack of intelligence of catastrophic proportions. Of course I don’t even think they are worthy of being helped out at this point in time.

Misha Firer,11mo,What concerns you most about politics today?,"Zombie Burger served processed meat to not yet processed cannon fodder returning from the special military operation.

Vets and minced vet wannabes would open the door with the giant Z and since they were not drunk yet didn’t see anything wrong with it. Until your first glass of vodka in the morning your brain remains zombie dead.

Then the photo of the burger place went viral on Telegram, and the State Duma terrified of any reference to “zombies” that so aptly describes Putin’s sycophants and his war ordered to remove Z’s from the signs and change them with the Russian equivalent letter because when it’s in Russian, it’s less zombie.

Russians have been swapping Cyrillic letters with the Roman script Z’s and V’s for so long that they forgot what the original letters look like.

Special educational courses shall be arranged to teach adults the alphabet that existed prior to SMO.

In Moscow Kinology College ( to study “kino” or cinema in Russian) the dean ordered to swap lectures about the history of movies with the lecture about “family values.”

It was conducted by an Orthodox Cristian priest wearing a huge crucifix looking like he was transported from 14th century in a Time Machine , except the Westernsky glasses, a demonic invention, that he picked up at the optics shop.

“Look at the screen, students . No, don’t look at the maths equations underneath - they are Devil’s work. I cross myself eleven times and spit over my left shoulder thrice my spittle smells of Colgate toothpaste, Devil’s work, and you do, too not to be jinxed. Repeat that at home before you go to bed.

“That’s a typical upper middle class American family. Our oligarchs, bless their pristine souls, aspire to look as healthy and happy as they do. We give them out taxes for that.

“There you can see an Americansky babushka who’s not hunched and doubled over as if she’s planting rice in the paddy the size of the Caspian Sea in front of her apartment block. And her husband wasn’t killed in one of the tsar’s wars or from bootleg vodka intoxication at age 54.

“And the parents are not divorced yet like 80% of you gonna be. Look at the sun-drenched park they are having a picnic at. Do you think it’s in Sochi where our Tsar has a palace and his hand-picked serfs spend vacation to fake that they are patriots?

“It’s in Santa Barbara , California , my stupid friends. A place of family values and happiness. And you, as future movie makers must create such propaganda that our fellow men and women believed that family values is a Russian invention, not of Americansky conservatives republicans.

“Cross yourself twenty times and spit over your right shoulder not to be jinxed with the devil’s work !”

At another university , a questionnaire posted the following question to the students with four possible answers. Kind of telling how jittery Putin’s regime feels at the moment. And more happy Americansky with white teeth from a stock photo in the header.

What do you think , what future awaits Russia ?

Russia is destined for disintegration.
Russia will exist within current borders.
Sooner or later Russia will start the process of uniting nations around it.
I don’t know.

Not a word about peace with the world and neighbors , and prosperity, booming economy, job prospects for the specialists, new hospitals , stand-alone family houses with indoor plumbing.

It’s more invasions or a temporary truce , or collapse or I don’t give a shit because nothing depends on me anyways.

John Cate,2y,What was Dwight D. Eisenhower’s political ideology?,"Ike was a pragmatic New Deal-lite politician, typical of the time period that he was part of when he left military service and entered politics.

He was president at a time when the U.S. was at its least polarized politically since the Era of Good Feeling 140 years earlier. There was very little difference between the two parties. Ike won because he was a war hero and Adlai Stevenson II wasn’t, and looked like a prototypical 1950s high-school principal. These things helped him build a consensus and get a lot of his agenda passed.

He had a successful presidency because he wasn’t afraid to steal popular ideas from others and because he was continuing what were, at the time, successful policies. I have said before that people have so often branded him “underrated” as a president that he is now overrated. But he was successful. He had the auctoritas needed to reduce defense spending, and he knew we could, because no one in the world outside the USSR understood their military capability and its limitations more than he did. He kept New Deal programs going because we could afford to then, and they were popular. He lent his personal prestige to further Harry Truman’s desegregation efforts, especially in the military. Some of the people there did their best to circumlocute Captain Truman’s orders. They didn’t dare when the orders were being reiterated by a man who’d worn five stars.

One of his best ideas came from the Austrian Corporal he’d helped beat in the 1940s. You may have occasionally seen “Eisenhower Memorial Highway” signs along American Interstate highways. Several states have them. The reason for this is that the system was his idea. When WW2 was over, Ike saw the quality of the German Autobahn system, which Weimar had started and Hitler had expanded when he saw its military potential, and how it had helped Germany’s war effort. When he became President, Eisenhower pushed for a similar system in the USA, pointing out its benefits both for national defense and for commerce.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vzq59jyk134tl0be', 'title': 'What was Dwight D.

Alex Johnston,2y,What is the worst political decision in the history of the world?,"Okay, before I describe the nature of this decision, I want to lay down a few ground rules.

This is not a question about the political decision that led to the worst result, in terms of human happiness and progress generally.

Nor is it a question about the political decision which was massively consequential but was made by people we don’t like and which carried out their wishes. Like, for example, the decision by the Nazi regime to engage in industrialised mass murder.

That wasn’t a political decision. It was a strategic and ideological one.

This is a question which is explicitly about the worst political decision.

And I want to be value-neutral about this. I want this to be a question about the art and technique of politics: of getting people to do what you want them to do, which is what politics has always been about.

And therefore, I think I have a candidate, on that level.

It seems to me that a good political decision is a decision, by a politician, that results in that politician getting the outcome that they want.

It follows, therefore, that a bad political decision is a decision made by a politician which produces an outcome that is exactly opposite to what that politician wanted.

Most political decisions that we don’t like, which are addressed in other answers, are decisions by politicians who were doing what they wanted to do, and got the result that they wanted, but which results we, for our own part, deplore.

I would argue that these are good political decisions, if the taking of them helped that politician.

Ronald Reagan’s decision to ignore and/or downplay the AIDS pandemic was a horrible, inhuman, disgusting decision on every level but the political level.

On the political level, it was very successful. It guaranteed him the support of homophobic Republicans.

Reagan was a good politician, but not, I don’t think, a good President. Or a particularly good man. Nevertheless, he was pretty effective at getting things done that he wanted to be done.

It’s in this sense that I’m about to describe what I think was one of the worst political decisions ever made, in that it produced exactly the opposite result that the politician who made it was hoping to get, and then some.

To give my answer, we’ll have to go back to the 19th century.

Specifically, to Australia.

The Old Parliament House, Adelaide, South Australia, 1872.

In the late 19th century, one of the fastest-growing political movements was the women’s suffrage movement, which was agitating to give women the right to vote. In those days, the right to vote was heavily restricted, as it had been for centuries.

The first sovereign nation to give women the right to vote was Norway in 1913; before then, in 1893, women in New Zealand had been granted the right to vote, but New Zealand was at the time a part of the British Empire. Women in the United Kingdom itself didn’t get even restricted voting rights until 1918.

So, come with me, if you will, to South Australia in the late 19th century, where the women’s suffrage movement was gaining momentum.

Women in South Australia had had voting rights in local elections since 1861. It’s always been one of the more liberal regions of Australia.

But when it came to parliamentary elections, women had no such freedom. The Constitution Act 1865
 restricted the vote in parliamentary elections to men over 21 who fulfilled certain property qualifications.

And the only people who could be members of parliament were people who had the vote—i.e., those men.

In 1885, a resolution to give all women the right to vote was introduced to the South Australian House of Assembly by this chap, Edward Charles Stirling:

Stirling had four daughters, and he wanted them to grow up with equal rights to men.

The resolution was passed, but it wasn’t acted upon. Nothing happened.

In 1894, another South Australian politician with a considerably less impressive moustache, John Hannah Gordon, presented to the Assembly a piece of legislation to make it happen, the Constitutional Amendment (Adult Suffrage) Bill.

Gordon believed in equality, and he was convinced that the dire prognostications of enemies of women’s suffrage would not come to pass.

In the course of the ensuing debate, many amendments got proposed and added to the bill, in attempts to both improve it and block it.

It was at this point that the protagonist of our answer made his move.

Ebenezer Ward.

Politician, journalist, keen amateur actor and social conservative.

Also, a dedicated enemy of women’s suffrage.

Ward was determined to stop the Bill. And he was sure he knew how to do it.

The Bill as it had been introduced contained a Clause 4, which explicitly barred women from becoming members of parliament. It should be pointed out that, at the time, nowhere in the world were women allowed to be elected to parliaments. (In this respect, the Bill was upholding part of the old Constitution Act.)

Even the male supporters in parliament of women’s suffrage thought that the idea of women in parliament was going too far, at least at this stage.

Ward agreed: Well, of course! Women as members of parliament! How grotesque!

Then he thought:

Wait…

If I get rid of that clause…so that women can run for parliament…

Then nobody will take the Bill seriously! It will fail!

So he began to lobby for Clause 4 to be removed.

And he was successful. Clause 4 was removed from the bill, which then went on to final debate. Ward was confident that the bill no longer had any chance of being passed.

The amended bill was introduced for the third time in December 1894, and because it meant amending the constitution, a two-third majority was needed to pass it.

The debate went on into the night, and then they voted.

They passed it, 31 votes to 14. The women bystanders cheered.

As you would.

What Ebenezer Ward had done was not merely give women in South Australia the vote.

He had made it possible for women to be elected to parliament, for the first time in history, anywhere in the world.

This wasn’t just a political own goal.

It was a political awarding the championship to the other side, in perpetuity, and resigning from the game.

Which is why, although I fully support the outcome, I have to call his decision to get Clause 4 removed from the Bill one of the greatest political blunders in history.

Dima Vorobiev,Updated 2y,Where is the line between bias and propaganda?,"There’s no line between bias and propaganda.

Propaganda is a subset of bias. This is how it works.

Bias

All human communication is bias. When you spend time with your kid, you choose if you talk to her about refraction of light in the rainbow, or the Al-Kawthar chapter of the Qur’an, or the baby rabbit you saw in the park yesterday. You decide what’s important for her to talk about. That’s bias.

You always direct your attention to this, and not to that, and not to a zillion other things. This constant focus on what’s most important is our mode of operation. The ability to focus, to scope is a precondition for survival. Only God can perceive and absorb everything at the same time—although those who pray to the Lord sometimes sit with the impression that even He can’t take it all at once.

This is your bias, and you never get away from it. Neither do I. No one does. Our value to the heavens is the unique bias each of us possesses.

Propaganda

Propaganda is the bias you apply to your communication with people. Everyone does it to steer others’ thoughts and behavior according to their plan. Education and entertainment is often an exception, because they don’t impact people in predictable ways. (This is why religious fundamentalists don’t like education and entertainment.)

For more about this, check out my answer Is every piece of information technically propaganda?

For illustration, look at the photo below. Its meaning can be completely decided by your bias. You can share it, turning around the message completely with a single sentence. The graffiti on the wall says, “Aleppo is ours, hurray!”

“A Russian mercenary claims Aleppo is theirs”
“A European kafir
 defaces the wall of a mosque in Aleppo with letters of the Crusaders and blasphemous symbols”
“A friend of Syria from Russia celebrates the liberation of Aleppo from terrorists”.
“A Russian Instagrammer was fined for taking a selfie beside a graffiti he sprayed on the wall of the Central Armed Forces Museum

Srinath Nalluri,Updated 3y,What are your opinions on Indian Politics?,"The strange thing about Indian politics is,

There is a trade-off between honesty and effectiveness.

In this Telugu film ‘Leader’, post the funeral of a CM, the son discovers that his father had amassed around 20,000 crores through corruption. He wonders how his father had become so corrupt.

His mother tells him how he had started ambitiously with lot of plans to eliminate corruption and caste hierarchy but then got sucked into the circumstances and started indulging in corrupt practices himself.

The son promises her to become the next CM and accomplish what his father wanted to achieve.

And the very first thing he does is—Buying the MLAs with the corrupted money and promising 1000 crores and portfolios to the alliance leader so that they support him for the CM post over his wicked cousin.

Thus, he becomes the CM. And he takes some drastic steps like forming Anti Corruption Group and Confiscation of Illegal Assets Plan to get back the illegal money. This doesn’t please the MLAs. So they start to revolt against him.

In order to save his chair,

He traps the Alliance party Leader’s daughter and makes her fall in love with him, so that he will get their support.
He frees one MLAs son and his friends of all charges as they were accused of raping and murdering a young girl.

Towards the end, he feels guilty and opens up about it to his mom.

‘I didn’t have a choice, ma.’

‘Even your father also used to say the same.’

He nods in disapproval, trying to defend helplessly. ‘No Ma, it was not like that...’

‘It is. Today, you cancelled a rape case. Tomorrow, murder case. After that, factory license and land grabbing. You will never really have a choice.’

That’s when he gets the answer for the question he had in the beginning ‘How did father become so corrupt?’

The sad thing about Indian politics is that

There is a trade-off between honesty and effectiveness.

The atmosphere is such that you need to let go of your honesty to be more effective and accomplish bigger things.

One cannot survive for long with complete honesty and altruism.

Simply because, some people and politicians around him might not accept it and they have the power to pull him down instantly at the slightest discomfort.

Hence, to survive with the support of majority, one has to please everyone, by playing caste-card, religion-card, approving illegal plans, turning blind eye to corruption etc. In the above example, the CM would have been easily honest, had the MLAs refused to take money to elect him as the party president and oust him out of power when he had passed the anti-corruption plans.

There is a difference between keeping head on the floor, legs on the sofa, watching political debates and thinking ‘Why can’t they be honest?’ to actually being inside a assembly surrounded by opportunists, opposition, corrupt people, fanatics and being honest.

If someone says he doesn’t support a politician only because he is not honest, I only feel that that person has a pathetic and ignorant view of how political machinery works in India. As long as there are people who look for caste, religion, Note for Vote, politicians will of course play to their galleries.

Shayn M.,2y,"Is it possible to be fascist and pro-Jewish, or is anti-Semitism a necessary condition of fascism?","Fascism has tended to be antisemitic to some degree historically but the original Italian fascism was not particularly antisemitic and even had several Jewish members and supporters.

Fascism is an ultranationalist and chauvinistic ideology but it is not always a priori racist. The early Italian fascists did not care if someone was born Jewish as long as they regarded themselves only as Italian and threw their Jewishness aside. Fascism was open to anyone willing to fully and completely embrace its totalitarian, ultranationalist view of the world.

Jews were generally seen as too “cosmopolitan” and international in orientation to be trusted by most fascists but many fascists were willing to accept Jews who abjured their own Jewishness. It was not seen as an issue of race.

The Nazis were very different from the Italian fascists, and even Austro fascists, in this regard. The Nazis had a deeply racialised ideology and saw Jews as an existential threat to the “Aryan” race. It did not matter what a Jew did or believed, they were seen as racially incompatible with the Nazi society.

There is nothing that intrinsically requires a fascist movement to be antisemitic. Most fascists do tend to be this way because it has become part of the DNA of the extreme right in many places, but it is not a requirement and it is entirely possible to imagine a fascist movement that was indifferent, or maybe even sympathetic, to Jews.

Naveen Subramanian,Updated 2y,"If education is not a criteria into politics, why doesn't it attract people? What are the drawbacks of entering into politics?","One of my friends is highly educated, was fed up with current politics, and desperately wished for a change. When the MNM party was launched by Kamal Hassan, he joined the party. When educated people - ex IAS, educationalists, and entrepreneurs joined MNM , he was thrilled and strongly believed MNM is a highly classified party that will work for the welfare of people.

He attended every party meeting without fail at his own expense. He already has huge respect among us due to his natural innocence and immense educational qualification, so we never discouraged him (nor encouraged him)

At the bottom of our hearts, we knew MNM is not what he thinks it is. But.. it was his choice and we respected his choice. Due to natural popularity (which he has gained out of his goodwill gesture and hard work) we didn’t discourage him but were cautiously following his move, as we really care for him and his wellbeing (of course that’s what friends are for)

During an election, the party asked if he’s willing to do election work - campaigns, groundwork, etc and he happily agreed. He spent full time - early morning till late evening campaigning for MNM candidate. The candidate was already popular for negative reasons, but still, he campaigned.

As expected, the candidate lost in the election. Within few days, the candidate announced: “quitting from the party” - like many other MNM candidates. Now that candidate has joined the ruling party.

Now my friend is in a dilemma on whether to quit politics altogether as he doesn’t know what to do next. Election winning and losing is a part of the political journey, but betrayal within the party hurts the people who actively did campaign on the ground that the party and its candidate will stand for morals. That got burst.
His family n relatives criticize his party in front of him. That’s normal, but they ask why did you work so hard for such a candidate who dumped the party within a month and joined the party they opposed all these days. He couldn’t answer such questions.
His social media followers tag him on trolls related to MNM. He has disabled his social media account recently.

He’s educated, well qualified, well settled, talented, hard-working, and genuinely cared for the welfare of people. The party didn’t give him a ticket to contest as he’s not a popular personality. Despite the disappointment, he genuinely worked on the ground during the election campaign for his party candidate. He stood with his party candidate even on poll result announcing booth till late at night. But …. now neither that candidate nor his party consulted him after the election.

Answering the question: If education is not a criteria into politics, why doesn't it attract people? What are the drawbacks of entering into politics?

Educated people expect ethics and morals which isn’t in politics. Even though the educated are aware of it, when they become victims of betrayal, it hurts them the most. They get trolled by family and relatives, they get trolled on social media. Ultimately they fall into depression.

Politics is mainly for people who are “ looking to benefit at any cost” - unfortunately, the middle class who’s well educated and professionally settled lives in an image trap which they can’t afford to lose by venturing into politics.

If an entrepreneur fails or if a sportsperson fails, they have to work hard to get success. But in politics, someone else can be a reason for your failure despite your sincere efforts.

In simple words - have you heard of any politician committing suicide out of shame for being immoral ?? - No … That’s the qualification for being a successful politician. Unfortunately, the middle class can’t afford such a lifestyle. We’re image-conscious, what our circle speaks about us is important to us. We live in an image trap, which we can’t afford to lose.

This is the difference between engaging in political debates in social media, versus actually venturing into ground politics. The disappointments, distrust, betrayals, disbelief, and humiliation you face on the ground will reflect directly in your image - which you spent years building it.

My answer is just a reflection of what happened to my friend recently. However, others may have differences of opinion which I can understand.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xpun6f1rd2a7i5vg', 'title': ""If education is not a criteria into politics, why doesn't it attract people?

Jean-Marie Valheur,Jan 17,Who is the world's worst politician?,"Without a doubt it was former British Prime Minister Liz Truss. She was just in office for two days when Queen Elizabeth died. Memes say the old monarch passed away of second hand embarrassment. Truss’ large scale tax cuts and borrowing pretty much led the nation into a state of despair.

On foreign policy, she presented herself as a tough, no-nonsense woman — she vowed to be particularly strong on China. Meanwhile in recently leaked documents and private correspondence, it has just been revealed that behind closed doors, Truss was actively lobbying for the sale of arms to Beijing.[1] Worst yet, the company that Truss helped sell anti-mining devices vital for the invasion of Taiwan came from her own Norfolk constituency. Corrupt much?

Liz Truss was in office for only 45 days, not even two months. And yet there is still news coming out two years later about how much of a complete embarrassment she was.

Mago Kim,1y,Will we ever have world peace?,"Wars have always existed in human history.

In the time when I was born and growing up, there were only ideological conflicts, no major wars. However, studying history and watching civil wars and conflicts in other countries, I realized that the world is always under the threat of war. Therefore, I have always dreamed of a peaceful world . I have always thought that hating people who start wars and protesting against war is not enough to make the world peaceful.

The underlying issue seemed to be a mystery to me. But one day, my meditation teacher said,

“ Everything becomes one when people’s mind become the true mind. The world will become united as one. Religions, philosophies, ideologies, and academics will all become one. Countries will also unite as one. There will be no more conflicts or wars. Instead, there will be only peace. “

His words meant a lot to me. So I meditated hard to understand this and accomplish it. So what meditation taught me was that the human mind itself is a self-centered mind, so it is constantly living in war. We don't even understand the mind of the ones we love. It is due to the narrow perception of our mind. There is war within a seemingly peaceful country, and there is war at the workplace, in family members, and in our mind, good and evil are always battling. The human mind and war are like soulmates that cannot be separated.

As long as humans do not break free from their selfish mind, war will continue to exist forever. While there is 'I', there is 'You' and if there is 'my country', then there is always 'your country'. Therefore, we will always live in war so long as we continue to believe that ""I am right and you are wrong”. However, if ‘I’ abandon ‘myself’, the war within me will disappear, and there will be no longer conflict in my life. Since my self-centered mind causes conflicts, whatever I see and experience through that lens will inevitably be filled with pain.

As a result, when I meditated in a way that allowed me to let go of my egocentric mind, the constant battles in my mind disappeared. I could feel the enemies within me disappear, and the hatred also disappear. So I realized that the world can be changed only by gaining peace from me. Everything that happens in the world is a result of the actions of the individual people that live there. Therefore, all problems must be solved at the individual level. The reason there is no peace in the world is because there is no peace in the mind of the people in the world. In our mind, there is only hatred for each other. There are people on this planet who are planting the seeds of hatred by making wars even now. The seed will grow and cause another war later.

Rather than blaming others, we should look back into our mind and get rid of the hatred and conflict that lurk there. Ultimately, I believe that the world will be changed when one awakened person becomes two, and then two becomes four, and so on. To find peace in the world, we must all wake up. You have to let go a lot of selfishness and your ego in your mind and work hard until you are one with others.

Gabriel Guzman,5y,"When it comes to politics, is demographics destiny?","Is this us?

If you were a white evangelical voter in 2016, there is a 77% chance you voted for Donald Trump.

If you were a black voter in 2016, there is a 91% chance you voted for Hillary Clinton.

These groups are the most reliable members of their party coalitions. There is an assurance with which we describe their voting habits, a confidence that, regardless of the situation, their presence amongst an electorate guarantees a certain number of votes.

What incentive does that give us to treat them as individuals?

The 2016 Presidential election was defined by the interplay between our political and demographic compositions. Changes in the sex, age, race, religion, and education of the electorate, coupled with decades of partisan animosity, brought numerous demographic divisions to the forefront of public discourse.

It’s tempting to write something like “Since then, these divisions have become affixed in the American conscience”. It’s tempting to give this a timestamp, an interval after which political considerations cease to be demographic ones.

But I won’t, because it would be a lie, and any half-decent political scientist knows that. The water didn’t start boiling, a simmering pot spilled.

“It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause. He is just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years. A fear and anger that’s rooted in our past but is also born out of the enormous upheavals that have taken place in your brief lifetimes.”

Barack Obama

This isn’t to say that demographic comparisons are necessarily divisive. There is huge complexity within any demographic subgroup, and exploring these nuances can yield powerful insights.

However, the pursuit of political power in America ultimately comes down to a binary. When push comes to shove, the commonalities suggested above will always fall short to the reality on the ground.

I spent a good part of the past month researching small towns in the United States, and when reading Robert Wuthnow’s “Small Town America”, there was a particular line that stuck with me.

“In many towns, immigration and new ethnic diversity are the principal changes on residents’ minds. In many others declining population, diminishing services, and lower standards of living are the major concerns. Understanding what leads people to say that their communities are dying or were better in the past than now, or deny that these changes are taking place, requires going beyond population statistics.”

Robert Wuthnow

In pursuit of victory, we will continue to leverage the abstraction that is demographic study. This has been essential to every political campaign thus far and will be essential to every political campaign henceforth for the foreseeable future. But make no mistake, any attempt to model the people can never do full justice to the person.

I hope, at the very least, that we can remember that.

Habib F,Updated 5y,Where do your viewpoints fall on the left-right political spectrum/compass?,"Interesting question. I will say that I am at the conservative end of the solid liberal spectrum.

In the US, both on economic and social issues, I am decidedly left of center. Ideologically, I’m very close of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

But the policies I end up supporting are often to the right of the policies I wish I could support. This tends to be for a couple of reasons:

If I don’t feel that a politician has done their homework, I won’t be able to support a policy they propose, even if I agree with the goals of their proposal. If you’re going to give me a universal healthcare plan, it’d better add up mathematically. You’d better be able to give me a firm and clear answer about how you’ll pay for it. If when you’re questioned on the subject you answer in vague platitudes that make it clear that you’re giving me ideology and not math, you’ll lose my support.
If I don’t think your plan has a realistic plan of passing, I won’t support it, because it will be a massive waste of time. So, if you’re a Democrat who is running on free college, you’ll more than likely make me yawn. Why? Republicans will oppose it unanimously. In the absence of a realistic scenario in which Democrats can capture 60 votes in the Senate AND a majority in the House, all grandiose schemes for major legislative initiatives are going to fail (except if they’re related to the budget and you can use the Reconciliation process to get them passed with a simple majority). There are a lot of veto points in the US system. Filibustering has become a norm in a way it wasn’t when LBJ was president. It was still possible for him to get Medicare passed with a simple majority in the Senate. Even as recently as Bush II, you had a situation where many Democrats supported and helped pass his tax cuts. That world is gone, and it’s not coming back. Trump can only pass legislation right now because the Democrats don’t control either chamber. By the same token, Obama was only able to get things passed during his first 2 years in office, when his party controlled Congress. This is the new reality. If when you’re asked how you’re going to overcome entrenched opposition, you reply with the rhetorical equivalent of voodoo, I’m going to have a hard time getting behind your plans.

So, in practice, I tend to come across as more conservative than I actually am. I would love to get all the undocumented immigrants documented. To do this, I’d support a deal whereby they became legalized without the possibility of future citizenship. I think it’s a fair deal. I think the immigrants themselves would take it.

John Potter,Updated 5y,Was there a time in US history when politics were as uncivil as they are now?,"On May 20, 1856, Senator Charles Sumner, a Republican from Massachusetts, had just finished a marathon address railing against the depredations of pro-slavery Border Ruffians in the Territory of Kansas. Sumner, the most outspoken anti-slavery voice in the Senate, had among his arguments against pro-slavery forces in Kansas, thrown a number of insults at fellow Senators hailing from slave states. Among the insults hurled during his address was a specific barb at Senator Andrew Butler of South Carolina, insinuating that Butler sought to preserve the institution of slavery so he could maintain pliant sexual outlets among his female slaves.

Two days later, May 22, 1856, Butler's cousin and Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina, grabbed his gutta-percha cane with a gold head and entered the Senate Chamber, flanked by two allies, Representatives Laurence M. Keitt and Henry A. Edmundson (also of South Carolina). The three men waited for the galleries to clear out, ensuring that all the ladies were out of the chamber before making their move.

Brooks approached Senator Sumner, who was at that moment seated close behind a his heavy wooden desk attending to some papers or such, not looking up. Brooks, in a low voice, addressed Sumner with the words: ""Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine.""

Sumner made as if to stand and address Brooks. It should be noted here that Sumner was a tall man, and well built. He stood substantially taller than the diminutive Brooks. Before Sumner could reach his feet, Brooks raised the gold-tipped cane and brought it swiftly down on Sumner's head. Thereafter he continued to rain blows down upon Sumner as the latter fell, and became trapped between the desk and the chair he had so recently been seated in. Initially his hands raised in his own defense, but as the blows continued he became more and more senseless from them, and still Brooks continued striking him.

Several witnesses stepped forward to Sumner's aide, but Representative Keitt brandished a pistol at anyone who drew too near, snarling at the bystanders to ""Let them alone, God damn you, let them alone!""

Brooks continued raining blows on Sumner even after the man had freed himself from his desk and chair, and attempted to flee from him. Blinded by his own blood and knocked senseless by the thrashing, Sumner toppled in one of the aisles in the chamber, where Brooks continued hitting him.

Dima Vorobiev,4y,Which book(s) would you recommend to get a full understanding of fascism?,"My three top suggestions for intuitive insight into the Fascist worldview.

The Fourth Turning, by William Strauss and Neil Howe
. This one, albeit written in the 1990s, gives you a fine primer on the rationale of why progress looks like a stupid and dangerous illusion to more and more people in the 21st century. According to the authors, politics are as circular and repetitive as the year cycles, the turning wheel, and the arc of human life in reproducing the same patterns generation after generation. Only our habitual thinking and the brevity of our lives prevents most from this insight, fooling too many to believe that arrow, not wheel, is the way of the world.
Revolt Against the Modern World
, by Julius Evola, A more poetic approach to Fascism. It’s about us as the Children of the Sun re-connecting with our truest inner self and how this forms the beating heart of Fascist worldview. The book will make you question the established European view on Fascism as a “conservative” ideology. You see how the the radical edge of Nietzsche’s ”Eternal recurrence
” bridges over to the communitarian idea of radical justice—right in the Socialist territory,
The Singing Heart: A Book of Quiet Reflections, by Ivan Ilyin
. This is a collection of thoughts and essays written by President Putin’s favorite philosopher. Seeking refuge from the Bolshevik terror in his European emigration, the man envisioned a hard-right alternative to Communism and Liberalism that he considered two most formidable foes of humanity. The book provides a inspired picture of Fascist ethics, embraced today by a considerable part of Russian society and friends of Russia across the world.

Below, art by Russian “Christian Socialist” Gennadiy Zhivotov, “The Fifths Empire’s Symphony”. The idea is that our Czars created the Third Rome, Stalin resurrected it as the Fourth Empire, and according to our radical nationalists, President Putin—willingly or not—has laid the foundation of the Fifth Empire. Based on the pillars of Orthodox justice, the 5th Empire will show the world a way out of the hellhole of liberal democracy, soulless profit-seeking and dead-eyed consumerism.

The ark of the Fifth Empire is built around something that looks like a hybrid of a torpedo and submarine.

Anthony Zarrella,4y,Why is the United States so reluctant or unwilling to modernize the Constitution?,"Because we like it this way.

Or at least, because there is no supermajority who can agree on any particular change. If a dial goes from 0–10 and is currently set at 5, it’s meaningless to say, “80% of people think the dial should be changed” if half of them think it needs to be higher and the other half think it should be lower.

And that’s precisely how it was designed—to resist change unless there is broad consensus as to what that change should be, so that the minority cannot be trampled by an evanescent majority.

It was never meant to be “modern”. It was meant to be stable. It was expressly designed to resist being changed according to the changing times—because the pendulum keeps swinging.

Imagine the Constitution we’d have if we’d “modernized” it in the 70’s.

Compare to if we’d “modernized” it in the early 2000’s.

Compare to if we “modernized” it today.

The very fact that you are (or ought to be) imagining three almost entirely different Constitutions is reason enough not to do it.

William Weir,3y,Can someone do their best to give me unbiased examples of the good & bad Joe Biden has done during his 47 years as a politician? And reasons to vote/not vote for him?,"A 47 year career would require a book to delve into in detail, but here are the highlights, mostly in chronological order.

When Congress refused ratify the SALT II Treaty as signed in 1979 by President Carter and Brezhnev, Biden took the initiative to meet with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and secured changes to address the Foreign Relations Committee's objections.

In 1984, he served as Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, and is is credited with modifying some of the law's worst provisions.

Biden spent years fighting for the U.S. to intervene in the Bosnian War, and eventually secured a successful NATO peacekeeping effort. Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his ""proudest moment in public life"" related to foreign policy.

In 1994, Biden sponsored the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which added 100,000 police officers, increased sentences for certain crimes, and included the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and the Violence Against Women Act. There were some unexpected downsides on this one as it resulted in a high number of incarcerations for nonviolent offenses, especially among minorities. This is something he worked to address with Obama (by commuting a number of sentences), and hopes to address more comprehensively as President.

Biden sponsored legislation that was eventually passed in 1995 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, one of many bills where he broke ranks with Democrats and voted with Republicans to pass. His contributions to the bill including strengthening the homestead exemption and fighting for an amendment to prevent felons from using bankruptcy to avoid paying their fines.

In 2002, Biden helped Boys and Girls Clubs to provide internet access and computer training to low-income and at-risk youth through his “Kids 2000” bill.

In 2002, Biden sponsored the Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act, which would eventually be passed as the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act as part of the PROTECT Act.

In 2004, Biden met with Muammar Gaddafi and secured the release political prisoner Fathi Eljahmi, who was imprisoned for advocating democracy for Libya.

In 2004 and 2005, Biden recruited private businesses to help diagnose problems with the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and secured the donation of equipment to improve its services.

In 2009, Vice President Biden oversaw infrastructure spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This was the catalyst for the economic recovery that resulted in the longest bull market in American history, cut unemployment by more than half, and more than tripled the Dow.

In 2010, Biden helped secure passage of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (“New START”) between the U.S. and Russia.

Biden negotiated with Republicans in congress to pass the 2010 Tax Relief Act, led negotiations between Congress and the White House to avoid a government shutdown in 2011, paving the way for the Budget Control Act of 2011, and negotiated with Mitch McConnell on a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

He also helped formulate Obama’s policies on Iraq and Afghanistan, prevented the confirmation of Bork, helped expand NATO, called for an end to genocide in Darfur, wrote the laws that created the U.S. Drug Czar, fighting steroid abuse, co-chaired the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, headed the Gun Violence Task Force, and so much more, not to mention numerous honors and recognitions including being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction.

The chief reason to vote for him is that he is experienced, qualified, and capable; while Trump is exactly none of those things.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3lx0r5e2b48op9af', 'title': 'Can someone do their best to give me unbiased examples of the good & bad Joe Biden has done during his 47 years as a politician?

Alex Yang,5y,Do you think people have taken political correctness too far?,"“Oh my god, look at what Melania tweeted!”

My friend said this, and instantly got my attention.

I don’t really have a strong opinion on Melania, but the way my friend was speaking made me believe Melania did something despicable.

So I peer over at her phone and find this…

“Uhh……..are you attracted to Christmas trees, I’m not judging bu-“

”NO! She tweeted Christmas Season! Not everyone celebrates Christmas! She needs to represent all Americans! Not just the white, Christian ones!”

…

I then slammed my head into the table until my everything went black. (Okay maybe not)

In all seriousness, political correctness has not just gone too far, it has become fucking insane!

I don’t like Trump, but I wouldn’t attack his wife for saying a common phrase!

She was hanging a Christmas Tree for the Christmas Season! Should she have hung a Non-Affiliated Winter Celebration Tree?

Complete with a blue, non-affiliated glass sphere!

What is even more ridiculous is that Melania has tweeted about other holidays such as Hanukkah this year.

Why my friend decided to cherrypick one tweet is unclear.

Look, I don’t dislike my friend (no shit) but what she said was completely emblematic of the issues with political correctness.

When a person can be attacked simply for saying a very common phrase, we have descended into madness.

What’s next? People being banned from saying Bless You?

May an ambiguous, possibly existent deity prevent you from sneezing again, you.

Jill Grant,4y,"Was Trump's proposed investigation of the Bidens a witch hunt, as he defines that term?","What was it he was proposing they investigate?

Before you initiate an investigation you have to have some idea of what someone has done wrong, and Trump has none. Because there was none. Neither Biden nor Burisma were under investigation for anything until Trump wanted to throw some cloud over the Biden name.

It was most certainly a witch hunt, witches in Salem weren’t casting spells and there was no evidence that anyone broke any laws. There isn’t any evidence that Biden broke any laws either.

Murphy Barrett,10mo,Is imposing democracy on authoritarian countries ethnocentric?,"No, it’s just stupid because it doesn’t work.

You cannot impose democracy. Democracy must rise from within via an educated and interested electorate. Just telling people to vote, who are not psychologically suited to the conditions of liberty and democracy, doesn’t work. They just vote for whomever the strongman tells them to, giving a veneer of legitimacy to his rule.

You can, from without, help a people build a democracy in their own county. But you can’t force it down people’s necks.

Really the only way to maybe “impose” democracy on a country would be via full military occupation, kill all the old men and women, and destroy the native culture. Raise the children to value democracy for at least three generations, and then it might stick after you go home. But that’s a bloody great investment for little to no gain for yourself, and a lot of bloodshed besides, so it’s really rather a bad plan all things considered.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r4jhiaks8ngm6wl2', 'title': 'Is imposing democracy on authoritarian countries ethnocentric?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'No, it’s just stupid because it doesn’t work.\n\nYou cannot impose democracy.

Henry R. Greenfield,Dec 22,Is Trump's cognitive decline worse than Biden’s?,"Who gets the walker first?

There are 2 parts to this answer, first Biden.

Biden has a stutter, he has made gaffes his entire career when speaking. His content however is excellent and he is focused. My view as I am 73 and have seen a lot of people go through declines as they age, he is about as good as it gets for his age and the pressure on him.
Biden is working from experience, he is sharp on other subjects but like all older people when something occurs to him in mid sentence he latches on to it. Also like older people, his short term memory is fading, this is typical and I have noticed it in myself. That means staying on message is important.
That said, when he is asked a question from reporters he always gets it and answers quickly. No processing other than hearing it which is not cognitive decline that is hearing loss especially in noisy settings and he answers unlike other Presidents. He doesn’t just get in the car and he likes to engage
Rating - 10–15% cognitive loss and it will increase in his 80’s, he will have to be cocooned if he is to make it with strong decisions if he wins a 2nd term. It is not ideal but it certainly can be done. I expect if he wins you will not see as much from him and it will be all surrogates including Kamala Harris all the time.

Now Trump.

Trump has a short agenda, he prepares now and hits his points exactly as he wants. His speeches are long winded and you never know what he is going to say. I know I have been to his rallies. His energy level is way down as he is under enormous pressure.
He keeps going by being fed info and watching tv and eating his famous junk food. He doesn’t drink so that is a big plus for him as he is always at his best and never slurs his words.
He is not in charge of anything so he doesn’t have to make any decisions like Biden so he is not getting worn down. He didn’t much in his 1st term as he doesn’t read so he is not bothered by facts. He asks for and gets ‘facts’ or changes them to match his speeches.
His wife is no longer around so that is a good thing for him as he doesn’t have to pander to her any more. He is on his own with the boys and they are now mostly boys no longer the young women like his 1st term.
Rating - Loss of 20% - from his peak he has actually lost more than Biden as his life is way more complex and his businesses have not done well under his sons. Ivanka is not there to coach him now so he is left to anecdotal and prepared speeches. His closest advisors are now lawyers as he trust no one else.
If he wins it will be a short list of people around him, he won’t let others in. He will rule by fiat and not by legislation. All of his legislation will be about retribution and closing the border and getting America out of everything. Expect an angry man blaming everyone as he slowly fades. As he doesn’t do detail, his age won’t bother him as much, he will play a lot of golf at his golf courses.

Palkesh Asawa,5y,"What is the best way to enter politics, so that an individual can truly clean the system?","It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.

This quote from Harry Potter speaks the truth in an eloquent manner. Power is a curious thing indeed. Those who actively seek power are not suited for it. It is not power itself, but chasing power, that seems to corrupt the minds and hearts of humans.

Let’s say that a person believes that he has the good intentions of everyone at heart, and that, if he enters into politics, he will genuinely work hard with the intention of serving the people and cleaning the system. But, when he enters politics, he sees that -

Those who he feels don’t deserve to win, are actually winning the elections and lots of people are supporting such people.
He sees that many politicians are adapting unfair means to win in elections, and they are getting away with it. As he sees this more often, his firm belief in honesty diminishes.
Further, he sees that a lot of voters themselves are not interested in ‘honest’ politicians. Voters are happy to be paid money to vote for any particular person. People don’t care about who their elected representative is, as long as they get what they want.
In fact, this person will soon realise that what voters want is also not the same. Managing this conflict of interests will soon take a toll upon this person who aims to achieve the ‘best for all’

When I was a small kid, I too had such dreams. I am sure that lots of people go through this phase in life, when they feel that they are indeed honest, and if given the opportunity, they shall indeed serve with the best interest of the nation, and will not be corrupt.

Time has made me wiser.

If you are still labouring under the delusion that you are not as bad as those scum politicians, let me show you some possible dilemmas that you might confront, if you join politics, and let you think about it.

Suppose you enter politics, and there is this huge problem of poverty in a village. All those villagers are ready to vote for you, if you promise that you will open a free hospital for them, once you are elected as their representative.
But, you are short of government funds. So, how do you build this hospital? You approach the private corporate houses. One such corporate is ready to build the hospital in that village, provided you clear their project of starting a factory in another location.
The people of that other location are objecting to this factory, of course. They shall not vote for you if you clear the tender for this corporate company. So, what do you do?
Meanwhile, some other political party has openly announced that they will build a hospital, and they shall also not allow the corporate company to start a factory in the other village. They have done so using illegal black money accumulated by them over time.

You want to tell the people that this other political party is corrupt, and is funding their hospital using black money. But, who cares? Do the villagers care how the funds are accumulating? They care about a hospital, and you are not able to provide them this hospital. So they won’t vote for you. Your honesty be damned. You’re useless if you can’t get the job done!

But then you object! You say that once you are elected, you will regulate the black money, and will force the corrupt corporate houses to pay their due taxes, and then you will have the government funds to build a hospital. Do you really think those villagers will listen to this argument? Nobody cares about a promise that will be executed so late!

In order to clean the system, you need to be elected first. But you will need to go through a lot of dirty shit in order to be elected in the first place. By the time you get elected, you are full of scams.

There is another truth we need to realise about politics

What you think is ‘right’ or ‘honest’ or ‘in the best interests’ of the people may not be the same as what they want. And, most people are not smart enough to differentiate what they need with what they want.

For example, you may believe that smoking is an addiction. So you announce that, once elected, you shall work towards banning cigarettes. How do you propose to sell this idea to millions of people who enjoy smoking? Regardless of your other policy announcements, they shall turn against you for this single statement alone.

Or, what if you believe that secularism is ideal. But a lot of the people are not interested in all that idealistic talk. They want to vote for people who will construct the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, secularism be damned. Will you tell them that you will support them, or will you stick to your ideals and risk losing the elections?

But that's just one half of the problem.

The other problem is that you will not even get full power in the first place, since you will be dependent on many people for this power, which means that there is no such thing as “absolute control”.

Let’s assume you have the best interests of the people of Maharashtra in your hearts. However, those people don't know you. They trust some other person, and if you are able to convince this other person to join hands with you, they can vote for you. But, if you do this, then the actual power is with him. He can always threaten to leave your political party and join others if you don't agree to his demands. How powerful are you?

You are helpless.

Most often, those who are in positions of power reach that position with the support of other people. In truth, they have no power over these people on whose shoulders they are standing.

And, in politics, there is a lot of quid pro quo. Regardless of what you want, you will have to depend on other people in order to win votes. And, the more you depend on others, the less power you have. In truth, therefore, all your intentions of “being good” go down the drain.

You may have all the best intentions in heart. But you cannot guarantee the same of all those people who are under you. Even if you handpick them all, you cannot guarantee that they shall remain so in the future also, when they are influenced by a lot of other conflicting viewpoints. If you threaten to micro-manage them, they shall leave. How much control can you really have over your sub-ordinates? How good can you be?

Lots of people who reach the pinnacle in power actually start off with good intentions. As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Everybody thinks that they are better than others. It’s an eternal truth in life, but only few people truly realise how susceptible they are.

All this deliberation leaves us with two pointed questions:

Does that mean the elected politicians are all corrupt? Can we seriously not expect good, honest politicians to come forward and take up the charge to clean the system?
In any case, how does one acquire true power then? If politicians do not hold the power enough to clean the system, where does that power lie and how do we attain it?

I am going to talk about these two important questions now.

#1] Does that mean we can’t expect good politicians?

This is probably the grim conclusion most people might reach based on my observations. Sadly, I agree with this. Everyone who aims to achieve power through politics will need to go through this grilling ritual which almost always leaves them corrupt or powerless.

However, this does not mean that we cannot expect politicians to be honest or genuinely good people. Saying that would be unfair to hundreds of good men that have taken up the mantle of doing whatever they could to improve the current situations.

All I am saying is: that we must understand that in this system of politics, those elected to power will always have to make compromises in order to retain power.

Having said that, I also believe that this kind of politics is also needed in it’s own way. Because we need someone to manage all the conflicting interests. If, once in a while, we get a leader who is loved by the masses, it becomes easier for him to capitalise that and bring about some real change.

I further believe that, if you want to bring real change, politics is not the right way to go about it. And this is the crux of my debate over here.

This question started with a fundamental need of bringing a change. We have this burning question in our hearts: how do I clean the system? How do I improve these inefficiencies? How do I bring peace?

It seems only natural to believe that one should enter politics and then seek to be an elected representative to bring about such changes. But I have observed that entering into politics does not seem to achieve that purpose. If you are a part of the system yourself, you cannot hope to change it. Because you will be changing the entire machinery which has given you the power to do it in the first place.

It would be like this -

Source

Those who seek to change the system, while being a part of the system themselves, are really cutting the same branch of the tree on which they’re sitting. Only fools think that this is possible. Which is why, by the time they reach the top, they lose the will to effect changes.

And this brings us to the bigger question here.

#2] If this is true, then how do we bring about change?

Like I mentioned previously, I believe that the only way to bring about change in a system is to actively stay out of it. And this is a little tricky. In fact, it also has a little snag of being difficult.

Here is the original question asked by OP: “What is the best way to enter politics, so that an individual can really change the system?” In his innocence, the question is asking too much. And, in my experience, it is an either-or situation: you can EITHER change the system, OR enter into politics. Because doing both is next to impossible.

Most people who can bring about real change do not start off as politicians. If I were to advice on how to bring about a change in the system, we must stay independent of the system; and here is how we do it.

Pick a cause that you want to fight for. We must realise that life is about making choices. If you think that you can do ‘everything right’ if you are the Prime Minister, you are being delusional. Let’s not get into that. Let’s understand that an individual can only do so much. Hence, pick a single cause that you want to fight for.
And then, fight for that cause. It’s literally as simple as that. Do not get under the misconception that you can solve all the problems for all the people. But, you can try to solve some problems for some people. It wouldn’t be as great as you dream, but it would be better than nothing, which is where most politicians end up.

You see: those who seek power are actually over-estimating themselves. They believe that they can do everything, and hence they go to any extent to just get there. Like Dumbledore said, those best suited for power are the ones who never actively sought it.

Hence, chasing power is the root of all evil associated with power.

Think about this:

Power is the ability to influence. In reality, though, those who seek power are actually dependent on those whom they aim to influence in the first place. This is the biggest irony of life.

The ones who seek power end up being powerless, precisely because they are at the mercy of their followers. They hold on to their power, always seek support, are very protective of falling down, and generally tend to view all decisions from their delusional stand of power.

But, once you have decided that you don’t seek power - you have nothing to lose. Nobody can bargain with you. Nobody can threaten to withdraw support from you, or force you to accept things that you don’t want to accept. In short, you cannot be manipulated.

And THAT is how you actually become powerful.

And this is where the second part of Dumbledore’s words become relevant: the ones who are most suited for power are those who have leadership thrust upon them, and who take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.

Never chase power. Instead, just do what you want to do. Don’t make compromises. And be relentless in your pursuit of your cause. The more compromises you make, in the hope of becoming powerful, the more powerless you become.

If you are good enough, power will come to you. But, even if it doesn’t, don’t worry: because your cause matters more to you.

I am sure that lots of people go through this phase in life, when they feel that they are indeed honest, and if given the opportunity, they shall indeed serve with the best interest of the nation, and will not be corrupt.\n\nTime has made me wiser.\n\nIf you are still labouring under the delusion that you are not as bad as those scum politicians, let me show you some possible dilemmas that you might confront, if you join politics, and let you think about it.\n\nSuppose you enter politics, and there is this huge problem of poverty in a village. All those villagers are ready to vote for you, if you promise that you will open a free hospital for them, once you are elected as their representative.\nBut, you are short of government funds. So, how do you build this hospital? You approach the private corporate houses. One such corporate is ready to build the hospital in that village, provided you clear their project of starting a factory in another location.\nThe people of that other location are objecting to this factory, of course. They shall not vote for you if you clear the tender for this corporate company. So, what do you do?\nMeanwhile, some other political party has openly announced that they will build a hospital, and they shall also not allow the corporate company to start a factory in the other village. They have done so using illegal black money accumulated by them over time.\n\nYou want to tell the people that this other political party is corrupt, and is funding their hospital using black money. But, who cares? Do the villagers care how the funds are accumulating? They care about a hospital, and you are not able to provide them this hospital. So they won’t vote for you. Your honesty be damned. You’re useless if you can’t get the job done!\n\nBut then you object! You say that once you are elected, you will regulate the black money, and will force the corrupt corporate houses to pay their due taxes, and then you will have the government funds to build a hospital. Do you really think those villagers will listen to this argument? Nobody cares about a promise that will be executed so late!\n\nIn order to clean the system, you need to be elected first. But you will need to go through a lot of dirty shit in order to be elected in the first place. By the time you get elected, you are full of scams.\n\nThere is another truth we need to realise about politics\n\nWhat you think is ‘right’ or ‘honest’ or ‘in the best interests’ of the people may not be the same as what they want. And, most people are not smart enough to differentiate what they need with what they want.\n\nFor example, you may believe that smoking is an addiction. So you announce that, once elected, you shall work towards banning cigarettes. How do you propose to sell this idea to millions of people who enjoy smoking? Regardless of your other policy announcements, they shall turn against you for this single statement alone.\n\nOr, what if you believe that secularism is ideal. But a lot of the people are not interested in all that idealistic talk. They want to vote for people who will construct the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, secularism be damned. Will you tell them that you will support them, or will you stick to your ideals and risk losing the elections?\n\nBut that's just one half of the problem.\n\nThe other problem is that you will not even get full power in the first place, since you will be dependent on many people for this power, which means that there is no such thing as “absolute control”.\n\nLet’s assume you have the best interests of the people of Maharashtra in your hearts. However, those people don't know you. They trust some other person, and if you are able to convince this other person to join hands with you, they can vote for you. But, if you do this, then the actual power is with him. He can always threaten to leave your political party and join others if you don't agree to his demands. How powerful are you?\n\nYou are helpless.\n\nMost often, those who are in positions of power reach that position with the support of other people. In truth, they have no power over these people on whose shoulders they are standing.\n\nAnd, in politics, there is a lot of quid pro quo. Regardless of what you want, you will have to depend on other people in order to win votes. And, the more you depend on others, the less power you have. In truth, therefore, all your intentions of “being good” go down the drain.\n\nYou may have all the best intentions in heart. But you cannot guarantee the same of all those people who are under you. Even if you handpick them all, you cannot guarantee that they shall remain so in the future also, when they are influenced by a lot of other conflicting viewpoints. If you threaten to micro-manage them, they shall leave. How much control can you really have over your sub-ordinates? How good can you be?\n\nLots of people who reach the pinnacle in power actually start off with good intentions. As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Everybody thinks that they are better than others. It’s an eternal truth in life, but only few people truly realise how susceptible they are.\n\nAll this deliberation leaves us with two pointed questions:\n\nDoes that mean the elected politicians are all corrupt? Can we seriously not expect good, honest politicians to come forward and take up the charge to clean the system?\nIn any case, how does one acquire true power then? If politicians do not hold the power enough to clean the system, where does that power lie and how do we attain it?\n\nI am going to talk about these two important questions now.\n\n#1] Does that mean we can’t expect good politicians?\n\nThis is probably the grim conclusion most people might reach based on my observations. Sadly, I agree with this. Everyone who aims to achieve power through politics will need to go through this grilling ritual which almost always leaves them corrupt or powerless.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that we cannot expect politicians to be honest or genuinely good people. Saying that would be unfair to hundreds of good men that have taken up the mantle of doing whatever they could to improve the current situations.\n\nAll I am saying is: that we must understand that in this system of politics, those elected to power will always have to make compromises in order to retain power.\n\nHaving said that, I also believe that this kind of politics is also needed in it’s own way. Because we need someone to manage all the conflicting interests. If, once in a while, we get a leader who is loved by the masses, it becomes easier for him to capitalise that and bring about some real change.\n\nI further believe that, if you want to bring real change, politics is not the right way to go about it. And this is the crux of my debate over here.\n\nThis question started with a fundamental need of bringing a change. We have this burning question in our hearts: how do I clean the system? How do I improve these inefficiencies? How do I bring peace?\n\nIt seems only natural to believe that one should enter politics and then seek to be an elected representative to bring about such changes. But I have observed that entering into politics does not seem to achieve that purpose. If you are a part of the system yourself, you cannot hope to change it. Because you will be changing the entire machinery which has given you the power to do it in the first place.\n\nIt would be like this -\n\nSource\n\nThose who seek to change the system, while being a part of the system themselves, are really cutting the same branch of the tree on which they’re sitting. Only fools think that this is possible. Which is why, by the time they reach the top, they lose the will to effect changes.\n\nAnd this brings us to the bigger question here.\n\n#2] If this is true, then how do we bring about change?\n\nLike I mentioned previously, I believe that the only way to bring about change in a system is to actively stay out of it. And this is a little tricky. In fact, it also has a little snag of being difficult.\n\nHere is the original question asked by OP: “What is the best way to enter politics, so that an individual can really change the system?” In his innocence, the question is asking too much. And, in my experience, it is an either-or situation: you can EITHER change the system, OR enter into politics. Because doing both is next to impossible.\n\nMost people who can bring about real change do not start off as politicians. If I were to advice on how to bring about a change in the system, we must stay independent of the system; and here is how we do it.\n\nPick a cause that you want to fight for. We must realise that life is about making choices. If you think that you can do ‘everything right’ if you are the Prime Minister, you are being delusional. Let’s not get into that. Let’s understand that an individual can only do so much. Hence, pick a single cause that you want to fight for.\nAnd then, fight for that cause. It’s literally as simple as that. Do not get under the misconception that you can solve all the problems for all the people. But, you can try to solve some problems for some people. It wouldn’t be as great as you dream, but it would be better than nothing, which is where most politicians end up.\n\nYou see: those who seek power are actually over-estimating themselves. They believe that they can do everything, and hence they go to any extent to just get there. Like Dumbledore said, those best suited for power are the ones who never actively sought it.\n\nHence, chasing power is the root of all evil associated with power.\n\nThink about this:\n\nPower is the ability to influence. In reality, though, those who seek power are actually dependent on those whom they aim to influence in the first place. This is the biggest irony of life.\n\nThe ones who seek power end up being powerless, precisely because they are at the mercy of their followers. They hold on to their power, always seek support, are very protective of falling down, and generally tend to view all decisions from their delusional stand of power.\n\nBut, once you have decided that you don’t seek power - you have nothing to lose. Nobody can bargain with you. Nobody can threaten to withdraw support from you, or force you to accept things that you don’t want to accept. In short, you cannot be manipulated.\n\nAnd THAT is how you actually become powerful.\n\nAnd this is where the second part of Dumbledore’s words become relevant: the ones who are most suited for power are those who have leadership thrust upon them, and who take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.\n\nNever chase power. Instead, just do what you want to do. Don’t make compromises. And be relentless in your pursuit of your cause. The more compromises you make, in the hope of becoming powerful, the more powerless you become.\n\nIf you are good enough, power will come to you. But, even if it doesn’t, don’t worry: because your cause matters more to you.\n\nThis is how you truly clean the system."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.39404

Jack Zhang,Updated 4y,"I’m not trying to stir up controversy, but surely the amount of progress made in physics must be affected by internal politics. Since politics is natural in any human endeavor, surely physics is not immune. Are there good examples of this?","Ever heard of newton’s lenses? They look like this:

They are used to demonstrate newton’s rings which look like this:

Newton did in fact do some work related to interference patterns as he formed his corpuscular theory of light. However, he never referred to them as “my rings” nor should he have because he was not the person to discover them. Newton believed that light came in tiny particles called corpuscles that traveled in straight lines that obeyed classical mechanics, i.e. the mechanics he helped to define and verify. Others had the view that light is a wave. Newton for a lack of a better term was the big guy in physics and thus the wave theory of light had a bit of a struggle for its supporters.

However, along came a single dot that screwed up Newton’s theory of light:

There is no reason for a bright spot to appear in the middle of the shadow of that object as-per newton’s classical theory of light.

Ke'Aun,2y,What is a formative experience that shaped your political viewpoint?,"I used to work as a bank teller.

Sometimes my branch would win sales awards, and when that happened the company would reward us with a fancy dinner, where everyone from the branch would eat with the C-suite executives. At one of those dinners I ended up sitting next to the CEO. He was a nice guy, and he struck up a conversation with us.

One thing he said, kind of as a throwaway comment, was this:

A company like Apple or Google could crush us if they entered the finance space. Luckily regulations keep them out; they decide it isn’t worth the hassle.

Hmm?

What was that now?

Regulations… keep companies out?

Up until then, my understanding of financial regulations was that they stopped banks from doing bad things. It hadn’t occurred to me that they also provided banks with a shield from competition.

This was my first time dealing with something called “barriers to entry
”

Barriers to entry is an economics and business term describing factors that can prevent or impede newcomers into a market or industry sector, and so limit competition. These can include high start-up costs, regulatory hurdles, or other obstacles that prevent new competitors from easily entering a business sector. Barriers to entry benefit existing firms because they protect their market share and ability to generate revenues and profits.

Now, maybe you don’t feel bad that Apple and Google can’t enter financial markets. And, fair. I personally think that a more tech-focused company could do a lot to improve the shockingly archaic practices of banks but, I won’t get into that.

The issue is, is that regulations don’t just stop big players from entering new fields, they can stop startups and small businesses too. When I got into cryptocurrency in the late 2010s, I really started to see how those financial regulations protected incumbents from new competition.

But I first started to think about it over that dinner celebration with my company’s CEO. One throwaway comment. A bank CEO grateful for banking regulations! That really threw me for a loop. It was so starkly opposite to what I expected that I couldn’t not dwell on it.

From that point on I’ve grown increasingly skeptical of market regulations. How many of them claim to protect the little guy, but in reality protect big business?

Not all of them… but more than you’d think.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ws9k0176zcdqmiv5', 'title': 'What is a formative experience that shaped your political viewpoint?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I used to work as a bank teller.\n\nSometimes my branch would win sales awards, and when that happened the company would reward us with a fancy dinner, where everyone from the branch would eat with the C-suite executives.

At one of those dinners I ended up sitting next to the CEO. He was a nice guy, and he struck up a conversation with us.\n\nOne thing he said, kind of as a throwaway comment, was this:\n\nA company like Apple or Google could crush us if they entered the finance space. Luckily regulations keep them out; they decide it isn’t worth the hassle.\n\nHmm?\n\nWhat was that now?\n\nRegulations… keep companies out?\n\nUp until then, my understanding of financial regulations was that they stopped banks from doing bad things. It hadn’t occurred to me that they also provided banks with a shield from competition.\n\nThis was my first time dealing with something called “barriers to entry\n”\n\nBarriers to entry is an economics and business term describing factors that can prevent or impede newcomers into a market or industry sector, and so limit competition. These can include high start-up costs, regulatory hurdles, or other obstacles that prevent new competitors from easily entering a business sector. Barriers to entry benefit existing firms because they protect their market share and ability to generate revenues and profits.\n\nNow, maybe you don’t feel bad that Apple and Google can’t enter financial markets. And, fair. I personally think that a more tech-focused company could do a lot to improve the shockingly archaic practices of banks but, I won’t get into that.\n\nThe issue is, is that regulations don’t just stop big players from entering new fields, they can stop startups and small businesses too. When I got into cryptocurrency in the late 2010s, I really started to see how those financial regulations protected incumbents from new competition.\n\nBut I first started to think about it over that dinner celebration with my company’s CEO.

Misha Firer,2y,What is Russia's government system?,"A bus with a National Guard unit on Taganskaya square in Moscow. Extra law enforcement operatives have been dispatched to the capital to ensure that no spontaneous demonstrations take place before September parliament “elections.”

All the candidates critical of Putin’s regime have been arrested, jailed, kicked out of the country, or prohibited from running.

Graffiti with anti-regime messages get painted over by the employees of the municipal services. In Moscow, especially at the university campuses, there are ubiquitous stripes of paint different color from the original on the walls at eye level.

Russians had to become creative. Above, the encrypted message reads “Diktatura” (dictatorship).

A police bus parked conspicuously on the side of the road opposite Christie Prudi, a popular hangout place of young people.

If a group of youngsters bands together and starts chanting “Navalny for president” or “United Russia is a party of thieves and crooks,” they will be apprehended, packed in the bus, and driven away.

Valery Solovei, an undercover FSB officer, has been giving regular interviews on Gasprom-owned liberal radio station Echo of Moscow and federal channels, with his fairy tales from his “insider” in Kremlin claiming that Putin is infirm and that he is going to step down at the end of the year.

Mr. Solovei’s job is to calm down liberals with “the end is nigh” storyline so they don’t pull something funny in September.

Although senior leadership have been attending church services for years, their communist upbringing didn’t teach them the words of Jesus spoken in the Sermon on the Mount: “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”

Dima Vorobiev,6y,What's your desired (relatively realistic) form of government (either to rule or be ruled)?,"I see a huge wave of admiration for oligarchy in the guise of “meritocracy” sweeping the world. The amazing success of China, combined with the rise of populism and the increasing inequality in the West, makes more and more people question the merits of democracy.

The Soviet A-bomb and our space program can also be chalked up to the Stalinist meritocracy. In the grand scheme of things, this seem to inspire an awful lot of people.

The Anti NSD,2y,How will political and social instability be resolved in the United States where normality and order is preserved in the next decades?,,{'error': 'missing content request parameter'},
Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,1y,Which political revolution is likely to happen next that would change the course of the world?,"The next big political revolution that could happen is against the big technology companies — Amazon, Google, Uber etc. That could break up the large companies, bring a slew of new regulation, possibly even nationalisation of some companies and bankruptcy for a few more when they are suffocated out of their profitable sources. China has already started it and it is only a matter of a time that wave would get to the west.

Throughout the 19th century, world saw a massive growth period from the industrial revolution. Telegraph, electricity, railways, automobiles and textile automation produced massive level of industrial growth. Millions of people moved from farms to factories. Massive tycoons rivalled the power and wealth of kings.

Things looked ok. While Marx and others talked of worker rights and revolution, the world seemed safe from socialism.

However, in the beginning of the 20th century there were significant rifts — between those who benefitted a lot with the technology and those who didn’t. Decades after the death of Marx, his ideas were resurrected causing the biggest political idea of the 20th century — communism.

Even countries that avoided Communism — like the US — changed substantially. Big companies were broken up, labour rights law came up and a slew of welfare schemes arose.

History might not repeat, but surely does rhyme

Since the 1990s we are seeing a new industrial revolution. It has caused massive changes. A few companies like Amazon have begun dominating a whole bunch of industries. There is a massive productivity rise on one side and destruction of centuries old enterprises on the other.

However, like in the 19th century, things are going calm as people are seeing growth. It is when things begin to slow down or stop will the chaos really come up. Sooner or later, the incremental benefits from the next iPhone, fast shipping from Amazon and fast searches from Google will all crawl to nothing. And when the incomes don’t rise up people will really seek the villains for the predicament. Even if the privacy part doesn’t shake people immediately, the immense power technology holds over people’s daily life will slowly start producing scary ramifications.

For a couple of days I was locked out of not just my mail, but my photos, documents and a dozens of accounts that are all connected to my Google. I got back my account, but the scary part of having technology companies having too much power over my life, without having any regulatory process or customer service is scary. If a sizeable population gets that experience, it could create its own mini revolution. Every revolution in the past gets started with a small spark.

Automation will slowly chip away jobs over the next 2 decades. Those who get dislocated will bring their anger.

Again, the political leadership of the world is insipid and uninspiring. Nobody gets excited with Joe Biden or his counterparts across the democratic world. They cannot bring people to a revolution.

What happens when a charismatic populist comes up at the right time when people stop seeing new benefits out of technology. That explosive cocktail is probably only years away. The incredible wealth of tech companies and their founders might be the lightning rod for the public anger.

How might this take place?

In capitalist societies like the US the following could happen:

Strong regulations of how social media companies, tech marketplaces and other platforms operate. They might get less autonomy in deciding what is an acceptable content, what is an acceptable product etc.
Breakup of companies too big.
Competition protection to keep platform companies from dominating with their own products. Such as how Apple can promote its own apps on the app store or how much preference Amazon can give its products in its marketplace.
Change in tax code to make tech companies and their founders pay a fairer share.
Change in perceptions of entrepreneurs similar to what happened in the late 19th century. Public attitudes towards Rockefeller and Carnegie is different from those of Musk or Bezos right now.
Public utilities giving every citizen a right to access basic services like email, cloud storage etc.

In less capitalist societies, such as China, India, EU the following could happen:

Nationalisation of some of essential tech companies and services.
Government supported/owned platforms taking over core tech infrastructure. For instance, in India government owned UPI and RuPay are taking over the transactions of Visa/Mastercard etc. Government is also encouraging a local alternative to Twitter, called the Koo. These trends would accelerate over this decade.
Public protests and violence against the rich, especially the nouveau riche. Laws will come as a reaction to significantly reduce their wealth.
Limits in the operations of overseas tech companies. There are already regulations on where data should be stored. These will get bigger.
Strong enforcement of local laws in content moderation and other operations of social media/tech companies.
End of domination of global social networks, to be replaced by local social networks. For instance, Facebook is useful for a more globally connected populace. However, for most people speaking non-English they might prefer more of the evolving new social media in their own language & catered to their own region.
Reversal in tech direction and going back to slightly more primitive tools. Just as some people picked up DuckDuckGo losing some search relevance for privacy, there will be an increasing public movement away from current technology.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/arfj5i239cqdx4b6', 'title': 'Which political revolution is likely to happen next that would change the course of the world?', 'score': {'original': 0.825, 'ai': 0.175}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The next big political revolution that could happen is against the big technology companies — Amazon, Google, Uber etc. That could break up the large companies, bring a slew of new regulation, possibly even nationalisation of some companies and bankruptcy for a few more when they are suffocated out of their profitable sources.

Ahead of football game Iran-USA, Moscow movie theatre displayed support. “Iran, Russia with you!” ran the message in Farsi and Russian. US defeated Iran 1:0.

Iran’s air support didn’t help Russia defeat Ukraine. Russia’s Potemkin support didn’t help Iran win in World Cup.

Habib F,7y,How could the Republican Party prevent another Trump-style candidacy in the future?,"Lots of different ways.

Adopt superdelagates. This move is antidemocratic, however, and would be decried by the Republican base.
Change the winner takes all system. Trump would win something like 30% of a state, but because it was first-past-the-post AND winner-takes-all, he would get a huge number of delegates. Soon, he had an insurmountable lead. Had delegates been awarded proportionately, it would have been hard for him to win, since a majority of the GOP primary electorate remained skeptical about him until fairly late in the race.
Adopt Instant-runoff voting. This would be democratic and would have the effect of empowering consensus candidates at the expense of extremists. It would also generate HUGE media publicity and would have the effect of making GOP voters excited to try the cool new thing. It would probably also lead a lot of independents to register as Republicans for the same reason.
Support campaign-finance reform. The problem Republicans had the last time around is that there were too many establishment candidates. Together, they split the establishment vote and allowed Trump to win. How did that happen? Financing. Simply put, there were too many sugar daddies available and they collectively showered their largesse on too many sugar babies. Normally, there’s an invisible primary before the primary where would-be candidates vie for the support of the party establishment. This is because the party establishment gives you access to money and media publicity. But what happens when you get can money from elsewhere is that the establishment structure matters less. So, by funding their own candidates, what the Kochs and Adelsons of the world ended up producing was a hopelessly divided field that was too fractured to stand up to Trump.

We’ll see where they opt to go. The party establishment must be thinking about doing something. I hope they go for something bold like IRV but more than likely, they’ll probably just change the winner-takes-all system.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/96v8oyiwjg0ltahb', 'title': 'How could the Republican Party prevent another Trump-style candidacy in the future?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Lots of different ways.\n\nAdopt superdelagates.

Had delegates been awarded proportionately, it would have been hard for him to win, since a majority of the GOP primary electorate remained skeptical about him until fairly late in the race.\nAdopt Instant-runoff voting. This would be democratic and would have the effect of empowering consensus candidates at the expense of extremists. It would also generate HUGE media publicity and would have the effect of making GOP voters excited to try the cool new thing. It would probably also lead a lot of independents to register as Republicans for the same reason.\nSupport campaign-finance reform. The problem Republicans had the last time around is that there were too many establishment candidates. Together, they split the establishment vote and allowed Trump to win. How did that happen? Financing. Simply put, there were too many sugar daddies available and they collectively showered their largesse on too many sugar babies. Normally, there’s an invisible primary before the primary where would-be candidates vie for the support of the party establishment. This is because the party establishment gives you access to money and media publicity. But what happens when you get can money from elsewhere is that the establishment structure matters less. So, by funding their own candidates, what the Kochs and Adelsons of the world ended up producing was a hopelessly divided field that was too fractured to stand up to Trump.\n\nWe’ll see where they opt to go. The party establishment must be thinking about doing something. I hope they go for something bold like IRV but more than likely, they’ll probably just change the winner-takes-all system.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9995
Misha Firer,Updated 1y,Will Putin's political system outlive him in Russia?,"Putin’s advisor Sergey Kirienko is a Matryoshka man.

Russian people sit on top of the largest deposits of natural resources on the planet. It’s a boundless source of incoming financial wealth … for a few. The main goal of the Russian elites has been to devise and implement methods to deceive the populace to steal from them.

Putin has been extremely good at fooling Russians and stealing from them while at the same time remaining popular (Lie-Steal-Happy: three cornerstones of Putin’s ingenious system).

The elites are fearful that it’ll be hard to find another Putin who can lie more believably than when telling the truth. It’s like Lionel Messi who runs faster with the ball than without it. A rare genius!

All the elites need to do is change the angle of the lie, and Russians who want to be deceived (otherwise it’d be like taking the red pill and they always wanna have the blue one) would fall in line.

Curb and sidewalk paving stone annual replacement scam caused ire in the Moscow residents after a decade of non-stop roadworks.

All the municipal crooks had to do was tweak the formula: they are now replacing underground piping and have to pulverise sidewalks and curbs and then replace them. Moscovites are looking happily at the holes in the roads and new pipes, and not sidewalks that are being replaced for the fifteenth times in eleven years.

Just another day on a road in Russia.

The goals of the special military operation have changed at least four times in three months, and yet Russian tv viewers haven't experienced any cognitive dissonance, they’re still “faithful, one hundred per cent”, as they are passive consumers of precooked propaganda mind candy, or what Americansky call drinking the kool-aid.

However, at the elites’ level, they’re not keen on drinkin’ cheapsky kool-aidsky manufactured at Ostankino TV studios by third-rate talents. Is cringeworthy. In my previous posts, I have covered two sources of the Russian elites’ beliefs:

Psychedelic drugs (Ayahuasca, LSD, magic mushrooms) consumed during shaman ceremonies that give them otherworldly visions and confirm self-importance.
Crack Pot Religions Ltd: a mixture of conspiracy theories, pseudo Orthodox Christian and Sumer prophecies and deities, and esoteric teachings.

In 1991, secret police founder Felix Dzerzhinsky monument is being removed from the Lyubyanka square. In 2022, a McDonald’s arch is being removed due to secret police vetted invasion of Ukraine.

If you still go higher on an intellect meter, you meet folks with critical thinking and high IQ who must justify to themselves why they’re at the top of steal-all-you-can pyramid, or at least complicit in the immoral system.

This Sunday, I visited ‘Oleg’, a well-educated and highly intelligent former auditor at the Big Four, then an independent consultant who’s worked for half a dozen state corporations before launching his own IT business.

Oleg leads a typical American upper middle class liberal lifestyle - a progressive family structure, fitness centre every day, healthy food, home office, private kindergarten for the daughter, intellectual pastimes, foreign vacations.

He doesn’t own a single Russian product, maybe except a cat, and yet, without experiencing any contradictions, Oleg is an anti-Western Russian patriot.

A Russian soldier is buried in a crate from a refrigerator.

It was interesting for me to learn different narratives that he constructed in his head to justify his stance.

Bad oligarchs? Some oligarchs do care about their employees like Severstal owner Alexey Modrashov. Whereas I see Cherepovetz where his factories located as a Soviet shithole while their owner got five super-yachts, Oleg sees high salaries, ecologically clean production, foster homes that have all their inmates adopted before they graduate.
Arrests and confiscation of property in Russia? Been detained in the US twice as a representative of a Russian state corporation.
Chernobyl disaster? Just four people were involved, all died before the trial. Soviet Union did too much to liquidate the aftermath using three million people to clean it up which bankrupted the state.
No technologies? Rosatom’s uranium enrichment technologies are unmatched, nuclear power station in every neighborhood and icebreakers generating, storing electricity and selling to customers.

Oleg has worked with Sergey Kirienko, son of a Jewish father and Ukrainian mother, when he was the head of Rosatom, and fell under his spell.

Kirienko believes that it doesn't matter whether Russia is a democracy or a dictatorship. With Putin he talks like to a tsar; with the Western leaders, like to democrats. To him, Motherland is much more than the structure of governance.

Sergey Kirienko believes that armed with eternal optimism and faith in Russia’s bright future and potential of its people, the next leader can take the country boldly and fearlessly into the 21st century.

Which, I believe, is still another riff of the same old fool and steal trick despite its lofty premises: “we didn’t roll back the hands of time to 1989, there was no war, no sanctions, look over here: we got nuclear stations in every city block because we are a great nation!”","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xmy0glo1hcd8bj32', 'title': ""Will Putin's political system outlive him in Russia?"", 'score': {'original': 0.53115, 'ai': 0.46885}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Putin’s advisor Sergey Kirienko is a Matryoshka man.\n\nRussian people sit on top of the largest deposits of natural resources on the planet.

Matthew Bates,3y,"Are most Americans fatigued by politics, energized by it, or tolerate its necessity?","Fatigued.

I honestly think that that’s why sports viewership goes down whenever the players start making political statements on the field, and convincing the league to go along with it. People tune out not because they don’t like the message, but because they don’t like the fact that politics has crept into yet another thing that they used to enjoy partially because it was apolitical.

It’s why groups boycott companies that make political statements. It’s not the statement itself that they’re boycotting… it’s the continued encroachment of politics into places where it didn’t used to be.

Company: *Makes official political statement.*

Group that’s opposed to that statement: We must boycott that company. If you support that company, you support (tyranny/bigotry/anti-Americanism/whatever…).

Average Americans: For fuck’s sake can’t I just buy this product like I always do and enjoy it without having to worry about the political ramifications? Why must this $5 transaction I’m about to make to secure a product I want be turned into a political statement? I don’t care what is or isn’t printed on the coffee cup they’re going to give me. I don’t care how the CEO spends their money. I just want to buy this (coffee/chicken sandwich/something else) in peace. Is that too much to ask?

I think it’s part of the reason people are tuning out the media, too. It’s not that the people don’t care about the news anymore, but rather, it’s that the media itself seems to focus way too much on politics, as if there’s nothing else in the world that matters to people.

Even the weather report gets politics injected into it now. A story about bad weather will inevitably mention climate change and the government’s inaction on it.

I think it’s also why we’re seeing more people attracted to political movements that promise less political influence in our lives… anarchists and libertarians, for example.

Katja Kaila,Updated 4y,"In European politics, are socialists considered ""moderates"" while capitalism is considered right-wing?","No.

We never use the word ‘socialist’ to refer to tax-financed welfare state, universal healthcare, free education, or income transfers to mitigate the consequences of different life situations (such as unemployment, having a baby, sickness, or studying).

The term is reserved solely for describing a situation in which there is no private ownership of the means of production.

And very few left-wing parties in Europe pursue that.

But in case you are really asking whether Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders would be moderates here in Europe, yes, that’s true. In many countries of Europe, most of the things that they suggest are policies that have already been adopted long time ago, and defending them is in no way radical or exceptional.

Here in Finland, right-wing parties tend to pursue the following kind of things:

Allowing private healthcare enterprises to produce healthcare services while still financing those services with tax money
Allowing employers and employees to make more agreements on the local level, independently of national trade unions
Adopting a flat income tax rate
Reducing income tax rate
Cutting the unemployment benefit by a certain percentage for people who haven’t managed to work or participate in education for a certain number of hours monthly

The left-wing parties tend to oppose those policies. For them, things like progressive taxation, healthcare organized by the public sector, and strong trade unions are important.

There are also differences between our Left and Right, when it comes to environmentalism and immigration policies. Our Right is, however, divided in regard to social liberalism, and the only bigger party in Finland that is socially conservative is the far-right party Finns.

But the consensus across the political spectrum has so far been that healthcare must be universal, education must be tuition-free, and there has to be some kind of a safety net for difficult life situations.

In other words, capitalism needs to be regulated in order to produce more well-being for people.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vlskcxopu82y4bmz', 'title': 'In European politics, are socialists considered ""moderates"" while capitalism is considered right-wing?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'No.\n\nWe never use the word ‘socialist’ to refer to tax-financed welfare state, universal healthcare, free education, or income transfers to mitigate the consequences of different life situations (such as unemployment, having a baby, sickness, or studying).\n\nThe term is reserved solely for describing a situation in which there is no private ownership of the means of production.\n\nAnd very few left-wing parties in Europe pursue that.\n\nBut in case you are really asking whether Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders would be moderates here in Europe, yes, that’s true.

Elena Gold,Oct 13,"Is Russia a democracy, in practice, not theory?","Vladimir Putin has 5 months until he’s officially a dictator and not a legitimate head of state.

Today, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted the resolution recognizing Putin as a dictator and the Russian Federation as a de facto dictatorship.

All 43 member countries voted for that.

PACE called on member states of the Council of Europe to recognize Vladimir Putin as an illegitimate president after the end of his 4th term in 2024 and to stop all contacts with him, with the exception of humanitarian ones.

Putin’s “extremely long stay in power” led to repressions within the Russian Federation and war in Ukraine, the PACE resolution noted.

PACE also confirmed its support for the decision on an international tribunal, which is designed to hold the leadership of the Russian Federation, including Vladimir Putin, accountable for war crimes, the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of war on the territory of Ukraine.

In March 2024, Russia intends to hold presidential elections (a show called “re-appointment of Vladimir Putin as the president”).

But so far, not a single candidate announced they’d be running. Even Putin himself hadn’t announced he’s going to stand for re-election!

Putin is expected to “win the elections”, but his actual ratings are so bad (because of the war in Ukraine), even an unknown school teacher from a small village would beat him — if Russia had fair elections. So, it’s a real challenge for the presidential administration to find candidates to run alongside Putin, who are despised more than him.

So much so that Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya leader, even proposed that Russia should have no elections. Or have elections, but only have 1 candidate: Vladimir Putin.

Of course, Kadyrov just said what he was told to say. Statements like this, about cancelling federal elections, aren’t his level of initiative.

The presidential administration is running out of ideas (and time) and trying to sound out variants that seem safe — but it is the variant of elections without a choice that could become the final straw for the Russian population, exhausted by the war in Ukraine, rising prices and instability.

So could be elections where the people voted overwhelmingly for another candidate but the result announced as Putin’s win. In 2020, Lukashenko did that, and he struggled to contain the revolution: only by killing and imprisoning hundreds of protestors (Putin sent Russian anti-riot police and FSB to suppress the uprising) that Lukashenko managed to stay in power.

Putin’s administration wants to avoid excesses like those: in a country at war, where a lot of guns and grenades are safely hid by soldiers who returned from the battlefield, where a group of population became hardened killers, massive public protests can turn deadly. And not only for Putin himself, but for his whole power circle.

Give the crowd a spark and it can explode.

Meanwhile, Putin in Kyrgyzstan made a speech at the meeting of CIS countries (Russian commonwealth) and specifically talked about the need to fight terrorism, acknowledged Tajikistan’s concern about the threat from Afghanistan, and called to increase efforts against financing of terrorism.

Lavrov and Taliban leaders.

Lavrov and Hamas leaders.

Lavrov and Hezbollah leaders.

Putin and the leader of Iran.

Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.

Mike Jones,3y,Why is Biden putting so many red states in play?,"It’s an interesting question. I think there are a couple of reasons based on looking at internals of a bunch of polls (i.e., how various groups answer the polls).

Misogyny. I don’t think this was the primary factor, but I think it was a factor in people not voting for Clinton. It appears in people saying “I just didn’t like her” in a variety of ways that they’re unable (or unwilling) to explain. And it’s not just among male voters, which seems odd but appears to me to have been the case.
Trump fatigue. There seem to be a lot of people (particularly women) who were willing to give Trump a shot in 2016. I suspect it’s because they didn’t really know much about him other than his public image, often from The Apprentice. After actually watching him for four years, well, let’s just say he’s not the sort of personality that wears well over time.

Misha Firer,1y,Why does Russia live in the past politically instead of embracing the future?,"Here’s a giant pavilion at VDNKH (Soviet Expo) in Moscow dedicated to history of Russia, or should I say its one person’s interpretation, designed to reflect the inner world of Vladimir Putin.

To the right from the entrance there’s a line of emperors from the Romanov dynasty in the spirit of Ancient Egypt pharaohs.

Putin’s favorite tsar Alexander the Third paranoid quote, “Russia has only two allies: Army and Navy” juxtaposed next to a Russian army soldier against the Z sign that stands for: “truth, victory, peace.”

The sanctions have caused the Z mark also to stand for : no tooth filings, no print paper, no MRI, no meds, no planes, no asphalt roads, and countless no other products of the western civilization that Russia doesn’t have and doesn’t know how to produce.

Next to the faceless soldier (if he stands for truth can we at least see his eyes?) there’s a quote of poet Alexander Pushkin about history being the way God has given him.

Substitute God with Putin. Pushkin was a native French speaking aristocrat who criticized Russian authoritarianism, and his quote was taken out of context due to his sacred status as the father of the modern Russian language.

To the left from the entrance, there are photos of great patriotic war, Gulag, red pioneers, kolkhoz - a triumphant tribute to glorious communism while the rest of the former republics are trying their best to put it all behind like a bad dream.

A sinister Putin’s quote ties the exposition together like the Dude’s rug: “You told me that Russia is between the west and east. It’s east and west that are located to the left and to the right from Russia.”

Yes, our president refers to the East as left and West as right. I assume, north is up and south is down.

Should one wonder why he’s pitching his country of 100M citizens against 1B people in the west and 1.5B in China.

57% of Russia’s populace, mostly uneducated working class and rural residents who can’t build a modern economy on their own, clamour for the special military operation, thus they have to counter 43M dissidents at home and 2.5B inferior enemies abroad who haven’t seen the light of the truth just yet.

I stood for ten minutes outside this paranoid and schizophrenic pavilion and no one walked in or out. I mean it must be pretty scary to ordinary 21st century person - glory of communism, wars, tsars.

Right next to that monstrosity there was a long line to the country house, garden and landscape fair. Dacha aficionados were out in force to buy seeds and equipment to plant and harvest from their plots of land to survive through summer and winter while food prices are doubling and tripling.

The Death Star forum hall was specifically positioned to dwarf richly decorated Soviet Ukraine pavilion. Kyiv Pecherak Lavra in the background was recently nationalised from the Russian Orthodox Church.

On the other side of the square, a fighter jet stood on a podium. Behind it, a rocket poised ready to launch. Sanctions have buried Russian space program as all the western partners tore contracts with Roscosmos. Its chief Igor Rogozin who’s been channeling (and bullying) Elon Musk can now only write tweets, although I’m not sure if it’s legal since government banned Twitter in Russia.

Third installation for the pavilion Soviet Transport is likewise useless for civil purposes - a military helicopter. In the background is Ostankino TV that’s been feeding Russians with its round the clock psychotic insanity since the turn of the millennium.

No wonder Russian army bombed Kiyv TV tower - they thought that Ukrainians are brainwashed by TV like Russians, and one just needs to deactivate television and they will welcome Russian troops with flowers for the channel one video cameras. Wouldn’t that be sweet?

Only a quarter of the installations in the Soviet Transport sector are for civilian use - a Yak 42 plane that will soon be refitted and leased by Aeroflot to substitute Boeings and Airbuses that have no maintenance and spare parts.

I stopped by Kazakhstan pavilion and wandered through its ornate corridors with exhibitions depicting its economical and commercial developments of the former Soviet republic in the past thirty years.

No khans, no tsars, no wars, no annexations, no faceless soldiers with half-swastikas anywhere. The sanity that I suddenly observed was like a breath of fresh air. Alas, Borat’s cultural learnings were not on display.

Contrasted to fascist quote of the Russian autocrat, I was struck with the quote of Kazakh elbasi, or National leader, Nursultan Nasarbaev, “To me there is no more superior goal that to lead my country into the ranks of the developed countries of the world.”

I was stunned. I have lived in madness for so long, simplicity and grace of these words hit me with the force of a freight train.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8ogz6kwchfmlieyb', 'title': 'Why does Russia live in the past politically instead of embracing the future?', 'score': {'original': 0.9977, 'ai': 0.0023}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Here’s a giant pavilion at VDNKH (Soviet Expo) in Moscow dedicated to history of Russia, or should I say its one person’s interpretation, designed to reflect the inner world of Vladimir Putin.\n\nTo the right from the entrance there’s a line of emperors from the Romanov dynasty in the spirit of Ancient Egypt pharaohs.\n\nPutin’s favorite tsar Alexander the Third paranoid quote, “Russia has only two allies: Army and Navy” juxtaposed next to a Russian army soldier against the Z sign that stands for: “truth, victory, peace.”\n\nThe sanctions have caused the Z mark also to stand for : no tooth filings, no print paper, no MRI, no meds, no planes, no asphalt roads, and countless no other products of the western civilization that Russia doesn’t have and doesn’t know how to produce.\n\nNext to the faceless soldier (if he stands for truth can we at least see his eyes?) there’s a quote of poet Alexander Pushkin about history being the way God has given him.\n\nSubstitute God with Putin.

I mean it must be pretty scary to ordinary 21st century person - glory of communism, wars, tsars.\n\nRight next to that monstrosity there was a long line to the country house, garden and landscape fair. Dacha aficionados were out in force to buy seeds and equipment to plant and harvest from their plots of land to survive through summer and winter while food prices are doubling and tripling.\n\nThe Death Star forum hall was specifically positioned to dwarf richly decorated Soviet Ukraine pavilion. Kyiv Pecherak Lavra in the background was recently nationalised from the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nOn the other side of the square, a fighter jet stood on a podium. Behind it, a rocket poised ready to launch. Sanctions have buried Russian space program as all the western partners tore contracts with Roscosmos. Its chief Igor Rogozin who’s been channeling (and bullying) Elon Musk can now only write tweets, although I’m not sure if it’s legal since government banned Twitter in Russia.\n\nThird installation for the pavilion Soviet Transport is likewise useless for civil purposes - a military helicopter. In the background is Ostankino TV that’s been feeding Russians with its round the clock psychotic insanity since the turn of the millennium.\n\nNo wonder Russian army bombed Kiyv TV tower - they thought that Ukrainians are brainwashed by TV like Russians, and one just needs to deactivate television and they will welcome Russian troops with flowers for the channel one video cameras. Wouldn’t that be sweet?\n\nOnly a quarter of the installations in the Soviet Transport sector are for civilian use - a Yak 42 plane that will soon be refitted and leased by Aeroflot to substitute Boeings and Airbuses that have no maintenance and spare parts.\n\nI stopped by Kazakhstan pavilion and wandered through its ornate corridors with exhibitions depicting its economical and commercial developments of the former Soviet republic in the past thirty years.\n\nNo khans, no tsars, no wars, no annexations, no faceless soldiers with half-swastikas anywhere. The sanity that I suddenly observed was like a breath of fresh air. Alas, Borat’s cultural learnings were not on display.\n\nContrasted to fascist quote of the Russian autocrat, I was struck with the quote of Kazakh elbasi, or National leader, Nursultan Nasarbaev, “To me there is no more superior goal that to lead my country into the ranks of the developed countries of the world.”\n\nI was stunned. I have lived in madness for so long, simplicity and grace of these words hit me with the force of a freight train.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9977
