Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,7y,"Even after 70 years of stable democracy, why is the Indian political system so corrupt and governance inefficient?","I’m not sure that the DAWN op-ed: Three questions from Pakistan that India needs to answer
 is a sincere one. For DAWN’s standards, it was of pretty poor quality.

First, the author asks how India can be corrupt if it is also democratic. The assumption is that democracy is a magic wand that removes all illnesses. For its size and poverty, India ranks fairly well in the Corruption Perceptions Index
. 100 nations [including China and Pakistan] rank behind India. Of the poorer countries, only 4 [Bhutan, Senegal, Lesotho, Rwanda] rank ahead of India and all of them are very small. India is corrupt, but most of the world is far more corrupt.

Second, the author wonders how India can have religious violence when it is secular. Again, the assumption is that having a secular Constitution would magically bring about all the necessary security infrastructure such as a modern police force to contain riots. For the size of its population, India’s religious violence rate is quite low. And way lower than Pakistan. The status of Muslims in India is infinitely better than that of Hindus in Pakistan.

Third, the author asks how the people can love their army in a democratic setup. I guess the author knows nothing of US. Democracy doesn’t mean you hate the military. In fact, being in a dangerous neighborhood with a key terrorism sponsor next to us, Indians are quite thankful that their army contains most of the bad stuff trying to get past our borders.

All in all, a very poor article. India has its share of problems and is poor, given the circumstances of the past few hundred years. However, when it is compared to its non-democratic neighbors, India fares way better. While Indians might whine a lot about their politics, I don’t know of any who would trade their system for the one run in Pakistan or Myanmar.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/y930edwuj621hzbr', 'title': 'Even after 70 years of stable democracy, why is the Indian political system so corrupt and governance inefficient?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I’m not sure that the DAWN op-ed: Three questions from Pakistan that India needs to answer\n is a sincere one.

Amy Winn VOTE BLUE,Updated Jan 17,"Why do liberals want to force everyone to believe there was no election fraud? In any democratic society, if elections were deemed fraudulent they should be nullified and held again. But no, libs want to force people to believe they were fair. Why?","Don't you think it's odd that Trump never complained about the election results when he won? Don't you think it's odd that many Republicans on the ballots in 2020 won their elections? Don't you think it's odd that Trump claimed that the election was stolen before a single vote was cast?

Don't you think it's strange that after three years, several recounts and 60 lawsuits, no voter fraud has been found…. except for a few Republicans?

Rudi Guiliani testified the had no evidence of any voter fraud. Fox news claimed that the voting machines were incorrect. They lied about it and were sued and had to pay 787 million dollars to the voting machine company for their lies.

Trump is a spoiled brat, a narcissist and a sore loser. He lied to his supporters about the election being stolen. He wanted to steal the election by having fake electors submit fraudulent documents. He called a Georgia official asking him to find 11,780 votes. He incited an insurrection on the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the votes. That all failed. He was the first president in history to refuse the peaceful transfer of power.

There was no election fraud. You were lied to. Trump was fact checked to have lied over 30,000 times in one term, and yet for some unknown reason, his supporters believe every word out of his fat orange lying face. It's just bizarre!!

Those who support Trump are misled. They are being used for donations for his legal fees and he will continue to lie to keep the money coming. He has sold everything from red MAGA hats and flags, to Trump mugshot tshirts, to silly trading cards, and his supporters fall for every single bit of it.

This is the very definition of a cult.

Maryanne Slater,Updated 1y,Democratic mayor says women should have 'right' to abortions up until the day of birth. What do you think about it?,"Let’s call our imaginary pregnant woman Kathie.

Kathie has been looking forward to having a baby. She’s got brand name baby clothes and a top of the line crib. Or maybe she’s got hand-me-downs. Doesn’t matter.

In her eighth month, Kathie realizes can’t feel her baby moving. Maybe she rushes off to her doctor right away. Maybe she has to wait for her day off to go to a clinic or emergency. Maybe she spends few days hoping and praying. Doesn’t matter.

When she sees a doctor and gets an ultrasound, it’s clear the fetus is dead from some kind of congenital abnormality. Maybe its little heart was malformed. Maybe its brain stopped developing at a critical point. Doesn’t matter.

What does matter is that just days away from what should have been her baby’s birthday, Kathie is carrying a dead fetus that’s going to start decomposing and her body isn’t ready to go into labour to expel it. There’s a risk that it could go septic.

No one should be able to make Kathie put her life at risk just because they don’t like the idea of a late term abortion.

Edit: Because people keep asking, yes, it’s still counted as an abortion if the fetus is dead. It still counts as terminating a pregnancy, even though that pregnancy is no longer viable.

Misha Firer,1y,"What is the peculiarity of Putin's dictatorship in Russia over other dictatorships? How is the propaganda used by the media, in schools, churches, etc.?","The soldier boy grows up, goes to war and becomes a samovar.

There are three things I can watch forever: fire burning, water falling, and vatnik women. I love vatnik woman! I really do.

Vatnik woman has endearing crassness and blunt directness. If she says no, she means yes, and vice versa. And when she says, “no, and I mean it!” it’s “maybe.”

That does not mean she’s not brutalsky because she’s tougher than nails!

Vatnik woman loves to do nails: she’s either a self-employed manicurist or a client of her manicurist friend.

My eight year old daughter Margot loves to do nails. She knows every nail salon in the hood. However, I’m afraid she’s refined and well-mannered and won’t become a vatnik woman.

Vatnik woman’s world revolves around nails, beloved “my husband my husband my husband,” kids and beyond that lie vast snow-covered lands steeped in heroic military fantasies, populated by spirits of the heroes-martyrs of the glorious past.

Vatnik woman glues to TV screen for must-watch religious rites - Victory Day Military Parade on Red Square and Putin’s two-hour long address to the nation.

She would not listen to the actual meaning of the words. She’d seek reaffirmation of her beliefs, and the tsar’s speechwriters would always deliver on the promise.

Mother Russia is strong.

Putin has vanquished fifth column on the inside and dealt a decisive blow to the foe who want to break Motherland apart on the outside.

Reassured by Kremlin leadership’s might, vatnik woman returns to nails, husband husband husband and household chores.

Once a year, vatnik woman would take her family to a photo studio to do a glamorous photo session of her beloved heroes-martyrs in Red Army uniforms.

Kids dressed up as little soldiers holding automatic guns. Husband husband husband in military uniform armed and heroic. She’s a nurse, or a tank factory worker, or a loving wife in vintage dress.

In a few days, vatnik woman’s Instagram feed with painted nails is interspersed with her gloriously photoshopped military family.

And then one day, vatnik woman’s husband husband husband is mobilised to fight Nazis in Ukraine. A cosplay is suddenly real? Not so much to vatnik woman.

She records the ceremony of parting with her husband husband husband at the town square and posts it on her Instagram with the same soundtrack that every vatnik woman uses for saying-goodbye-to-mobilised-husband posts.

“My husband husband husband is going to fight Nazis and liberate vast lands of glorious Motherland!”

Were you to ask vatnik woman to name one Ukrainian town and find it on the map she’d say Penza and point her manicured finger at Minsk.

Brutalsky found a game changing weapon that can turn the tide on the battlefront: Tsar Cannon.

And then, one day, vatnik woman learns that her husband husband husband was killed in action.

Vatnik woman would act surprised. It can’t be! My husband husband husband is a hero! He didn’t go to fight Nazis to die. It’s impossible.

Because you see, when vatnik woman parted with him on the town square and posted a video with that same melody as other vatnik women do, she was absolutely sure it was all fun and game, like a photo session and he can’t die.

But he did.

Her hero-martyr from the military-styled photo session. Vatnik woman had told her husband husband husband you should go and fight Nazis! Don’t run abroad like office plankton. Don’t hide like your friends from factory.

And now she’s stuck with mortgage and kids and slim chances to land another husband of equal value. Her life prospects have been degraded, but she does not understand it!

She posts pictures of her hero husband on Instagram and tells everyone that he died to rid Armenia or France, one of those distant lands, of Nazi scum.

And then, comes another shocker.

Vatnik woman is told that her husband husband husband wasn’t really, you know, a hero. And let’s skip a bit into the future to the era when vatnik woman learns from TV and her clients that her husband husband husband who posed in military uniform every year for a heroic photo session, was in fact a war criminal.

Husband husband husband raped women, tortured men, killed civilians by thousands in a foreign land where there were no Nazis. And if the enemies are not Nazis, this can only mean one thing: her husband husband husband was a Nazi!!!

You might think that vatnik woman won’t be able to come to terms with cognitive dissonance that her husband husband husband is not a Nazi Slayer but a Nazi but that would imply having to deal with two conflicting thoughts at the same time. And clearly you don’t know vatnik women! Not as much as I know them at least.

Vatnik woman will quietly delete all the brutalsky military style photos from her Instagram and pretends that there was no husband husband husband. And when her son asks where are glorious military photos from his second grade mom will tell him , there have never been any.

It’s always been just her and the kids. She despised Nazi military parades and Putin’s Nazi speeches.

She’s a nurse, or a tank factory worker, or a loving wife in vintage dress.\n\nIn a few days, vatnik woman’s Instagram feed with painted nails is interspersed with her gloriously photoshopped military family.\n\nAnd then one day, vatnik woman’s husband husband husband is mobilised to fight Nazis in Ukraine. A cosplay is suddenly real? Not so much to vatnik woman.\n\nShe records the ceremony of parting with her husband husband husband at the town square and posts it on her Instagram with the same soundtrack that every vatnik woman uses for saying-goodbye-to-mobilised-husband posts.\n\n“My husband husband husband is going to fight Nazis and liberate vast lands of glorious Motherland!”\n\nWere you to ask vatnik woman to name one Ukrainian town and find it on the map she’d say Penza and point her manicured finger at Minsk.\n\nBrutalsky found a game changing weapon that can turn the tide on the battlefront: Tsar Cannon.\n\nAnd then, one day, vatnik woman learns that her husband husband husband was killed in action.\n\nVatnik woman would act surprised. It can’t be! My husband husband husband is a hero! He didn’t go to fight Nazis to die. It’s impossible.\n\nBecause you see, when vatnik woman parted with him on the town square and posted a video with that same melody as other vatnik women do, she was absolutely sure it was all fun and game, like a photo session and he can’t die.\n\nBut he did.\n\nHer hero-martyr from the military-styled photo session. Vatnik woman had told her husband husband husband you should go and fight Nazis! Don’t run abroad like office plankton. Don’t hide like your friends from factory.\n\nAnd now she’s stuck with mortgage and kids and slim chances to land another husband of equal value. Her life prospects have been degraded, but she does not understand it!\n\nShe posts pictures of her hero husband on Instagram and tells everyone that he died to rid Armenia or France, one of those distant lands, of Nazi scum.\n\nAnd then, comes another shocker.\n\nVatnik woman is told that her husband husband husband wasn’t really, you know, a hero. And let’s skip a bit into the future to the era when vatnik woman learns from TV and her clients that her husband husband husband who posed in military uniform every year for a heroic photo session, was in fact a war criminal.\n\nHusband husband husband raped women, tortured men, killed civilians by thousands in a foreign land where there were no Nazis. And if the enemies are not Nazis, this can only mean one thing: her husband husband husband was a Nazi!!!\n\nYou might think that vatnik woman won’t be able to come to terms with cognitive dissonance that her husband husband husband is not a Nazi Slayer but a Nazi but that would imply having to deal with two conflicting thoughts at the same time. And clearly you don’t know vatnik women! Not as much as I know them at least.\n\nVatnik woman will quietly delete all the brutalsky military style photos from her Instagram and pretends that there was no husband husband husband. And when her son asks where are glorious military photos from his second grade mom will tell him , there have never been any.\n\nIt’s always been just her and the kids. She despised Nazi military parades and Putin’s Nazi speeches. And as for the new president, she firmly believes he’s the best leader Russia has ever had!', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.8942
William Weir,6mo,"If you're a Democrat in line with contemporary Democratic thought, belief, and dogma, don't you fear going to hell?","Conservative here and former Republican, but as a Christian minister, I have to ask what religious background someone has to ask such a question.

From a Biblical perspective, Jesus is recorded in Matthew 25 as speaking about the coming judgement. I’m quoting that entire passage below (NIV):

31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.

34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’

37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’

40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’

41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’

44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’

45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’

46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”

So based on Christian theology, the Democrats obviously being those who advocate welcoming immigrants (translated here as “strangers”), universal healthcare, expanding food stamps, etc., would be the ones going to heaven. If you take Jesus at His word, the ones who need to be in fear of hellfire are the Republicans wanting to cut foodstamps, repeal Obamacare, build a wall, execute prisoners, and who have literally passed laws making it a crime to give thirsty people bottles of water while standing in line to vote.

So obviously you aren’t talking about fearing going to hell from a Christian perspective, so what religion says people should go to hell for helping people?

David W. Rudlin,Jan 18,Is the fact that seditious Trump can still be a presidential candidate proof that the American democracy is deeply flawed and needs to be reformed?,"You might want to get comfortable for this one.

trump’s utter lack of shame and decency have shown that a lot of things we thought were laws are actually just norms that every other president adhered to, but trump simply ignored. That needs to be cleaned up.

And his endless frivolous lawsuits intended to do nothing more than delay his inevitable conviction show that our legal system needs to be improved to protect against serial criminals with the money to delay justice.

But we the real problem is… us.

It is beyond belief that a man out on bail in four different jurisdictions, a man who had to fly back from winning the Iowa caucus to a NY courtroom where a jury will decide how much he has to pay the woman he raped, defamed, and then defamed again. It is beyond belief that the leading candidate for the Republican nomination is also the biggest single threat to our national security, a man who now admits that yes he did have “papers” he stole from the White House — despite having sworn the FBI must have planted them. It is beyond belief that Crazy Rudy owes $148 million for his job in destroying the lives of two Georgia poll workers by telling baseless lies about them, but the man he did it for — a man who spread those same lies from the biggest bully pulpit in the world — is thinking about the Oval Office and not the Poor House.

Alan Higgins,1y,Do British people know that the US is the oldest surviving democracy? Even the first French republic (1792-1804) was run by unelected dictators like Robespierre and Napoleon.,"Really? You are that ignorant?
Unbelievable.
You know nothing of these Tings.

A thing
 or ting (Old Norse
 and Icelandic
: þing; other modern Scandinavian
: ting, ding in Dutch
) was the governing assembly in Germanic
 societies, made up of the free men of the community and presided by lawspeakers
.

The thing was the assembly of the free men of a country, province or a hundred
 (hundare/härad/herred). There were consequently, hierarchies of things, so that the local things were represented at the thing for a larger area, for a province or land. At the thing, disputes were solved and political decisions were made. The place for the thing was often also the place for public religious rites and for commerce.

The thing met at regular intervals, legislated, elected chieftains
 and kings
, and judged according to the law, which was memorised and recited by the ""law speaker
"" (the judge).

The Icelandic, Faroese and Manx parliaments trace their origins back to the Viking expansion
 originating from the Petty kingdoms of Norway
 as well as Denmark, replicating Viking government systems in the conquered territories, such as those represented by the Gulating
 near Bergen in western Norway.[citation needed

Franklin Veaux,4y,What is wrong with comparing democracy to two wolves and a lamb voting on what to eat?,"It’s a quick and dirty, bumper-sticker-sized sound bite for describing the tyranny of the majority.

And it’s not wrong, exactly. In a pure democracy, the majority can and indeed sometimes has voted to tyrannize the minority. It’s a very real risk of pure democracies.

But pure democracies are as thin on the ground as snowmen in the Bahamas, at least if you’re talking about societies. I mean, my partner Zaiah and my crush sometimes vote on what they think I should do—and strangely, my vote seldom seems to carry the day—but real societies are rarely structured that way. And by “rarely,” I mean “never.”

Like all pithy sayings able to be squeezed onto a bumper sticker, it may not be precisely wrong, exactly, but that doesn’t mean it’s right.

As a shorthand for “we should take care to structure societies so that everyone’s voice is represented, at least to the best of our ability, and the 51% can’t vote willy-nilly to deprive the 49% of their basic rights,” it’s okay.

William Weir,1y,Why do Democrats support lowering the voting age to 12?,"I admit I’m always puzzled why anyone would ask random strangers this kind of question.

This is your fan-fiction, so write it however you like. And the crazier thing you can come up with, the better.

These morons still believe Hillary is selling child sex slaves out of the basement of a pizza parlor that definitely doesn’t have a basement. These people aren’t well.

So two things to keep in mind. Number one, you don’t need to give Democrats a motivation in this story, because your audience doesn’t think critically enough to care. Think about it.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,9y,"Why has India ended up as such a corrupt country, while the USA, being another democratic country, has such an organized and law-abiding government in comparison with India?","I have a detailed answer on corruption here:
How can corruption be eradicated from India?

Factors that affect corruption:


Low salaries: Poor countries are all corrupt. While it can easily argued that corruption causes poverty, the reverse is also partly true. One issue is that many of key government personnel - such as cops and clerks are paid quite low in poor countries. Police in many parts of India earn about Rs.2000/month ($30). Even honest players in such environment will be tempted to deal under the table. US and UK got rich, before they got less corrupt.
Fear of reprisals: In the US no one dares touch a cop. If a cop is killed, the entire might of US machinery will be upon the criminal. India has a fairly strong underworld and honest officers are often silenced violently. Our law & order system is not strong enough to wipe out the gangs. Before we take on corruption, we have to make sure that our honest officers don't end up like Satyendra Dubey
. That requires a strong war on gangs.

Excessive government: Our government tries to run everything from airlines to mines and hotels. Ask your parents about the time they had to bribe a government official to get a scooter, electricity connection or a telephone line. Most of these are privatized now and we no longer pay bribes to buy cars, motorcycles or phones. If everything else is equal, more government leads to more corruption.
Poor technology: In the US, almost all records are digitized and made public. You can scroll over any street and find out what is the sale price of any house (very hard to buy homes with illicit money). In India, things still run on paper. The biggest movement of blackmoney is in land dealings and we don't have the records properly digitized yet. Once you put all sale records online and interface it with Google maps, a lot of whoppers will be found out (many houses are drastically underpriced for black money movement).


Here are the home prices in my area that I could obtain in 2 seconds. If I can do this in India, a major change in black money would occur.

Alex Denethorn,Feb 4,Are Republicans truly the superior choice over Democrats when it comes to leadership?,"The problem with your question is that both groups judge by different metrics:

Democrats largely want liberal or progressive leaders who push for reform and change, and who govern according to that principle. They want widescale investment into the economy (starting with the foundations, such as infrastructure and healthcare, which support all other economic development), and they prefer a humanitarian approach to government: one which sees people as something to be valued, rather than a resource to be exploited and discarded. Thus, Democratic leaders are expected to be quietly competent, and just get on with the job. A little charisma helps (as was the case with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama), but it’s not key to the role.
Republicans seem to prefer leaders who are outwardly considered ‘strong’: forceful, assertive, sometimes aggressive, and willing to use force. These are often zero-sum thinkers who see negotiation and compromise as a victory for the other guys and a loss for them - and, since Donald Trump, this has become the go-to practice for the party as a whole, which has largely led to extreme legislative logjams in Congress. They expect their leaders to be highly conservative (with Trump being the obvious exception), and to work through demagoguery and ebullient rhetoric. They don’t necessarily have to accomplish anything: they merely need to play the part.

If I’m being blunt, what we’re seeing now is a very different expression of leadership from the two parties: President Joe Biden being quiet but effective. It’s very telling to me that Republicans continue to claim that he is “campaigning from his basement” because he isn’t engaging in the sort of Nuremburg-esque rallies that we see from Donald Trump. This is where that inherent incompatibility comes from: Republicans see strong leaders as ones who continue to get up in front of a crowd and use effusive (and inflammatory!) rhetoric. They don’t like a guy who just sits behind a desk and keeps working.

This invariably has led to a shift in US politics: with the rise of Donald Trump, a demagogue speaker who seeks to inflame the passions of the electorate (and ultimately exploits them for his own gain, as we witnessed on January 6th 2021), there’s been a clear development in what the electorate wants. Contrast him to President Barack Obama: a charismatic, intelligent and diplomatic man, a guy who most of the world still holds in high esteem…and he’s not the sort of the man that many Americans on the right-wing would deem a “strong leader”.

That being said, don’t be fooled into thinking that Trump is the future of leadership in the United States: he lost an election as an incumbent President, has seemingly lost significant support within his own party (judging by the number of Republicans who voted for someone else in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries), and who persists in alienating a large segment of the American electorate with his inflammatory language and aggressive behaviour. This is a guy almost certain to win the Republican nomination for President, but who is ultimately unlikely to win the actual election - which, that being the case, would suggest that whilst a bombastic demagogue might fire up the electorate, the majority of Americans prefer a quiet-but-strong leader in the style of President Biden. Personally, I think far more would prefer another Barack Obama - but it’s the popularity of Obama that has put Biden in such a strong position.

I would also factor in a very clear reality that most Americans have no clear understanding of what the President’s role, responsibilities and limitations are. It’s clear enough from listening to Donald Trump speak that he doesn’t either - but that’s something he plays on with the electorate, claiming all sorts of powers, capabilities and even immunities that simply aren’t applicable to the Presidency. To be quite honest, I don’t think we can really grasp as what real American leadership should look like - because it seems obvious to me that most Americans don’t know, either.

Be blunt here: US politics largely amounts to a popularity contest, one in which image is often more important than competence. You end up hiring the guy who puts on a good show rather than the one who is the most experienced or qualified for the role. That, for the moment, seems to be what embodies leadership in the United States - and, until that changes, I think your democracy will continue to remain under threat from men like Donald Trump.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/iny8vm5xcpz1ar6w', 'title': 'Are Republicans truly the superior choice over Democrats when it comes to leadership?', 'score': {'original': 0.533, 'ai': 0.467}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The problem with your question is that both groups judge by different metrics:\n\nDemocrats largely want liberal or progressive leaders who push for reform and change, and who govern according to that principle.

Mats Andersson,18h,Why do people in the United States falsely claim that China is not a democracy?,"Primarily, because China fails to fulfil most of the requirements to be called a democracy. It does, however, fulfil many of the requirements to be called a dictatorship.

This being said, most people in the USA, and generally in the West, imagine that China is a much harsher dictatorship than it actually is. For instance, by Chinese law, elections to every assembly must have 120% of the candidates required to fill all seats; the choice is very limited, especially since they all have to be pre-approved by the CPC, but there is definitely an amount of real choice there. And while keeping political prisoners is of course wrong in every way imaginable, Amnesty International recognises some 1,500 political prisoners in China – which is a lot, but you also have to realise that it corresponds to one in a million Chinese. This is not a sign of a society where every sign of dissent is ruthlessly persecuted, it is a sign of a society where you actually have to try quite hard before they start to bother about you; it is not a country where you have to watch your tongue every time you step outside, it’s a country where you have to think hard about what you publish in a newspaper with a big circulation.

Awdhesh Singh,Updated 3y,Are staged encounters by the police good or bad for democracy?,"Most people in India today appear to believe that police encounter is good because the Indian judiciary is quite slow and corrupt.

They argue that it takes decades for the courts to decide a case and often the criminals are set free due to lack of evidence, poor quality of investigation, complicated procedures and corruption in judiciary.

Hence, they compliment police when they provide instant justice by killing the alleged criminals.

However, it would be foolish to assume that people have more faith on police in India.

You can have this illusion only till you have to deal with police in real life.

If you have ever dealt police in India, you know how difficult it is to file even the First Information Report (FIR) in a police station.

The behaviour of the police official in general is extremely rude and they don’t think twice before abusing and even beating common people even in public view, though they have no power to do so under any law.

Imagine yourself to be the man on bike!

Now, if you unfortunately suffer a crime against yourself or your loved ones (murder, rape, extortion etc.) and the police fails to act in time according to law, what option you would have to get justice?

The only option which would be left to common men, when police fails, is take the law in their own hand and take the revenge of the crime.

It means that you have to kill the person whom you suspect to have committed murder, rape etc. against you or your family, and become a criminal yourself.

If that happens, the family member of that person would do likewise and the society would get into total chaos where the people would be taking revenge themselves and the streets will be filled street fights and gang wars.

When a large number of people will take law in their own hand, the police too would not be able to control them for long.

While police would protect a policemen when they commit encounters, they wont be protecting a common man if they do the same.

When the government and the government machinery (like police) itself loses trust in law and blatantly starts breaking the law in public view with impunity, they lose the moral authority to ask people to follow the law.

Morever, the same cop who kills criminals in encounter in broad day light when asked by politician, dedicate all their energies saving the heinous crimes are committed by the politicians and their relatives.

Judiciary may not be up to the mark, but still better than police since it is independent to politicians to a great extent.

A country without strong judiciary will be an autocracy and tyranny of majority.

India is today at the crossroads and Indians have to make a choice.

Do we wish to become a developed country like America, England or France by following the rule of law?, or
Do we wish to become the next Afghanistan and Syria where people have to fight their own battle to get justice in their country?

Their choice will decide the destiny of their country.

member of that person would do likewise and the society would get into total chaos where the people would be taking revenge themselves and the streets will be filled street fights and gang wars.\n\nWhen a large number of people will take law in their own hand, the police too would not be able to control them for long.\n\nWhile police would protect a policemen when they commit encounters, they wont be protecting a common man if they do the same.\n\nWhen the government and the government machinery (like police) itself loses trust in law and blatantly starts breaking the law in public view with impunity, they lose the moral authority to ask people to follow the law.\n\nMorever, the same cop who kills criminals in encounter in broad day light when asked by politician, dedicate all their energies saving the heinous crimes are committed by the politicians and their relatives.\n\nJudiciary may not be up to the mark, but still better than police since it is independent to politicians to a great extent.\n\nA country without strong judiciary will be an autocracy and tyranny of majority.\n\nIndia is today at the crossroads and Indians have to make a choice.\n\nDo we wish to become a developed country like America, England or France by following the rule of law?, or\nDo we wish to become the next Afghanistan and Syria where people have to fight their own battle to get justice in their country?\n\nTheir choice will decide the destiny of their country.\n\nSource of pictures: Google Images', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.34865

Scott Gosnell,1y,"What do you think of Zelensky's words to the US Congress ""your money is not charity, it is an investment in global security and democracy that we manage in the most responsible way""?","Whoever worked on that speech with him has spent a lot of time thinking about how Americans of every political persuasion think.

The first and most important thing that Zelensky and all of the other Ukrainian governmental representatives do is to say, “Thank You”. It is said simply and sincerely, rather than over-the-top or not at all. This is the biggest cultural mistake that other allies have made. It feels nice to be thanked and makes us want to help more.

Saying ""your money is not charity, it is an investment in global security and democracy that we manage in the most responsible way"" is a reinforcement of that Thank You that is particularly directed at the old-school conservatives in the audience, as were references to “values”, “freedom”, “children” and “family” made immediately after.

All of this makes the relationship a collaborative one among true allies and peers, not one where one partner is taking advantage of the other.

Wearing a simple army-colored sweatshirt rather than either a tailored suit & tie or a pompous, unearned military uniform also struck exactly the right note, as did bringing a battle flag signed by the defenders of Bakhmut’s front line where Zelensky had been a day before. He delivered the speech himself in his third language rather than using an interpreter. These things showed fundamental integrity, dignity, and valor.

Every word of that speech should be studied closely. It was perfectly shaped for what it needed to do.

I should also point out that it’s true. Backing Ukraine is a really, really good investment for what we’re getting, even if you don’t consider the fact that it’s the right thing to do.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2g6yirtqfw9ozd5x', 'title': 'What do you think of Zelensky\'s words to the US Congress ""your money is not charity, it is an investment in global security and democracy that we manage in the most responsible way""?', 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Whoever worked on that speech with him has spent a lot of time thinking about how Americans of every political persuasion think.\n\nThe first and most important thing that Zelensky and all of the other Ukrainian governmental representatives do is to say, “Thank You”.

Misha Firer,1y,What do the Russian citizens who are keeping their heads down or fleeing the country make of the Iranian schoolgirls who are taking off their hijabs and protesting?,"Before 24 February 2022, Russians were predators. After 24 February 2022, Russians became food for Lockheed Martin and Raythenon weapons.

Amateur clown Lyobov Grigorieva ‘Businka’ won state procurement tenders worth 156,480 rubles to perform at funerals of killed mobilised soldiers in Ulan Ude, Buryatia.

Ten red-nose performances will take place at the Archery Centre where parents of the children that train there often complain of cadaver odor. The conveyor belt of dead Buryat soldiers works 24/7.

Deputy Prime Minister of Bashkiria Azat Badranov initiated animal sacrifices in 16 mosques of the region for the well-being of volunteers and soldiers performing combat duties in the Special Military Operation in Ukraine.

“Russian Army - Army of Professionals. 0+.” Babies are welcome to apply.

According to the new federal school education program, “10th and 11th graders will learn to shoot from AK-47 and use hand-grenades F-1 and RGD-5.”

The document states that school students will study the basics of military combat, principles of motor rifle squad with infantry armored vehicles, movements during infantry combat operations.

Students are NOT going to learn about armored drones, Javelin anti-tank missiles, and HIMARS.

Mobilised reservists sleep on the floor and make bonfires to warm themselves up. They call their old Soviet infantry armored vehicles “tin cans” as the Armed Forces are pressed to buy hardware from Belarus, drones and missiles from Iran, and ammunition from North Korea.

The 2 meter tall hulks are employed by Rosgvardiya tasked with protecting the regime in big cities. They beat up demonstrators, guards government banks, and drive around in cheap Ladas all day long. They won’t be mobilized to fight in tin cans any time soon.

Legendary Crazy Dazy bar and dance floor is shut down on Sretenka, Moscow.

US flags, names and decadence are banned forever.

As Russian authorities make preparations towards many years of infantry meat-grinding combat on multiple fronts, HIV infections have hit historical maximum at 1% of the population infected.

And they too can become an effective weapon during combat.

The Wagner Group enlists HIV infected soldiers from prisons and force them to wear red wristbands.

This pilot program launched by Ministry of Defense has good chances to become a norm when drafting soldiers from the most HIV infected region of Russia (probably only because they are open about it), Ekaterinburg and whereabouts, where, according to propagandist Soloviev, “liberal scumbags” reside.

The enemy is in Kremlin. Not in Ukraine.

The liberal streak of Ekaterinburg residents is not incidental for Joseph Stalin resettled millions of Ukrainians to Urals who apparently are genetically predisposed to feel aversion towards despotic jackboot of Moscovy Empire.

The likely culprit of the fire at the Polygon cafe in Kostroma, in which 16 people died, returned from Ukraine in August. On August 22, 23-year-old Stanislav Ionkin was wounded during shelling.

For a long time, Stanislav was on sick leave and in early November he went back to the military unit to undergo a medical examination.

Last night Stanislav went to a nightclub at the Polygon cafe and set off fireworks, which led to a fire.

Misha Firer,Sep 13,Is it possible to make Russia democratic and free from dictatorship at the same time?,"Nazi swastikas on Victory Gate of Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces nicknamed War Church in Kubinka, near Moscow.

And there it is, War Church, in all its Games of Thrones glory.

The chief architect is thirty five year old Dima Smirnov who doesn’t have a diploma in architecture.

Buddhist shaman Dashi Namdakov from Buryatia is the chief sculptor of Virgin Mary and Jesus.

The ideological father of the project is Metropolitan Tikhon who studied theatre screenwriting.

The Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu initiated construction and ensured that funds would never dry up. Shoigu is a pagan from Tuva.

In summary, an architect who didn’t study architecture, a priest who studied screenwriting, a buddhist scultor and a heathen defense minister who never served in the military got togethet and built an Orthodox Christian cathedral.

If it sounds to you like the beginning of a joke, you’re absolutely right.

I’m pushing the folds apart and stepping out of iron vulva. I’m a born again Brutalsky Christian! The monument is instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with female anatomy.

Inspired by the Cathedral of Seville, the tinted arched windows hide a military museum that boasts Adolph Hitler’s hat, its most valuable exhibit, and lots of guns to reclaim Russian men’s declining masculinity.

PUSH!!

War Church features recurrent Celtic patterns and knots and other symbols.

Celtic crosses in what you want to have in Eastern Orthodox Church.

Americansky Art-Deco lampposts.

Art-deco lamppost juxtaposed with Red Army stars filled with firewoods to make barbecue meat in the Russian church courtyard. Eclectic.

Bronze bar-relief is quite a jumble. There’s Peter the Great, a medieval warrior with a Mongol saber, a tsar with a cudgel, commanders Kutusov and Suvorov, admirals, and about everyone armed to the teeth with some weapon to kill people.

I counted over a thousand weapons depicted in War Church, from a simple sword to anti-aircraft gun. The two pagans, screenwriter and fake architect planned to paint intercontinental missile Satan on the dome but ditched it under pressure from public.

Soviet soldiers with Nazi banners next to Saint George killing the dragon. Interesting that the vanquishing of the dragon has pre-Christian origins while Soviets were atheists and Nazism was a pseudo-religion.

Under the burden of detailed scenes of slaughter and piles of corpses, a saint with a halo stabs Nazi eagle with a lance and his colleague finishes him off with a sword. I would add a third figure of a Wagner mercenary peppering the birdie with bullets from a machine gun.

Machine gun Maxim , cannons, bayonets. Brave commanders from different epochs, heads raised up prepared to maim, kill, and loot. A sister of mercy appalled at barbarity looks down in horror.

In the chapel in the basement, I walked by a squadron of angels armed with lances. “Have a good fight! At ease, comrades.”

Prince Vladimir with his new Byzantine pals has forced peaceful pagans into the river to baptize them. Look at their tied hands and miserable faces! It’s like they can see into the future, what Vlad has gotten them into: from Ivan the Terrible to Uncle Stalin and Special Military Operation. Alas, they’re helpless - Vlad is on the shore about to chop the head off of anyone who bolts.

Note that when Prince Vlad was baptized by the same bearded Greek, he didn’t have to freeze his butt in the cold river and nobody stood with a sword over him.

I climbed up the stairs to the main entrance . The shaman architect depicted Jesus in a similar posture as his mom - suggestive of lewd intentions. Above, on the ceiling are criss-crossed lances and swords.

Soviet red flags with hammer and sickle. Yup, that’s what you wanna hang in a church.

A boy soldier with a sub-machine gun. Combat pilots and about everyone wields a gun.

Another child sailor with a rifle who already got a medal for his first kill. And hovering above the ruined city is Prince Vlad with a sword about to drive blasphemous communists into the Neva river to baptize the whole lot of them.

“I, Misha Firer nicknamed Brutalsky , Tsar of Easteros, son of Vlad the Jew, Ruler of Eastern Block, Collector of Lost Lands, who conquered the kingdoms of Crimea, Zaporozhie (not in full), Donetsk (not in full), Luhansk (not in full), Cherson (not in full) preside upon this Plastic Throne for Lord Shoigu stole the iron one and bless you, haloed convicts of Penitentiary Number Four to sign the contract and lay your heads for me in the trenches of not fully conquered kingdoms of Easteros!”

“Ivan, spray them with bullets! “

“Ladies, I think you’re in a wrong temple.”

“Don’t hold back, guys. We all basically just slaughter each other in this church.”

Catholic gothic stained glass windows depicting military medals and orders. Catholicism and communism intertwined seamlessly in war church.

Church shop inside the church. How awesome.

Floor is made of melted Nazi battle tanks. Faint light glowing behind winged Lucifer in golden armor. I’ve come here four times with different friends and each said that this place is absolutely evil. I suspect mass consumption of fly agaric mushrooms of people involved in its design.

Old Lady Number Cruncher,Feb 12,Should everyone vote for Joe Biden in 2024 if they want our democracy to survive?,"Absolutely.

Donald Trump has a published plan (Project 2025) to:

Use the DOJ to persecute (not just prosecute) anyone who doesn’t flatter him and submit to him. This ends equal justice for all as even a goal, and it ends the rule of law.
End the non-political role of the civil service, and multiply the number of political appointees in it by a factor of 10. This reverses the single biggest protection we have against government corruption.
End any and all restrictions on the power of a President, turning them into absolute monarchs or dictators.

You may think all of that is fine, because he’s only going to go after the people you don’t like.

Yeah, that’s been what people thought every time that a free country has slid into dictatorship. It NEVER works that way for long. Never.

This reverses the single biggest protection we have against government corruption.\nEnd any and all restrictions on the power of a President, turning them into absolute monarchs or dictators.\n\nYou may think all of that is fine, because he’s only going to go after the people you don’t like.\n\nYeah, that’s been what people thought every time that a free country has slid into dictatorship. It NEVER works that way for long. Never.\n\nHe may come after people like me first, but your turn will come.\n\nWhereas, Biden?

Andrew Cox,Updated 4y,A question to those wishing to remain in the EU - what do you actually like about it?,"I am in my early 50s and the EU (or EEC as it was) has always been there, quietly doing its job.

To be honest I cannot think of a single thing that the EU has done that I would say was a detriment to my life.

It allowed me to travel easier to Germany when I decided I wanted to make a serious attempt to learn the language having become friends with some Germans in London.

Travelling there, no problem due to Freedom of Movement. When there, there was no requirement for me to have a study Visa (unlike my non-EU classmates) nor a requirement for me to have Health Insurance (unlike them).

When I stayed for a longer period I decided to register in Germany. Simple and I was treated just like any other German. For my non-EU friends I know the system is for more complex with Visas and Rights to Remain, etc. They have to go to the Office dealing with foreigners, while I went to the Office for Germans.

Politically I think the EU is about as democratic as you can get an international organisation to be. Not as democratic as a state, sure, but it isn’t a state and I don’t want it to become a state. Some do - fine, that is their right, but I don’t see the EU evolving into a United States of Europe for decades, if ever.

But, I did get an MEP who represented my political beliefs due to the PR system of voting, unlike in Westminster where that has never been the case. I wrote to him about some issue, he wrote back, he wrote to the Commission, they wrote back, we discussed it some more. OK, I didn’t achieve a major revolution in EU politics, but he accepted my point and thought it good and may indeed have raised it with fellow MEPs.

So now I live in Germany. At the moment I am an EU Citizen in Germany, able to function as though I was German without having become German. I liked that, I was proud of that. Brexit might force me to become German (and to give up my UK Citizenship) but that wasn’t my choice, but one that is being forced upon me.

The EU works hard to make things a simple as possible for EU Citizens. Healthcare, tax, registration, penisions, driving licences, marriage, work, study, retirement, renting, buying, traveling - the list goes on and on and Brexit has highlighted for us who do live abroad just how much we took for granted as we attempt to sort out the bureaucratic mess that is our post-Brexit future. I help with a group called British in Germany[1] (part of British in Europe[2]) and we are flooded with questions from concerned Brits as we try to work out what post-Brexit might mean for us.

I have worked in Germany, I have worked for a British company while in Germany, I have worked in the Polish office of a British company while being resident in Germany. All without any fuss. OK, there was one problem, the polish zloty. Another currency to deal with, to exchange (still have some left over, going to waste), while France, Holland, Austria allowed me to use exactly the same currency as in Germany, easy, free of charge (oh yes, the EU removed cross border charges on Euro bank accounts and of course I benefited from free roaming too so I could use my contactless bank card for small purchases too). And I could easily compare prices too.

I have bought goods from Germany while in the UK, I have bought UK goods while in Germany. Again all without fuss.

I am proud that the EU managed to expand and take in 8 former Communist states without them falling into dispute between themselves. I notice the less happy outcome for states which were unable to join.

In summary, I want to be part of this club, not outside it.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,4y,"In spite of months of protest in Hong Kong, the administration did not look at internet ban as an option. Why did a democratic India opt for Internet shut down within a few days of protests?","Among the largest global powers — US, China, Russia, India — ours is the only one that doesn’t have a direct control on the Internet companies serving the populace. In all the other 3 powers, local internet companies that extensively work with the government are the ones controlling the information.

China is a nearly a closed network and Russia is nearly becoming one too. In case of US, all the major Internet companies are American and their CEOs can directly be questioned by the Senate. They also extensively cooperate with the NSA and other government organisations. Thus, US doesn’t have as big a concern immediately.

India has over a billion people and seeks to be a global power. However, the key to the power in 21st century — information — is not within the control of the Indian government. Our governments over the years have not prioritised indigenising the Indian Internet. This is a key threat to the system.

Sure, Internet shutdowns can be called as censorship, but it can also be a question of security especially when tools like WhatsApp are weaponised with fake news and become tools of lynching. Mob violence through WhatsApp has become a common occurrence: Indian WhatsApp lynchings
 and WhatsApp sets new rules amid mob killings

You don’t need to be a left or right winger to understand how stupid a lot of the content in WhatsApp groups are. In normal times, it just lowers IQ of the populace. However, in times of violence it can be a very potent weapon.

Given its inability to exert power over the Internet companies, the government resorts to localised shutdowns of the Internet when it deems the situation to be out of control.

China had been treating Hong Kong as another country and thus didn’t bring too much of its rules into HK. The city was too small to be triggering a mass revolution and thus was not a big risk. However, as the protests dragged China’s government newspaper had a new admiration for India’s method: India's internet shutdown shows normal practice for sovereign countries

It is high time India works on bifurcating Internet services into two — essential services and public Internet. Whitelisted essential services like banking, e-governance, education and ecommerce should be in first tier and should be uninterrupted regardless of violence. All other services should be regulated.

Mobs can be scary especially in a nation of 1.3 billion people. Information can move the mobs into frenzy and it would be callous of any major government not to regulate information.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wr8e1xbgcotmkjy7', 'title': 'In spite of months of protest in Hong Kong, the administration did not look at internet ban as an option.

Misha Firer,Feb 5,What are the reasons for Russia not becoming a democratic country? Is there a possibility of this changing in the future?,"Tucker Dickovich Carlson , American journalist and political commentator was spotted in the VIP central balcony of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow (tickets to Bolshoi are sold out a month in advance) reserved for heads of state corporations, oligarchs and dear friends of the Motherland.

The time stamp indicates that conservative journalist had already spent 2 hours and 19 minutes watching men in dance tights prance about the stage. Six seats in the central VIP balcony for Tucker Dickovich and his TV crew cost Russian state $15,000.

This is a very special treatment for the fired Fox News host and his crew who came to Moscow to interview Russian President Vladimir Putin.

President’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the tsar hasn’t decided if he is going to give the interview or not, and Tucker Dickovich was likewise dismissive and cryptic. He said he wants to speak with people.

Let me explain. Tucker Dickovich’s every movement is being watched by the state security, recorded and scrutinized and his hotel room is bugged.

Putin fears that Tucker Dickovich is a Trojan Horse and was sent in by the State Department and wants to ensure that the latter is not communicating with his superiors in the CIA. Putin is a paranoid KGB officer and he trusts no one.

The VIP balcony in the Bolshoi had cameras and listening devices that normally used to find out what oligarchs talk about behind president’s back. Tucker Dickovich in pursuit of sensationalist story had walked into the den of the bear.

He will take an interview with Edward Lonnievich Snowden, Russian naturalized citizen. Edward will tell his fellow Americans about the democratic government of his hosts who from March 1 will try to block all the VPN services.

Ekaterina Mizulina, head of the League of the Safe Internet called free VPNs “a portal to hell.” Although, she also noted that it is technically impossible to completely restrict access to VPNs. Perhaps Edward had assisted the league in their godly mission to battle Satan?

The Union of Journalists of the Russian Federation announced their readiness to accept Tucker Carlson into its ranks for his service to the Motherland on the condition that he pays fees on time and comply with the charter of ethics of Russian journalist.

In a nutshell, “Be frank and honest and thou shalt be punished. Lie, and thou shalt be rewarded.”

Thus spoke the chairman of the union, propagandist and genocidal host Vladimir Solovyov. Tucker Dickovich is in a good company!

To fight devil’s wickedness, an officially ordained priest of the Russian Orthodox Church was invited to bless a brick and mortar branch of online retailer Ozon (any similarities to Amazon are purely coincidental) in Moscow Oblast (in Russia, online retailer off-lines you).

The priest sprinkled holy water on furniture and floor from a golden cup using a golden brush. The priest wore a golden vest, a golden crucifix, a gold-rimmed spectacles and a golden wristwatch.

As you might have guessed his services don’t come cheap. However, if you want your business to prosper, you gotta pay for if you don’t, sanitation inspector would shut you down and taxes authorities would slap you with fines.

Treat government employees with generosity of heart and purse whatever uniform they tend to wear!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/seau7trb6gd0yxmi', 'title': 'What are the reasons for Russia not becoming a democratic country?

Ben Waggoner,Dec 31,Isn’t letting “We The People” vote on who or who cannot be on a ballot democratic?,"The Constitution already bans large numbers of people from running for President, regardless of what “We The People” want.

Kylie Jenner cannot be elected President, no matter how badly “We The People” might want her, because she is 26 and the Constitution says that the President must be 35 or older. She will become eligible in about nine years, but as of right now, she could not be President even if the entire country wanted her.

Arnold Schwarzenegger cannot be elected President, no matter how badly “We The People” might want him, because he is not a natural-born citizen of the US. He might well do an excellent job, but no matter; he will never get on the ballot.

Ronnie Jones cannot be elected President, no matter how badly “We The People” might want him, because he has lived in Italy since 1978. (He’s a blues and R&B singer.)

David Moore,Updated 7mo,Is democracy just wishful thinking?,"In a very important sense, yes it is.

Democracies can only exist in societies where, deep down, people trust each other. What a democracy means, practically, is that you agree that you will not get what you want if more people want something different.

Democracy means ‘if I lose this vote then even though I disagree with you I don’t believe you are evil’. Democracy means ‘together, we will take different approaches - but work together to solve problems that are bigger than both of us’.

In democracies we hope that, under all the bluster, our fellow citizens are not our enemies. In democracies we assume that the people of our nations care more about the country as a whole than their personal patch of it.

Is such thinking delusional? In many ways, yes. Democracy is an agreement to be a loser. It is a statement of trust in an opponent.

Hence, democracies can only be formed by rational, ethical, empathetic people. People who can work together despite not always winning.

Abhishek Soni,2y,What are two tales of democracy?,"Know this vehicle? It's pick up version of Mahindra’s famous Scorpio on sale in South Africa. It's assembled in Durban and it's a sellout according to Mahindra SA.

What does it have to do with the story of the two democracies, India and Pakistan? I'd say: EVERYTHING!

In 1945, K C Mahindra, J C Mahindra and Malik Ghulam Mohammad founded a steel trading company company called Mahindra and Mohammad. After partition, Mohammad emigrated to Pakistan and went on to become the first finance minister of Pakistan.

Mahindra and Mohammad on the other hand became Mahindra and Mahindra, and they saw an opportunity in Auto manufacturing and acquired willis licence for assembling Jeep in India. They soon also ventured into tractor manufacturing.

Meanwhile, on the other side of border, Mohammad started being regarded as one of the leading economists. He went on to become the first finance minister and then the Governor General of Pakistan. More importantly though, Ghulam Muhammad is viewed negatively by historians, criticized for “giving rise to political intrigue, undermining civilian control of the military by declaring martial law, and devaluing nascent democratic norms by sacking parliament"".

Ghulam Mohammad left behind a legacy of stealing from pakistan the opportunity to become a proper democracy. His early misadventures reflect in the nature of how things are handled in the power galleries of Islamabad, even today.

On the other hand, Mahindra today owns Ssangyong, Pininfarina, Peugeot two wheelers along with several other multinational companies selling their products in all continents but Antarctica with a total assets of 23 billion US dollars.
