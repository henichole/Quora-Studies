Ben Waggoner,5y,What are some words that don’t rhyme with anything?,"“Silver”, “penguin,” and “month” are said to have no rhymes, although you can rhyme them if you cheat:

To find a rhyme for silver
Or any rhymeless rhyme
Requires only will, ver-
bosity, and time.
—Stephen Sondheim

How many weeks in a month?
Four, as the swift moon runn’th.
—Christina Rossetti

A woman asked me to rhyme penguin.
I said, “Does the erstwhile Emperor Eng win?
If not, I’ll send a brand-new tractor
To “Big Boy” Williams, cinemactor;
On the card attached, a smiling penguin
Will say, “You’re truly a man among men, Guinn.”
“All right,” she said, “so now rhyme silver,”
But I left because I’d had my filver.
–Ira Levin

[Note: Guinn Terrell “Big Boy” Williams (1899–1962) was an actor in many Western movies; “cinemactor” is a portmanteau of “cinema actor”, in case that wasn’t obvious. “Filver” = “fill of her.” Get it?]","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b0ds45kgtulz16ci', 'title': 'What are some words that don’t rhyme with anything?', 'score': {'original': 0.9948, 'ai': 0.0052}, 'blocks': [{'text': '“Silver”, “penguin,” and “month” are said to have no rhymes, although you can rhyme them if you cheat:\n\nTo find a rhyme for silver\nOr any rhymeless rhyme\nRequires only will, ver-\nbosity, and time.\n—Stephen Sondheim\n\nHow many weeks in a month?\nFour, as the swift moon runn’th.\n—Christina Rossetti\n\nA woman asked me to rhyme penguin.\nI said, “Does the erstwhile Emperor Eng win?\nIf not, I’ll send a brand-new tractor\nTo “Big Boy” Williams, cinemactor;\nOn the card attached, a smiling penguin\nWill say, “You’re truly a man among men, Guinn.”\n“All right,” she said, “so now rhyme silver,”\nBut I left because I’d had my filver.\n–Ira Levin\n\n[Note: Guinn Terrell “Big Boy” Williams (1899–1962) was an actor in many Western movies; “cinemactor” is a portmanteau of “cinema actor”, in case that wasn’t obvious. “Filver” = “fill of her.” Get it?]', 'result': {'fake': 0.0052, 'real': 0.9948}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1992719, 'subscription': 0, 'content': '“Silver”, “penguin,” and “month” are said to have no rhymes, although you can rhyme them if you cheat:\n\nTo find a rhyme for silver\nOr any rhymeless rhyme\nRequires only will, ver-\nbosity, and time.\n—Stephen Sondheim\n\nHow many weeks in a month?\nFour, as the swift moon runn’th.\n—Christina Rossetti\n\nA woman asked me to rhyme penguin.\nI said, “Does the erstwhile Emperor Eng win?\nIf not, I’ll send a brand-new tractor\nTo “Big Boy” Williams, cinemactor;\nOn the card attached, a smiling penguin\nWill say, “You’re truly a man among men, Guinn.”\n“All right,” she said, “so now rhyme silver,”\nBut I left because I’d had my filver.\n–Ira Levin\n\n[Note: Guinn Terrell “Big Boy” Williams (1899–1962) was an actor in many Western movies; “cinemactor” is a portmanteau of “cinema actor”, in case that wasn’t obvious. “Filver” = “fill of her.” Get it?]', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9948

Ernest W. Adams,Updated 1y,What does the nursery rhyme “London Bridge is falling down” mean?,"London Bridge has been rebuilt many times.

Joshua Engel,9y,What's behind the absence of making words rhyme in a lot of modern English poetry? Why are French and Spanish poems rhyme more? What is the history of free verse poetry?,"It's because English eliminated its case endings.

Romance languages rhyme a lot because a lot of words end in a limited range of sounds. Just to grab a random example, from Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac:

Touche !
Trèfle !
Un baiser !
On voit !. . .
Pas de danger !
Lorsqu'on vient en avance, on est bien pour manger.



""Danger"" and ""manger"" end the way thousands of verbs do in French, with ""-er"". It's the most common class of French verbs. Rhyming is easy. Spanish uses the same three verbal endings. Nouns are even easier: practically everything ends in a gendered ""o"" or ""a"" in all of the Romance languages.

It's so easy that double rhymes are hardly interesting. In Italian, Dante use terza rima, which requires three rhymes:

Giustizia mosse il mio alto fattore;
fecemi la divina podestate,
la somma sapïenza e ’l primo amore.

Dinanzi a me non fuor cose create
se non etterne, e io etterno duro.
Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate’.


Podestate-create-intrate... (and in fact he's kinda fudging on ""podestate"", which is no longer used in modern Italian)... these would rhyme less effectively without the pronounced final ""e"". English, in fact, used to have one of those, but we dropped it, perhaps because early English poetry used alliterative rather than rhymed verse, though more likely because everybody just got peeved at having a superfluous syllable that doesn't contribute more than making everything rhyme.

English stopped doing alliterative verse around the time that it was so heavily influenced by French, though I personally have a fondness for it:

Where now are the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?
Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?
Where is the harp on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?
Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?



That particular poem skillfully blends alliterative and rhymed verse, and is based on an Old English poem, The Wanderer:

Hwær cwom mearg? Hwær cwom mago?
Hwær cwom maþþumgyfa?
Hwær cwom symbla gesetu?
Hwær sindon seledreamas?





Where is the horse? Where is the rider?
Where is the gift-giver?
Where are the feast-seats?
Where are the hall-revels?



Pretty damn fine stuff, even in my ham-handed translation. The adaptation above is by one of the greatest poets of 20th century English, playing in to both traditions, and it shows just how much English is capable of, without having to devolve into free verse. (Free verse doesn't have to suck, but it usually does, because too many poets have lost the feel for the flow of language. The greatest poets of this generation are sadly wasting their skills in braggadocio, but there is some genuinely fine hip-hop and rap out there that remember the power of English.)","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/em7fw06nzsl2tip5', 'title': ""What's behind the absence of making words rhyme in a lot of modern English poetry?

David Gouldstone,2y,"What word or short phrase rhymes with ""chimney""?","The definition of a rhyme is that the last stressed vowel sound, and all subsequent sounds, are identical.

There is no single word rhyme for ‘chimney’ (and thus the two previous answers are wrong, though some of Steve White’s suggestions are near rhymes, such as thinly and dimly, and would be close enough for many purposes).

To find a true rhyme for chimney you have to look at phrases, such as dim knee, skim knee or gym knee (maybe that last one is something like tennis elbow?).

Who once put his leg up a chimney.

Veronique Helmridge-Marsillian,3y,Why are there so many dark nursery rhymes?,"Censorship—when you are not allowed to call out the ruling class, you have to call it out through “nonsense” rhymes.
And these have survived as little songs or poems told to children.

See here, this is how you were treated in England in 1569 (under Queen Elizabeth I) if you had no job, no food, no shoes, and your clothes full of holes.[1]
Anyone who objects to his taxes going on welfare should have a good look.

A nobleman is tossing a coin at a beggar. The beggar stinks—he makes the nobleman feel bad—so the nobleman turns his nose and eyes away as he hurries past.
The nobleman does not know whether, round the back of the house, the beggar’s mates are not about to ambush him and his purse… so he clutches the pommel of his sword.
(This is an engraving from a drawing, so the image, hence the action, is reversed.)

Okay, now you have now seen a real beggar.
But there were other beggars—the ruling class itself.
Did you notice how the beggar and nobleman looked similar?

What kind of begging did the ruling class do?
Well, 50 years later (under King James I), they would tell Parliament to tell the King to tell the middle and lower classes to pay taxes!
Import duties, export duties, taxes on livestock and produce, you name it, the lower classes paid it.
As a result of which, the top noblemen looked like this.[2]

George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, painted by Rubens, 1625.

The Duke of Buckingham was one of King James’s “favourites”—I say, favourites—all beautiful youths—there were many of them,
and they poured into England from Scotland when Scottish James took the throne in 1603.[3]

Obviously, you weren’t allowed to say anything. Especially if you were lower class.
So you wrote a song:

Hark, hark, the dogs do bark,
Beggars are coming to town.
Some in rags,
Some in jags,
And some in velvet gowns.

(A “jag” is a jagged cut in a velvet surcoat, revealing the fine lawn shirt beneath.)

If you were really bold, you might even sing this song—loudly, raucously, mockingly—as some Duke or Count or Marquess swept past you in the street.

And, because rich beggars have continued until the present day,
so has this rhyme.

Ram Rasik,Oct 1,What are some other mantras that rhyme with “Ram”?,"सीतानाथ समारम्भां रामानन्दार्य मध्यमाम्।
अस्मदाचार्य पर्यन्तां वन्दे श्रीगुरू परम्पराम् ।।

This is a very interesting question!

One very famous incident mentioned in Srimad Varaha Purān and also mentioned by Srimad Goswami Tulsidas Ji; In Varaha Purān it is said:

दैवाच्छूकरशावकेन निहतो म्लेच्छो जराजर्जरोहारामेण हतोऽस्मि भूमिपतितो जल्पंस्तनुं त्यक्तवान्।
तीर्णोगोष्पदवद्भवार्णवमहो नाम्नः प्रभावादहोकिं चित्रं यदि रामनाम रसिकास्ते यान्ति रामास्पदम् ॥

अर्थ: “दैवात् शूकर-शावक के द्वारा जरा-जर्जरित एक म्लेच्छ मारा गया। 'हराम के द्वारा मैं मारा गया– कहते हुए वह भूतलपर गिरकर पञ्चत्वको प्राप्त हुआ । आश्चर्यकी बात है कि 'हराम' शब्दके अन्तर्गत 'राम' नामके प्रभाव से वह भी गोष्पद के समान इस भयानक भवसागरके पार चला गया । तो फिर यदि रामनामके रसिक राम के परमपद को प्राप्त करें तो इसमें आश्चर्य ही क्या है |""

“A Mleccha was killed by a divine boar, that Mleccha while falling on ground says, “Haram has killed me” and dissolved in pancha tattva. This is very surprising that The word ""Haram"" encompasses the influence of the name ""Ram”, he has crossed over this dreadful worldly ocean like a cow's footsteps. So, if Rasik devotees of the name ""Ram” attain the ultimate Lord Rama, what marvel is in that !”

(-Srimad Varaha Purān, excerpted from Gita Press Kalyan Patrika, May 1972 Page No. 889)

And same incidence is also captured by Goswami Tulsidas Ji:

(-Sri Tulsidas Kavitavali Pada 76)

And even Maharishi Valmiki by chanting ‘Mara Mara Mara’ attained Sri Ram; So chant any in anyway, the final destination you will reach will be of Sri Ram. As Ramayana Bālkand says:

भायँ कुभायँ अनख आलस हूँ। नाम जपत मंगल दिसि दसहूँ॥

“अच्छे भाव (प्रेम) से, बुरे भाव (बैर) से, क्रोध से या आलस्य से, किसी तरह से भी राम नाम जपने से दसों दिशाओं में कल्याण होता है।”

“Chanting the name of Rama in a loving manner, in anger, in envy, or even with laziness, brings auspiciousness in all directions.”

(-Rāmāyaṇa Bālkand)

Vijaya Lakshmi,5y,"What is the meaning of ""sambar kotti"" in the Telugu rhyme “dagudu moothalu”?","After reading the question I watched the video on YouTube.

This is sung while playing ‘hide and seek’

It is not ‘sambar kotti’. It is ‘Sambar Buddi’—సాంబార్ బుడ్డి

Buddi —బుడ్డి means a round flask or some round container.

For example ‘ink buddi’ means ink bottle (they are usually round).

Sambar buddi means a round container in which sambar (a soup made with lentils in India) is stored.

“ఎక్కడి దొంగలు అక్కడే —Ekkadi dongalu akkade —means “Oh thieves, stay(hide) wherever you are”.

The phrase ‘sambar buddi’ is totally irrelevant here.

In our childhood when we played hide and seek there was no phrase “Sambar buddi” in the lyrics.

This seems to be a recent addition to the original lyrics to match rhythm.

These are original lyrics:

Meaning: Let us play hide and seek.

when a cat comes all the rats hide.

Oh, thieves stay hidden wherever you are.

Joshua Parin,3y,"Would you rather have to permanently speak in rhyme, or not hear every third word spoken?","Those are some pretty big requirements.

On one hand I forever speak in a rhythm.

Forced to speak words with other words that fit them.

Forever incapable of not speaking in melody.

Forced to let poems and songs carry me.

I’m not even that far in and it’s getting annoying.

Well at least I’m not singing which would be very boring.

For those who don’t like what I have to say.

Shut up, I didn’t ask you I’ll do it anyway.

And shut your lips I know I’m not well equipped

With the verbal ability or agility to speak with gracility.

So my rhymes aren’t fine and are filled with futility.

So now I’ll sit because I don’t know if this is a hit or miss.

Honestly now I’m tired,

Maybe it’s time I retire.

Although there’s a lack of fire.

Somehow I still managed to freaking perspire.

Now that would be annoying because some words don’t rhyme.

Like what if I needed one of these:

And my life depended on it.

Although this may seem annoying it’s a lot better compared to our other choice.

This other really sucks. Case you couldn’t, it’s to hear every word spoken I’m going show you that would like. Now I the same from earlier commenting, “BuT iSn’t bEinG.” But really, cares?

In any, I would miss out on which would at all good. I’m starting reconsider typing this, actually can just normally now delete the word. I’m to erase of this do that.

It would to hear have to say: “I’m breaking with you.”

Nick Nicholas,1y,"Is there a linguistic reason “orange” doesn’t rhyme with ""range,"" ""strange,"" ""arrange,"" etc.?","Everyone that has answered this question to date:

… Really?

This is a very very good question, and it deserves an answer, and you haven’t had one yet, OP. Let’s expand the question out.

Words like range, strange, change, arrange, exchange, derange, came into Middle English from French. They have long ā, and when they are multiple syllables, they are accented on the final syllable.

Orange came into Middle English from French as well (although ultimately it is Dravidian). Orange and échange and étrange all rhyme in French, and are accented in the same place. Yet in English, orange is accented on the initial syllable, not the last, and the -a- is short, not long. In fact, orange is notorious for having no true rhyme in English, but for forced arrangements such as

The four eng-
ineers
wore orange
brassieres.

Why is orange /ˈɔɹəndʒ/, and not /ɔˈreɪndʒ/, to rhyme with arrange?

In late Old English, vowels lengthened before a nasal followed by a homorganic stop: nd, mb, ng. So lāmb and lāng and sēndan used to have long vowels. And if they kept them, we’d now say lambe, lowng, seend.

We don’t: they got shortened during Middle English again, though that varied by context; so for a ~ o, we got back to short vowels in Chaucer, except for mb: hond, lond, stondon (hand, land, stand), but lōmb, wōmb (lamb, womb). -ong, -ang regularly became short: lāng become long; hongen; strong; thong; wrong.

And none of this is relevant to French words. So what happened with French words in English?

I noted first that ā and ō converged in Old English: that was before French words came into English, so their long a’s stayed as a’s: cāve, damāge, dāme.

a before mb, nd, nt, ng, nc developed into aw, and then the w was dropped (except before -nd, nt), leaving the a long: angel (“Ann gel”) > aungel (“ow!-ngel”) > āngel (“ah!-ngel”), but (t)ante > aunte (“ow!-nt”) > aunt. For that matter, brānche used to have a long a. In the north and west in the 15th century, those -aung- and -aunch- even ended up pronounced in the modern way: straynge, chaynge, braynche. (Elsewhere, that “ay” for long a had to wait until the 18th century to develop.)

Jespersen (A Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles) §3.991 argues that the switch of -aun- to -ān- in Middle English is not just a matter of phonetic context, but also of the fact that -aun- was specifically Anglo-French, and the -ān- reflects reborrowing back of the same words from France French.

In any case, yes, arrange is a normal development, and we’ve seen how we got from the French pronunciation of arrange to the Modern English pronunciation. That still doesn’t tell us why orange did not follow the same path.

The distinction is in fact because of stress.

(Yes, others have already said it, but they haven’t set up the pathway for why that matters here.)

If the -ange stayed stressed, like it was in French, then the -a- stayed long. If the -ange was unstressed, it also ended up shortened, because that’s what English does after stress (cf. American and British pronunciations of the later loan from French garage: American “garahzh”, British “garridge”)

So Jespersen §3.37 says:

“Stressed in English, not in French: danger, manger, stranger, to which must be added ancient. Stressed in French, not in English: orange, now [ɔrin(d)ʒ], transcribed by S 1547 in the pl. oreintsys.”

So English moves the accent back, in danger, manger, stranger, ancient, orange, but not arrange, exchange. The criterion on whether the accent moves back or not is somewhat random, because it constitutes a nativisation, an assimilation of French words to English accentuation. But as it turns out, “S 1547”, i.e. William Salesbury’s
 1547 Welsh–English dictionary, p. xiv, transcribes oranges into Welsh as “oreintsys” (“oranges, oreintsys, afale orayds”: Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru
);

That means a long a was used in oranges, and it suggests that orange did used to rhyme with arrange.

My guess is going to be that, at some stage after 1547, people felt orange was a familiar, prosaic, commonplace enough word, that they stressed it like an English word instead of like a French word—unlike the more formal, legalistic verbs exchange, arrange.

Pekk Lau,1y,Are dogs called dogs because when they bark they sound like “OG pog” and dog rhymes with og pog?,"The sound of a dogs bark is very different from breed to breed and even from dog to dog. Mine resembles several wows and one more like warg.

Today, the most popular theory is that “dog” is derived from another Old Germanic word – “docga” (dogga).

So, one reason to replace “hound” with “dog” would be that in the Middle Ages in England, powerful hunting and fighting dogs were the most common types of dogs – fluffy toy dogs were still not that popular!

Another possible theory suggests that the popularity of hounds led to people wanting to distinguish them from other canines, and thus the collective name for canine breeds became “dog”, while the hounds kept their designated name.

Still, the origins of the word “dog” remain rather misty, and it is still a mystery why the word became so popular – later on it would appear in the Netherlands (dog), Germany (Dogge), Sweden (dogg), France (dogue), Spain (dogo), and so on.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/lvu8ei5sgo6nxkcf', 'title': 'Are dogs called dogs because when they bark they sound like “OG pog” and dog rhymes with og pog?', 'score': {'original': 0.9904, 'ai': 0.0096}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The sound of a dogs bark is very different from breed to breed and even from dog to dog.

Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,5y,Does the recitations of Sanskrit slokas or rhymes in Indian schools and colleges violate the principle of secularism? Should they be banned?,"No. Let the rhymes and shlokas be selected with due consideration for the religious beliefs or atheist beliefs of all.

Just examine this.

ॐ सह नाववतु।

सह नौ भुनक्तु।

सह वीर्यं करवावहै।

तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु

मा विद्विषावहै।

ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

Om, May we all be protected

May we all be nourished

May we work together with great energy

May our intellect be sharpened (may our study be effective)

Let there be no Animosity amongst us

Om, peace (in me), peace (in nature), peace (in divine forces)

What is there in the above to upset secularists, atheists, communists?

Let those who don’t want to utter the above words keep quiet while others who are willing recite this.

For eleven years, I studied in a school run by Catholic Missionaries and recited every single day the following prayer.

Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Name,
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

Amen.

We never screamed and protested that these missionaries were converting us to Christianity.

This is a needless controversy.

Thepoetryofjp,1y,"What inspired popular nursery rhymes like ""London Bridge is falling down""?","These nursery rhymes, London Bridge’s, Ring Around the Rosie, and most other nursery rhymes of the period are part of a history contained in side of nursery rhymes. The poets/ societies that created these lyrics somehow collectively decided that nursery rhymes were a good place to put the realities that they saw in the world around them.

Period nursery rhymes are often found to be disturbing by the informed modern mind. Not all of these nursery rhymes dealt with the same subject matter, but a lot of these did carry messages. London Bridge and Ring Around the Rosie are both songs of societal collapse. Their inspiration was clearly from the societal realities that surrounded the people of the time. London Bridge, as it is referred to in the lyric, is not referring to an event. It is, however, referring to the fact that London Bridge keep falling down by means of time and natural/ human events and that we keep building it back up again.

The versions starting with sticks and stones being common during the Late Middle Ages. Here we see starting with lowly sticks to build, and that we are building it back being addressed to someone who is referred to with an honorific making it clear who we rebuild for. With each new sequence the quality of the materials improve but the bridge still falls down, only to have to be built back again. Finally we arrive at steel as a building material. Yet, it still falls down. The bridge is built back with gold and silver this time, but that was not a good idea because it gets stolen. Then a man is set to watch the bridge to make sure it does not get stolen, and asks ‘suppose a man were to fall asleep’ while watching. The lyric does not answer the consequences of such a thing, but he asks for a pipe to smoke all night to keep him up.

Ultimate the best we build our societies is not good enough. They all fall down. Like the children in Ring Around the Rosie everything is dying and no material will stop that. Throw all the money you have at it and it will still collapse and the best we can do is watch a smoke a pipe to try to prevent it.

Nigel Lusby,Updated 1y,What does “Berk” mean in Cockney rhyming slang?,"It’s not “Burke”, it’s “Berk”. & that comes from the “Berkeley Hunt” - (which is actually pronounced “Barclay Hunt”, but the cockneys of east London didn’t understand that), so when they “coined” a new rhyming slang word…..

…..Oh dear, you don’t understand cockney rhyming slang….!

Rhyming slang was a simple way of speaking in code - let's be honest, it was intended to confuse the average beat policeman (or customs officer - the eastenders often were dock workers) - (not that it would work if the copper were also cockney)

a couplet of (almost random) words that rhyme with the “hidden” word

“apples & pears” = “stairs”

“whistle & flute” = “suit”

then you “drop” the word that actually rhymes- “pears”, “flute”.

so you end up with:

Apples = stairs

Whistle = suit

“that geezer with the whistle just went down (actually “daan”) the apples”!

translation: the chap in the suit went downstairs!

Cockneys have an instinct for this, & can create a new slang on the spot, & the others around them will know exactly what they mean…..

anyway - the Victorian age came along and any profane or blasphemous language became seriously “bad form”, so much so that even as a child in the 1970s I remember being severely admonished for using words such as: bloody or even blimey (which I now realise is a corruption of “God blind me”).

…..meanwhile, the Victorians/Edwardians were also fighting umpteen wars:

Crimea (maybe about to repeat that one!)
Boer (South Africa)
WW1
WW2

Troops were not allowed to be profane & definitely not insult senior ranks….

but the cockneys got around this….

Berkeley Hunt = C*nt

Berkeley was shortened to Berk…… & a seriously rude insult became so “innocent” that even refined ladies would come to use it as a mild rebuke to someone being silly……

“oh you are a berk”!

But the Cockneys always knew what they REALLY meant!

Katja Kaila,4y,Does poetry in other languages rhyme the same way poems in English rhyme?,"In Finnish, the traditional poetry follows quite complicated rules called the Kalevala meter.

The first thing that Finnish children learn about the meter is alliteration. Many people in Finland are in the belief that alliteration, in addition to eight syllables per line, is the only thing you need to know for your poem to sound like the ones of the Kalevala.

But it is much more complex than that.

The Kalevala meter is a trochaic tetrameter. In each verse, there are four feet, each of which consists of two syllables. Sometimes, the first foot can also consist of three syllables, but the others can’t. The stress is always on the first syllable of the foot (in other words, the rising foot). That’s what makes it trochaic.

Quite exceptionally for Finnish, however, the stress doesn’t need to follow the real stress pattern of Finnish; the Kalevala is a universe of its own, in this sense.

Let me illustrate this with a fragment of the Kalevala. (I will quote it in a bit unorthodox way, leaving out some lines and repeating others, since I once wrote a song based on this text. The Kalevala is a compilation of oral poetry, so I think we are allowed to be a bit flexible with these things.)

Heitän suoni, heitän maani,
heitän heinikkopihani,
heitän valkeat veteni,
heitän hiekkarantaseni.
Heitän suot sorehtijoille,
maat heitän maleksijoille,
lepikot lepeäjille,
kanervikot kaahlaajille,
aitavieret astujille,
kujavarret kulkijoille,
pihat pitkin juoksijoille,
seinävieret seisojille.

Pellot heitän peuran juosta,
salot ilveksen samota,
ahot hanhien asua,
lehot lintujen levätä.
Lähen tästä kuin lähenki,
toisen lähtijän keralla,
sykysyisen yön sylihin,
kevä’isen kierän päälle,
jottei jälki jäällä tunnu,
jalan isku iljangolla,
hangella hamosen toimi,
helman hiepsintä lumella.

Jätän kaikki terveheksi:
maat ja metsät marjoinensa,
kujavieret kukkinensa,
kankahat kanervinensa,
järvet sa’oin saarinensa,
syvät salmet siikoinensa,
hyvät kummut kuusinensa,
korpinotkot koivuinensa.
Heitän hiekkarantaseni,
heitän valkeat veteni,
heitän heinikkopihani,
heitän suoni, heitän maani.

(The Kalevala, Rune XXIV)

And this is what it sounds like: Heitän suoni, heitän maani

English translation by Keith Bosley:

I leave my swamps, I leave my lands
leave my grassy yards
leave my white waters
leave my sandy shores
I leave the swamps to squelchers
the lands I leave to laggards
and the alders to idlers
and the heather to strollers
the fence sides to those who step
lane-edges to those who walk
yards to those who run along
the wall sides to those who stand.

Fields I leave for the reindeer to run
backwoods for the lynx to roam
the glades for the geese to dwell
the groves for the birds to rest.
I am really leaving here
with another who’s leaving
for an autumn night’s embrace
for a sheet of ice in spring
so there’s no track on the ice
no footprint on the surface
on the crust no skirt’s pattern
no hem’s brush-mark on the snow.

I bid all farewell —
lands, forests with their berries
lane sides with their flowers
heaths with their heather
lakes with their hundreds of isles
the deep straits with their whitefish
the good mounds with their spruces
the wild dells with their birches.
I leave my sandy shores
leave my white waters
leave my grassy yards
leave my swamps, leave my lands.

The most important rule concerns the placement of long and short syllables:

If the first syllable of a word coincides with a rising foot, it must be long (i.e. ending in a consonant, diphthong, or a long vowel).
Only in the first foot, the aforementioned rule may be discarded.
If the first syllable of a word coincides with a falling foot, it must be short (i.e. ending in a short vowel).

For example:

Pellot heitän peuran juosta,
salot ilveksen samota

As you can see, the syllables pel-, hei-, peu-, juos-, and il- are all long syllables, and they are placed on rising feet. The first syllalbe of the word salot, sa-, is an exception, since it begins the line — the only position in which a short first syllable can coincide with a rising foot. And the other word that begins with a short syllable, samota, is placed in a way that allows the first syllable to coincide with a falling foot instead.

Perfect.

As to monosyllabic words, they can be placed anywhere, except for the last foot:

Lähen tästä kuin lähenki,
toisen lähtijän keralla,
sykysyisen yön sylihin,
kevä’isen kierän päälle

The words kuin and yön are both placed on rising feet.

There are also rules concerning the placement of long words.

A word that consists of four syllables cannot be placed on the second and the third foot — unless it is a compound, in which case this rule may be discarded.

Oh, and the last syllable of the line can’t be a monosyllabic word. Neither can it be a syllable ending in a long vowel. (That has caused me quite a lot of challenges, since in Finnish there are many words that end in a long vowel.)

Then there is also alliteration that I already mentioned in the beginning of this answer.

Usually alliteration tends to tie the words of one line only. If the alliteration is strong, at least two words begin with the same vowel or with the same combination of a consonant and a vowel. (My name, Katja Kaila, would be an example of strong alliteration.)

Alliteration is weak when at least two words in a line begin with the same consonant (followed by different vowels) or with different vowels.

An example of strong alliteration:

lepikot lepeäjille,
kanervikot kaahlaajille,
aitavieret astujille,
kujavarret kulkijoille

And of weak alliteration:

heitän valkeat veteni,
heitän hiekkarantaseni

Not all lines need to have alliteration at all, and usually it only concerns two words.

Another stylistic device is repetition. That’s crucially important in the Kalevala meter.

While traditional Finnish poetry doesn’t care about rhyme, rhyming poetry was written roughly since the 19th century until the 1950s.

To give you an example, I will quote Eino Leino again, this time his poem Minust’ oli kuin olisi soudettu.

Minust’ oli kuin olisi soudettu
me kirkasta järven pintaa
ja aurinko aaltoja lämmittänyt
ja rantakallion rintaa.

Oli niinkuin oisi me laskettu
sen kallion kaunihin alle
ja kaahlattu hietaa valkeaa
ja kuljettu kukkulalle.

Ja eikö aurinko laskenut
taa saarien, salmensuiden,
ja tullut ilta ja tullut yö
yli laaksojen, laulupuiden?

Ylt’ ympäri tanhusi terhenet yön,
utu ulapan aalloilla sousi,
unen vallassa laaksojen lammet ui –
ja uni se nousi ja nousi.

Se heilahti oksalta oksalle,
se kukasta kukkahan kiipi –
me seisoimme vuorella käsikkäin
ja katsoimme, kuinka se hiipi.

Oi, lyhyt on Suomessa suvinen yö!
Pian aurinko aalloista nousi.
Mut siitä asti mun aatoksein
yhä unten aaltoja sousi.

(Eino Leino)

And here I’m reading it: Minust’ oli kuin olisi soudettu

English translation — unfortunately not by Keith Bosley this time, but by yours truly:

It was as if we were rowing
the bright surface of a lake
and as if the sun had warmed the waves
and the chest of a cliff.

It was as if we had disembarked
at the foot of that beautiful cliff
and waded through the white sand
and climbed to the hill.

And didn’t the sun set
behind the islands and the straits,
and didn’t the evening come and the night fall
over the valleys and the trees full of birdsong?

All around us, the mist elves were dancing,
haze sailed over the waves,
the ponds of the valleys were swimming in sleep —
and dream was rising and rising.

It swang from branch to branch,
it crept from flower to flower —
we stood on the hill, hand in hand,
watching as it glided.

O, short is the summer night in Finland!
Soon the sun rose from the waves.
But since then, my thoughts
have been rowing the waves of dream.

This rhyme pattern is quite typical for a Finnish poem. Every second line rhymes with every fourth, and the first and the third line are independent.

There are naturally poems in which all lines rhyme, but it is not considered a violation of the rhyme even if they don’t.

Nowadays very few poets write rhyming poetry, but in songwriting rhyme lives on.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/d0ujsg9czxypri4e', 'title': 'Does poetry in other languages rhyme the same way poems in English rhyme?', 'score': {'original': 0.99043333333333, 'ai': 0.0095666666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In Finnish, the traditional poetry follows quite complicated rules called the Kalevala meter.\n\nThe first thing that Finnish children learn about the meter is alliteration.

Neither can it be a syllable ending in a long vowel. (That has caused me quite a lot of challenges, since in Finnish there are many words that end in a long vowel.)\n\nThen there is also alliteration that I already mentioned in the beginning of this answer.\n\nUsually alliteration tends to tie the words of one line only. If the alliteration is strong, at least two words begin with the same vowel or with the same combination of a consonant and a vowel. (My name, Katja Kaila, would be an example of strong alliteration.)\n\nAlliteration is weak when at least two words in a line begin with the same consonant (followed by different vowels) or with different vowels.\n\nAn example of strong alliteration:\n\nlepikot lepeäjille,\nkanervikot kaahlaajille,\naitavieret astujille,\nkujavarret kulkijoille\n\nAnd of weak alliteration:\n\nheitän valkeat veteni,\nheitän hiekkarantaseni\n\nNot all lines need to have alliteration at all, and usually it only concerns two words.\n\nAnother stylistic device is repetition. That’s crucially important in the Kalevala meter.\n\nWhile traditional Finnish poetry doesn’t care about rhyme, rhyming poetry was written roughly since the 19th century until the 1950s.\n\nTo give you an example, I will quote Eino Leino again, this time his poem Minust’ oli kuin olisi soudettu.\n\nMinust’ oli kuin olisi soudettu\nme kirkasta järven pintaa\nja aurinko aaltoja lämmittänyt\nja rantakallion rintaa.\n\nOli niinkuin oisi me laskettu\nsen kallion kaunihin alle\nja kaahlattu hietaa valkeaa\nja kuljettu kukkulalle.\n\nJa eikö aurinko laskenut\ntaa saarien, salmensuiden,\nja tullut ilta ja tullut yö\nyli laaksojen, laulupuiden?\n\nYlt’ ympäri tanhusi terhenet yön,\nutu ulapan aalloilla sousi,\nunen vallassa laaksojen lammet ui –\nja uni se nousi ja nousi.\n\nSe heilahti oksalta oksalle,\nse kukasta kukkahan kiipi –\nme seisoimme vuorella käsikkäin\nja katsoimme, kuinka se hiipi.\n\nOi, lyhyt on Suomessa suvinen yö!\nPian aurinko aalloista nousi.\nMut siitä asti mun aatoksein\nyhä unten aaltoja sousi.\n\n(Eino Leino)\n\nAnd here I’m reading it: Minust’ oli kuin olisi soudettu\n\nEnglish translation — unfortunately not by Keith Bosley this time, but by yours truly:\n\nIt was as if we were rowing\nthe bright surface of a lake\nand as if the sun had warmed the waves\nand the chest of a cliff.\n\nIt was as if we had disembarked\nat the', 'result': {'fake': 0.0481, 'real': 0.9519}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'foot of that beautiful cliff\nand waded through the white sand\nand climbed to the hill.\n\nAnd didn’t the sun set\nbehind the islands and the straits,\nand didn’t the evening come and the night fall\nover the valleys and the trees full of birdsong?\n\nAll around us, the mist elves were dancing,\nhaze sailed over the waves,\nthe ponds of the valleys were swimming in sleep —\nand dream was rising and rising.\n\nIt swang from branch to branch,\nit crept from flower to flower —\nwe stood on the hill, hand in hand,\nwatching as it glided.\n\nO, short is the summer night in Finland!\nSoon the sun rose from the waves.\nBut since then, my thoughts\nhave been rowing the waves of dream.\n\nThis rhyme pattern is quite typical for a Finnish poem. Every second line rhymes with every fourth, and the first and the third line are independent.\n\nThere are naturally poems in which all lines rhyme, but it is not considered a violation of the rhyme even if they don’t.\n\nNowadays very few poets write rhyming poetry, but in songwriting rhyme lives on.', 'result': {'fake': 0.0039, 'real': 0.9961}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 15, 'credits': 1992631, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'In Finnish, the traditional poetry follows quite complicated rules called the Kalevala meter.\n\nThe first thing that Finnish children learn about the meter is alliteration. Many people in Finland are in the belief that alliteration, in addition to eight syllables per line, is the only thing you need to know for your poem to sound like the ones of the Kalevala.\n\nBut it is much more complex than that.\n\nThe Kalevala meter is a trochaic tetrameter. In each verse, there are four feet, each of which consists of two syllables. Sometimes, the first foot can also consist of three syllables, but the others can’t. The stress is always on the first syllable of the foot (in other words, the rising foot).

Scaz,1y,What's the true dark history behind famous nursery rhymes?,"Great question I would love to answer it! I love things like this, so I will really enjoy it!

Before I start, let’s do the boring bit, reminding people who know better that I will take absolutely no offence if they click the ANSWER tab and answer it themselves.

Ok, are you sitting comfortably? Then I’ll begin!

Ring O’ roses.

Simple. This was referring to the Black Death (bubonic plague). One of the symptoms of plague was a ring of pustules that resembled roses and normally showed in a ring on the body. Another symptom was sneezing. People thought the plague was spread by bad smells and carried small bunches (posies) of flowers to block the smell, hence

Ring O’ ring o’ roses (pustules)

A pocketful of posies (to prevent the smell getting to you)

Atishoo, atishoo (or bless you, bless you depending on where you’re from)

All fall down (SCHNUFFED it!)

In And Out The Dusty Bluebells

Bluebells had a magical significance and were said to be the home of the faeries. Forget Tinkerbell, these guys were mean!! The took your babies and changed them with goblin babes (changelings), or made your dog lame, or even ruined your crops! They were also somehow affiliated with the devil so baaaaad news! Stories spread of children wandering in to bluebell rings and disappearing, so obviously the faeries took them! This pretty little ditty is accompanied by a dance where children form a ring and weave in and out of the arches formed by other kid’s arms, this is said to represent being led away from good and towards evil. It is interesting to note the words used to be you shall be my Master, and it has recently been changed to Partner

In and out those dusty bluebells, (Faerie ring)
In and out those dusty bluebells,
In and out those dusty bluebells,
You shall be my master. (Said to be a reference to the devil/faeries)

Tippy tippy tap tap on your shoulder… (The faeries gaining your attention)
You shall be my master. (there’s that reference again)

The kids would keep twisting in and out and formed a chain of kids one behind the other until none were left. This was said to represent the devil overtaking an entire village.

Pop! Goes The Weasel.

Really old London one here, a bit like me! Ok, this one isn’t gruesome, but it’s sad.

This is based on the old weaving trade, and poverty. Everyone knows what a weasel is, I am sure ladies we have all dated one or two in our time! Do you know that it is also a tool of the weaving trade?

One weasel. Yep. it’s a tool for the weaving industry!

“Ok Scaz, we can see the significance of the weasel, but it can’t be sad.. it has the word POP! in it. POP is a jolly word!”

Or is it? Pop in the UK is a slang term for pawning things. (Pawn as in selling stuff, not scantily clad people sneezing, their clothes falling off, and all parties and gaining horizontal refreshment!) What would happen is, you would be rented a “weasel” and go to work on the Monday, part of your wage would go to eventually buying it. You’d do your shopping, go in to the Eagle (a pub on the City Road in London which I believe is still there) and get bladdered on cheap gin, then go to the pawnbrokers and “pop” the weasel until payday on Friday when you’d get paid and pay to redeem your weasel. How very sad!

Mary Mary Quite Contrary

This is a reeeally nasty one!

Originally it was sung:

Mistress Mary, quite contrary

How does your garden grow?

With silver bells, and cockleshells

And pretty maids, all in a row!

What did it mean? It was all about this lady. She’s rather severe isn’t she? Meet Queen Mary, aka Mary Tudor, aka Bloody Mary. She was a religious zealot who ordered the brutal executions of protestants in England. Not only were liable to be beheaded or burnt, they were tortured to force confessions and name other “heretics”.

“Oh, but Scaz, silver bells and cockle shells! And pretty maids all in a row! How can that be gory?”

Simple!

Silver bells were a nice name for thumbscrews, and cockleshells were a device attached to your genitals that believe me couldn’t have been pleasant.. even to those in to that sort of thing! And the pretty maids all in a row? What a pretty way to describe bodies in a graveyard?

EDIT: It would seem I have made a mistake, the above picture shows the silver bells and cockleshells, they look enjoyable don’t they??!, The tripod affair is a “Maiden”, a device for beheading heretics.

Charming people the Tudors!

(there’s that reference again)\n\nThe kids would keep twisting in and out and formed a chain of kids one behind the other until none were left. This was said to represent the devil overtaking an entire village.\n\nPop! Goes The Weasel.\n\nReally old London one here, a bit like me! Ok, this one isn’t gruesome, but it’s sad.\n\nThis is based on the old weaving trade, and poverty. Everyone knows what a weasel is, I am sure ladies we have all dated one or two in our time! Do you know that it is also a tool of the weaving trade?\n\nOne weasel. Yep. it’s a tool for the weaving industry!\n\n“Ok Scaz, we can see the significance of the weasel, but it can’t be sad.. it has the word POP! in it. POP is a jolly word!”\n\nOr is it? Pop in the UK is a slang term for pawning things. (Pawn as in selling stuff, not scantily clad people sneezing, their clothes falling off, and all parties and gaining horizontal refreshment!) What would happen is, you would be rented a “weasel” and go to work on the Monday, part of your wage would go to eventually buying it. You’d do your shopping, go in to the Eagle (a pub on the City Road in London which I believe is still there) and get bladdered on cheap gin, then go to the pawnbrokers and “pop” the weasel until payday on Friday when you’d get paid and pay to redeem your weasel. How very sad!\n\nMary Mary Quite Contrary\n\nThis is a reeeally nasty one!\n\nOriginally it was sung:\n\nMistress Mary, quite contrary\n\nHow does your garden grow?\n\nWith silver bells, and cockleshells\n\nAnd pretty maids, all in a row!\n\nWhat did it mean? It was all about this lady. She’s rather severe isn’t she? Meet Queen Mary, aka Mary Tudor, aka Bloody Mary. She was a religious zealot who ordered the brutal executions of protestants in England. Not only were liable to be beheaded or burnt, they were tortured to force confessions and name other “heretics”.\n\n“Oh, but Scaz, silver bells and cockle shells! And pretty maids all in a row! How can that be gory?”\n\nSimple!\n\nSilver bells were a nice name for thumbscrews, and cockleshells were a device attached to your genitals that believe me couldn’t have been pleasant.. even to those in to that sort of thing! And the pretty maids all in a row? What a pretty way to describe bodies in a graveyard?\n\nEDIT: It would seem I have made a mistake, the above picture shows the silver bells and cockleshells, they look enjoyable don’t they??!, The tripod affair is a “Maiden”, a device for beheading heretics.\n\nCharming people the Tudors!\n\nEDIT: *SIGH* this is getting boring now, once again I am reminding people that trashing other’s answers is NOT cool. If you know better, feel free to answer it yourselves. My answer is based on my knowledge and my understanding of the knowledge I have, if you have heard differently FANTASTIC!

Dave Haynie,Updated 9mo,Why do most songs rhyme? Why do we find rhyming lyrics more pleasing?,"We enjoy rhyme in songs in a big part because both rhyme and music form complementary patterns. Our brains are receptive to these patterns versus words or notes without pattern.

Because a lyric is a sonic event (directed to the ear), rhyme is important, since it provides a roadmap for the ear; showing relationships between lines, creating forward motion, creating either stability or instability in sections, and telling the ear where sections end.

-Pat Pattison

I took Pat Pattison’s online Songwriting course (Berklee College and Coursera) some many years ago, and it really did change the way I write and appreciate lyrics.

There’s only so much room in a song for words (yeah, even you, Bobbie Dylan), as well considering that in most songs you have a repetitive refrain or chorus, that you’re working with your chords, melody, intonation, rhythm, and rhyme as separate elements of prosody, essentially merging these elements into a unified thing: a song. If your song has a message, it can’t be subtle. The listener doesn’t get to go back and re-read anything. Prosody pretty much optimizes the whole of the song for delivery to the human brain.

Part of understanding this is to analyze where a song can be stable, where it might be unstable, and how these tweak emotions in the listener. Rhyming words, an even number of lines, a resolved chord pattern, we process these as emotionally stable in a song. An odd number of lines, a missing rhyme, etc. is unstable. Both are useful tools… the stable verse or chorus establishes a statement, while the unstable will often move the song along.

But I’m not the best at explaining all this, so I’ve linked some articles, the first from Pat Pattison, who is one of the best teachers on the planet for teaching the understanding rhyme and its role in prosody.

However, this does seem to go deeper, and it’s really that we’re writing music this way because we want to please or push our human brains with our musical and lyrical patterns. Our millions of years of evolution have lead to brains which are constantly searching for patterns.

We’re happy when we find patterns, and less so when we don’t, which is really I guess the crux of why we’re satisfied with an even set of lines that resolve the rhyme, a musical pattern that resolves, and music and lyrics that reinforce the same pattern.

But it’s not just in music. We start little children out with nursery rhymes, and studies have shown that they recall rhymes far better than prose at a very early age.

In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

We invent rhymes in order to remember things. We adults remember rhymes better than non-rhymes, too. We tend to believe things we’ve heard over and over again, at least in part because they’re in our memory and sound familiar. So as rhyming helps us remember, and remembering helps us believe, we tend to believe rhymes! Which leads to the Rhyme as Reason effect, identified in 1999 by psychologists Matthew McGlone and Jessica Tofighbakhsh. I don’t claim I have their entire thesis here, but this is enough to have a basic understanding of this truth.

Which is one reason songs have repetitive refrains or choruses: it’s easier to remember a rhyme. So going back to primitive music and oral histories, songs and stories passed down from mouth to mouth were better retained through rhyme. That’s part of the folk music of pretty much every country, and so rhyme became tradition even when it wasn’t absolutely needed for remembrance, even when it wasn’t analyzed as part of prosody.

You’ve probably run into this yourself. You’ll like a song better if you remember it, if you’re going to like it at all. This is why, if you’re an “album person”, you probably play an album through a few times before you’re really “getting into it.” That all-important hook in your hit song is the repetitive lyrical/melodic pattern that keeps the song in listeners heads and, hopefully, prompts more than a few to buy it. There’s a saying that “musicians have the worst stereos” which is not based on their projected income, but because when you listen to music like a musician, you’re playing the song in your head. That leads to higher satisfaction even on a crappy audio system. It’s also lead to Apple’s reinvention of themselves as a consumer electronics company… people, it turns out, didn’t care about better sound, they wanted their whole music collection in their pocket, eh?

Going the opposite way, a good number of Hymns have poor prosody, poor rhymes, no rhymes, accents on words that counter the melody, poor melody, etc. Which is why no one remembers them and churches have big hymnals or, these days, screens which display the words, even when the same songs are sung all the time. Part of the reason, too, certain kids I can think of used to hide out on Sunday morning hoping Mom and Dad would not bring us. er… them to that church. But I digress!

This phenomena is also why ad agencies often create slogans or jingles that rhyme. And why some ads use music to reinforce that rhyme. And why politicians, as well as salesmen and conmen (and the occasional few who are all three) constantly repeat the same phrases, which sometimes also rhyme. If it’s in your head, you’re more likely to believe it.

The Rhyme-as-Reason Effect: Why Rhyming Makes Messages More Persuasive
The rhyme-as-reason effect is a cognitive bias that makes people more likely to believe statements that contain a rhyme, compared to statements that don’t. For example, people generally perceive the statement “woes unite foes” as more accurate than the statements “woes unite enemies” and “misfortunes unite foes”— even though they all mean roughly the same thing—because only the first statement contains a rhyme (i.e., the words “woes” and “foes” end with the same sound). Furthermore, rhyming can also influence people in associated ways beyond making them trust statements, for example by making them more likely to like, remember, and repeat statements. These effects can apply to various types of statements, such as aphorisms , educational mnemonics devices , and advertising slogans . The rhyme-as-reason effect is important to understand, since you can use it to craft messages that are more persuasive, and since accounting for its use by others can help you assess information in a more rational way. As such, in the following article you will learn more about this effect, and see how you can use it yourself, as well as how you can deal with its use by others. Examples of the rhyme-as-reason effect The following are examples of aphorisms where the rhyme-as-reason effect plays a role, since people rate them as more accurate when they contain a rhyme compared to when they do not: Anger restrained is wisdom gained . Anger held back is wisdom gained . Anger restrained is wisdom acquired . Those who are poor by condition are rich in ambition . Those who are poor by circumstance are rich in ambition . Those who are poor by condition are rich in desire . Caution and measure will win you treasure. Caution and restraint will win you treasure. Caution and measure will win you riches. What sobriety conceals , alcohol reveals . What sobriety obscures , alcohol reveals . What sobriety conceals , alcohol unmasks . In addition, the benefits of the rhyme-as-reason effect also mean that many other traditional aphorisms contain rhymes. For example: “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” “Red sky at night, sailor’s delight. Red sky in morning, sailor’s warning.” “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” Furthermore, the influence of the rhyme-as-reason effect can be observed in many other types of contexts. For example, rhyming was used as part of a rhetorical legal technique in the infamous trial of O. J. Simpson, whose lawyer (Johnnie Cochran) told members of the jury “if it doesn’t fit , you must acquit ”, in reference to the gloves allegedly used by Simpson during a murder. Similarly, rhyming is often used in advertising, since slogans that contain rhymes are generally perceived as more trustworthy convincing, likable, original, and memorable than slogans that don’t contain a rhyme. Psychology and causes of the rhyme-as-reason effect The rhyme-as-reason effect can be attributed to several connected cognitive mechanisms: Rhyming can improve the aesthetics of statements

If your song has a message, it can’t be subtle. The listener doesn’t get to go back and re-read anything. Prosody pretty much optimizes the whole of the song for delivery to the human brain.\n\nPart of understanding this is to analyze where a song can be stable, where it might be unstable, and how these tweak emotions in the listener. Rhyming words, an even number of lines, a resolved chord pattern, we process these as emotionally stable in a song. An odd number of lines, a missing rhyme, etc. is unstable.

For example, people generally perceive the statement “woes unite foes” as more accurate than the statements “woes unite enemies” and “misfortunes unite foes”— even though they all mean roughly the same thing—because only the first statement contains a rhyme (i.e., the words “woes” and “foes” end with the same sound). Furthermore, rhyming can also influence people in associated ways beyond making them trust statements, for example by making them more likely to like, remember, and repeat statements. These effects can apply to various types of statements, such as aphorisms , educational mnemonics devices , and advertising slogans . The rhyme-as-reason effect is important to understand, since you can use it to craft messages that are more persuasive, and since accounting for its use by others can help you assess information in a more rational way. As such, in the following article you will learn more about this effect, and see how you can use it yourself, as well as how you can deal with its use by others. Examples of the rhyme-as-reason effect The following are examples of aphorisms where the rhyme-as-reason effect plays a role, since people rate them as more accurate when they contain a rhyme compared to when they do not: Anger restrained is wisdom gained . Anger held back is wisdom gained . Anger restrained is wisdom acquired . Those who are poor by condition are rich in ambition . Those who are poor by circumstance are rich in ambition . Those who are poor by condition are rich in desire . Caution and measure will win you treasure. Caution and restraint will win you treasure. Caution and measure will win you riches. What sobriety conceals , alcohol reveals . What sobriety obscures , alcohol reveals . What sobriety conceals , alcohol unmasks . In addition, the benefits of the rhyme-as-reason effect also mean that many other traditional aphorisms contain rhymes. For example: “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” “Red sky at night, sailor’s delight. Red sky in morning, sailor’s warning.” “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” Furthermore, the influence of the rhyme-as-reason effect can be observed in many other types of contexts. For example, rhyming was used as part of a rhetorical legal technique in the infamous trial of O. J. Simpson, whose lawyer (Johnnie Cochran) told members of the jury “if it doesn’t fit , you must acquit ”, in reference to the gloves allegedly used by Simpson during a murder. Similarly, rhyming is often used in advertising, since slogans that contain rhymes are generally perceived as more trustworthy convincing, likable, original, and memorable than slogans that don’t contain a rhyme.

Eleftherios Tserkezis,3y,Does the Iliad rhyme in Greek?,"No.

The metric form of the Iliad —and all Greek and Roman epic poetry in general— is known as dactylic hexameter.

Each line contains a varying number of syllables arrayed according to their length. The pattern that has to be followed is six foot long: the first five feet are either dactyls (long-short-short) or spondees (long-long), while the sixth is either a spondee (long-long) or a trochee (long-short).

Apart from that, there were virtually no other concerns. The lines were not required to rhyme, and neither the accents nor anything else mattered. Those appeared much later, in the Byzantine period.

Benjamin Murphy,1y,How do songs in English rhyme and also rhyme in other languages?,"It is possible that the limerick was invented by Saint Thomas Aquinas, who wrote the following:

Sit vitiorum meorum evacuatio
Concupiscentae et libidinis exterminatio,
Caritatis et patientiae,
Humilitatis et obedientiae,
Omniumque virtutum augmentatio.

Here’s my translation:

O Lord, make all my vices cease

From Lust’s strong grip my soul release

But patience and charity

Obedience and humility

May all the virtues in my soul increase.

How about that? A Latin limerick is still a limerick when translated into English. Because, of course, I cheated.

I added “O Lord” so the first line would have enough syllables. I used one word, “lust” to stand for “concupiscentae et libidinis”, and added the reference to a strong grip on the soul. This was done so that I could end the line with the word “Release”, because that rhymes with “increase.” With the next two lines, I changed the order of the word because “charity” and “humility” rhyme, so they need to go at the end of the line. That sounds better than rhyming “patience” and “obedience”. In the final line, there is once again a reference to the soul, inserted by me, because that fits with the second line. A literal translation is

Let there be of my vices an evacuation

Of concupisence and libido an extermination

But of charity and patience

Of humility and obedience

And of all the virtues, an augmentation.

That still rhymes, because I was able to stick with English words derived from the Latin words that Saint Thomas uses.

Evangelos Lolos,Updated 3y,Does the Iliad rhyme in Greek?,"Not in the original ancient Greek text.

WARNING: if you're prudish and/or easily offended please move along, nothing to see here.

Oh, you're still here. Well, I did warn you. Here you go:

Ραψωδία Α'

Πάνω στης Τροίας τα βουνά που ’ναι σαν κωλομέρια,

Book I

On top of Troy's mountain tops, whose butt-cheek shape is known,

Homer was seated, cock in hand, erect but all alone.

As he was boldly jerking off, spreading ’round his load,

Gods' inspiration he received, to write an epic ode.

My translation skills notwithstanding, this is not a poem worthy to be compared with Homer's in artistic terns. Still, it goes on for quite a bit, only increasing in vulgarity and resourcefulness, while daring to touch upon the actual causes of the Trojan War and not the fake news spread by the blind ancient poet.

Perhaps due to its predominantly oral transmission among teenagers, going back several decades, it's impossible to say who was the original writer, if there was one. Not that it matters, of course.

This is a wonderful album filled with dark anger. The US and its allies attacked Iraq in January of this year and Tamaki calls those who started war “paranoia” in “Warning from 1991” in this album. Anzen-chitai is not a political band in any sense but sings their personal feelings at those times. So, I’ve been following their pieces in chronological order to swallow one by one.

Sine = opposite/hypotenuse, Cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse Tangent = opposite/adjacent.

See how much easier that is?

“Better be right or your great big venture goes west” is another. What’s it for?

Alex Johnston,Updated 7mo,"How do I make this quote rhyme, ""Though the path ahead may wind and twine, there's one place we won't leave behind. With inviting windows and welcoming doors, our home forever stands tall.""?","Though the path ahead may wind and twine,

There’s one place we won’t leave behind,

With inviting windows and welcoming doors,

Our home forever is made of oars.

Though the path ahead may wind and twine,

There’s one place we won’t leave behind,

With inviting windows and cavity wall,

Our home forever [syllables] tall.

Though the path ahead may wind and twine,

There’s one place we won’t leave behind,

With inviting windows and welcoming doors,

We hoover up the toxic spores.

Though we may leave the path behind,

There’s one place that won’t fade at all,

With inviting windows made of rind,

We hang our hats on Timothy Spall.

Though we can’t rhyme to save our wine,

We whine and twine and number nine,

And fine fine oars and doors and pours

With something chimneys and whatsit doors.

Though the path ahead blah blah blah ine,

There’s one place blah blah blah blah all,

With blah blah blah and blah blah oars

Our blah blah blah blah blah blah all.

Although we try to write a poem,

We really shouldn’t try to show ‘em,

Because, to be (for once) quite blunt,

We’re really quite a bigoted ****.

Though poetry we try to make

We can’t outsource the rhymes of it.

Because that means our work is fake,

And we are, frankly, full of shit.

Bonus answer:

It sucks.

R J Holland,3y,"When singers and songwriters write songs, why does it have to rhyme?","Writing songs is just like writing poetry, it’s lyrical and easy to read when it rhymes. There’s beauty in a song that rhymes

But it doesn’t always have to rhyme. There are songs that don’t rhyme.

New Sensation by INXS is a song with no rhyming. I love the drumming in this song, it’s simple but there’s a lot of nice, tasty shots and great sounding drums so I wanted my band to do it. I wrote the words out, looked at them and thought, Jesus, this thing doesn’t rhyme. I gave the pages with the lyrics to Barry our vocalist who looked them over and said, “This isn’t a song, it’s a f——g BOOK! Forget it.” It was too bad because Barry sounded a lot like Michael Hutchence the then lead vocalist for INXS.

I sang some lead songs and I could adapt my voice to sound like the vocalist on the records, also did a lot of cartoon characters; I said I’d do it. “You’re going to need a teleprompter to read that f——-g song,” Barry said laughing. Anyway, I memorized it but always had the lyrics in large print down beside my drums just in case.

Live, baby, live
Now that the day is over
I got a new sensation
Mm, perfect moments
That's so impossible to refuse

Sleep, baby, sleep
Now that the night is over
And the sun comes like a God
Into our room
All perfect light and promises

Got a hold on you
(A new sensation, a new sensation)
Right now
It's gonna take you over
(A new sensation, a new sensation)

Dream, baby, dream
Of all that's come and going
And you will find out, in the end
There really is
There really is no difference

Cry, baby, cry
When you got to get it out
I'll be your shoulder, you can tell me all
Don't keep it in ya
Well, that's the reason why I'm here

Hey hey, are you ready for a?
(A new sensation, new sensation)
Right now
Gonna take you over
(A new sensation, a new sensation)

Hey hey hey hey hey-ee-ey-ee-ey-ee-ey-ee

Hate, baby, hate
When there's nothing left for you
You're only human, what can you do?
It'll soon be over
Don't let your pain take over you

Love, baby, love
It's written all over your face
There's nothing better we could do
Than live forever
Well, that's all we've got to do

Hey now, I'm gonna take you over
(A new sensation, a new sensation)
Right now
I've got a hold on you

It would probably be during his crossover and encounter with Wonder Woman, during Vol 1 of Wonder Woman “All Sins Remembered” #124 written by John Bryne.

Diana, Artemis, along with Cassie Sandsmark are both trapped in the underworld of hell by Neron and are both seemingly defeated by him in the process. With Diana having no chance of beating him in the underworld, since she’s stripped of her powers.

Meanwhile Etrigan teases and tortures her while she’s restrained, along with one of the best rhymes I've ever heard from him say. Before Donna Troy comes in to save them.

“Learn you now know what has been hidden, scales from your eyes have fallen here. Though you Etrigan your ally, now this Hope is turned to Fear.”

Nadiya Safeer,1y,"Why do some words rhyme and others do not? For example, eat and treat.","Rhyming words are words that have similar sounds, particularly at the end of the word. The reason why some words rhyme and others do not has to do with the way the sounds of the words are constructed and how they are used in the language.

In English, rhyming words are typically words that end with the same vowel and consonant sounds, often called the ""rhyme sound."" For example, in the words ""eat"" and ""treat,"" the vowel sounds in the last syllable of each word (i.e., the ""ee"" sound) are the same, and both words end with the same consonant sound (i.e., the ""t"" sound). Therefore, these two words are considered to rhyme.

Words that do not rhyme may have different vowel sounds, different consonant sounds, or different combinations of vowel and consonant sounds that do not match. For example, the words ""eat"" and ""beat"" share the same ending consonant sound, but have different vowel sounds, and therefore do not rhyme.

The reason why certain sounds or combinations of sounds are used more frequently in rhyming words is partly due to the way the English language has developed over time. Many English words are derived from different languages and have undergone various sound changes and shifts in pronunciation. Additionally, the use of rhyming words in poetry and songwriting has also contributed to the development and popularization of certain sound patterns in the language.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wjghca2m305kuvny', 'title': 'Why do some words rhyme and others do not?

Alex Johnston,2y,What movies have dialog that rhymes?,"I know of only one, but I’m sure there must be more:

Jean-Paul Rappeneau’s highly enjoyable 1990 movie Cyrano de Bergerac, starring Gérard Depardieu as its impressively-conked hero, and Anne Brochet and Vincent Pérez as Roxane and Christian.

This is one of the best things Depardieu has ever done. He was still young and fit enough (42) to buckle on his swash, but old enough to give the role the necessary gravitas. The reason the film rhymes is that the script and dialogue are adapted from Edmond Rostand’s 1897 play of the same name, which also rhymes.

Saleh Abdel Motaal (صالح),Updated 2y,"My husband rhymes all the time. He will say something like “let’s go for a walk, talk, thought”, and he calls our son silly nicknames. Is this a symptom of autism?","I think it is not quite the way folks on the spectrum look at things, my symptoms of my autism spectrum condition are ones born out of being autistic and then at one point something was amiss until there were symptoms experts look for at that point, it is the crude way they go about it, but they somehow call it science, and the autism spectrum disorders.

That said, according to the diagnosis I completed as an adult in October 2020, there are specific observable traits in my social interactions and behaviours, along with certain patterns in self-reported questionnaires that outlined I was an autistic individual, from birth, and it took me a couple of years to navigate the system and end up with a diagnosis that would allow me to move forward with my life.

In the years leading to my diagnosis, I suffered extremely traumatic events in my life.

I was 37 at the time of my diagnosis, and I had landed there after 19 years of misdiagnoses, while others around me were trying to find a way to explain all the struggles we have in our household away at my different way of seeing the world, when in reality I see in each of them some of those traits.

In our community, we do not stereotype autism, folks on the spectrum are more diverse than the neurotypical population, and so to be more accurate, we tend not to, we try not to, at least in the grand scheme of things.

Meanwhile, others like to attribute to us stereotypes and stigma, that in of itself is the reason why we go from being on the autism spectrum to being stigmatized, stereotyped, and eventually traumatized enough, when that comes at us from those near and far.

I genuinely appreciate your question, and I offer my insights only because I see there sadly many such answers that send shivers down my spine.

The day when my compounding life’s trauma first made apparent to my psychiatrist what they consider symptoms of autism, that was earlier in the very same week when my dad passed away.

He always had such humour, and he always had such atypical ways around the extremely ridged and unforgiving expectations of neurotypical social interactions.

He loved pulling pranks on those who abused their authority, this made him feel proud, and he would stand up to them while others would prefer he just would keep his head down and not bring needless trouble, according to them, so they neglected to act when what they meant was to show him they were proud.

He was never diagnosed.

I thought he was silly, but in an innocent, loving, humble, and kind sort of way.

I am proud to be silly, funny, and hardly concerned when it comes to this whole shit show we call being kind to our egos.

Kindness begins when we teach our egos to be kind, to ourselves, to those we love, to those being harmed, and to those who don’t know better than to cause others harm, when you are being kind to their being, instead of propping up their easily inflatable egos, while trauma unfolds.

My own struggles in trying to live masked all those years finally made so much more sense when I came across this post
 by the Unashamed Voices of Autism folks on Facebook:

Of course, this infographic is more generic and will not likely match perfectly to everyone on the spectrum, and I am inclined to say that those columns will differ for each of us at different periods in our lives.

However, my own struggles are shared by so many others due to gaps in the diagnostic protocols over the years, and so there are still so many of us out there who belong to what some now refer to as the lost generation.

Ultimately, with knowledge we grow empowered, and without it we might struggle, and we might even not be aware of how much more needlessly our struggles are, that we would do so painting in our world happiness that it may see us through the thick of trying times.

So, I offer that you share this answer with your loved one, because folks on the spectrum resonate, and if and when they find this resonates, they may choose to identify, they may choose to embrace their neurodivergence, that they would never be made to feel they needed to appease another’s ego, to never feel challenged to have to apologize, for being who they are.

Mats Andersson,Oct 31,Can anyone help fix the transcription of the Swedish nursery rhyme Bamses födelsedag linked to in my self-answer?,"Thanks for the A2A.

OK, so… it’s not actually a nursery rhyme. It’s the lyrics of a song, from a Norwegian children’s book from 1953 called Klatremus og de andre dyrene i Hakkebakkeskogen, by Thorbjørn Egner. (In Swedish, Klas Klättermus (och de andra djuren i Hackebackeskogen).) It’s very popular in both Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and is often played as a musical at schools.

With that out of the way… there actually exist several Swedish translations and adaptations. But I managed to dig up the original translation on the Web. Here goes, with my comments to the original transcription and your questions in italics:

Den gamla snälla Bamse Björn
som alla djuren känner
han skulle hålla stort kalas
för alla sina vänner.

Gamla snälla Bamsen vår
Fyller femti år i år
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar.

Och hela långa natten flög
fru Uggla kring och ropa’: (Not “Uckla”: it’s Mrs. Owl. She was flying around and shouting this message.)
“I morgon klockan sju precis
så samlas allihopa!”

Bamsen, Bamsen han är bra,
föl’sedag ska Bamsen ha. (It’s contracted to fit with the meter, it’s a fairly common pronunciation)
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar!

Och räven skulle skaffa kött,
för Mickel det var kocken. (The fox’s first name is Mickel, and he’s the cook for the party)
Till bondens hönsgård smög han sej; (hönsgård, so, literally “hen farm” but it’s probably just a hen house)
där tog han halva skocken. (“Skock” is one of several possible collective nouns for a flock of poultry.)

Hönsstek det ska Bamsen få, (Hönsstek - literally, hen steak.)
det förstår sej Bamsen på.
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar!

Klas Klättermus blir speleman (Klas Klättermus is, indeed, the sort of main character of the book. “Speleman” means “player of instrument” but it’s usually understood to be a fiddler – but it’s stated in the book, and in Egner’s own illustrations, that he plays the guitar. The last name means “Climber Mouse”; in the Norwegian original he doesn’t seem to have a first name.)
och spelar hela dagen,
och äter mycket härlig mat,
för det gör gott i magen.

Bamsen, Bamsen, Bamsen har
alltid vart en karlakarl. (“Always been a manly man” – I don’t know what happened to your AI here. The expression is not so much about what you might call macho, more about being hard-working, honest, strong, and reliable.)
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar!

Och dagen kom med fågelsång
det var en hel orkester
och Bamsen hälsade så fint
på alla sina gäster.

“Bamsefar, goddag, goddag, (Not “Bamsens barn”, it should be “Bamse-father”.)
det är Bamsens dag i dag.
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar!”

Och Jösse och hans fru de kom (It’s spelled with a J. It’s the Hare.)
med färska mazariner (A mazarin is a Swedish sweet pastry; a shortcrust shell with an almond paste filling, and icing on top. Delicious. The name probably has something to do with the French 17th century cardinal Jules Mazarin, but no one’s been able to figure out how and why.)
och fyra burkar blåbärssylt
från Jösses små kusiner.

Bamsen, Bamsen du är snäll,
här ska bli kalas ikväll. (Not “fli”, “bli” – literally “become”, it’s just expressing future tense)
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar!

Och mössen gav åt Bamsefar (Correct: it’s the mice, Klas and his neighbour Mårten Skogsmus (“Forest Mouse”)
en randig slickepinne:
“Den kan du slicka på i vinter, (It’s not complex: “på” goes with the lollipop! “You can lick on this lollipop in the winter”, it’s understood to be this coming winter.)
när du ligger inne.

Den ska farbror Bamsen ha
för den smakar sött och bra. (Not “spött”. That’s not actually a word.)
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar!”

Den stora älgen reste sej
och det blev tyst kring bordet: (Around the table, not around the yard.)
“Ja, jag är ingen talare. (“Well, I’m no speaker”, as in “holder of speeches”.)
Förlåt att jag tar ordet. (To “take the word” doesn’t really mean “speaking up” as in telling a truth, it’s that you sort of assume a temporary chairmanship.)

Käre gamle Bamsen vår, (“Dear old Bamse ours.”)
du blir femti år i år.
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar!”

“Det var ett väldigt vackert tal,
och tänk vad älgen kan sen”, (OK your AI was drunk here. “And think [as in, ‘it’s surprising’ or ‘it’s impressive’] what the Moose knows, then [as in, what he’s capable of]” – yes, it’s a sort of good-natured joke, it’s a really stupid speech even by the standards of the intended audience, age 10 or so)
sa Bamsemor, och Mickel torka (The final “-de” of words like “torkade” is often dropped in speech; it’s dropped also in writing here to show how it fits the meter)
bort en tår med svansen: (He just wiped off his own tear with his own tail, your translation is slightly off there)

“Bamsen, gamle hedersman, (“Hedersman” is an old expression, the literal meaning is “honourable man” but it’s more like “valued old friend”)
bästa björn i detta land.
Hipp hurra för Bamsefar
som är så snäll och rar!”

Denis Martindale,1y,How do I create a poem that rhymes?,"The purpose of poetry is the sharing of poetry so if you write for yourself then that becomes a starting point that could be leading to greater poetry later. The greater the number of one’s audience could mean more dedication towards creating the end result. Even so, if it’s for a special person you really care for then that could lead to taking extra care. Now that we can use the Grammarly website to get text checked it’s a second chance at going beyond the rhymes and the rhythms. The English language offers us so many easy rhymes using the A and E and I and O and U sounding words. So it should be easy-peasy.

:

Topics are sometimes well-chosen themes that have been dealt with before yet that doesn’t stop us from doing what we can. Sometimes we merely play with words such as using alliterations or puns. Or we develop ideas based on the acrostic style or the sonnet rhyming pattern. Google search finds several poetry patterns or styles or genres that we see are offered when we submit a new poem on the poemhunter-dot-com website.

:

Imagine the challenge of writing not a single poem but a dozen poems and thinking it’s impossible to create something profound yet time passes and repeated attempts can help us to improve. That’s why poets keep writing. It’s not enough to write a thousand poems once you’ve achieved that level. The desire is to continue because poetry can bless so many people. The text may be difficult to recite but we can keep editing to improve the text. So creating a poem that rhymes isn’t all it seems at first. We may find Grammarly suggesting make us rethink our words and phrases as well as the order of the verses or we may think of a better poem title instead.

:

Beyond the initial stages we could consider how poems get recited. I learned that by listening to the poemhunter poems when recited by talented reciting talents as Blessed Sheriff. Certain words get recited in a slow and distinctive style. Poets can study this and recite their rhyming poems in a slower way to emphasise the meanings better. People may recite our poems much faster and then miss out words but that’s one of the problems with rhyming poetry so it helps to consider writing in other styles as well.

Unidentifiable,1y,What children’s nursery rhyme or story best describes a narcissist?,"The Toy Story movies.

How Andy treats his toys, is the resemblance of narcissistic abuse.

Andy, the main character and his toys share a special connection.

Andy writes his name on every toy to represent them as his possession and property, that no one, but him, can own.

Andy plays with his toys, but once he is bored, he puts them in a toy box, then when he is bored of the next toy, he can play with one of his old toys, that he put away, until he was in need of it again.

A narcissist views their partners as possessions. Or as their property.

In other words, they believe they own you.

They make you believe you have found the one.

They build you up, to tear you down.

Then they discard of you, but they aren’t finished with you, so they put you in a “toy box” when they bore of their new shiny toy.

The Love-Bombing Stage:

The Devaluation Stage:

The Discard Phase:
