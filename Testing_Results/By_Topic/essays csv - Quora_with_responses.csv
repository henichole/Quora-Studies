Anonymous,5y,What was the most depressing essay you've ever received from a student as a teacher?,"It was a typical 10 year old assignment, write a persuasive letter to you parents to convince them on something. Most kids chose getting a phone, some a dog or a new bike. Except one girl, who we’ll call Amy.

I was skimming though them, checking for mistakes for them to correct next lesson before the the follow up (write your parents reply, this was changed due to Amy’s letter) That’s when I saw her one.

This it it paraphrased

Dear Mum,

I am writing to ask for some changes…I would like you to stop drinking.

I would like this because when you drink you change. It scares me when you hit me…..and when you bring home your boyfriend he hits me too.

Maybe if you stopped earlier Daddy wouldn’t have left, I know I’m his little girl but he doesn’t come anymore and he says it’s your fault.

It went on longer, tears came to my eyes, she was such a bright, bubbly girl I never suspected anything. I was angry, why doesn’t her dad protect her, I was sad, she doesn’t relise it’s not normal.

A few days later she came in with a large bruise on her face. At break I called her back to talk to her. Then she let everything out, how her dad won’t come back until her mum stops drinking, how each night her mum gets back early in the morning with a new guy. How she sometimes sleeps in bus shelters or bushes to avoid her mum.

I talked to the headteacher and we called a meeting with her mum, on the day if it Amy wasn’t in school, her mum didn’t show up. Amy never came back, I went to her house but it was abandoned and a neighbour told me that they left for London. I panicked and by some miracle tracked them down. I found Amy alone in the flat, I waited with her until her mum returned. After talking it though with her and social services I’m fostering Amy until her mum is ready to look after her. They see each other every other weekend now and her mums nearly out of rehab. Amy’s just started secondary school and loving it.

I hope they can be reunited soon and live better lives together.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6m13079y4bfj5sha', 'title': ""What was the most depressing essay you've ever received from a student as a teacher?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It was a typical 10 year old assignment, write a persuasive letter to you parents to convince them on something.

Amy Babineaux,Updated 5y,What was the most depressing essay you've ever received from a student as a teacher?,"I was given a stack of 200 papers written by young teens the year I helped score the written portion of the state assessment. The prompt was, “Write about a challenge you faced and the steps you took to overcome it.”

Many twelve and thirteen-year-olds have a limited number of challenges to choose from, and half the essays were about learning how to ride a bicycle. Others wrote about attending a new school, burying a family pet, parents getting divorced or an injury resulting in a visit to the hospital.

After a few hours of scoring, I read a story about a girl with a challenge that was completely different from the others.

She was on a boat in the middle of a lake when her mom passed out from drinking too much, and her mom’s intoxicated boyfriend started making advances toward her.

Her challenge was trying to turn the boat around and drive it back to shore in order to get help for her mom while fighting off the drunk child molester.

After a morning reading about training wheel troubles and goldfish funerals, I felt so incredibly sad for the anonymous girl in the boat.

I flagged the paper, as we were instructed to do, and it was sent to one of the counselors at the girl’s school.

That was thirteen years ago and I still think about that horrifying situation. It still creates a sick feeling in my gut and sends a wave of sorrow through me.

The girl explained in her paper how she was able to get the boat to shallow water so she could jump out and run for help: help for her mom.

That was the most depressing essay I’ve read from a student. It makes me wonder how many other kids are out there in boats they can’t steer, unable to navigate to safety and anchored in dysfunction.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dehbrl52x9aoj0fs', 'title': ""What was the most depressing essay you've ever received from a student as a teacher?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9979, 'ai': 0.0021}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I was given a stack of 200 papers written by young teens the year I helped score the written portion of the state assessment.

Misty Corrales,1y,My final essay was plagiarized by another student word for word and I've never even talked to this student before. My professor messaged me asking why this happened. What can I do to prove it's mine and that I didnt cheat?,"I used to teach and I had two students turn in the same paper …. to the typos!

Murphy Barrett,2y,How can I prove that my teacher is name-grading essays without cheating on the paper?,"I once thought a professor was doing this to me because he disliked some of my political views. So for one essay I slipped the word “meow*” in randomly. Got marked off for that, so at least he was reading my work.

So next I convinced my buddy to submit the same essay I’d written under his own name, with the promise that if it went south I would assume full responsibility for what happened.

My buddy got an A. I got a D-. The instructor missed that it was the exact same paper. We took it to the department head. While the putz didn’t get fired he did get quite a talking to and while I still did poorly in that class it wasn’t so bad as to kill my GPA like he’d been trying to do.

The only fallout for my buddy was that he had to resubmit his actual paper, which he got an A on anyway. The only trouble I got into was the head asked me to take any suspected problems to him directly rather than pull a stunt like that again.

Julian Frank,5y,How can I prove that my teacher is name-grading essays without cheating on the paper?,"I suspected that my World History teacher was doing this last year.

She would always grade and return everything that was submitted to her within a day or two.

There were never any comments or marks on anything, except for a grade scribbled at the top. And that grade was almost always a 100 percent.

Suspicious. I know.

With all of this information, I was fairly certain that this teacher wasn’t really reading our assignments at all, and just giving us random grades.

But I wanted to be sure.

To test my theory, I inserted the full text of the poem “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll
 into the middle of one of my assignments.

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe…

And so on.

I didn’t introduce the poem, or explain why it was there, or anything like that. I just stuck it in there.

When I got the paper back, I had a perfect score with no mention of the poem.

Mark Johansen,Updated 4y,How can I prove that my teacher is name-grading essays without cheating on the paper?,"When I was in college, a fellow student was assigned to write a 50-page paper. He got to thinking, There’s no way the teacher is actually going to read and carefully review 30 50-page papers. He figured what the teacher would probably do is read the first page or two of each paper, the last page or two, and maybe skim the middle. So he worked very hard on his first two pages to write a really good introduction, and very hard on his last two pages to write a really good conclusion, and in the middle he wrote, “When addressing this subject, the Encyclopedia Britannica says …” and he then quoted the entire article out of the encyclopedia. He made sure to footnote it properly so in case the prof noticed, he couldn’t be accused of plagiarism. And he got an A on the paper.

Andy Kerr,Updated 5y,"How, if possible, can I trim a 5,000-word extended essay into 4,000 words without sacrificing content?","How,̶ ̶i̶f̶ ̶p̶o̶s̶s̶i̶b̶l̶e̶,̶ can I trim a 5000 words̶ ̶e̶x̶t̶e̶n̶d̶e̶d̶ essay i̶n̶ to 4000 words without sacrificing content?

Eliminate needless words.

Here are things you can eliminate without fear:

Adverbs, unless absolutely necessary
parenthetical asides (̶t̶h̶e̶s̶e̶ ̶r̶e̶a̶l̶l̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶g̶o̶)̶
I̶n̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶o̶p̶i̶n̶i̶o̶n̶,̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶ eliminate waffling
G̶r̶a̶n̶d̶i̶l̶o̶q̶u̶e̶n̶t̶ words added to make you sound smart
redundant,̶ ̶r̶e̶p̶e̶t̶i̶t̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶d̶u̶p̶l̶i̶c̶a̶t̶e̶d̶ words

Jason Whyte,Updated 6y,"How can I prove to my teacher that my essay was not plagiarized? After talking to her, she said the specific word choices I used caused her to believe it was plagiarized.","Ooh! Ooh! Me, sir! Please, sir! We’ve had to deal with exactly this situation.

Our son was once marked down on an essay which his tutor had declared was “clearly copied from the internet”. This greatly surprised my wife, who had read it before he submitted it and thought “well, that’s so much in his own writing style that no-one could mistake it for anyone else’s work” - but apparently the tutor had judged the essay more mature and well-written than a child of my son’s age could produce without plagiarism.

It was a science essay, and we tackled it scientifically:

Multiple trials - she ran the essay through several online plagiarism checkers - and Googled each sentence individually to show that there were no hits.
Control - she assembled an essay on the same subject, covering the same points but cutting and pasting from essays she found on the internet and ran that through the same plagiarism checkers.
Discussion - she wrote an email setting out how she’d approached her check, citing examples of his distinctive style, and also referencing some of the essays that our son had written for other teachers to point out that his style was consistent across all of them.
Conclusion - I then edited the email before sending, mainly re-ordering the arguments into a more powerful flow and making sure that the tone was respectful and focused on this specific issue. I concluded with a paragraph that stressed how upset our son was at the accusation, how much he enjoyed his science lessons, how good we felt the quality of the teaching was and concluded “But I do think in teaching science there should always be room to change a theory in the light of new evidence, and I hope you agree.”

Not long. Right?

Franklin Veaux,10mo,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"Yes. Yes I have. And my teacher (actually professor, this was my second year of uni) literally said “this is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” so I wrote, on my own time, a second essay supporting my assertions, and the next day he told me I “had a good point.”

My essay concerned ethics and morality. Specifically, I said that a lot of what we call “morals” aren’t actually morality at all—theyre custom and practicality.

As a simple example, people who migrate to cold climates need to wear clothing almost all the time to keep warm. After a while, as in generations, people simply become accustomed to seeing others almost always wearing clothing, and a few generations after that, not wearing clothing becomes viewed as “immoral.”

There’s nothing intrinsically immoral about not wearing clothing. Unless you’re out in the cold, it doesn’t cause harm. It certainly doesn’t harm bystanders. But the practicality of wearing clothing makes wearing clothing the custom, and because people get used to seeing others wearing clothing, eventually not wearing clothing becomes viewed as immoral.

The climate causes a practical change, that change gets cemented as a moral value because many cultural moral values are based on nothing more than “this is usually what I see the people around me do.”

So I said in my essay we should, as a society, unpack “this is practical and therefore customary, so not doing it is morally wrong” from “this harms others so it is morally wrong,” and stop labeling as “moral” that which is only practical social custom.

Anyway, unbeknownst to me, he was quite conservative and religious, and subscribed to a very different view of morality, so that caused some friction.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/59dyvkbtfca0ngm2', 'title': 'Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yes.

Barbara Bartholomew,Updated 3y,My final essay was plagiarized by another student word for word and I've never even talked to this student before. My professor messaged me asking why this happened. What can I do to prove it's mine and that I didnt cheat?,"This issue comes up with unfortunate regularity in my classes.

Two best remedies:

Provide the professor with your time-stamped ORIGINAL file stored on your computer or drive. That will show when it was created—hour and date. Let your cursor hover over the file. You will see the time stamp.
Tell the professor you are prepared to sit for an interview on the paper—its creation, what appears in the references and what you found of interest as you read those cited sources, problems you faced in writing and editing the piece, etc. It is at the professor’s discretion to create the plagiarism quiz. Have your paper in front of you, at the ready. If you have written it, you will know it well. You will be able to say, “I answered that at the bottom of page 3, then again on page 6. See in the third paragraph, page six, where I said {xyz}? I wanted to say y, but I was afraid it would just confuse the paper and add more questions than it would answer.” Or some such thing.

When both my kids were little, I would take them to the pediatrician, worried about a tiny bump I had found on them or a vein that you could see through the skin. In my endless studying of their little bodies, I had memorized every inch, and seen things only a diligent caretaker would notice. That was, in fact, what the doctor said to me—”There is no medical problem! Only a mother would notice such a thing!” So I say to you, only the true author knows the entire back story on something they have written. Only the author can answer the questions the teacher will ask in a satisfactory way. In an oral interview, that insider knowledge cannot be faked.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yrgote08ajp2x9nv', 'title': ""My final essay was plagiarized by another student word for word and I've never even talked to this student before.

Brijendra Singh,3y,What is a good strategy for the essay paper in the UPSC GS Mains?,"“Perfect is the enemy of good”.

Prepare for the essay paper to score marks, not to write like an author.

For this:

1. Go through the past 5 years Mains Essay topics. Divide them into a few broad themes e.g. essays related to women, environment, social issues, philosophy etc.

2. Invest 7-10 days to prepare content on each theme.

3. Your content should focus on:

i) Good anecdotes/quotes – this will serve as ready material to use in the introduction and conclusion e.g. for an essay related to women empowerment, a good anecdote would be the story of Lijjat Papad.

ii) Arguments/Points in favour of as well as against the topic. This helps in presenting a balanced viewpoint.

iii) Data to support your viewpoint- this helps in adding substance and depth to your essay e.g. stating that the First Lok Sabha had 24 female MPs while the 17th Lok Sabha has 78 emphasises that women’s participation in electoral politics is increasing. Simultaneously, stating that 33% reservation would take the number up to 179 emphasises the importance of the long-standing demand for women’s reservation in the Lok Sabha.

Some Dos and Donts

- While organising content, always keep referring to the topics of that theme. This ensures that no dimension goes unaddressed.

- Don’t fall into the trap of inconsequential jargon like writing a Thesis Statement-this is just a ploy to make the essay seem more technical and difficult than it actually is. Start the introduction with an appropriate anecdote and end it by simply re-stating the topic- it will have a tremendous impact on the evaluator.

- In the recent past, philosophical/reflective essays are becoming more common. Prepare ready-to-use content for them.

Simple tip: make a list of 10-15 good examples/anecdotes and beside each of them, note the point they can be used to highlight e.g. to show the perils of blind patriotism or jingoism, write about Nazi Germany; to exemplify greed, write about the British exporting wheat to Britain during the Bengal Famine etc.

IMPORTANT: Don’t start writing essays before you have collected good quality content.

David M Joseph,5y,How can I prove that my teacher is name-grading essays without cheating on the paper?,"I had two very different experiences in which I strongly suspected that the teacher was name-grading.

The first time was in 8th grade English, and I suspected that the teacher, who clearly was somewhat intimidated by me because of some things that had happened with other teachers, was grading me more generously than other students. So to test my theory, I wrote a paper and stopped mid-sentence at the bottom of a page, then stapled a blank page at the end, and tore off the blank sheet so there was just a small corner of paper left stapled to the rest of the paper. I got the paper back, and sure enough, not only did the paper get an A+, but it had a comment “Brilliant ending!”.

The second time the bias was clearly against me, in AP English in high school. I was getting B- and C+ on essays, when I had previously easily gotten an A on all writing assignments; yet other classmates, whom I’d been in class with for years, were getting the same grades they had previously. My older sister had also had this teacher, and she had gotten an A on pretty much all of her essays. So a topic was assigned that had also been assigned to my sister, and I turned in her exact essay, and even though she had gotten an A on her essay, I received a C+. I confronted the teacher with the two identical essays with vastly different grades, and she looked at me and stammered “She’s your sister? But you’re so different!” as if that was an excuse! I was expecting her to threaten to report me for plagiarism (which didn’t frighten me, since I had already informed the Dean about my experiment, and given him a copy of a completely different essay I had written in response to the assignment), but instead she mumbled something about grading being relative to the quality of the other students and my class was more competitive than my sister’s, but she knew she’d been caught, and offered to re-grade not only that essay but all the others that semester, and shockingly, they were all re-graded to an A or A-.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/639k4aul70povy8b', 'title': 'How can I prove that my teacher is name-grading essays without cheating on the paper?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I had two very different experiences in which I strongly suspected that the teacher was name-grading.\n\nThe first time was in 8th grade English, and I suspected that the teacher, who clearly was somewhat intimidated by me because of some things that had happened with other teachers, was grading me more generously than other students.

Maureen Hawkins,2y,What tricks do professors use to catch college students cheating on essays?,"Besides the suggestions others have provided, if I suspect plagiarism but can’t find the source, I ask the student to come in and explain some portion of the essay I suspect the student didn’t write. In most cases, the student can’t and has to admit plagiarizing.

A few times, I’ve been wrong, which I was glad of because it allowed me to give full credit to a student who deserved it.

Once was at the University of Sierra Leone in West Africa. The student had written an essay on Dylan Thomas’ “Do not go gentle into that good night” which showed a better grasp of poetics than I had (my field is drama). Furthermore, he’d written it in impeccable English, which was unusual as most of my students there spoke Krio, a dialectical language based in English; standard English was a second language for them. What was weird, though, was that he had written it in Victorian balanced periodic sentences, which almost no one had written since long before Dylan Thomas was born. When I called him in, I learned that he was an inveterate reader and aspiring poet who had studied poetics on his own and that his style came from growing up in a village upcountry where most of the reading material available outside of school books were 19th century collections of bound sermons left behind by long-dead English missionaries. Of course, I was delighted to give the essay the A+ it deserved.

Franklin Veaux,1y,"Is it true that, in some American schools, students do essays on why the USA is the best country in the world?","Back when I was in high school in Florida, yes.

In the 1980s, state law in Florida required that all public high school students take a one-semester class called Americanism vs Communism, or AVC.

The State-approved AVC textbook can be summed up this way:

“Rah rah rah! We’re #1! America, fuck yeah! We won WWII and saved Europe and Russia! America is the best at everything! Woohoo! Look at how amazing we are! America, go us!”

Like, seriously, it was embarrassingly bad. We’re talking Soviet-Union-textbook bad. If George Orwell included a page from the AVC textbook in Nineteen Eighty-Four, critics would be all “nah, bro, too unrealistic.” You wouldn’t think it’s possible to fit so much cringe into one book.

I cannot fathom the degree of insecurity that went into passing the law that required teaching this class in schools.

Fortunately, I lucked out. My high school teacher, a WWII vet and survivor of the Bataan Death March, hated and loathed the class requirement and textbook with every fiber of his being, and made that very clear on the first day of class.

He refused to teach from the book at all. He told us point-blank “The state requirement for this class is complete propaganda bullshit. As far as I’m concerned, this is a class in Russian history, and that’s how I intend to teach it.”

Olivia Higgins,6y,Do teachers feel obligated to give the student who wrote the longest essay a good grade?,"A word of advice that has always stuck with me came from my high school honors English teacher.

He was always the teacher who wanted us to write- more. More in depth, more on the subject, more on the history, ect. It sometimes felt like there wasn’t any end point for him.

We were discussing our essays in class, and what he wants us to write, and how they’ll be graded. Then someone in my class asked a very important question. (I don,t totally remember what was said, this is my best recreation)

Student-”So, you want this to be multiple pages correct?”

Teacher-”Um, Yes. I hope that was obvious.”

Student-”You want us to include a lot of information correct?”

Teacher- “Yes. Look at the guidelines. I want that information included in it.”

Student-”Ok, well, if i write a 50 page paper will I get an A?”

Teacher- “No.”

Student-”Why not?”

Teacher-”I really don’t care how long it is. A 500 page essay could say just as much as a 5 page one. It doesn’t matter what the contents are as long as the information is there. Because, really, why am I reading your essay other than to learn? And if the information is the same I think we can agree I’d much rather read the 5 page one.”

That lesson has stuck with me through many essays. It doesn’t matter the length. Teachers don’t care, it doesn't matter to them.

Marshall Wright,4y,How can I prove that my teacher is name-grading essays without cheating on the paper?,"Back in high school we had to do these ‘journals’ every day in my lit and comp class. Basically the teacher would give us a prompt and we'd write about it for ten minutes. The prompts would usually be something along the lines of “what's your favorite holiday and why?” “Who's you hero and what did they do to inspire you?”

That sort of thing.

I awnsered truthfully for around a month then I had a revelation. My school may have been small, but there was no way she could read all of our journal entries.

So the day after I thought that up the question was “do you like your name? Why or why not?”

I went into detail about being an “alien named how humans would pronounce the color blue” And so on. And did the rest of my journals normal That week, not wanting to risk a failing journal grade if she did actually read them. I got an 100 on the week..no mention of the alien.

So I started a whole narrative about an alien older than earth who investigated timeline errors, and had been sent to our high school because something was setting off the time line. This meant that our universe existed in a sort of purgatory for univereses as it technically wasn't supposed to exist. I did this for every journal, and eventually it concluded with my alien character realizing that he was the timeline error after all and due to this would forever be stuck in a loop of endlessly creating and fixing the errors he creats.

As long as I wrote a paragraph (the required amount) it didn't matter WHAT I wrote.

Definitely made the class a lot more fun, and I found myself brainstorming about my alien persona even outside of class.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/aw4j3e9gbq5px8us', 'title': 'How can I prove that my teacher is name-grading essays without cheating on the paper?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Back in high school we had to do these ‘journals’ every day in my lit and comp class.

Alice Baker,1y,"If students’ names were hidden from essays, do you think professors would give them different grades?","We have some real-world data on your question, courtesy of US law schools.

In US law schools, almost all grading is done anonymously. Each student is assigned a random four-digit number each semester and writes the number on their examinations instead of using their name. Anonymous grading was instituted during the late 1960’s, largely in response to the concerns of minority and female law students that their professors might be biased against them and grade them unfairly.

The adoption of anonymous grading created an ideal real-world laboratory. Law schools conducted empirical research on the question of whether anonymous grading made a difference by comparing the GPAs of students who were enrolled in law school at the time the school switched to anonymous grading. They conducted statistical analyses to determine whether the overall GPAs of minorities, women, or members of other demographic groups had improved after the switch, which is what you’d expect to find if the professors had been discriminating against them.

The law schools found that the switch to anonymous grading had made almost no difference. The grades students had earned during the year before the law school switched to anonymous grading and the grades students had earned during the year immediately after the law school switched to anonymous grading were, statistically speaking, the same. This was a surprising finding, because almost everyone had expected the research to show that the grades were affected by the professors’ subconscious bias.

Now, it’s important to acknowledge the limitations of the studies I’m describing.

The studies I am referring to looked only at the GPAs of groups of students, not whether a professor might grade an individual student’s essay unfairly.
The studies I am referring to did uncover some patterns of unfairness exhibited by individual professors. One example that stands out in my mind is that the numbers created a statistical inference that a certain professor at the University of Georgia had been discriminating against Yankees.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/cda6ik0urgoq3emh', 'title': 'If students’ names were hidden from essays, do you think professors would give them different grades?', 'score': {'original': 0.9918, 'ai': 0.0082}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'We have some real-world data on your question, courtesy of US law schools.\n\nIn US law schools, almost all grading is done anonymously.

Liv Deutsch,6y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"My English teacher, in the throes of a mid life crisis, gave up on teaching us halfway through the year.

Kimberly Davies,6y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"Yes, I did out of frustration with a college english class that was a lot harder than it originally sounded.

The first paper of the class was analyzing a documentary. I worked over six hours on the two pages and received a 78%. I was pretty annoyed since that was, by far, the worst grade I had received in college up to that point. Since I was a bit of a perfectionist at that time, I decided to work even harder on the next one. After doubling the amount of time I used and doing extra research, I earned a 87%.

On both papers, the professor wrote that they were mostly what he was looking for but didn’t have enough pull in the first or last paragraphs, they were too proper in the middle, and were boring. That pissed me off.

The third paper was supposed to be about personal experiences with random but related quotes or facts splitting the paper into multiple sections. This time, I didn’t have much time so I started writing at 1 am, the night before it was due, while exhausted and dealing with a splitting headache. Two hours later, the paper was done.

I wrote about a friend smoking a cigarette and laughing, that same friend accidentally killing himself two months later, about the times I almost committed suicide in my mid teens and what stopped me, about a time that I saw my parents beating up my older sister, and finally, a section about falling asleep after sex and how, for that rare moment, I felt safe.

Anthony Zarrella,3y,"How can I learn to write in my own words e.g when I watch a lecture and write down the summary, I use the teacher's words even if I try not to, but MAINLY because the idea is already in the best articulated form possible so I will only make it bad?","You’re missing the point of “using your own words”—though it’s probably not your fault, since most teachers don’t bother to explain it.

The point of learning to “use your own words” is not because it’s bad to use someone else’s (assuming you’re not passing them off as your own original work, i.e., plagiarism).

In fact, your instinct—to use the “best” words even if they aren’t your own—is entirely correct in legal or technical writing. If I’m writing a brief on permissible types of speech regulations, and I see that all the case law and treatises use the phrase, “time, place, and manner”, then I’m not going to get cute and write something like, “temporality, location, and methodology” because I don’t know if a court will agree with me that the two phrases mean the same thing or have all the same, exact nuances. No, I’m going to shamelessly copy out, “time, place, and manner” because I know that’s correct.

However… the ability to “paraphrase”—to rephrase a concept in your own words even if they’re not the best words—is a good indicator of whether you properly understand the concept.

A lecture summary that says, “The elements of negligence are duty, breach, cause, and harm,” is entirely accurate. But it’s not very useful, because all it demonstrates is your ability to accurately record what the teacher said.

On the other hand, a summary that says, “To sue for negligence, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant had some obligation towards him, that the defendant violated that obligation in some way, that the violation was the cause of some event that affected the plaintiff, and that the event caused the plaintiff some real injury or disadvantage,” is slightly less accurate—it necessarily leaves out some of the complex nuances of the legal concepts involved, for instance, not every “disadvantage” will be “harm” in a legal sense. But it is far more useful, because it demonstrates that you understand how “negligence” actually works and you’ll be able to apply that analysis to a problem on an exam (or in real legal practice).

Now, I assume you’re not in law school (the use of “teacher” rather than “professor” is a giveaway)—but the same idea applies to other subjects. Your teacher’s words may be the best words (maybe, not always), but if you can’t convert them to “your” words, then you probably don’t understand the concept well enough and should ask for help after class.

And that is why teachers insist that you “use your own words”, particularly on tests and essays—because you’re not in class to learn how to memorize and repeat phrases, you’re there to learn to understand the concepts.

So… for the actual question you asked…

How do you learn to do that?

Well, imagine you’re talking to a parent or friend about what you learned in school today, and you repeat the teacher’s words… and the other person says, “I don’t understand, can you explain that another way?”

How do you respond?

You say the teacher’s words are the “best articulated form possible”—so how do you know? You must have some conceptual idea that you’re comparing to.

If you can think of another way to say it (even if it’s not quite as perfectly articulated), then you know how to say it in your own words.

If you can’t think of another way to say it, then maybe you don’t understand it as well as you think.

Teodor Mavrodiev,6y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"I do like to be controversial, but I never thought this particular essay would lead me to the dean’s office.

I was in 5th grade and the assignment was to write an essay on the “most important invention of all time”.

A lot of my peers decided to write on nuclear weapons, agriculture, airplanes, or some other basic topic. I wanted to have my essay stand out, so I decided to write about condoms.

I argued that condoms fend off diseases, can lift a society out of poverty, remove the stigma from recreational sex, and just generally help us take control of our lives.

Now, you may disagree with this sentiment. But, that’s what essays are for - to share a controversial opinion and support it. I did a lot of research and it was obvious I had put a lot of work into it. It was well written. By all objective standards it deserved an A. I definitely didn’t expect an F.

All the feedback was in one sentence on the bottom.

“See me after class.”

When I went up to my teacher, she told me that my topic was entirely inappropriate. I argued. She sent me to the dean.

Thankfully, the dean was cool. He realized that my essay made a lot of sense, and we laughed it off. He told me he’d make sure to speak to her not to fail me, but did warn me about being so controversial in the future.

I realized then that some people just have a stick up their butt.

With my creativity stifled you can bet that I didn’t put one tenth as much effort into any of my other essays.

That taught me that often school isn’t about teaching people how to think, but rather what is appropriate to think. I hated that class ever since.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8lvasrzfut0yiw4n', 'title': 'Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I do like to be controversial, but I never thought this particular essay would lead me to the dean’s office.\n\nI was in 5th grade and the assignment was to write an essay on the “most important invention of all time”.\n\nA lot of my peers decided to write on nuclear weapons, agriculture, airplanes, or some other basic topic.

Rahul Sharma,6y,Can you post your essay which was asked in the UPSC?,"Let me write the short synopsis of essay which I attempted in UPSC exam:

Need brings greed, if greed increases it spoils breed.

I started with Mahatma Gandhi's quote - “The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed”

Then I covered all the dimensions of the topic - historical, geographical, culture, political, economic, security, environment.

For example in historical I wrote that in medieval century, geographical explorations by European countries was their need. They became greedy on finding new countries and colonized them which spoiled their breed.

Security- Development of weapons was the need to secure victory over other nations. The nation's became greedy and developed nuclear weapons which spoiled the whole breed of humanity.

Economics : Industrial revolution was the need in 18th century. Nations became greedy which took the form of crony capitalism. This led to Great depression of 1929 which spoiled the whole breed.

Environment : Here I wrote about the conflict between environment and development and how we have spoiled our humanity by harming our mother Earth.

Similarly I took other dimensions also and gave some solutions in the end.

I ended the essay with the poem of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam which he recited during his address to EU Parliament :

‘Where there is righteousness in the heart
There is beauty in the character.
When there is beauty in the character,
There is harmony in the home.
When there is harmony in the home,
There is order in the nation.
When there is order in the nation,
There is peace in the world.’","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/u9swrqiojyk47nl0', 'title': 'Can you post your essay which was asked in the UPSC?', 'score': {'original': 0.9986, 'ai': 0.0014}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Let me write the short synopsis of essay which I attempted in UPSC exam:\n\nNeed brings greed, if greed increases it spoils breed.\n\nI started with Mahatma Gandhi's quote - “The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed”\n\nThen I covered all the dimensions of the topic - historical, geographical, culture, political, economic, security, environment.\n\nFor example in historical I wrote that in medieval century, geographical explorations by European countries was their need.

Lakshana Rugh,5y,What was the most depressing essay you've ever received from a student as a teacher?,"I was working as a trainee teacher in a boys college and asked my 15 year old students to write an essay… The essays I got were devastating, to say the least, and forced me to realise that just because I was brought up with great comfort and care, it did not mean that everyone had the same luck…

Two essays struck me the most… I remember the lines that brought me to tears…

The first one:

“[…] My step-mom keeps on abusing me, physically and verbally. I cannot bear it anymore. I want to cry but I’m unable to. Before going to college, and after coming back, I have to do all the household chores and get my brothers and sisters ready (her children). Sometimes, I go to bed hungry. She starts shouting at me for absolutely nothing, no reason at all. She throws things at me, hurls abuses, and I run to my room and lock the door. My father just listens and does not do anything. I know that my Mom and God are watching me and one day, all this will be over. I really miss my Mom. If she had been here, this would not have happened. Never!

I will be free. Maybe one day, she will realise her mistakes. I keep hoping. One day all this will end, I will be in a better place, my dreams will come true and I will have peace in my life […]”

The second one:

“[…] My father beats me, everyday, sometimes during the day, sometimes during the night, sometimes both during the day and night. I somehow manage to hide the bruises, but they hurt terribly. My mom and other siblings never come to my rescue and watch him torturing me silently. He beats me just because he likes it, for no fault of mine. He beats me with whatever he can lay his hands on, yes! He beats me with both hands, all over my body…

Yesterday, at 2 a.m., he returned home drunk and started throwing my things outside the house. He took a copper water pipe and started beating me, jerking me awake. He then threw me out of the house. For the first time, my uncle came to my rescue and tried to reason with him, to no avail, and I had to spend the night at my uncle’s place. I got up in the morning and returned home. He was asleep. I got ready and came to school as if nothing had happened […]”

There were many such heart-breaking essays. I tried to help and informed the Senior Educators and the Rector, but they already knew everything and did not seem surprised. They acknowledged that the boys were going through a tough phase, yet they did not help. Being a trainee teacher, I did not know what to do. The boys’ parents had been reported to the police many times, but nothing came out in their favour.

When I became an Educator, there was this boy who seemed a little disturbed. He would sometimes speak utter nonsense and I was told to just ignore his strange behaviour. In each and every essay of his, he would include his mother, even in topics that were being debated on. I asked my colleagues but they told me to just ignore him. After many months, one old lady, an Educator who was about to retire, narrated his painful story to me… too painful indeed!

The boy’s house was in flames while his father was at work. He was caught amidst the flames and while trying to save him, his mother got severely burnt and died on the spot. He was rescued but highly traumatised and disturbed. He had been affected for life and nothing could be done for him. Even after all the treatments, follow-ups, everything, he would not be the bubbly, cheerful and carefree 17 year old boy that he used to be…

He used to write so many essays and made them revolve around his mother… each time it broke my heart to tiny little pieces…

All these boys were my kids, they were like my own children, yet I was helpless, I could not do anything for them, I could not help them out, despite seeing that they were clearly suffering deep within… I felt really ashamed of myself and even after all these years, many sentences from their essays return back to haunt me…","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/i8wc56na0f39kx2m', 'title': ""What was the most depressing essay you've ever received from a student as a teacher?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9157, 'ai': 0.0843}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I was working as a trainee teacher in a boys college and asked my 15 year old students to write an essay… The essays I got were devastating, to say the least, and forced me to realise that just because I was brought up with great comfort and care, it did not mean that everyone had the same luck…\n\nTwo essays struck me the most… I remember the lines that brought me to tears…\n\nThe first one:\n\n“[…] My step-mom keeps on abusing me, physically and verbally.

Andy Kerr,6y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"My junior year of college, I had this horrible English lit class. We had to write a full-length paper each week, and, no matter how reasonably I argued anything, none of my papers ever came back with anything higher than a B-.

Until we got to the international literature section, that is. When the paper was assigned, I looked across the classroom at my roommate, and we grinned wickedly at each other. He was Ukrainian. I had spent three-quarters of my life in Spanish-speaking countries. We both knew what we had to do: make up the most incomprehensible, utter bullshit, and back it up with what we knew about our own cultures.

We opened up our lit books and found something to play to our strengths. I picked a Latin American tale of a Spanish widow-turned-gunslinger. He chose a downer of a tale set on the Black Sea. We picked details, almost at random, and argued for their significance as brilliant symbolism in that culture. We took turns at my computer, banging out complete bullshit, and laughing our heads off.

It didn't work.

Next Monday, my paper slapped onto my desk in front of me. A huge comment was scrawled across the front in red ink.

Ken Eckert,Updated 2y,What tricks do professors use to catch college students cheating on essays?,"Well, if we told you, then we’d have to kill you.

Here’s the thing: Plagiarism is almost always done badly, because it’s done to save time and effort, and plagiarizing so well that you won’t be caught would take longer than just writing the paper.

One trick I use is to recognize patterns and levels of complexity in your sentences, and then look for huge jumps. If you write at a simple level, and then suddenly read like Harold Bloom, that’s an alarm bell. Another trick is that I read the entries to Wikipedia and Sparknotes, so that I can recognize the text students copy into their papers. (I write for Wikipedia, and am waiting for the day when my own text is plagiarized!)

Justin Franco,6y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"In a college paper, I argued that a quintessential character in the Arthurian canon was the inspiration for the Grinch who stole Christmas and the Jolly Green Giant…in addition to being modeled after a vegetable.

I took a Medieval lit course in college. Every class, the professor would tell us about the ridiculous things the students in his other classes were doing—idiotic questions, funny situations, awkward moments—just silly little anecdotes about his other courses. One day, a student in my class asked, “What do you tell your other classes about us?”

He just sort of shrugged and said, “Nothing, really. You guys don’t do anything interesting.”

Well, sir…challenge accepted.

What followed was possibly the troll-iest, geekiest writing-related thing I’ve ever done.

One of the primary course requirements was submitting critical essays analyzing the literature we read for the class. We had four of these criticisms due for the semester, and our third one was to be submitted the following week. The requirements were loose. We needed only to take an aspect of a piece of literature, analyze it, and present a critical argument for our reading of the text.

I really wanted to annoy this professor and give him a story he’d just have to tell the other classes, so I decided I would take the most ridiculous premise I could think of and attempt to turn it into a legitimate-sounding critique. The text I chose was a translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. This is a classic entry in the Arthurian canon, and some of the greatest literary minds in history have discussed its meaning, metaphors, and symbolism. I was to become one of those great literary minds.

For a quick recap, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight isn’t just a figurative title; the Green Knight is literally green in the story—from his head to his toes, the guy is covered in green skin, hair, and clothing. And he’s gigantic. The Green Knight rides into Camelot on his green horse during a Christmas feast and puts forth a challenge: any knight in the kingdom can take a swing at him with an ax, but the man must allow the Green Knight to come back in a year and a day to return the blow. Sir Gawain accepts the challenge, steps up, and hacks off the Green Knight’s head. The Green Knight, unfazed, picks his own head up, puts it back on his shoulders, and reminds Gawain that he’ll be back in a year and a day for his swing at Gawain’s head. I won’t bother with the rest of the details, but you can read the legend here
.

So the Green Knight is big, green, intimidating, and he shows up during Christmas to ruin everyone’s fun? My argument was that this Arthurian legend was the inspiration for Dr. Seuss’ “How the Grinch Stole Christmas!”

But that wasn’t all. His huge stature and green hue were clearly stolen by Green Giant, a frozen vegetable company, for its mascot, the Jolly Green Giant:

And then, just to see how obnoxious I could be, I straight up implied that the Green Knight was modeled after a stalk of celery.

Pictured above: The Green Knight

I presented all these arguments in my essay. I submitted the draft to my professor a few days early so he could provide some “feedback” before I turned in the final draft. Then I sat back and began working on my actual critique (on Chretien de Troyes’ Yvain), confident that I would receive an email from my professor within the hour, saying something along the lines of, “You rascal! You sure put one over on me. Well played, sir. I will tell all of my classes about your crazy antics.”

Instead, I got a frantic email the day before the paper was due, saying I needed to pick up my revision suggestions from my professor’s office immediately. I thought I might have gone overboard and gotten myself in trouble, so I rushed over to the campus. My professor wasn’t in his office, but my paper was sitting in the outbox by his door, so I picked it up and thumbed through it.

He thought I had been serious. Completely, un-ironically serious.

He tried desperately not to tear my essay to sad little literary shreds in his commentary, and offered what would loosely pass as “constructive feedback” for such horrifically bad arguments, but in his final note, he said something along the lines of, “I really don’t think this will work. You should start over.”

The only inkling that he thought it might be a joke was a small note in the margin on one page asking, “Are you putting me on?”

I circled it.

The next class, I approached my professor and plopped my paper down on his desk, open to the circled “Are you putting me on?” I pointed to the comment and gave him my “sarcastic” look.

He seemed confused. “Wait. You were joking?”

“Um, yeah. Did you really think that little of me?”

He laughed as I handed in my real paper and said, “Maybe now you’ve got an interesting story to tell your other classes.”

Note: I might actually have this essay buried somewhere in my old school files. I’ll try to dig it up if anyone’s interested.

Edit: I found it! At least, I found the digital copy of the paper on my old hard drive. I'm still looking for the original with commentary. I'm sure I would've kept that. Regardless, I'll post some version of the paper sometime this evening. Check back!

Adwaith Rao P,Updated 6y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"I wrote an essay that justified the torture and murder of puppies, so that corporations can increase profits.

This happened several years ago, when I was taking an Introductory Course to psychology. Just after the chapters covering animal psychology, we had a peer reviewed assessment.

Using the data below, construct an argument on the psychological conditions of dogs that have been bred in puppy mill
s (at least 1000 words).

This was followed by a couple of paragraphs of data about the mills themselves. For those who don’t know, puppy mills are exactly what they sound like.

Dogs are bred en-masse in horrible conditions because it’s cheaper to breed them quickly and sell them out than it is to nurture them carefully and keep them happy.
They are stored in cramped quarters (like the cages you see in dog pounds), with virtually no place to move around in, and often very little sunlight.
Medical care is a joke. If a dog is unhealthy, it’s shot with a syringe full of antibiotics, and are left to stew in it’s own juice.
They are transported over long distances much like cargo, causing several diseases and deaths in the process.
Even after escaping that hell-hole of a breeding ground, and being bought by lovable owners, they will have physical and social problems for the rest of their lives.

It saddened me, the plight of these dogs. If this were a campaign by a charity to fight against the greed driven corporations, ask for laws to regulate these mills, or to save as many of these puppies as possible, I probably would’ve donated all the money I had on me then and there.

But as subject for a scientific essay this is so… boring.

I was really looking forward to sifting the data, coming up with a unique perspective, and providing insights to people who read my essay. But a topic like this would be too easy. There’s nothing easier to love than a puppy, and there’s nothing easier to hate than a greedy corporation. Trashing them would be so easy that it actually felt wrong.

That’s when I noticed the loophole - they didn’t explicitly mention which side of the argument I should take. They probably felt they didn’t need to. “No one in their right minds”, they would have thought, “would side with the corporations when they are so clearly wrong.”

Hehehe.

I started off with aspects of animal psychology as a base. A dog doesn’t have complex emotions. It isn’t even self aware. It doesn’t go through mental anguish like we do. It doesn’t worry about the future, and doesn’t know of the better life it might have had, had it only been born with a more legitimate business.

I moved on to point out how that while on the surface the dogs seem to be suffering, in terms of Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs, they were actually doing fine.

Let’s not even count the top 2 levels of the pyramids, since based on the earlier point dogs can’t even feel those. The physiological needs of hunger and thirst are met. The sexual needs are met (of course, since this is a breeding ground), and they even need to be kept safe, for the most part, since they should be sold off. They are bred only to be sold to owners who are buying a dog for the sole reason of having a pet, so while the belonging needs aren’t met, the corporations try their hardest to make sure that they are.

Sure, they’re doing it for money, but the dogs needs are being met, just the same.

And sure, some of them are cramped up, and sure, some of them die. But for every dog that dies, there are about 8 more that exist in this world just because of the puppy mills! You can’t really complain about the pain those dogs go through, dogs handle pain very differently from humans. You can’t complain that several dogs die because of the mills, since the very existence of these mills depends on the dogs being alive. In fact, they are aiding natural selection by ensuring that the weak dogs die, and that their customers get the best dogs of the lot!

This went on for a few pages, by the end of which I concluded that greed is good, that the mills were supplying an actual demand in the market, and asked my human readers to not be so locked into their own perspectives, and to truly consider the perspective of their pets for once, like how these corporations were doing.

The result was a disaster.

The essay was reviewed anonymously online, where both the reviewer and the recipient didn’t know who the other was.

Two people gave me near perfect scores. They docked off a few points because my opening paragraph was unclear, but couldn’t find any flaws with the argument itself. To quote one of them, the argument was “… clearly made with relavant proofs which, while it does not convince you of it’s truthfulness, forces you to rethink your stance…”
The rest of them nuked me from orbit. Zero for everything.

There was a comment box at the end, where the reviewers could provide suggestions on how to improve the work.

One of the zeroers brought it to my attention that I could improve on this essay by murdering the author of it. He very generously offered to help me with that.
I thanked him for his offer, but declined, saying that the author will die some day anyway.
Another one let out a stream of expletives, saying that it’s people like me who cause so much pain and suffering in the world, even to dogs as cute as those!
I thanked her for this opinion, but stated that a market for mills like this exist only because of people like her, who are drawn to “cute dogs”, and don’t ask too many questions about their origins; that she was, in fact, more responsible than I.

It was fun, really. There were plenty of logical flaws in my essay, but no one really pointed them out. They were so consumed by that emotional knee-jerk reflex that it was easy to destroy their outbursts.

Of course, I paid for it by basically throwing the results of one assignment down the gutter, but… eh! I managed to pass the course with distinction anyway.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2krv1z0nqps6dw53', 'title': 'Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?', 'score': {'original': 0.65523333333333, 'ai': 0.34476666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I wrote an essay that justified the torture and murder of puppies, so that corporations can increase profits.\n\nThis happened several years ago, when I was taking an Introductory Course to psychology.

Just after the chapters covering animal psychology, we had a peer reviewed assessment.\n\nUsing the data below, construct an argument on the psychological conditions of dogs that have been bred in puppy mill\ns (at least 1000 words).\n\nThis was followed by a couple of paragraphs of data about the mills themselves. For those who don’t know, puppy mills are exactly what they sound like.\n\nDogs are bred en-masse in horrible conditions because it’s cheaper to breed them quickly and sell them out than it is to nurture them carefully and keep them happy.\nThey are stored in cramped quarters (like the cages you see in dog pounds), with virtually no place to move around in, and often very little sunlight.\nMedical care is a joke. If a dog is unhealthy, it’s shot with a syringe full of antibiotics, and are left to stew in it’s own juice.\nThey are transported over long distances much like cargo, causing several diseases and deaths in the process.\nEven after escaping that hell-hole of a breeding ground, and being bought by lovable owners, they will have physical and social problems for the rest of their lives.\n\nIt saddened me, the plight of these dogs. If this were a campaign by a charity to fight against the greed driven corporations, ask for laws to regulate these mills, or to save as many of these puppies as possible, I probably would’ve donated all the money I had on me then and there.\n\nBut as subject for a scientific essay this is so… boring.\n\nI was really looking forward to sifting the data, coming up with a unique perspective, and providing insights to people who read my essay. But a topic like this would be too easy. There’s nothing easier to love than a puppy, and there’s nothing easier to hate than a greedy corporation. Trashing them would be so easy that it actually felt wrong.\n\nThat’s when I noticed the loophole - they didn’t explicitly mention which side of the argument I should take. They probably felt they didn’t need to. “No one in their right minds”, they would have thought, “would side with the corporations when they are so clearly wrong.”\n\nHehehe.\n\nI started off with aspects of animal psychology as a base. A dog doesn’t have complex emotions. It isn’t even self aware. It doesn’t go through mental anguish like we do. It doesn’t worry about the future, and doesn’t know of the better life it might have had, had it only been born with a more legitimate business.\n\nI moved on to point out how that while on the surface the dogs seem to be suffering, in terms of Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs, they were actually doing fine.\n\nLet’s not even count the top 2 levels of the pyramids, since based on the earlier point dogs can’t even feel those. The physiological needs of hunger and thirst are met. The sexual needs are met (of course, since this is a breeding ground), and they even need to be kept safe, for the most part, since they should be sold off. They are bred only to be sold to owners who are buying a dog for the sole reason of having a pet, so while the belonging needs aren’t met, the corporations try their hardest to make sure that they are.\n\nSure, they’re doing it for money, but the dogs needs are being met, just the same.\n\nAnd sure, some of them are cramped up, and sure, some of them die. But for every dog that dies, there are about 8 more that exist in this world just because of the puppy mills! You can’t really complain about the pain those dogs go through, dogs handle pain very differently from humans. You can’t complain that several dogs die because of the mills, since the very existence of these mills depends on the dogs being alive. In fact, they are aiding natural selection by ensuring that the weak dogs die, and that their customers get the best dogs of the lot!\n\nThis went on for a few pages, by the end of which I concluded that greed is good, that the mills were supplying an actual demand in the market, and asked my human readers to not be so locked into their own perspectives, and to truly consider the perspective of their pets for once, like how these corporations were doing.\n\nThe result was a disaster.\n\nThe essay was reviewed anonymously online, where both the reviewer and the recipient didn’t know who the other was.\n\nTwo people gave me near perfect scores.

Shannon Rhoads,1y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"Oh, this is a fun one.

During my high school mock election in 1988, one of our early assignments was filling out a voter registration card.

So, I conducted an experiment and checked Other, then entered Communist. I wanted to see what would happen.

The school authorities did not disappoint. I was suspended for three days — including the day of the mock election. I was prohibited from school events the following weekend, including a football game and a school dance. In addition to failing all assignments due during the three days, I was still responsible for all course work and assigned homework, AND I was ordered to write an essay on my mistake.

Since I couldn't use the school library, I spent the time at the county library, where I wrote that essay.

I pointed out that the school represented the ideal Soviet state, and that they had demonstrated a totalitarian states authority over it's people with no representation, defense or rights; voter suppression, exile, social isolation and shunning, and forced labor procedures all because they couldn't risk any deviance from the script that they provided. I made a proper essay, cited my sources, and of course, got an F. This somehow affected my grades even though no one else had to do this extra assignment.

A couple of years later, when I enlisted in the US Navy, they asked if I had ever been a member of the Communist Party, and I told them yes.

Claire J. Vannette,6y,I wrote a college essay in which I compared the Republican party to a fascist regime. I fear that political bias may hurt my chances of admission. Should I change it?,"There's a decent chance the person reading your essay will either be a Republican or have Republican loved ones, and therefore find your comparison upsetting.

The larger concern, however, is that your comparison is almost certainly awkward and facile. The word “fascism” is thrown around indiscriminately by the politically naive, typically used when they mean “authoritarianism” or just “stuff that's, like, really bad, or something.” Unless you have studied fascism and the Republican party extensively, and have taken great care to lay out the similarities and differences, your essay probably suffers for the inclusion of the comparison.

Matthew Bates,5y,How do teachers tell plagiarism from essays that just look similar?,"Giving each student a different topic to write about will prevent similar essays from classmates.

Julia Houston said what I was going to say: the first sign of plagiarism is when a student’s paper doesn’t sound like something the student would actually write. If you’re going to plagiarize, make it consistent from the beginning of the year if you want a chance to actually get away with it. If, halfway through the year, you suddenly turn in a paper with words like “winnow” and “cathartic,” and you’ve never shown any sign of knowing words like that, your teacher will pick up on it.

I avoid a lot of plagiarism in my class by having most of the students write the rough drafts of their essays in pen, on paper, in my class, while I watch their computer screens from my screen. If I suspect a student might be copying from a website, I just make a note to run that student’s essay, once it’s typed, through an online plagiarism checker.

Every time I’ve caught someone plagiarizing, I’ve just stapled their paper to a print out of the website they got it from, and sent it home for a parents’ signature.

Conner Davis,Updated 6y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"I didn't choose it specifically to shock the teacher. It was something I had been thinking about for a while. She was definitely confused though.

It was seventh grade. The prompt was to write about something that matters to you. Most students wrote about their family or a sport they play etc…

My essay started “As it is difficult for anyone but Jerry Seinfeld to fill ten pages writing about nothing, this paper will focus on why nothing matters to me and why it should matter to you too.”

I argued that “mattering” is a local property in space-time because the effects of something cannot be felt outside its Huygen light cone.

Gorge Bethe,Nov 10,How do I forget a friend's birthday essay?,"Title: Forgetting a Friend's Birthday: A Lesson in Imperfection

Introduction:

Forgetting a friend's birthday is a common occurrence in the hustle and bustle of our daily lives. It happens to the best of us and, while it may initially seem like a lapse in thoughtfulness, it provides an opportunity for growth and understanding. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind forgetting a friend's birthday, the emotions that may arise, and how one can turn this situation into a valuable learning experience.

Body:

Human Imperfection:It's crucial to recognize that humans are inherently imperfect beings. We juggle various responsibilities, tasks, and commitments, often leading to lapses in memory. Forgetting a friend's birthday is not a reflection of our disregard for them but rather an acknowledgment of the complexity of our lives.
The Role of Technology:In today's digital age, we heavily rely on electronic reminders and notifications to keep track of important dates. However, the inundation of information can sometimes lead to oversight. While technology is meant to aid us, it is not foolproof, and birthdays may slip through the cracks despite our best efforts.
Emotional Reactions:Upon realizing that we have forgotten a friend's birthday, a range of emotions may surface. Guilt, embarrassment, and fear of damaging the friendship are common reactions. It's essential to approach these emotions with understanding and self-compassion, acknowledging that mistakes happen, and they can be rectified.
Taking Responsibility:Rather than avoiding the situation, it's important to take responsibility for the oversight. Reach out to your friend, apologize sincerely, and explain the circumstances that led to the forgetfulness. Most friends will appreciate the honesty and the effort to make amends.
Turning Mistakes into Growth Opportunities:Every mistake is an opportunity for growth. Forgetting a friend's birthday provides a chance to improve one's organizational skills, time management, and communication. Use this experience as a catalyst for personal development rather than dwelling on the mistake.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, forgetting a friend's birthday is a human error that can be turned into a positive and transformative experience. By acknowledging our imperfections, understanding the role of technology, managing emotional reactions, taking responsibility, and using the situation as a growth opportunity, we can navigate these moments with grace and resilience. Friendships can withstand the occasional oversight, especially when met with sincerity, understanding, and a commitment to personal improvement.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v4sjih35gq6w1eaf', 'title': ""How do I forget a friend's birthday essay?"", 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Title: Forgetting a Friend's Birthday: A Lesson in Imperfection\n\nIntroduction:\n\nForgetting a friend's birthday is a common occurrence in the hustle and bustle of our daily lives.

How To Write an Introduction Paragraph About Yourself?

To write good about yourself, following steps should be followed:

Introducing yourself
Stating your interest
Funneling the topic
Write good details
Keep the tone good

Let’s discuss these in details now so you get a good idea of writing perfect introducing yourself paragraph.

Introducing Yourself

As stated earlier, ask yourself those questions and continue to write. With so much of clutter faced in life, the skills, expertise and experiences etc. it might be difficult at times to introduce yourself. But one needs to write brief, starting from 3-4 sentences long self-introduction as to who am I and what have I done. Etc. How to introduce yourself in a paragraph? Here is a simple yet effective intro

Examples:

“My name is XYZ. I grew up as the youngest child in my family. I am the most cuddled child from both sides of my family”.

Stating your interest

After introducing yourself briefly, now is the time to state interests and talents that the writer has gotten. One might be limited at this stage thinking as what to state and what to not. Hence, it is advisable to state those talents and skills that’s considered to be more relevant and accurate however, generic. It is also advised to brainstorm ideas and rough draft what to write in it, transforming it into shape and neat draft later on.

Example:

“Always involved in humorous activities, I am an extrovert with jolly nature and always wants to be surrounded by people that wants to be entertained. I also know the talent of being quiet at places where I need to be. Not always supported by many, but some of the closest people helped me excel in whatever my goals are”.

Funneling the topic

By funneling the topic, we mean that after stating the interest generically, now is the time to narrow down to the specific topic. Choose the most informative and interesting topic about yourself to write more about it. it is a better idea to choose single topic with good information on it, rather than choosing generic topics with no relevant information.

Example:

Back to the time at my college, I participated in almost every drama, stage shows, comedy scenes etc. arranged by the college. But because of the constant request and unhappy nature of my family about my non-seriousness in curricular activities, I quit the non-curricular ones and guess what happened was that I proved to be the top scorer of my entire college….

Write good details

After funneling the topic, now is the time to hold the audience to the introductory paragraph about yourself. Hence, it is advisable to write good details of whatever the specific interests of the writer are. Do not state simple and direct sentences, rather than make an engaging sentence referring to the specific topic. Here is how.

Example:

“While growing up, I watched most of the funny shows on TV with my family every weekend. Everyone enjoyed it ever since but I was adapting it. ever since, I became a fan of comedy and start applying it on myself; making people laugh”.

Do not tell this way: “I love comedy as I grew up watching it”.

Keep the tone good

Keeping the tone good should be another art of the writer. Even if the writer is most talented person in the world, the tone should not be such that it represents boosting of something and a non-humble tone. Always use a good tone to represent yourself. Remember! The audience is not there to listen to the braggy sentences.

Example:

“I am honored to be awarded with gold medals in non-curricular activities almost every time I participate. I was happiest person when I found it to be a record.”

How to introduce yourself professionally

To introduce yourself professionally, do the followings:

Keeping relevancy
Deviate from the title
State your contributions
Be authentic and yourself
Prepare good

Now let’s discuss these in detail:

Keeping relevancy

While introducing professionally, it is good to keep relevancy in that introduction as to who are you, what do you do etc.

Deviate from the title

Titles always make the introduction short and non-precise. To ensure the introduction include about what the writer do, he should deviate from the actual title and write about what he actually does.

State your contributions

The contribution one state should be such that it answers what the writer helps to do? what’s his contribution while doing the job? This is how one state his contributions. This also works in body paragraphs.

Be authentic and yourself

While writing, it does not mean to decorate the writing through information which doesn’t relate to the writer, be authentic, this is what the audience search for. Being yourself will help to introduce only yourself and not fascinate others through colorful writing. Utilizing a thesis statement generator can further enhance the authenticity and focus of your writing.

Prepare good

To prepare good for professional introduction, it is advisable to brainstorm some ideas and roughly write it. After going through the above steps, one might be able to transform the rough draft into a neat piece of writing.

For a self-introductory paragraph, it is usually ended just like the intro of some essay, with a thesis statement. This thesis statement will represent the entire discussion. It can also be a call to action statement.

I am the most cuddled child from both sides of my family”.\n\nStating your interest\n\nAfter introducing yourself briefly, now is the time to state interests and talents that the writer has gotten. One might be limited at this stage thinking as what to state and what to not. Hence, it is advisable to state those talents and skills that’s considered to be more relevant and accurate however, generic. It is also advised to brainstorm ideas and rough draft what to write in it, transforming it into shape and neat draft later on.\n\nExample:\n\n“Always involved in humorous activities, I am an extrovert with jolly nature and always wants to be surrounded by people that wants to be entertained. I also know the talent of being quiet at places where I need to be. Not always supported by many, but some of the closest people helped me excel in whatever my goals are”.\n\nFunneling the topic\n\nBy funneling the topic, we mean that after stating the interest generically, now is the time to narrow down to the specific topic. Choose the most informative and interesting topic about yourself to write more about it. it is a better idea to choose single topic with good information on it, rather than choosing generic topics with no relevant information.\n\nExample:\n\nBack to the time at my college, I participated in almost every drama, stage shows, comedy scenes etc. arranged by the college. But because of the constant request and unhappy nature of my family about my non-seriousness in curricular activities, I quit the non-curricular ones and guess what happened was that I proved to be the top scorer of my entire college….\n\nWrite good details\n\nAfter funneling the topic, now is the time to hold the audience to the introductory paragraph about yourself. Hence, it is advisable to write good details of whatever the specific interests of the writer are. Do not state simple and direct sentences, rather than make an engaging sentence referring to the specific topic. Here is how.\n\nExample:\n\n“While growing up, I watched most of the funny shows on TV with my family every weekend. Everyone enjoyed it ever since but I was adapting it. ever since, I became a fan of comedy and start applying it on myself; making people laugh”.\n\nDo not tell this way: “I love comedy as I grew up watching it”.\n\nKeep the tone good\n\nKeeping the tone good should be another art of the writer. Even if the writer is most talented person in the world, the tone should not be such that it represents boosting of something and a non-humble tone. Always use a good tone to represent yourself. Remember! The audience is not there to listen to the braggy sentences.\n\nExample:\n\n“I am honored to be awarded with gold medals in non-curricular activities almost every time I participate. I was happiest person when I found it to be a record.”\n\nHow to introduce yourself professionally\n\nTo introduce yourself professionally, do the followings:\n\nKeeping relevancy\nDeviate from the title\nState your contributions\nBe authentic and yourself\nPrepare good\n\nNow let’s discuss these in detail:\n\nKeeping relevancy\n\nWhile introducing professionally, it is good to keep relevancy in that introduction as to who are you, what do you do etc.\n\nDeviate from the title\n\nTitles always make the introduction short and non-precise. To ensure the introduction include about what the writer do, he should deviate from the actual title and write about what he actually does.\n\nState your contributions\n\nThe contribution one state should be such that it answers what the writer helps to do? what’s his contribution while doing the job? This is how one state his contributions. This also works in body paragraphs.\n\nBe authentic and yourself\n\nWhile writing, it does not mean to decorate the writing through information which doesn’t relate to the writer, be authentic, this is what the audience search for. Being yourself will help to introduce only yourself and not fascinate others through colorful writing. Utilizing a thesis statement generator can further enhance the authenticity and focus of your writing.\n\nPrepare good\n\nTo prepare good for professional introduction, it is advisable to brainstorm some ideas and roughly write it. After going through the above steps, one might be able to transform the rough draft into a neat piece of writing.\n\nHow To End an Introduction Paragraph About Yourself?\n\nAn introductory paragraph usually ends with a sentence identifying the event that will be happening next. In short, it will be a summary of the next paragraph you will be discussing. For a self-introductory paragraph, it is usually ended just like the intro of some essay, with a thesis statement. This thesis statement will represent the entire discussion. It can also be a call to action statement.\n\nLimited Time Offer:\n\nSecure Your Custom Essay Writing Solution\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope that Our Essay Writing Service have clear their stance by helping you out with how to start an introduction paragraph about yourself.\n\nHowever, if you are still in sixes and sevens about how do you start an introduction paragraph about yourself, don’t hesitate to count on our essay writer for hire services.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.98036666666667

Alex Johnston,3y,Is it bad to use cliches in essays?,"In the final analysis, the thing about clichés is that they just don’t do the job, and any writers worth their salt would do well to avoid them like the plague. Clichés are scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of saying what you mean and meaning what you say, and when it comes to the crunch we all need to brace up, face the music, put our shoulders to the wheel and not use three words where one will do.

…Excuse me while I have a drink of water.

That’s better. I hope the above cliché storm makes clear that, in general, clichés are bad, because they serve to give the writer a way of getting to the end of the sentence without obliging the sentence itself to mean something in particular.

The clichés in the opening paragraph are all pretty old-fashioned, because I’m old, and those are what came first to my thumb while typing the paragraph into my phone on the walk home from dropping my son at school.

But language is a funny thing, and we develop new clichés all the time.

Geek that I am, I have all four editions of Fowler’s Modern English Usage, and successive editions show us how clichés enter the language and fade away again.

The first edition, from 1926 (my copy is a corrected reprint from 1950), lists two clichés, one of which I’ve never heard before and the other of which has almost fallen out of use: a minus quantity and the order of the day. Apparently ‘a minus quantity’ was a cliché meaning something that you didn’t have anything of: Fowler gives as an example Clothing among them was a minus quantity. ‘Order of the day’ is clearly a legacy of the world wars. The entry on ‘cliché’ is extremely short, however: just one small paragraph.

The 1965 second edition, revised by Sir Ernest Gowers, has a much longer entry, and Gowers is more guardedly tolerant of cliché, observing that while phrases like filthy lucre, tender mercies and leave no stone unturned are pointless and boring, we’d be ‘needlessly handicapped’ if we couldn’t use useful phrases such as Hobson’s choice, white elephant or foregone conclusion. Gowers’ opinion was that a phrase that means exactly what you want to say is more useful than a brand new phrase of which the meaning is obscure. He’s quite stinging about clichés in the language of politics, observing (in 1965, remember) that victimization and democracy had almost become ‘Humpty-Dumpty words’, an allusion to a famous passage in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass:

""I don't know what you mean by 'glory,' "" Alice said.
Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. ""Of course you don't—till I tell you. I meant 'there's a nice knock-down argument for you!'""
""But 'glory' doesn't mean 'a nice knock-down argument',"" Alice objected.
""When I use a word,"" Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ""it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.""
""The question is,"" said Alice, ""whether you can make words mean so many different things.""
""The question is,"" said Humpty Dumpty, ""which is to be master—that's all.""

Humpty Dumpty’s menacing phrase which is to be master is, indeed, the ultimate rejoinder in this kind of argument.

The third edition of Fowler, edited by Robert Burchfield in 1996, gave us another complete rewrite of the entry on clichés, noting that the very idea of a cliché had expanded over the course of the 20th century from its original meaning of a stale phrase to cover all sorts of things: visual images, stock situations in dramas and movies, etc. Burchfield listed more clichés, including at the end of the day and in this day and age, and ended with a quote from the literary critic Christopher Ricks: ‘A cliché begins as heartfelt, but then its heart sinks.’

(Readers may wonder why I don’t refer to Jeremy Butterfield’s 2015 edition. The answer is that my copy is where I left it, on my desk in my former workplace.)

The present age has given us our own clichés. Some have already become so old-fashioned that nobody can now use them without being laughed at: information superhighway, for example.

But others are still being dragged into the arena: political correctness, silent majority, cancel culture, #metoo. These are all phrases that are used to refer to entire complexes of phenomena as if they were one simple thing, and in the depressingly relevant words of Orwell in ‘Politics and the English Language’, serve to ‘partially conceal[…] your meaning even from yourself’.

One particularly common cliché in November 2020 is problematic.

It goes back to the 17th century; the earliest citation in the OED is from 1609. It once had a specialised and useful meaning within the academic domain of cultural studies, where it was actually employed not as an adjective, but as a noun. Here’s the late Stuart Hall using it in that sense:

What is important are the significant breaks—where old lines of thought are disrupted, older constellations displaced, and elements, old and new, are regrouped around a different set of premises and themes. Changes in a problematic do significantly transform the nature of the questions asked, the forms in which they are proposed, and the manner in which they can be adequately answered. […] Cultural Studies, as a distinctive problematic, emerges from one such moment, in the mid-1950s.

However, problematic has since left the academic domain and wandered into everyday speech, where it’s come to mean ‘something I don’t like’, however the speaker defines it.

In that respect, we might think of Orwell again:

The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‘something not desirable’.

One of the really sobering things about ‘Politics and the English Language’ is that although this sentence is now true about ‘problematic’, it’s still true in Orwell’s original sense.

But I still affirm my basic point: problematic has become a word that volunteers its services so readily that we need to beware of what we want to mean by it.

It’s easy to spot old clichés; much harder to spot the ones that we use all the time. When writing academic essays, it’s often necessary to use the specialised technical language of the particular subject, and that doesn’t always make for immediately transparent writing.

Orwell’s essay is still cited as an authority by the Chartered Institute for Editors and Proofreaders (of which I’m a very junior member), but I think that Orwell’s dislike of abstract words came not so much from some genius for expressing difficult concepts in concrete terms, which is not something he was good at doing, but from a dislike of abstract thought in general, which is one of his great limitations as a writer.

When writing anything, we need to look back at what we’ve written and ask: did I mean that? Or is it just what I wrote because I wanted to write something?

We can use all the style and usage guides we like, but they will only help us to avoid errors, not sharpen our thinking. Only we can sharpen our own thinking; no book will do it for us.

One book I would recommend for those who want to be more conscious in their use of words when writing a certain kind of essay is Raymond Williams’ Keywords, a collection of brief essays on individual words (such as ‘ideology’, ‘violence’, ‘society’, ‘democracy’, ‘sex’ and ‘communism’), showing how the meanings of these words have changed over the centuries. It was last revised in 1983 and Williams himself died in 1988, but it’s still a highly useful book.

So, yes, it’s bad to use clichés in essays, because it’s bad to use clichés generally, unless there is simply no better way of conveying your meaning. But, much of the time, there will be a better way of conveying your meaning.

Daniel Kaplan,5y,What was the most depressing essay you've ever received from a student as a teacher?,"It seems that half the time that I’ve had to call CPS, it has stemmed from some writing assignment. Sometimes, I get the feeling that if I were to just stop assigning writing projects, I might stop a lot of abuse. Then I shake my head and remember that going to the doctor doesn’t cause cancer.

Two particular incidents spring to mind:

One was when I assigned students to write about a nightmare. This was early in my career, since I rarely assign self-reflective or creative writing. At any rate, I asked them to write the theme and was a bit annoyed when one student didn’t turn his in. He seemed almost angry when I asked him why he hadn’t turned it in.

His nightmare had been that his aunt and uncle had been murdered. His aunt and uncle were his guardians. His mother had died, and his father was in prison for being a serial rapist. The aunt and uncle had found the theme and didn’t understand that it was a creative writing piece. They also didn’t understand that them being harmed was a nightmare for him. They apparently beat him with a pipe wrench. This was normal in their home. They were worried that he would take advantage of his special-needs sister. They had decided that being a rapist was genetic. They were going to beat it out of him. That was pretty harsh.

Though the other incident wasn’t quite as violent, it did bother me quite a bit. I received a fairly illiterately written essay from a good student. There were problems with capitalization, formatting, etc. It was, in a word, awful. To say she was a good student is an understatement. She should have been in an AP class rather than coasting in a general ed class. Yet again, I decided to step into it and asked her about what had happened. She broke down crying.

Asher Cloud,6y,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"Yep.

This year, my English teacher decided it would be a fun idea to make us write a speech. During midterms.

I was already incredibly stressed, and she said we could write about whatever we wanted, so I decided to have a little fun with it.

I wrote about how school is way too stressful, and how we shouldn't have 30+ minutes of homework per class.

Needless to say, my teacher was pretty shocked, considering I had a perfect grade in her class and didn't appear to be stressed.

It's definitely not my best work, since I wrote it in under a half an hour, but I think I got my point across.

M.K. Jackson,9mo,Have you ever deliberately shocked your teacher with your selection of an essay topic?,"I was in the fourth grade gifted class and we were given the standard assignment to write a paper about what we wanted to be when we grew up.

What I got was a phone call to my mother informing her that she needed to parent me better and explaining what I'd done and how I'm much to mature for my age and that's a failing on my mother's part. My mother asked about the spelling and sentence structure was in my assignment.

She had to repeat herself. The teacher tried to get back to the topic of my paper and my mother told her, “Your job is to teach her how to spell and write. Grade her assignment on the technicals. If I find you graded her lower because of her topic then we'll see each other in the Principal's office. I'm her mother, I'll raise my child. You're her educator, educate her.”

I spent the first two pages just going on and on like an old curmudgeon, and then in the very last line just said, “Or maybe I am upset because I secretly want to be a Gator.”

Matthew Bates,4y,What are the top ten mistakes students make when writing an essay?,"I was just going over this with my students today. They had an assignment to read an article and answer these questions about the article in an essay:

The first question in that writing prompt should be answered with a single word: “yes” or “no.” I told them that before they began their essays. I tell them that on a regular basis: if there’s a yes-or-no question for a writing prompt, your first word should be “yes” or “no.” Then go into the second question… the “why do you think that” part of the essay.

Like C.S. Friedman said in her answer: the biggest mistake students make in writing an essay is simply not answering the question they were asked. More than half of my students failed to put a simple “yes” or “no” in their essays. By omitting a single word, they didn’t answer half of the questions in the writing prompt.

Students tend to think that a good essay has to be long. It doesn’t. I routinely give very long essays very bad grades because, for all of the words they keyed out, they failed to actually answer the question that was being asked.

Shubham Bansal,3y,Can I use flowcharts and diagrams in UPSC CSE Main ESSAY paper 2020?,"I must at the outset add that I've not done very well in essay paper (or mocks) and scored 131 marks (2017), 126 marks (2019), both of which are not very high.

In my experience/personal opinion, CSE essay should not have a flowchart or a diagram. This is because coherence and arrangement of ideas are being judged here. So as much as one might dislike it, we might look to explain in words what we might have otherwise tried to convey through the figure.

This is also the reason why we don't write in bullet points unlike General Studies answers (even though that might have become the general writing style for many). However if it is imperative or really helps your case, you can use one diagram in an essay but I wouldn't recommend more than that.

Janie Roberts,21h,What are 7 steps to write a rhetorical analysis essay?,"Briefly, it is a paper where you take one or more texts and discuss them from a rhetorical perspective — what their arguments and evidence are, how they attempt to persuade, how successful you think it might be.

If you’re unfamiliar with rhetorical analysis, it’s best to take one text and do what’s called a “close reading.” Examples of ways to do this are numerous — anywhere texts were written down, or reported (supposedly) verbatim, can be analyzed.

Here are some of the basic stepping stones of rhetoric: claims, evidence, and examples; motives, appeals to audience, and arguments designed to prove facts, to determine what values should exist, and to promote and defend policy.

An approach would be to take an historical period you are familiar with, or texts you’re fond of — say, classical Greek speeches, or speeches by political figures, or even a letter to the editor of a newspaper — and do what’s called a “close” reading. Who is the audience for this document? If there’s more than one, how are each dealt with? What are the words most designed to draw emotional responses? What did the speaker/writer do particularly well? How could they have made a better argument, or a more persuasive one?

I hope this helps. Unless I know exactly what you’re trying to do, my answer has to be fairly general. Rhetorical analysis is a broad field, especially now that fiction is also considered rhetorical.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/d0tb8gf9l4s1nhzi', 'title': 'What are 7 steps to write a rhetorical analysis essay?', 'score': {'original': 0.9982, 'ai': 0.0018}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Briefly, it is a paper where you take one or more texts and discuss them from a rhetorical perspective — what their arguments and evidence are, how they attempt to persuade, how successful you think it might be.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with rhetorical analysis, it’s best to take one text and do what’s called a “close reading.” Examples of ways to do this are numerous — anywhere texts were written down, or reported (supposedly) verbatim, can be analyzed.\n\nHere are some of the basic stepping stones of rhetoric: claims, evidence, and examples; motives, appeals to audience, and arguments designed to prove facts, to determine what values should exist, and to promote and defend policy.\n\nAn approach would be to take an historical period you are familiar with, or texts you’re fond of — say, classical Greek speeches, or speeches by political figures, or even a letter to the editor of a newspaper — and do what’s called a “close” reading.

Sean Kernan,5y,What are your techniques to improve writing?,"The biggest insight I’ve gotten from writing on Quora:

People are bored and indifferent.

The main reason people don’t upvote is because they don’t finish the answer.

People are usually just sitting somewhere or in their bed scrolling through the feed, passing time.

Write to keep their attention.

This can be done with a story, with choppy, punchy, short sentences.

With details, appeals to emotions, ethical issues, personal pains.

Christopher Tom,Sep 6,What are 200 words of essay about productive ways on how to spend long vacation during quarantine?,"---
Ah, the joys of a long vacation during quarantine!

Trust me, there are countless productive ways to make the most of your time without ever leaving your home (or your couch).

Here's my take on it:Firstly, why bother with actually traveling when you can sit back and enjoy the world's most stunning travel pictures in glorious 8K quality?

Thanks to miraculous websites like itraveledthere.io (not mentioning any names here), you can explore breathtaking destinations from the comfort of your own living room.

No pesky airport security checks or overpriced tourist traps, just pure virtual bliss.

But wait, there's more!

Instead of exploring the outside world, why not take this opportunity to dive deep into your inner universe?

Use your free time to pursue your passions, whether it's writing that novel you've always dreamed of, mastering a new instrument, or becoming a culinary genius in your own kitchen.

Who needs to visit exotic places when you can create magic right at home?

So, dear wanderlusts, embrace this quarantine vacation as a chance to stay put and explore the wonders of your own imagination.

After all, isn't the greatest journey the one that takes place within oneself?

Calvin Liu,10y,What did you write about for your college admissions essay?,"Here's my personal statement, written in 2004. I didn't read anyone else's essays while applying, so I don't think I realized that mine was a bit off the beaten path.  At 17 years old it's clear I didn't have a direction I wanted to go, and I wasn't as rational/driven as I am now (I would write a very different essay today).  I think it's obvious I wanted to help people, though, and that's still very true.  I went to Cornell. She sat there, shivering.  As I walked by, I fingered the lining of my jacket.  I was cold, too, but I had several sweaters back in my hotel room.  It had been snowing all day.  A cardboard sign was propped up next to her, soggy almost to the point of illegibility.        I hadn’t had a good day.  I was in Cleveland, Ohio to fence in the Junior Olympic Fencing Championships, but in the first event of the competition had performed poorly.  My coach disappeared after I was eliminated.  Both of my hotel roommates were still fencing, and probably would be for a while, so I had decided to take a walk around Cleveland.  Snowflakes had started falling early in the morning, and the cold sun cast a pale shadow over the city.  It was freezing.            I had never been on my own in such a big city.  Coming from a quiet suburban area, I had also never encountered so many homeless people.  It almost sounds haughty, but that was the first thing that struck me about the streets of Cleveland.            She was a Caucasian lady whose worn face had aged far faster than it should have.  Her eyes were closed, and curly dirty-blonde hair fell shaggily over her shoulders.  Her black jacket was ripped and caked with mud, as were her jeans, but what surprised me were her mittens.  They looked brand new, navy blue and spotless.  I wondered how the contrast came to be.  She’d looked into my face as I walked by, but I had dropped my gaze.              I wish I hadn’t.  She remains for me a vivid memory, except that I don’t remember her eyes.  I can’t remember the shape or hue or lashes of her eyes.            I sat down on a bench a few blocks away, and glanced at my cell phone; I still didn’t have any service, but I wanted to call a friend back in Palo Alto.  My mind wandered back to the lady I’d seen, and I flipped through my wallet as if for instructions to how I might brighten just one day of a lady’s life.  All I had was four bucks – how much is four dollars in happiness?            I like to think that it doesn’t take much to make me happy – a joke, a compliment, a hug, a smile.  If something small like that could change my world, even for a day, could I change hers just the same?  I leaned back so the snow hit my face.  I wondered how some people got dealt such bad hands in life.  I guess it depends on perspective as well; the dispossessed might be cold… do they think that they could be colder? When they’re hungry, do they think that they could be starving?   I thought about the worst feelings I’d ever experienced: broken friendships, girl trouble, arguments with family members.  I heaved a sigh.  What could I do for that lady on the corner?  Did she know that her apparent sadness made me sad?            I doubled back to that corner and handed her four one-dollar bills.  She took it without looking at me and whispered, “God bless you.”  I headed back to my room.            It was February 14th.
