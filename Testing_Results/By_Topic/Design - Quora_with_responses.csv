Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,7y,Should the Indian passport be redesigned?,"Of course. Indian passport is among the most boringly designed passports out there. It is designed by bureaucrats than artists. For such a colorful nation of brilliant variety, our passport is monotonous. Here is the interior of an Indian passport. It has nothing.

Now, here is the interior of an American passport. It has brilliant quotes and great many specialities of the land.

I say we make it 72 pages with each state & union territory given a 2-page spread, - the best wonder from that state could be used as the background image and some great quote from a literature of that region used as the text. The passport could be a passport for Indians to look into India - to take pride, joy and enlightenment.

We Are Here (WAH),Updated 2y,Which screenshot can get views?,"When I gave birth to my first child on September 3rd, I was excited, feeling her small and warm body between my arms.

But after 24 hours, my baby girl Mila failed her first test. She was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect.

After hearing that I cried so hard, and I couldn't breathe.

It's something no mother should experience.

Her body wasn’t getting the oxygenated blood it needs, her heart functions are all missed up, and blood flow in the wrong directions, and they also found a hole in her heart.

Her first week of life has been lots of poking, blood drawing, and test after test, and it was very hard for me to see that every time, I couldn't eat even after being exhausted from the surgery.

The only thing I wanted to hear is the doctor saying your daughter is gonna be okay.

To fix these defects, she had open-heart surgery and was in surgery for around 5 hours.

She needs to stay for 3-4 weeks, for more testing and surveillance, meaning more expense, until we can take her home for the first time, and hope she can have a normal life.

Please, we really need all of the support we can get whether it's a donation, prayer, or share, I'll appreciate every help.

Please I'm begging you for any support, that can help my baby. Please.

Geoffrey Widdison,2y,What is a product design detail that only engineers will notice?,"The mix of simplicity, low cost, and functionality, once you start seeing it, is hard to unsee.

There’s another answer here about pop-top soda cans, and I want to take it a step further, and look at the whole soda can.

That’s at least eight layers of soda cans, weighing multiple tons, and the only structural support there is aluminum skins, less than a tenth of a millimeter thick. how does it stay up? Because each of the cans is pressurized, so the internal pressure of the can itself both provides support and forces the aluminum to remain in a cylindrical shape, which makes it even more stable. Once the pressure is released and the can is emptied, it’s easy to collapse. And it can cheaply be produced in massive numbers at minimal cost and using minimal material.

This is exactly the kind of design that seems blindingly obvious when you’re used to it, but before it existed, it took a lot of very clever design to create.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gfj5c9183w74rk6v', 'title': 'What is a product design detail that only engineers will notice?', 'score': {'original': 0.2465, 'ai': 0.7535}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The mix of simplicity, low cost, and functionality, once you start seeing it, is hard to unsee.\n\nThere’s another answer here about pop-top soda cans, and I want to take it a step further, and look at the whole soda can.\n\nThat’s at least eight layers of soda cans, weighing multiple tons, and the only structural support there is aluminum skins, less than a tenth of a millimeter thick. how does it stay up?

Ruchita Ram,6y,What water bottle has the best design?,"Notebook Water bottles

As long as water bottles are concerned, all of them will carry water. The design comes into perspective when there are other things that need to be done for example maintaining the temperature of the water (hot/cold), or the leakage angle.

This bad boy here will fit into your bag like a dream. They have gone one step ahead with the design just so that it can be comfortably carried in your bag.

You do not need a big bag while you are travelling to fit this thing into it.

They have sizes too I believe.

Chukwuebuka Sunday,Updated 3y,What are the best examples of a really good design?,"The couple who used 2,800 bottle covers to create a beautiful bathroom floor.

The floor before;

They started working on it;

The floor after;

It took a period of four years for the couple Ellie Brodey and Tyler to save up the bottle covers.

This is a perfect design :

They first stuck down the covers in rows using silicone glue

Steven Haddock,3y,What was the biggest design flaw to ever occur in history? How was it fixed if it was?,"This is a suspension bridge

This is a very old technology, but it can solve a lot of problems. Essentially, you use two ropes or cables that are supported at each end by an anchored point. You then hang smaller cables from the two large cables, and then you use those smaller cables to hang a bridge platform. Suspension bridges give you one of the best load to weight ratios of any bridge type, can be used to cross very long spans, and are generally cheaper to construct.

By the 19th century, material science had advanced and so had engineering, so engineers could use very strong strands of wire cable to cross even longer spans. Suspension bridges started to be used for railroads. All the math worked.

But the bridges often didn’t.

Broughton Suspension Bridge - Wikipedia

Yarmouth suspension bridge - Wikipedia

Angers Bridge - Wikipedia

Wheeling Suspension Bridge - Wikipedia

An even more confusing problem - the cables generally didn’t fail - the bridge deck did. This made suspension bridges less attractive and often people went with more expensive options.

However, the engineers finally found out the problem - these bridges, because they were so light, were also very flexible. They had all failed because their flexibility subjected them to massive torsional forces from things like heavy winds or even people moving from side to side.

As such, suspension bridges were designed to be stiffer, generally by making them wider.

Like the Brooklyn Bridge, which is still doing fine over 130 years after its completion.

But sometimes, engineers forget stuff

This is the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Completed in 1940, it was one of the longest suspension spans in the world when it was completed. But, as you can see, it’s only two lanes wide.

And here’s what happened to it.

As you can see, the cables are just fine. The bridge deck has collapsed. Because it was so narrow, the bridge wasn’t very stiff and, as such, tended to flutter in even moderate winds. The wind that destroyed it was about 40mph.

Here’s what replaced it

The bridge deck on both of the spans was made much deeper and stiffer to resist wind forces. It’s just fine thank you on its 70th birthday and a twin was built in 2007.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/x5wfoirpnkasdhu2', 'title': 'What was the biggest design flaw to ever occur in history?

Kshitij Salgunan,Updated 8y,Aviation:,"Interesting question. Nearly half of the passenger airplanes flying today are leased by the airlines from big plane leasing companies. It is easier and cheaper to lease a standard white airplane and then just change its logos than repainting the entire plane (which some leasing companies may not even allow).

​
​
Decorative painting are expensive
Cost can run anywhere from $50K to $200K per plane. The 2-3 weeks of time required for such paint jobs will cause loss of revenue for that period.

More paint= More weight= More fuel = More operating costs
The paint on a fully painted 747 will weigh more than 250 kgs, while a polished skin will just weigh 25 kgs. EasyJet Airlines was able to reduce 2% of their operating costs by just repainting their planes with new thinner aerodynamic paints. When your annual fuel bill is $1.2 billion USD, then that 2% can mean a savings of $22.4 million USD. Suddenly a coating becomes interesting, doesn't it?

​

Colorful Airplanes have low resale value.
Painting an aircraft in a color other than white can negatively affect its resale value as the buyer will have to repaint the plane which will further add more weight to the plane.

The airliners which purchase brand new planes instead of leasing are almost always purchasing by using huge long term loans. This is a huge investment in a competitive market. They may themselves want to sell or lease their planes if things don't go well.

White has some significant thermal advantages over color.
A white object reflects all wavelengths of light, so the light is not converted into heat, while a colored object absorbs more wavelengths of light and converts them into heat, so the object gets warm.

In most cases, this is probably just a benefit in terms of keeping the cabin slightly cooler. In the case of 'plastic' airplanes (those built with composite construction), some airframes require the use of white paint on upper surfaces to keep some elements within limits. Early Diamond Aircraft designs had a 38° C
 outside air temperature limit, past which the main spar is not considered structurally sound.

Concorde had to be painted with a special, highly reflective white paint
 to mitigate the extreme heating effects that friction caused at mach 2.


This could be the reason how white became the standard color.

White is a nice, neutral base color.
Artists typically start out with a white canvas, or white paper - it's a color associated with ""blank"" and ""clean"". Starting with a white base coat allows the airline's marketing department to paint whatever livery they want on their flying billboards.

White doesn't fade.
An average airliner will have several paint jobs during its service life, but the longer you can go between having to repaint the plane the better, and if you don't have to worry about the paint fading and looking old for a good long while you can stretch the time between paint jobs without having your passengers start making snide comments about your fleet of flying hoopties.

All colored paints will eventually fade from exposure to sun and the elements, particularly exposure to the sun at 30,000 feet, where substantially more UV radiation is hitting the paint and accelerating the fading process.

White looks better and when it gets old and dull, it still looks good compared to a dark colored plane. Dark colors fade faster, dull, and when paint flakes off it just looks terrible.

​
​
​Here is a recent picture of a TWA L1011 that's been parked for about 15 years. Except for the faded red stripe the white part still looks good.

​
​
​Good visibility
One good reason for a white coat, is visibility. Not being able to see it in the sky, but visibility of corrosion, cracks, leaking oil and suchlike on the ground. White shows up this sort of thing best, so from a safety standpoint, white is a no-brainer.
In the event of an airplane crash, white color can be easily spotted on both water and land. It is also easy to spot a white plane in the dark.

""If it works, then we don't want to change"" attitude
Many big airliners are directly or indirectly owned by the government or big corporations which doesn't care about creativity or color. They just want the business to keep going as is. So they have a uniform color for their entire fleet which is often plain white.

But, there are many colorful airplanes too. Here are few pics.

Simple... isn't it?

So I was searching about SBI in Ahmedabad and I found this:

Gordon Moar,6y,What are some examples of cheap products that were 'unintentionally well engineered'?,"The IBM Model M keyboard
 would seem to fit this description.

Mass produced in the mid 80s to early 90s and, in the days before PC-compatible clones dominated the market, it was fairly ubiquitous in offices. Not the cheapest keyboard ever made, but they were enough of a commodity part that they would be routinely be discarded with their associated PC when it had reached end of life.

However the Model M offered nothing less than tank-like build quality - these things are HEAVY! - and an engineered-in durability that means the many that avoided the skip/dumpster are still perfectly serviceable today.

You can strip the Model M down and rebuild with nothing more than a couple of screwdrivers.
You can wash the keys and casing in the dishwasher and they often come out looking like new, even after 30 years (tar stains the only thing that persist, but that's hardly IBM’s fault).
They survive having drinks spilled on them thanks to their thoughtful splashproof design.
The switches and keycaps can all be replaced and tweaked/upgraded to suit the user’s preferences.
And most importantly of all they are GREAT to type on. Noisy, sure (unless you swap the switches for quieter ones), but the buckling spring design is robust and gives great tactile and audible feedback to the user.

So great is the Model M that even today people will seek them out and many copies/tributes exist. With the appropriate adapter even the earliest ones can be used with a modern PC. Try doing that with any other piece of technology from the mid 1980s!

The turning point came in the late 1990s when mushy, disposable $5 keyboards that came with commodity PCs became the norm and people started to realise what was being lost when companies like IBM, and their culture of building something to last, abandoned the market.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/isn13vg5zatkmubj', 'title': ""What are some examples of cheap products that were 'unintentionally well engineered'?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9995, 'ai': 0.0005}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""The IBM Model M keyboard\n would seem to fit this description.\n\nMass produced in the mid 80s to early 90s and, in the days before PC-compatible clones dominated the market, it was fairly ubiquitous in offices.

Max Williams,2y,"What is a ""design flaw"" of the male body?","This is specific to males, I think: hairy arse cracks.

Having hair in your nostrils makes sense - it’s filtering particles of dust and dirt from the incoming air, before it gets into the lungs. No argument there.

Another function that body hair has is to provide warmth. Again, useful.

A third function of hair is to make us more attractive, particularly to the opposite sex.

But, your arse crack doesn’t particularly need warming, and it certainly doesn’t need filtering: you don’t need to filter something unwanted on the way out, you just want it to get out as efficiently and completely as possible.

Arse crack hair acts simply to trap poo, making it take longer to wipe your arse, and means that there is more of a residue of poo in your arse crack afterwards.

In addition, very few females, on seeing a hairy male arse crack, ever thought “Phwooar, look at the hairy arse crack on that!”. Triple fail.

Kennen Rabino,Updated 5y,What is your ideal Quora logo?,"Here’s my version of the logo.

I made this with the handy MS Paint so the real deal can still be improved, but this one is just to give you guys a rough idea of what I have in mind for a Quora logo.

It’s a mix of small letters “q” “a” and “?”.

The “q” is the easiest to see and stands for “Quora” or “questions.”

Then it also has the “a” for “answers” and a question mark “?” to complete the message:

“Quora can answer your questions.”

Edit: Changed the red to be a bit darker.

Update 7/3: Thanks! Nice to know many of you enjoyed my answer. Anyway, I was wondering if the word “Quora” is still readable/appealing to users when the logo also forms as the “Q” for Quora? [see pixelated examples below for reference]

Lynda Rea,3y,What was the biggest design flaw to ever occur in history? How was it fixed if it was?,"A strong wind could’ve toppled the 59-story Citicorp Center, but the construction flaw wasn’t noticed until a Princeton University student raised concerns a year after its 1977 opening. To avoid panicking New York City residents, workers labored only at night to make emergency repairs, and the secret was kept quiet for decades.

The civil engineering student, Diane Hartley, contacted Citicorp’s architects to ask why she couldn’t get the math to work on her research paper about the building’s design. Hartley assumed her calculations were in error. They weren’t. Instead they revealed that the building’s unique configuration — perched on four stilts — made its corners vulnerable to wind load.

Making matters worse, when architects looked further into the situation, they learned that a hasty change during construction — in which beams were bolted rather than welded as originally planned — further heightened the risk of catastrophic failure.

It would take three months to make the repairs, and in the meantime, emergency management agencies put into place a plan to evacuate a 10-block radius of the building should it be necessary. At the darkest hour, Hurricane Ella threatened the East Coast. But fortunately the storm never made landfall. The repairs were made and the public was none the wiser.

Not just a drawing, but something that could potentially be used if it could be built?","Yes, actually, there is a grand total of one fully designed interstellar spaceship, the result of a program known as Project Daedalus.

It is a two stage unmanned interstellar probe based on a fusion drive and intended to be capable of reaching Barnard's Star within fifty years.

Joshua Alexander,Updated 4y,What are some elements people rarely consider when designing fictional nations?,"Nation-building, in the literary sense, is about knowing what brings people together and makes them unique from the people in the next land. What binds them, be that history, culture, ethnicity, or simply the roads?

It’s the logistical networks that ensure a people have economic health and military security, but no one thinks about frigging roads when they design their fictional empires. This is perhaps the most important element of how empires are able to win wars and secure peace.

Do you know the Romans invented the milestone, a literal stone they placed every mile along the roads they built, as a means of helping them calculate everything from travel times to how much food would be needed for the campaign?

Because of the Roman engineers’ mastery of how to build roads, bridges, and all sorts of other links across the empire, they could become war winners. They could do more with fewer soldiers, able to move soldiers from across the empire faster than any of their enemies. This meant that when someone needed killing, the best of the best could travel from thousands of miles to meet the barbarians at the door, who spent the same time to travel only a hundred.

This not only benefited the army, but helped improve trade along the empire, making travel faster and safer from Britannia to Egypt. Never underscore the economic advantage that most cultures bless their civilians when making improvements for their defense.

The Americans also demonstrated this during the American Civil War, where it was Union railways connecting the north that allowed troops and supplies to be shipped from across the country to where they were needed on southern battlefields. In this way, they were eventually able to whittle away the South, even as the South’s better Generals continued to win more strategic victories usually at a disadvantage. Rail was so important that the march of Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman made a goal breaking the back of the South’s logistical networks with his famous Sherman neckties, uprooting the metal rails and wrapping them around anything that would piss off the locals.

Even better, to get a feel for how the Americans like to fight, where logistics matter, look at the testimony presented from the book Flags of our Fathers, about the Battle of Iwo Jima of World War II:

... the movement of over 100,000 men, Marines, Navy support personnel, Coast Guard units across 4,000 miles of ocean for three weeks is a triumph of American industry galvanizing itself in a time of great national peril. At the outset of the war, Japan's naval strength was more than double that of America's, but across the American continent, the idling factories steamed and sparked to life. Most of the vessels came splashing off the industrial assembly lines in the six months before this assault...

... And it has not just been a matter of hardware. The civilians of America have mobilized behind these fighting boys. Behind each man on board the ships are hundreds of workers. In the factories, in the cities and towns, on the heartland farms; Rosie the Riveter, boy scouts collecting paper and metal, the young girl who would become Marilyn Monroe, sweating away in a defense plant.

Here is some of what those mobilized civilians have generated for this tremendous force: For each of the seventy thousand assault troop Marines 1,322 lbs of supplies and equipment. Some of it sounds weirdly domestic: dog food, garbage cans, light bulbs, house paint. Some of it suggests an island business office: duplicating machines, carbon paper, movie projectors. Some sounds like kids' camping gear: toilet paper, socks, shoelaces, paper and pencils, flashlights, blankets. Some begin to suggest a sterner mission: flares, plasma, bandages, crucifixes, holy water, canisters of disinfectant to spray on corpses. And some of it gets exactly to the point: artillery, machine guns, automatic rifles, grenades and ammunition. The transport ships carry six thousand five-gallon cans of water, enough food to feed the population of Atlanta for a month or the assaulting Marines for two months. The Marines brought along one hundred million cigarettes.

By contrast, German soldiers might have 50 lbs each in supplies, the Japanese, 20 lbs. That’s how you win a war between empires.

What these represent, a powerful advantage that one nation can leverage that others have no answer to, those are strategic advantages. The Roman engineers and the American manufacturing mastery, those were and are strategic advantages that no one else could replicate at the time. When the Akkadians formed a single empire that secured not only the resources of tin, and copper, but also the trade lanes between them, they had a strategic advantage.

They had a ton of bronze that no one else did. Not only that, but their people became wealthier, healthier, and had more babies. More babies means more work can be done and more soldiers for the army. It’s a runaway effect that only grows if the trade networks continue to grow. When one culture gains an edge their neighbors lack, they look to one obvious conclusion.

“Huh. We can do whatever we want and no one can stop us, so we should gain as much strength as possible to secure ourselves from future threats.”

This is the break-out period for most empires. It’s true whether we are talking about the rise of the British Empire, the Rise of First Islamic Empire, Alexander the Great’s push eastward, or the American’s move westward (or really any empire, whatsoever.)

Beyond just logistical considerations, history also has a part to play.

Considering strategic advantage, studying the French is fascinating.

The French Revolution was truly revolutionary, where the changes decided upon by one people forced all their neighbors to abandon the old ways or be absorbed into the new order of the world. The French decided they were a people with a national identity that could rule itself. (Not that they were the first to act on that idea… ahem.) But they were the first to consider the common person a modern citizen and that citizens were in a sense owned by the collective nation. Thanks to new industrial processes that could make arms easy enough for common peasants to quickly be trained up to the point of lethality, you could have something actually revolutionary — a national draft capable of fielding millions of soldiers. Before, armies were measured mostly in the tens of thousands of professional soldiers. A national military draft of peasant trash would never have been considered before the French Revolution paved the way, not just technologically speaking but for a nation to have such rights over the people. But hey, it worked for the French (actually it didn’t. Horribly bloody affair that revolution.) But what came out of it was the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, a military genius who, for all his faults, knew how to use his new military capability and reform the way armies were structured. His reforms are still the backbone of how western militaries operate today, down to the medals we wear, the regimented structure, and even the vocabulary (where is the “r” in Colonel?)

While not successful in taking the French Empire into the a future of ruling all of Europe, his enemies saw him as the genius he was.

And because of that, all of Europe was forced to transform itself right along with the French. Nationalism wasn’t so much a wave of great ideas. It was a model that conferred such a great strategic advantage to those who adopted it that if you didn’t, the French are going to eat you. People were forced to unify and see themselves not as separate feuding fuedal kingdoms, but as unified peoples with a common culture, common lineage, and a common destiny. Then they had to start working together or fade away into nothingness. See Germany:

Yes, Germany had to unify and modernize as an empire or France would have eventually overwhelmed them. The people who now consider themselves Germans would have been the subjects of an empire one way or another once Pandora had let that idea out of the box.

That said, most people had little choice in being ruled by distant overlords. Frankly, most had it better than perpetual serfdom under a king in his castle a few miles away. This is why people were begrudgingly content within an empire because they can see some measure of prosperity and security coming from it.

Finally, we should explore how a strategic disadvantage can forge an advantage through a few fateful choices. A look at the Japanese can teach us much about culture and resources. Japan is lacking in many natural resources other advanced nations take for granted. One of them is iron.

The lack of iron ore is a notorious set back to the Japanese Islands. This lack of iron makes iron and its alloys, such as steel, high commodities. It was simply too expensive to make into many things, such as the heavy plate armor of European feudal knights. This is why most of the armor we see from Japan is made mostly of woven mat, wood, and cloth. But one piece of technology stands against this fact. The sword. Japanese weapons, primarily that of the samurai swords such as the katana, show resource scarcity can force ingenious and revolutionary invention.

Because of the lack of iron native to Japan, blacksmiths (who weren’t occupied making heavy armor) mastered the art of making swords, folding the blade many times during manufacture, to give it a unique balance of strength, flexibility, and an ability to maintain it’s sharpness.

Likewise, the shape of the blade was key. It’s unique shape includes a long two handed grip and a curve. This curve is for slicing, rather than stabbing like other straight swords. The curve makes it easy for a practitioner to slice through the weak armor of an opponent, but only if he masters the powerful weapon.

To compensate for this, intense lifelong training around the martial arts was demanded to use the weapon. This training became an important aspect of the warrior class that now characterise pre-modern Japan: the Samurai. The Samurai perfected their craft to the point that they leveraged the difficulties of the weapon, into fighting styles that were efficient and deadly, such as mastering the sword draw itself to be a lethal technique.

And this culture, one of proud martial heritage, drive, and a constant quest for efficiency, spread throughout all of Japan. This would play an important role in transforming the nation when it modernized in the 1800s. Japan quickly rebuilt itself from a feudal society to a modern empire in decades, most importantly, through the building of a modern Navy.

Japan is a resource poor country and an island nation at that. This means that much of the wealth of the nation must be imported, and a strong navy was crucial for this to happen. This, of course, led to the Imperial period of Japan and World War II, where Japan sought to solidify its place among the world’s most powerful nations by overcoming its resource scarcity with imperial growth. Samurai culture was a major part of that story as the heritage of the samurai was passed on to the officers of the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy.

Some of that heritage led to their eventual defeat, such as suicidal banzai and kamikaze attacks, depriving the military of valuable and experienced warfighters all for a few yards of territory or to attempt to sink an enemy vessel, but it also led to their rise in the first place.

Japan is an interesting study of consequences. A lack of iron ore led to the development of a particular sword. That sword necessitated the creation of a particular fighting style. That style evolved into warrior culture around use of the weapon. That culture transformed Japan into an imperialistic naval power which almost conquered the Eastern Pacific.

Putting all this together, how might we write in strategic advantage into a story?

Let’s look at the animation Avatar’s Evil Empire, the Fire Nation, to see how a well written fictional nation provides a perfect setting for a good story.

In the world of Avatar, there are people who have special abilities to harness nature based magic. They can manipulate either air, water, earth, or fire. Rather than simply leave it at that, “yea, we use magic,” the creators of Avatar decided to consider how would a nation use their magic’s unique properties to transform their culture. Makes sense, actually. With the Fire Nation, this saw a mastery of fire to master metallurgy, allowing them to essentially become the first industrialized nation, but still reliant on a traditional social structure. This meant that they hungered for more resources and were the first to have truly imperialistic aims. Put it all together and what do you have? A medieval high fantasy with a modern military — a rather terrifying enemy to face if you’re the other guy.

What we can learn from that is that creative writers will know the implications of the rules of the world they create, and think about how nations would form and grow around groups of people who best take advantage of those rules. Who has the strategic advantages and how do they exploit them?

But because of this, real processes that make sense, you can do something that Avatar did that few others tried — they made the people of the fire nation human. You could go there and see how their specific traits affected their culture, but that they also had a culture. They were decent people who had a point of view and were likable.

Do that — make a nation that is simultaneously terrifying to people who oppose them, but who aren’t just evil people in scary masks. You do that, and you’ll create a people your readers won’t simply hate; but respect, enjoy, lament when they do wrong, and hope for a better future for them too.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/vf0u1h29e7pgy6t5', 'title': 'What are some elements people rarely consider when designing fictional nations?', 'score': {'original': 0.68788, 'ai': 0.31212}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Nation-building, in the literary sense, is about knowing what brings people together and makes them unique from the people in the next land.

Not only that, but their people became wealthier, healthier, and had more babies. More babies means more work can be done and more soldiers for the army. It’s a runaway effect that only grows if the trade networks continue to grow. When one culture gains an edge their neighbors lack, they look to one obvious conclusion.\n\n“Huh. We can do whatever we want and no one can stop us, so we should gain as much strength as possible to secure ourselves from future threats.”\n\nThis is the break-out period for most empires. It’s true whether we are talking about the rise of the British Empire, the Rise of First Islamic Empire, Alexander the Great’s push eastward, or the American’s move westward (or really any empire, whatsoever.)\n\nBeyond just logistical considerations, history also has a part to play.\n\nConsidering strategic advantage, studying the French is fascinating.\n\nThe French Revolution was truly revolutionary, where the changes decided upon by one people forced all their neighbors to abandon the old ways or be absorbed into the new order of the world. The French decided they were a people with a national identity that could rule itself. (Not that they were the first to act on that idea… ahem.) But they were the first to consider the common person a modern citizen and that citizens were in a sense owned by the collective nation.

Before, armies were measured mostly in the tens of thousands of professional soldiers.

But hey, it worked for the French (actually it didn’t. Horribly bloody affair that revolution.) But what came out of it was the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, a military genius who, for all his faults, knew how to use his new military capability and reform the way armies were structured.

Nationalism wasn’t so much a wave of great ideas. It was a model that conferred such a great strategic advantage to those who adopted it that if you didn’t, the French are going to eat you. People were forced to unify and see themselves not as separate feuding fuedal kingdoms, but as unified peoples with a common culture, common lineage, and a common destiny. Then they had to start working together or fade away into nothingness. See Germany:\n\nYes, Germany had to unify and modernize as an empire or France would have eventually overwhelmed them. The people who now consider themselves Germans would have been the subjects of an empire one way or another once Pandora had let that idea out of the box.\n\nThat said, most people had little choice in being ruled by distant overlords. Frankly, most had it better than perpetual serfdom under a king in his castle a few miles away. This is why people were begrudgingly content within an empire because they can see some measure of prosperity and security coming from it.\n\nFinally, we should explore how a strategic disadvantage can forge an advantage through a few fateful choices. A look at the Japanese can teach us much about culture and resources. Japan is lacking in many natural resources other advanced nations take for granted. One of them is iron.\n\nThe lack of iron ore is a notorious set back to the Japanese Islands. This lack of iron makes iron and its alloys, such as steel, high commodities. It was simply too expensive to make into many things, such as the heavy plate armor of European feudal knights. This is why most of the armor we see from Japan is made mostly of woven mat, wood, and cloth. But one piece of technology stands against this fact. The sword. Japanese weapons, primarily that of the samurai swords such as the katana, show resource scarcity can force ingenious and revolutionary', 'result': {'fake': 0.5877, 'real': 0.4123}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'invention.\n\nBecause of the lack of iron native to Japan, blacksmiths (who weren’t occupied making heavy armor) mastered the art of making swords, folding the blade many times during manufacture, to give it a unique balance of strength, flexibility, and an ability to maintain it’s sharpness.\n\nLikewise, the shape of the blade was key. It’s unique shape includes a long two handed grip and a curve. This curve is for slicing, rather than stabbing like other straight swords. The curve makes it easy for a practitioner to slice through the weak armor of an opponent, but only if he masters the powerful weapon.\n\nTo compensate for this, intense lifelong training around the martial arts was demanded to use the weapon. This training became an important aspect of the warrior class that now characterise pre-modern Japan: the Samurai. The Samurai perfected their craft to the point that they leveraged the difficulties of the weapon, into fighting styles that were efficient and deadly, such as mastering the sword draw itself to be a lethal technique.\n\nAnd this culture, one of proud martial heritage, drive, and a constant quest for efficiency, spread throughout all of Japan. This would play an important role in transforming the nation when it modernized in the 1800s. Japan quickly rebuilt itself from a feudal society to a modern empire in decades, most importantly, through the building of a modern Navy.\n\nJapan is a resource poor country and an island nation at that. This means that much of the wealth of the nation must be imported, and a strong navy was crucial for this to happen. This, of course, led to the Imperial period of Japan and World War II, where Japan sought to solidify its place among the world’s most powerful nations by overcoming its resource scarcity with imperial growth. Samurai culture was a major part of that story as the heritage of the samurai was passed on to the officers of the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy.\n\nSome of that heritage led to their eventual defeat, such as suicidal banzai and kamikaze attacks, depriving the military of valuable and experienced warfighters all for a few yards of territory or to attempt to sink an enemy vessel, but it also led to their rise in the first place.\n\nJapan is an interesting study of consequences. A lack of iron ore led to the development of a particular sword. That sword necessitated the creation of a particular fighting style. That style evolved into warrior culture around use of the weapon. That culture transformed Japan into an imperialistic naval power which almost conquered the Eastern Pacific.\n\nPutting all this together, how might we write in strategic advantage into a story?\n\nLet’s look at the animation Avatar’s Evil Empire, the Fire Nation, to see how a well written fictional nation provides a perfect setting for a good story.\n\nIn the world of Avatar, there are people who have special abilities to harness nature based magic. They can manipulate either air, water, earth, or fire. Rather than simply leave it at that, “yea, we use magic,” the creators of Avatar decided to consider how', 'result': {'fake': 0.5435, 'real': 0.4565}, 'status': 'success'}, {'text': 'would a nation use their magic’s unique properties to transform their culture.

You could go there and see how their specific traits affected their culture, but that they also had a culture.

What binds them, be that history, culture, ethnicity, or simply the roads?\n\nIt’s the logistical networks that ensure a people have economic health and military security, but no one thinks about frigging roads when they design their fictional empires. This is perhaps the most important element of how empires are able to win wars and secure peace.\n\nDo you know the Romans invented the milestone, a literal stone they placed every mile along the roads they built, as a means of helping them calculate everything from travel times to how much food would be needed for the campaign?\n\nBecause of the Roman engineers’ mastery of how to build roads, bridges, and all sorts of other links across the empire, they could become war winners. They could do more with fewer soldiers, able to move soldiers from across the empire faster than any of their enemies. This meant that when someone needed killing, the best of the best could travel from thousands of miles to meet the barbarians at the door, who spent the same time to travel only a hundred.\n\nThis not only benefited the army, but helped improve trade along the empire, making travel faster and safer from Britannia to Egypt. Never underscore the economic advantage that most cultures bless their civilians when making improvements for their defense.\n\nThe Americans also demonstrated this during the American Civil War, where it was Union railways connecting the north that allowed troops and supplies to be shipped from across the country to where they were needed on southern battlefields. In this way, they were eventually able to whittle away the South, even as the South’s better Generals continued to win more strategic victories usually at a disadvantage. Rail was so important that the march of Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman made a goal breaking the back of the South’s logistical networks with his famous Sherman neckties, uprooting the metal rails and wrapping them around anything that would piss off the locals.\n\nEven better, to get a feel for how the Americans like to fight, where logistics matter, look at the testimony presented from the book Flags of our Fathers, about the Battle of Iwo Jima of World War II:\n\n... the movement of over 100,000 men, Marines, Navy support personnel, Coast Guard units across 4,000 miles of ocean for three weeks is a triumph of American industry galvanizing itself in a time of great national peril. At the outset of the war, Japan's naval strength was more than double that of America's, but across the American continent, the idling factories steamed and sparked to life. Most of the vessels came splashing off the industrial assembly lines in the six months before this assault...\n\n... And it has not just been a matter of hardware. The civilians of America have mobilized behind these fighting boys. Behind each man on board the ships are hundreds of workers. In the factories, in the cities and towns, on the heartland farms; Rosie the Riveter, boy scouts collecting paper and metal, the young girl who would become Marilyn Monroe, sweating away in a defense plant.\n\nHere is some of what those mobilized civilians have generated for this tremendous force: For each of the seventy thousand assault troop Marines 1,322 lbs of supplies and equipment. Some of it sounds weirdly domestic: dog food, garbage cans, light bulbs, house paint. Some of it suggests an island business office: duplicating machines, carbon paper, movie projectors. Some sounds like kids' camping gear: toilet paper, socks, shoelaces, paper and pencils, flashlights, blankets. Some begin to suggest a sterner mission: flares, plasma, bandages, crucifixes, holy water, canisters of disinfectant to spray on corpses. And some of it gets exactly to the point: artillery, machine guns, automatic rifles, grenades and ammunition. The transport ships carry six thousand five-gallon cans of water, enough food to feed the population of Atlanta for a month or the assaulting Marines for two months. The Marines brought along one hundred million cigarettes.\n\nBy contrast, German soldiers might have 50 lbs each in supplies, the Japanese, 20 lbs. That’s how you win a war between empires.\n\nWhat these represent, a powerful advantage that one nation can leverage that others have no answer to, those are strategic advantages. The Roman engineers and the American manufacturing mastery, those were and are strategic advantages that no one else could replicate at the time. When the Akkadians formed a single empire that secured not only the resources of tin, and copper, but also the trade lanes between them, they had a strategic advantage.\n\nThey had a ton of bronze that no one else did.

Mason Bivens,Jan 19,What is the importance of wing loading in aircraft design?,"Wing loading plays a large role in stall speed, landing distance, cruise speed, turbulence sensitivity, and max speed. Wing loading is aircraft weight (W) divided wing area (B). Wingloading = W/B. It’s a ratio that ranges in typical values depending on aircraft type. Fighter jets have wing loadings around 110 to 135 lbf per ft^2. While gliders have wing loadings under 10 lbf/ft^2! (lbf is pound force)

Turbulence sensitivity. Have you ever noticed that the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds look so smooth flying in formation? They are barely affected by rough air (turbulence) the way a small GA airplane is. Flying Cessna’s that close together is asking for an accident, Cessna’s get tossed around! The Fighter’s stability in turbulence is due mostly to its high wing loading. High wing loading = smooth in turbulence, low wing loading = rough.

Stall speed sets the takeoff speed and landing speed. High wing loading sounds pretty great? Not so fast, the FAA and EASA have strict limits on allowable stall speeds for all certified aircraft. Most certified Part 23 aircraft carrying 2–6 passengers must have a stall speed under 61 kts (kts is knots). The manufacturer can certify above 61 kts, but they need to explain and prove how they mitigate the extra crash energy and the problems that increased stall speeds create. Low wing loading = slow stall speed

Landing distance. Most fighter jets require runways in excess of 8,000 feet long and have landing distances over a mile. The small municipal airport near you probably has a runway shorter than half that. Small GA airplanes can regularly stop in about 1,000 feet - even shorter with skill. US fighter jets (other than the A-10) touch down between 150–185 kts, that’s almost 200 mph! Touching down that fast takes some serious training, training that the average person wouldn’t be able to afford for a skill that quickly goes away. High wing loading (W/B)= long landing distance.

Cruise speed. The wing area that a plane carries with it becomes a drag (pun intended) when trying to reach fast cruise speeds. At cruise, less wing area equals less drag, and by extension the faster it can fly with the same power. That’s the reason fighter jets have such tiny wings and huge engines. Fortunately FAA and EASA primarily care about passenger safety and makes sure that GA aircraft don’t fall out of the sky at 200 mph like a fighter does. That means it’s harder for GA aircraft to reach super high speeds in flight. Higher wing loading (W/B) = faster. Lower wing loading = safer/slower

I hope this answers your question. The chosen wing loading determines the approximate aircraft performance in the areas mentioned above, but choosing the ‘optimum’ wing loading depends on other external requirements. In short, it’s complicated.

Wirawan Winarto,6y,Who designed the symbol of Indonesia?,"It was Sultan Hamid II, the Sultan of Pontianak.

And the story of this gentleman is not pleasant. His name was erased from our nation’s history and his name was not even mentioned in our history book up until the fall of Suharto in 1998.

Although he was born in royal family of Pontianak Sultanate, he was raised by British couple, Salome Fox and Edith Curteis. He was later married to Marie van Delden, daughter of a Dutch captain.

When United States of Indonesia (RIS) was formed, Sultan Hamid II proposed a design for national symbol. It was Garuda, a bird-God of Hindu mythology, the vehicle of Vishnu. The concept was approved by Sukarno whom later appointed Dullah, a famous painter, to redesign the symbol based on the concept.

One interesting thing about Garuda, the original design showed a bald human-like creature. It was later redesigned to be more bird-like, as well as adding hair above its bald head. It is said that its hair were added to avoid the bird looking similar to American bald-eagle.

Few years later, Sultan Hamid II showed his growing dissatisfaction towards the newly-formed republic. Considering Indonesia as an “extension” of Javanese colonialism, especially towards his homeland, Kalimantan. Until at one point, Sultan Hamid II decided to conspire with Raymond Westerling, Dutch military commander, to assassinate Javanese king, Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, and Head of Indonesian Military, Tahi Bonar Simatupang.

The rebels were known as Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA).

However the assassination plot failed. And the rebellion was diffused. Raymond Westerling fled to the Netherlands after the Dutch royal government successfully smuggled him to Singapore.

Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX ordered Sultan Hamid II to be arrested. He was imprisoned and his political rights were stripped. He was later perceived as the villain in Indonesian post-independence history, his name was erased from the history books, and he died in late 1970’s.

If you go to Pontianak make sure to pay a visit Qadriyah Palace, this is the palace that houses royal Pontianak Sultanate family. The palace was built next to River Kapuas, the longest river in Indonesia, near the Kampung Beting, a village that famous for its narcotics and drug-dealing activities.

Before his death, Sultan Hamid II told the royal family to “never let any Garuda symbol, picture, or statue mounted in royal house, until Indonesia recognize sultan’s contribution to the nation.”

Julian Frank,4y,"What product, not designed to be a weapon, would make a great weapon?","Allow me to introduce:

The crowbar.

Usually, crowbars are used to open nailed wooden crates or pry apart boards.

But used as a weapon, the crowbar can be absolutely deadly.

First off: notice how the crowbar has a sharp hook on one end?

With a good swing and good aim, this hook could easily do a lot of damage.

You could puncture a lung. Or take out an eye. Or burst a spleen. The possibilities are endless!

But that’s not even the best part.

Let’s say you hit someone with a blunt part of the bar.

A crowbar weighs about 5 pounds, and with a good swing, you could get the crowbar moving at about 35 miles-per-hour.

This means that a hit from a crow bar would deliver around 15,000 newtons of force.

To put that in perspective:

It takes about 3,300 newtons to break a human rib, and around 5,000 newtons to crack a skull.

Basically, a hit from a crowbar has enough force to break any bone in your body—twice at one time.

Long story short, if you happen to get attacked by someone wielding a crowbar.

You’re in for a very, very bad day.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rhmt9k3d1vsownx4', 'title': 'What product, not designed to be a weapon, would make a great weapon?', 'score': {'original': 0.9789, 'ai': 0.0211}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Allow me to introduce:\n\nThe crowbar.\n\nUsually, crowbars are used to open nailed wooden crates or pry apart boards.\n\nBut used as a weapon, the crowbar can be absolutely deadly.\n\nFirst off: notice how the crowbar has a sharp hook on one end?\n\nWith a good swing and good aim, this hook could easily do a lot of damage.\n\nYou could puncture a lung.

Haha, this is actually a trick question. Both X-rays are normal.

Bu-but, what’s this thing over here?

This, everyone, is called the epiphyseal plate. Also known as the growth plate. It is the area where bone growth occurs and thus, is only present in children and adolescents. When a person reaches adulthood, the gap fuses and the bones become one. Yes, both are normal x-rays, but the first one depicts the shoulder of a child while the second that of an adult.

The epiphyseal plate does not only occur at the shoulders. They are scattered all over a child’s skeleton. Take a look at this paediatric hand x-ray:

All those little knobs of extra bones in the fingers are due to growth plates. They will fuse with the main bones upon adulthood.

Sneha Mathews,4y,What are some awesome examples of simple yet innovative designs?,"You are in the car, going home after a long day of work.

You are tired and hungry, and you want to reach home as quickly as possible.

A traffic jam.

Your stomach then decides to curse at you, too.

For commuters in Mexico city, definitely.

Burger King's traffic jam whopper works by using real-time data to target hungry drivers along congested roads and highways for food delivery by couriers on motorcycles.

Customers can order using voice commands. While waiting for their order, they get personalized messages on billboards.

Once it is ready, the deliverer uses Google Maps and GPS technology to weave through traffic and deliver the order.

This project has helped Burger King increase deliveries by 63% and it became the number one fast food app in Mexico City.

Wayne Mulligan,Updated 5y,"In design and innovation, what is the most elegant idea ever?","The Paperclip:

Here's why:

It was truly ""invented"" - paperclips, unlike the wheel, weren't based on a naturally occurring shape
Functionally Darwinistic - It was invented over 120 years ago and the design hasn't changed a bit...optimal evolution occurred on Day 1
True elegance -- accomplishes a simple objective (binds pieces of paper) without disturbing the media it interacts with
If you modify the design at all its functionality is diminished greatly - again, highlighting its optimal design
However, the design can be easily modified to suit other needs (i.e. it's versatile) -- how many times have you unfolded a paperclip in order to reset your old CD ROM drives? :)

Rebecca Williams,Dec 4,Why is the design of the C-130 being so successful?,"The design of the C-130 is so successful because it combines several features that make it a versatile, reliable, and efficient aircraft for tactical airlift missions. Some of these features are:

A high-wing, four-engine turboprop configuration that provides high lift, low drag, and good stability. The high-wing design also allows the aircraft to have a large cargo door and ramp at the rear, which facilitates the loading and unloading of cargo and personnel. The four-engine turboprop configuration provides more power and fuel efficiency than jet engines and also enables the aircraft to operate from short, rough, and unprepared runways.
A spacious and flexible cargo compartment that can accommodate a wide range of payloads, such as troops, vehicles, equipment, supplies, and even other aircraft. The cargo compartment can also be configured for different roles, such as medical evacuation, aerial refueling, firefighting, and airborne command and control. The C-130 can carry up to 42,000 pounds of cargo, or up to 92 passengers, or 64 paratroopers, or 74 litter patients.
A robust and adaptable airframe that can withstand harsh environments and demanding operations. The C-130 has a strong and durable structure that can resist corrosion, fatigue, and damage. It also has a modular design that allows for easy maintenance and modification. The C-130 can operate in extreme temperatures, altitudes, and weather conditions, and can perform various maneuvers, such as airdrops, low-level flights, and assault landings.

Pete Feigal,1y,What are the deadly design flaws of the B-17 Flying Fortress?,"After 400 early B-17s crashed on landing, eventually blamed on the pilot, when every part of the B-17 seemed to be just perfect, Air Force Psychiatric examiners discovered…

(Left — right): Switches for Landing Gear & Wing Flaps, identical and almost next to each other-400 crashes later the problem was discovered.)

So close to each other in fact, that exhausted pilots approached the runway and flipped the switch for what they believed to be the landing gear, but instead flipped the wing flaps switch, slowing their descent and then grounding the plane, crashing it into the ground.

This breakthrough led to the coining of the term “Designer Error”, essentially absolving the pilots of blame. These Air Force psychiatrists went on to pioneer ‘Shape Coding’, a system that ensured all knobs and levers were different shapes and sizes, redesigning the cockpit and ensuring there was little to no room for confusion for pilots reaching for their controls. No similar incidents took place after this adjustment.

Today, not only are the two controls fairly far apart in the cockpit, the lever for the Flaps is large and squared, while the Landing Gear’s knob is shaped like a wheel.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ibp0sre634hdkxyl', 'title': 'What are the deadly design flaws of the B-17 Flying Fortress?', 'score': {'original': 0.9947, 'ai': 0.0053}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'After 400 early B-17s crashed on landing, eventually blamed on the pilot, when every part of the B-17 seemed to be just perfect, Air Force Psychiatric examiners discovered…\n\n…that the controls for the Wing Flaps and Landing Gear looked exactly the same AND were positioned close to each other.\n\n(Left — right): Switches for Landing Gear & Wing Flaps, identical and almost next to each other-400 crashes later the problem was discovered.)\n\nSo close to each other in fact, that exhausted pilots approached the runway and flipped the switch for what they believed to be the landing gear, but instead flipped the wing flaps switch, slowing their descent and then grounding the plane, crashing it into the ground.\n\nThis breakthrough led to the coining of the term “Designer Error”, essentially absolving the pilots of blame.

Victor,2y,"Why doesn't SpaceX design their rockets to open a parachute during landing? Why don't they just design a metal shape, like a flower, in the middle of it?","You mean like the retired Space Shuttle boosters?

Sounded like such a good, simple idea. Parachute back down, refurbish & reuse. Well, actually…

-Has to come down in the ocean for not-so-soft landing.

-Ocean water is corrosive. Especially to electronics, heated metal and O-rings.

-Boats needed to tow it back.

-Loaded on to a train to send it to the factory in Utah (2000 miles away from the launch center) for cleaning, repairing, refurbishment for re-use.

Ditto for the parachutes. Then ship it 2000 miles back to the space center. The loss rate (“too dinged/melted/waterlogged/corroded to fly again”) was absurdly high.

To summarize: it was more expensive and time-consuming than just building a new one. NASA did it because it signed contracts, backed up with deep taxpayer bucks. Efficiency or profitability were never the highest priorities.

In comparison, Space X (and other private space businesses) are profit-driven, as you may have heard. They are VERY concerned about the bottom dollar. Their current method boils down to “land it at the same spot it took off from using less fuel than a large parachute weighs, inspect/repair on site, refuel to go again within days. TRUE reusability means delivering at 1/10th the cost and still making a profit!” Everything the Space Shuttle had promised, yet failed spectacularly to deliver.

Stefan Pociask,Updated 3y,Who designs and plans wildlife crossings?,"Getting a Wildlife Crossing built is quite a complex process that requires the cooperation of multiple agencies and wildlife groups, all of which have very important parts to play. First you need raw field data, which can take years to acquire. This data is mostly collected by volunteer wildlife groups working together, and plenty of volunteers going out looking for actual tracks in the dirt, mud and sand. This is necessary, in order to locate the most highly used “wildlife corridors” , or the trails that wildlife uses. Roads quite often block animals from going where they need to go, and we get situations like this:

Can you imagine how helpless and anxious that mother moose is feeling? What’s she to do? This is a disaster waiting to happen… waiting for a truck come barreling by, and that little moose darts out into the road in terror. This is not at all uncommon.

Or worse yet… we get dead animals on the road. Or, even worse than that… and entire populations have their entire life-cycle interrupted by being completely blocked off from necessary migrations.

These volunteers normally walk endless miles through the wilderness, plotting every step that they take, over a course of two or three years, or more. Every track that they find is carefully recorded and identified. Over those several years, patterns begin to make themselves apparent, regarding animal migrations and just normal paths that are used within an animal’s territory.

An example of such a group is the Sky Island Alliance, that works out of Tucson, Arizona. Or The Sierra Club. They consist of Wildlife Biologists, and various people who have an interest in their local wildlife, who donate their time. All of this is done in conjunction with the state wildlife agency as well as the US Fish & Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and even the Department of Transportation, who provide data regarding “road kill”… animals who get struck by cars while crossing.

After all this data is collected and analysed, then the work begins in trying to find funding from local, state and federal agencies. This includes a lot of lobbying by various groups, including (in Arizona, the Sky Island Alliance), The Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club and others like The Center for Biological Diversity. Oftentimes, governments just don’t believe in it, or there are budget cuts, or irresponsible Presidents and Environmental Cabinet Secretaries that do away with such nonsense spending because they would rather give resources to oil or coal lobbies who have them in their pocket. That’s when citizen donations are crucial.

Once funding is attained, then it goes back to the Department of Transportation, working with the local groups in the planning of the actual crossing, which will allow wildlife to cross above, or sometimes even below, the roads that intersect the wildlife corridors, particularly where there has been a lot of animals that have been hit. At that point, a Civil Engineering company must bid for the job of designing it and getting it built.

The crossing can take many forms, but the main idea is to have as little impact on the actual area, and give wildlife a place to get from one side to the other safely.

Sometimes they are really huge undertakings.

Other times, they are just a pipe.

Wildlife corridors are extremely important for a whole lot of species, from bears, deer, various wildcats, wolves… even huge migrations of crabs in certain places. We’re lucky that there are volunteer groups out there who donate thousands of hours of walking and data collection, in order to get these projects off the ground and running. I recommend to any of you, to locate a local wildlife group and asking what you can do to help in this very important task. It’s a lot of work, but it’s full of adventure and self satisfaction for doing something that is vital to our wildlife, no matter where you live. It can’t be done without volunteers… and that’s YOU!

I can't count how many hours I put into this task. I'm happy to say that I made a direct impact on several of these crossings and over the years since that time, have saved the lives of countless animals and quite likely human beings as well, who might otherwise have had accidents while trying to avoid hitting an animal in the road. As a matter of fact, these experiences were the reason that I became a tracker and eventually became certified in teaching the craft to other people. It was also the reason that I was allowed to lead groups of conservation minded people during bear and lion surveys in wilderness areas. All of this led to a wide variety of opportunities and wildlife experiences and adventures. These are the types of things that result from volunteering for causes such as this.

There is an excellent documentary film, called Cascade Crossroads, about wildlife bridges and crossing, at this website. It’s quite fascinating. Actually, it goes through the entire process, from the genesis of an idea, all through the politics, the engineering, and finally the actual results. So, everything I mentioned up above, and much more! Whether you are an engineer, or a lover of wildlife… absolutely check it out when you get a chance: Cascade Crossroads

First you need raw field data, which can take years to acquire. This data is mostly collected by volunteer wildlife groups working together, and plenty of volunteers going out looking for actual tracks in the dirt, mud and sand. This is necessary, in order to locate the most highly used “wildlife corridors” , or the trails that wildlife uses. Roads quite often block animals from going where they need to go, and we get situations like this:\n\nCan you imagine how helpless and anxious that mother moose is feeling? What’s she to do? This is a disaster waiting to happen… waiting for a truck come barreling by, and that little moose darts out into the road in terror. This is not at all uncommon.\n\nOr worse yet… we get dead animals on the road. Or, even worse than that… and entire populations have their entire life-cycle interrupted by being completely blocked off from necessary migrations.\n\nThese volunteers normally walk endless miles through the wilderness, plotting every step that they take, over a course of two or three years, or more. Every track that they find is carefully recorded and identified. Over those several years, patterns begin to make themselves apparent, regarding animal migrations and just normal paths that are used within an animal’s territory.\n\nAn example of such a group is the Sky Island Alliance, that works out of Tucson, Arizona. Or The Sierra Club. They consist of Wildlife Biologists, and various people who have an interest in their local wildlife, who donate their time. All of this is done in conjunction with the state wildlife agency as well as the US Fish & Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and even the Department of Transportation, who provide data regarding “road kill”… animals who get struck by cars while crossing.\n\nAfter all this data is collected and analysed, then the work begins in trying to find funding from local, state and federal agencies. This includes a lot of lobbying by various groups, including (in Arizona, the Sky Island Alliance), The Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club and others like The Center for Biological Diversity. Oftentimes, governments just don’t believe in it, or there are budget cuts, or irresponsible Presidents and Environmental Cabinet Secretaries that do away with such nonsense spending because they would rather give resources to oil or coal lobbies who have them in their pocket. That’s when citizen donations are crucial.\n\nOnce funding is attained, then it goes back to the Department of Transportation, working with the local groups in the planning of the actual crossing, which will allow wildlife to cross above, or sometimes even below, the roads that intersect the wildlife corridors, particularly where there has been a lot of animals that have been hit. At that point, a Civil Engineering company must bid for the job of designing it and getting it built.\n\nThe crossing can take many forms, but the main idea is to have as little impact on the actual area, and give wildlife a place to get from one side to the other safely.\n\nSometimes they are really huge undertakings.\n\nOther times, they are just a pipe.\n\nWildlife corridors are extremely important for a whole lot of species, from bears, deer, various wildcats, wolves… even huge migrations of crabs in certain places. We’re lucky that there are volunteer groups out there who donate thousands of hours of walking and data collection, in order to get these projects off the ground and running. I recommend to any of you, to locate a local wildlife group and asking what you can do to help in this very important task. It’s a lot of work, but it’s full of adventure and self satisfaction for doing something that is vital to our wildlife, no matter where you live. It can’t be done without volunteers… and that’s YOU!\n\nI can't count how many hours I put into this task. I'm happy to say that I made a direct impact on several of these crossings and over the years since that time, have saved the lives of countless animals and quite likely human beings as well, who might otherwise have had accidents while trying to avoid hitting an animal in the road. As a matter of fact, these experiences were the reason that I became a tracker and eventually became certified in teaching the craft to other people. It was also the reason that I was allowed to lead groups of conservation minded people during bear and lion surveys in wilderness areas. All of this led to a wide variety of opportunities and wildlife experiences and adventures. These are the types of things that result from volunteering for causes such as this.\n\nThere is an excellent documentary film, called Cascade Crossroads, about wildlife bridges and crossing, at this website. It’s quite fascinating. Actually, it goes through the entire process, from the genesis of an idea, all through the politics, the engineering, and finally the actual results.

Damien Leimbach,Updated 4y,"When designing a fighter aircraft, what considerations go into deciding to make it single or double seated?","Depends on what you want to do with it.

Lets talk about the F-15.

When McDonnel Douglas designed the F-15 for the Air Force, it was strictly going to be an air superiority fighter. “Not a pound for air to ground” was the mantra, meaning this will never be used to bomb stuff, to do recon, to do wild weasel, to do Raven jamming missions, it was air combat only.

Look at that steely eyed missile man all by himself.

He didn't need a back seater. He had a manageable workload.

When the Air Force wanted to get rid of some of its old air superiority fighters, like the F-100,

F-101,

F-104,

F-106,

well, they wanted more F-15’s. Notice the air superiority versions of all those were single seat as well. But they couldn't afford more F-15’s, because they were awesome, and awesome costs a lot of money in aerospace. So they bought these instead.

F-16’s. Winner of the Lightweight fighter competition. Another single seat air superiority fighter.

But in the early 80’s McDonnell Douglas knew the USAF was going to need a replacement for their tactical bombers and multirole fighters really soon, namely the F-111,

and the F-4.

Notice they are two seat? The F-4 specifically is a “multi-role.” Aircraft.
Yes, I know it was originally a fleet interceptor and didn't even have any guns, but I’m talking about what it was when we replaced it. It was a jack of all trades. It did air defense. It did fleet defense. It did close air support. It did wild weasel. It did photo recon. It did everything.

And when you do everything, you need a back seater to share the workload.

So what does McDonnell Douglas do, knowing that a jack of all trades needs a replacement? Something that can do it all? Well, they make a two-seat version of their fighter of course, the F-15E “Strike” eagle.

Cool, Right?

Now, other countries like our stuff and want to buy it. But they can’t afford all the specialized toys the Americans have, so when they buy, they tend to buy two seat versions if available, because they might need a fighter one day and a bomber the next and a CAS support platform the day after that.

So like I said, it depends on what you want to do with it. Air to Air only? You can get away with one seat. Need it to do more? Probably going to need another set of eyes.

There are exceptions to this rule of course. Typically exceptions boil down to how its going to be used. Do you have AWACS support? Do you have other aircraft for SEAD? Do you have other Jammers? Do you have other planes for CAS and recon? If so, you might be able to get away with a single seat plane even though that aircraft might be doing missions that would be better off with two seats if it were alone. The F-35, only coming in single seat versions, is one of these exceptions, but it is really not designed to be used alone, so it can get away with it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q4h0ad8lnz6ucv7i', 'title': 'When designing a fighter aircraft, what considerations go into deciding to make it single or double seated?', 'score': {'original': 0.44625, 'ai': 0.55375}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Depends on what you want to do with it.\n\nLets talk about the F-15.\n\nWhen McDonnel Douglas designed the F-15 for the Air Force, it was strictly going to be an air superiority fighter. “Not a pound for air to ground” was the mantra, meaning this will never be used to bomb stuff, to do recon, to do wild weasel, to do Raven jamming missions, it was air combat only.\n\nLook at that steely eyed missile man all by himself.\n\nHe didn't need a back seater.

Craig Weiler,Updated 6y,What are some common mistakes made when designing a floor plan for a house?,"I have been in and out of people’s homes for over 20 years and I've seen all sorts of layouts in custom homes and I've been called in to correct some of the problems. But some of them are just the type that you can’t change. This is mostly rich people stuff:

The biggest one I see: the huge, ginormous master bath with a shower, Jacuzzi tub, enormous walk-in closet, and more than two sinks. Like this:

These bathrooms are too big to feel comfortable and due to their great size and abundance of marble and other polished stone, they feel quite sterile. They echo, which is annoying, and most clients never use the huge tub because they’re hard to fix and expensive when they have problems. They also take forever to fill and use a huge amount of water. I was asked to remove one earlier this year. Most of the drawers are empty.

Huge TV Rooms:

The owners think they’re getting a great TV room, but it’s not. This is the proper way to watch TV:

A single couch close to a smaller TV in a smaller room pushes people together and creates an intimate space. Those houses I've visited with the enormous TV room? Largely unused. Instead, people have TVs in their bedrooms where they instinctively feel more comfortable. The grand TV room, in other words, has pushed people into bad habits.

Great rooms (term used to describe large rooms with no specific function):

a.k.a. The room that gets quickly cleaned once a week and is only used for large parties when the host finally gets all the guests out of the kitchen.

I've seen these in many homes, not just the extremely wealthy, and I lived once in a home that had one. People can put TVs in them, but then they end up putting the TV on the wall, pushing the sofa up near the TV, and basically using 1/10th of the room. It feels weird.

They are hard to fill with furniture because putting a couch in there feels like you just put it out to sea.

Like this:\n\nThese bathrooms are too big to feel comfortable and due to their great size and abundance of marble and other polished stone, they feel quite sterile. They echo, which is annoying, and most clients never use the huge tub because they’re hard to fix and expensive when they have problems. They also take forever to fill and use a huge amount of water. I was asked to remove one earlier this year. Most of the drawers are empty.\n\nHuge TV Rooms:\n\nThe owners think they’re getting a great TV room, but it’s not. This is the proper way to watch TV:\n\nA single couch close to a smaller TV in a smaller room pushes people together and creates an intimate space. Those houses I've visited with the enormous TV room? Largely unused. Instead, people have TVs in their bedrooms where they instinctively feel more comfortable. The grand TV room, in other words, has pushed people into bad habits.\n\nGreat rooms (term used to describe large rooms with no specific function):\n\na.k.a. The room that gets quickly cleaned once a week and is only used for large parties when the host finally gets all the guests out of the kitchen.\n\nI've seen these in many homes, not just the extremely wealthy, and I lived once in a home that had one. People can put TVs in them, but then they end up putting the TV on the wall, pushing the sofa up near the TV, and basically using 1/10th of the room. It feels weird.\n\nThey are hard to fill with furniture because putting a couch in there feels like you just put it out to sea.\n\nPeople need people-sized spaces and while you can make something larger and more expensive, it doesn't necessarily translate into a better living experience."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.997

Tamanna Pawar,4y,What are some awesome examples of simple yet innovative designs?,"Diamond whiskey glasses

These stylish whiskey glasses really look like diamonds. The shape allows you to rotate the glass and then enjoy the full-bodied flavor of your favorite drink.

A smart plate

Annet Bruil, a Dutch social designer, has found her way to create a positive impact on people in their struggle to become healthier. She designed a special plate with sections that visually divide your food and show the sufficient amount needed of each kind.

Shoes with removable heels

You can magically turn your comfortable ballet flats to stylish high-heel shoes. Tanya Heath, a fashion designer from Canada, invented interchangeable heels to reconcile comfort and style. The heels come in variety of colors and styles, so that you could mix and match them your very own way.

Umbrellas with invisible prints

A nightstand with pull-out tray

If you enjoy having breakfast in bed, this nightstand is just the right invention for you.

A perfect anti-stress ball

This anti-stress ball is covered with a special mesh bag. When you squeeze the ball, it starts looking like a bunch of grapes, or maybe an infectious disease.

Bag re-sealer

What a time to be alive! Re-seal the packet of your unfinished chips or any other plastic bag and keep the food fresh for whenever you want to consume it later. This uses the timed impulse of heat to close the bag.

Magic clean – A Jelly cloth to clean hard places

A jelly cloth helps you cleaning the harder places much easier. Designed by Guangzhou Clean & Simple Cleaning Products (who manufactures cleaning products), this jelly cloth can easily reach small gaps in the keyboard, calculators, computers, laptops, car vent, etc. All you need to do is to press it on the device to be cleaned and take it out. Due to its structure, this reusable material easily removes dust, hairs, and food which rests in the small gaps. This product is also environment-friendly and easy to clean.

Life Straw

Life Straw uses hollow fibre micro filtration technology to purify water by removing potential pathogens like typhoid, cholera, dysentery as well as the parasites. The personal straw size works as soon as you suck up water from a source, rendering up to 1,000 liters of water fit to drink without electricity or additional attachments, while the family and community filters purify larger quantities of water through a larger pitcher.

Menstrual cups

Many women and girls around the world do not have access to basic sanitary protection -- especially in parts of the developing world where periods are seen as taboo, or where the cost of sanitary pads exceed the average person's income.

The menstrual cup is one affordable and reusable solution. The bell-shaped product, made of surgical-grade silicone, is worn inside the vagina and collects menstrual fluid. Once the cup is removed, it simply needs to be washed before reusing, providing a sustainable and safe option for women in developing countries.

Pedal powered electricity

Another invention which could greatly benefit countries without electricity is the Free Electric person-powered bike. Not only can you get your exercise on this gym-style bicycle, but every hour of cycling produces 24 hours of free energy, which has enough power to run 24 light bulbs, a fan, and a smartphone charger all at the same time.

RJ C.,Updated 2y,What is the most logical or realistic ship design seen in all of Star Trek?,"Initially ignoring the more fictional aspects such as warp drives and artificial gravity, the most thought out design was the original Constitution-class USS Enterprise herself.

Under Roddenberry’s request of not having a retro rocket or UFO saucer as the hero ship, Matt Jefferies and company had to think of a design that was logical yet still iconic:

As the ship operates in the vacuum of space, the best pressure vessel would be a sphere or cylinder, thus they started with those forms.

They expected the engines and machinery was dangerous and possibly radioactive, so they decided to position the engines in external pods and keep the engineering section away from the main crew space, resulting in the famous neck pylon and warp nacelles.

Heat disposal is an issue in a vacuum, so increasing surface area to radiate excess heat is a must. Coolant pipes were added to the nacelles and the primary hull was flattened into its familiar disk shape.

At that point, they are just filling in details appropriate for science fiction. The glowing bits on the nacelles became Bussard Collectors to top off fuel tanks, a nod to the theoretical Bussard Ramjet Engine. A big satellite dish was added to the front for what would be a communication-sensor-shield array.

To imply the ship is a government vessel, the hull was painted in a Military Grey and the registry number made more prominent than the ship’s name plate, as is common in Naval practice. Running beacons similar to maritime/aeronautical navigation lights were also added.

The design of the original Enterprise would go on to influence the aesthetics of most Starfleet ships from then on, though not all were given as much practical design thought.

***Edit Notes***

I thank the people for making this a popular answer. Will keep the comments up for now as I like seeing input and constructive criticism but a few notes:

I am calling this ship a logical design, not necessarily a realistic one (noting the question does have an “or” rather than “and”). If you interpret the question differently, be my guest. My reasoning for this opinion is as follows.

Star Trek is a soft science-fiction franchise, so this alongside most other ships are not perfectly realistic designs. Any unrealistic aspects are due to:

Aesthetics - primarily the design has to be visually pleasing and recognizable to the audience above all else
Innocence - Neither the writers nor the general audience are all experts, it just has to make enough sense for casual viewership. What seems okay for someone in the 1960s may not be so for someone in the 2020s.
World building - as a fictional universe, writers may assign internal rules that are necessary for the setting work without being constrained by real world limits. Anything in-universe should then abide by the fictional rules first.

The last is my important factor in terms of logic, as I first use real life then follow in-universe standards to cover the gaps. Any unrealistic aspect must have an in-universe reason:

Fictional materials like duranium or transparent aluminum supposedly allow for unorthodox structures.
Engines that operate on an internal set of fictional physics don’t always need to abide by real world physics so long as they follow the fictional rules.

There are starships that have some realistic features but then have illogical/unexplained ones even in universe (such as how the symmetrically designed Stargazer lacks a deflector dish or the less-than-aerodynamic Borg Cube lack visible ports, etc).

The TOS Enterprise just has a reasonable design under both real and fictional standards.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9lzw5xfvjtcd2bks', 'title': 'What is the most logical or realistic ship design seen in all of Star Trek?', 'score': {'original': 0.8979, 'ai': 0.1021}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Initially ignoring the more fictional aspects such as warp drives and artificial gravity, the most thought out design was the original Constitution-class USS Enterprise herself.\n\nUnder Roddenberry’s request of not having a retro rocket or UFO saucer as the hero ship, Matt Jefferies and company had to think of a design that was logical yet still iconic:\n\nAs the ship operates in the vacuum of space, the best pressure vessel would be a sphere or cylinder, thus they started with those forms.\n\nThey expected the engines and machinery was dangerous and possibly radioactive, so they decided to position the engines in external pods and keep the engineering section away from the main crew space, resulting in the famous neck pylon and warp nacelles.\n\nHeat disposal is an issue in a vacuum, so increasing surface area to radiate excess heat is a must.

Lokesh Dubey,Updated 7y,What are the best examples of a really good design?,"Rumble Strips

These have been there for so long but I didn’t realize that they are literally lifesavers until recently. I actually never knew what they were there for.

So I was driving down from New York,NY to Raleigh,NC recently and I was driving solo. As I was coming here for the first time I had to get a lot of addresses, directions from Google. I was alone so I decided I’ll type one character and then look back on road again for safety. Well it didn’t work out and an auto correction took too much of my attention and suddenly I heard an alarming sound and my car started to vibrate. Not too much but like how it would if my car would be a cellphone. So yeah I was about to go into a ditch if these strips wouldn’t have shook me and said ‘Bzzzzz Eyes on the road buddy!!’. There can be various reasons to steer off the road people may get tired and doze off etc.

So yes in my opinion its very ordinary thing in first impression but very well thought off and I’ll consider it as a really good design to save lives.

Edit: Proceed and read for some elucidation, if required.

I appreciate all for the great reception. However, based on some of the comments, I would like to clarify a few things. This by ‘no means’, is and ever would be an inherent suggestion to take this for granted. My answer is specifically talking about how well thought and simple the design is which I’m sure, and you’d all agree, saves a lot of lives.

As far as my own personal interaction with this specific incidence is concerned, other than the mentioned ‘light bulb’ moment I also got back to my senses to not use my phone anymore while driving. I’m typically a good and responsible driver as its implicit by how keen and vigilant I am on the roadways to observe all the gory details. So yes I indeed stopped after that every now and then if I had to use my phone and I was stopping anyway to take breaks because it was nearly a 12–13 hours drive for me (including stoppages).

Which brings me to my next response on some comments where it’s mentioned that its very bad for cyclists. In my opinion its not rather it’s relative. First of all I was driving on Interstate Highways where typical speed of a vehicle was 75 mph. At this speed I don’t think its safe for any cyclist to be on the shoulder as they’ll really get sucked into the traffic with the low pressure created. Believe me its really really strong. Remember tractor trailer usually drive on the right most lane, go figure :). Irrespective of that right shoulders are not supposed to be that small (the pic is nothing but first image I found on google). According to Interstate Highway standards
 they are supposed to be at least 3.0 m / 10 Feet. If it’s not then that is one odd highway with a lot of space crunch or if its a road in a city then nowadays they mostly have dedicated bike routes along the way and they possess the right of way.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a7k02woluv6c91n5', 'title': 'What are the best examples of a really good design?', 'score': {'original': 0.46945, 'ai': 0.53055}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Rumble Strips\n\nThese have been there for so long but I didn’t realize that they are literally lifesavers until recently.

Steven Haddock,1y,How was the design of castles affected by the use of cannons in war?,"You pretty much wanted to eliminate these

Cylindrical towers were a favourite of designers because they give you the maximum volume for materials and they’re naturally strong. Castle corners were not very structurally strong and even in the days of cannon they absorbed energy rather than deflecting it.

But if you have cannon to shoot back, they create massive blind spots. Enemy troops can essentially hide behind the cylindrical towers as you’re trying to shoot cannon at them.

So castle design essentially went from this

To this

Not only did you eliminate blind spots, by shooting along the walls you have very wide fields of cross fire against the enemy no matter what direction they’re coming from.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3u4q8zs6a1wv7rkn', 'title': 'How was the design of castles affected by the use of cannons in war?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'You pretty much wanted to eliminate these\n\nCylindrical towers were a favourite of designers because they give you the maximum volume for materials and they’re naturally strong.

Paul Adam,2y,Are there examples of military equipment that was actually designed for a particular field but turned out to be deployed in a very different field from what it was designed for?,"One example I like, is the Boulton Paul Defiant.

Designed for a role of bomber-destroying, where it was expected that German bombers would have to skirt French airspace and attack Britain in a flight too long for fighter escort: so the Defiant wasn’t expected to mix it up with enemy single-engined fighters.

Why no forward-firing guns, and a turret instead? Because it was expected (not quite right but not too far from the truth as it happened) that many bombers would be nearly as fast as fighters, so a conventional fighter would have to engage in a long tail-chase, being hosed down by the bomber’s defensive guns (for instance, four fast-firing MGs in a power-operated turret, twice the firepower of most 1930s fighters) as it did so.

A Defiant could approach at more of an angle, avoiding the worst of the defensive fire, and position out of arcs of the bomber’s guns while delivering a concentrated blast of firepower from the beam or below. (This was a time of experiments, like the US YFM-1 Airacuda and Arado E.500).

A sensible theory… eroded a bit by aircraft evolving not quite as planned, and undercut badly when France fell unexpectedly quickly and the Luftwaffe were based in France, able to escort bombers over southern England.

Against agile fighters, the Defiant didn’t do brilliantly: Bf109s attacking a formation of Defiants from above and behind ran into a lethal hail of fire, but the weight of the turret and extra crewman meant the Defiant was badly disadvantaged in a dogfight. That said, over Dunkirk the Defiant did better than is often suggested: 264 Squadron were often able to survive (though not beat) German fighters by good defensive tactics, and downed a number of bombers and an occasional careless 109 during that action and the Battle of Britain - they claimed a cheerfully positive kill ratio of 3–4 to 1, but the reality seems to have been about even (overclaiming was at least as common as with other fighter types; a group of Defiants had multiple gunners shooting at the same target, all claiming the kill in good faith when it burned or crashed)

However, “better than the popular view of disaster” still wasn’t great, and the Defiant was withdrawn from day-fighter duties.

The first place it kept a lease of life, was as a night fighter: though handicapped (like all 1940 aircraft) by lack of radar, the two-seat Defiant was quite well suited to the nightfighter role (again, the pilot free to fly and observe - since he only had his eyes to find targets - the gunner to fire, and the muzzle flash from the guns less likely to cost the pilot his night vision). By September 1941, the Defiant Mk.II had a more powerful Merlin and - crucially - Airborne Intercept radar, and were proving successful enough that fitting a turret to the nightfighter versions of the Beaufighter and Mosquito was seriously considered (and for the Mosquito, at least prototyped)

As the Beaufighter took over the nightfighter role, the Defiant was initially relegated to the role of target tug for gunnery training (where its decent performance and agility made it a good fit for the job).

However, the small aircraft with good handling, still-respectable speed and a rear seat for either a heavy gun turret or “other heavy stuff”, meant that it was used to carry electronic-warfare gear, using “Moonshine” and then “Mandrel” jammers to degrade German air-defence radars by either generating false targets, or simply whiting them out with noise; able to operate in daylight, and being quick enough to run away from enemy fighters.

The Defiant finally faded away in 1943 or so - it wasn’t being developed or updated much (the last production version was the Mk III, a dedicated target tug and trainer). It wasn’t a success in its intended role (you could argue it might have done better if the specific niche it was designed for had happened, but that’s the danger of designing for very specific tasks…) but it wasn’t the disaster often claimed, merely “not good enough”.

While a fair number of aircraft types no longer fit for the frontline became trainers, target tugs and the like, the Defiant was somewhat unusual in also becoming a useful night-fighter and early electronic-warfare platform when it wasn’t effective in its original role.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/l6nq4ec2syk93ati', 'title': 'Are there examples of military equipment that was actually designed for a particular field but turned out to be deployed in a very different field from what it was designed for?', 'score': {'original': 0.48825, 'ai': 0.51175}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'One example I like, is the Boulton Paul Defiant.\n\nDesigned for a role of bomber-destroying, where it was expected that German bombers would have to skirt French airspace and attack Britain in a flight too long for fighter escort: so the Defiant wasn’t expected to mix it up with enemy single-engined fighters.\n\nWhy no forward-firing guns, and a turret instead?

Leila Thomas,4y,What are the most evil packaging designs?,"We all know that one of the “pro gamer moves” that companies use to bamboozle us is by packaging things in a completely misleading way. And we’re not too short on examples:

-

What a nice, organic sandwich that’ll definitely fill me up at lunchtime…maybe not.

Expectation: all the colors of the rainbow

Reality:

Only 5 pencils in a box that looks like it’s supposed to contain 10.

This rope has a picture of someone climbing, yet it says “not suitable for climbing”. How clever.

They really did it with that marker box:

When your box of staples is more box than staples:

You said that there were ~40 pizza rolls in there and yet there’s barely 27?

HOW DARE YOU!

Any frozen yogurt fan’s worst nightmare…

To conclude: the next time you go to a store, don’t be fooled!

Good luck.

A torch with an additional bulb

Md. Alisher, class 12, KSS College, Lakhisarai, Bihar

The idea is to have another bulb below the main bulb of the torch so that light is available near the feet of user and also for people following the user. Once Alisher was returning home with his grandmother at night. As he was using his torch to show his grandmother the way, he could not see a pit himself and fell into it.

New design of serving tray

Alok Singh, class 12, Shah Faiz Public School, Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh

Serving tray with a release mechanism to put cup/ glass on the table along with a coaster without touching it. Once while serving tea to a guest, Alok spilled over hot tea over him resulting in some burns to his hands and stains on his cloth and the sofa. After this incident he started thinking how such a problem could be avoided and came up with this idea to make serving easy and ‘stylish’.

Electronic purse with paired watch

Phamnya Konyak, class 9, Konjong Higher Secondary School, Mon, Nagaland

Password protected purse and an electronically paired watch, which alerts if user gets away from these or someone steals the purse.

It promises fuel efficiency, more passengers, and so on and so forth. NASA studied BWB concept starting around 2007–2008 for large airplane applications such as airliners and cargo:

X-48B subscale demonstator by NASA

Comparison of theoretical BWB airliner with 747

Potential advantages

As of now, the X-48 is still under study, potentially leading to a larger demonstrator airplane that is closer to the size of actual airliners. Still, that is a long way to go.

On one hand, yes, a BWB theoretically could be more aerodynamically more efficient than conventional “tube and wing” metal airplane. And yes, they can fit in more people due to their large central cabin area. Obviously, this is very attractive to airliners because they can reduce fuel consumption and squeeze more people. On top of that, BWB airplanes generally looks sleek and futuristic; it’s something that I’m more than willing to fly in, provided there are no problems.

But there are major problems.

One of the biggest issues with BWB is emergency evacuation. In a conventional airliner, you’re never too far away from the exits:

This is based on FAA requirements on emergency exit availability:

14 CFR § 25.807 - Emergency exits.

I’m going to direct your attention to part (f) and (g), it says:

No emergency exits will be further than 60 ft from the next emergency exit
There is a ratio on how many exits to the number of seats/passengers to prevent overcrowding

However, if we look at the theoretical seating configuration of a BWB airliner:

I have serious doubts that those seated in the center would have enough time to evacuate. The problem is only exacerbated when you consider a “double decker” BWB. Sure, those on the top deck can, theoretically, exit from the top (I doubt the FAA would let that pass though, since climbing on top requires some physical strength that younger, elderly, and injured passengers and crew may not have), but those on the bottom deck… we’ll they’re screwed.

Another issue that may arise is because of the engine placement on top of the fuselage:

If those engines got detached, one way or another, there is a concern that they’ll come off forward, crushing the cabin. Not a pretty outcome given how heavy that thing is and how many sharp blades it has.

The other thing that may present certification issue (see where this is going?) is that the most recent iteration of BWB airliners are tailless (at least it won’t have horizontal tails). The tail of the airplane is used for stability and control. In military airplanes, where performance is king, this issue is mitigated using advanced flight computers that would automatically compensate for any instability. But these can, and have, failed:

B-2 flying wing crash in Guam a few years ago, due to short circuit because water managed to seep into the computer system.

A civilian airliner, carrying hundreds of people, would need to have safeguards against that. One obvious way of doing it is to make the V-tail in the back large enough. But this means that tail is very likely going to be humongous, adding drag and weight as well as offsetting the potential environmental benefits.

Another way of doing it is to make the control system extremely robust, but again this can cost a lot of money and additions, maybe to the point that it’s not that different from conventional airliners.

Large passenger capacity, while on paper sounds great, is not necessarily going to guarantee success. Take the Airbus A380, for example, an airplane that can carry 850 passengers max.

Airbus is ending A380 production in 2021, not because it was a terrible performing airplane, but rather because Airbus misjudged the market. There is simply no demand for such a large, long-range airliner today.

Lastly, there is also an issue that those seated in the middle won’t be able to see out of the windows. but this is more of a trivial issue, if at all, and today we have VR and other wonderful technologies that we can use to offset this.

Basically, BWB airliners are going to be a nightmare to certify using current standards. They may need their own, special rules. If BWB airliners are ever going to be commercially feasible, it’s most likely not going to happen anytime soon. Maybe 50–70 years from now, maybe more.

HOWEVER, for non-civilian applications, BWB are already in use (though they don’t really look that futuristic compared to current concepts):

Tu-160 bomber

B-1B bomber

SR-71 recon airplane

The requirements for military airplanes are generally different. As I noted earlier, performance comes above everything else. I could see that there may be a room in the market for BWB military transport, but this is more speculation. In any case, BWB haven’t been used much in the military anyway; these 3 examples are the only ones to have been produced in large (enough) quantities.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rp9fo0xha57mvyqk', 'title': 'Is a blended wing and body design commercially viable?', 'score': {'original': 0.89845, 'ai': 0.10155}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Ok, so the blended wing body (BWB) passenger airplane is coming back again, thanks to Airbus.

Abhinav Sharma,Updated 9y,"What is it like to be a color blind designer? How does it affect the way they do their work? Does it put them at an advantage or disadvantage in their field? If you are a color blind designer, do your clients or employers know you are color blind?","I'm red-green color blind and I work as a Product Designer at Quora. My color blindness is on the stronger side (~1% of all men instead of a more common kind that affects about 5%).

My tl;dr for this is that in the grand scheme of things, making a color choice between a green and brown is the kind of decision we make rarely enough that you can ask for help and it really isn't a big deal.

Make no mistake, it is a handicap, but for me a minor one. I do wonder what it's like to be, for example, a fashion designer or interior designer, where you're making a lot more color decisions. I'd imagine it would be harder.

When people first find out, I often get a ""You're a colorblind designer, WHAT?!"" reaction. My usual response is two part:

Color blindness is really hard to describe if you don't have it. My closest experience to not being color blind is wearing EnChroma glasses, through which I can distinguish between green and brown, as well as see red as a much stronger color than I do otherwise. It was while wearing those that I first understood why a red dress is such a powerful image. My reaction to most of the spectrum, with the exception of red, green and brown is like anyone else's.
Most of the time, I'm using a color from a palette that we've already agreed upon. Sometimes, we have a problem for which I'd have to create a palette. I usually know when I'm getting close to a color I'm weak with and just ask for help.


Overall, I feel like the handicap makes me a better product designer (emphasis on product because I'm not sure it would make me a better fashion or interior designer), for the following two reasons:

I have to be more disciplined with color, and rely on systems and patterns more. This helps ensure consistency.
I represent 5% of the male population within a design team, so 2.5% of potential users. I can tell the other designers when we make something that is not color blind friendly. I once took over a webpage which was full of a brown text that to me seemed closer to red and really ""popped"" as if everything was calling out for attention in red. For 95% of people, this was ""meh, doesn't matter, we could've picked any of these colors and we'd be fine"" but for a small minority, it was a really janky experience.

My favorite story about this is that Facebook is blue because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind and just didn't want to deal with it. Nobody's really complaining about it 10 years down the line.


On that note, I'd like to add that designing for color blind people is not that hard -- tools like ColorSchemeDesigner have a color blind friendly mode that simply won't let you pick a palette that's inaccessible. I really recommend using these on any product.

Color blindness is a huge consideration when building a safety-related product. You really don't want to use the wrong red and green on a stop/go sign for example (for the record, traffic lights are very, very easy to distinguish between).

That's really the gist of it. To answer the last point, yeah, I've generally made it pretty clear upfront when looking for jobs that I'm color blind, and most good employers start out asking if it has affected my work in the past.

An immediately negative reaction is usually a sign of incomplete understanding of how color blindness works.

I'm really curious to hear if there's color blind designers in fashion, interior or graphic design and how this affects their work.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9iam3gs5vn1rd6fz', 'title': 'What is it like to be a color blind designer?

When properly planted into the ground, it was far too low to be of use unless you were in a trench.
The 3/16th of an inch thick steel meant the blade end of the spade was extremely blunt, meaning it was useless for digging into hard earth.
At over 5 pounds in weight, it was shockingly heavy.
The handle was way too short to permit effective digging.
It was extremely difficult to carry around.
It couldn’t stop a bullet, even low caliber ones.

Basically, a shovel that cannot shovel.

Archie D’Cruz,Updated 9y,How important is typography in reading experience?,"Very important.

Done well, typography (especially in body copy) should not attract attention to itself. Instead, it should make the reading experience pleasant, leave no room for confusion (""Is that an I or a 1?""), be audience-appropriate (is the type large enough if your readers are senior citizens?) and medium-appropriate (what works in print may not translate well to the web).

Let's not take extreme examples like use of Comic Sans in Fortune 500 boardrooms (We Are A Fortune 500 Company, Not A Lemonade Stand
) or poorly kerned store signs like this one:



Let's instead look at everyday examples and stick to something you might expect to find in a book or newspaper.

Here's one headline, set the way it would show if you were simply to type it out in a word processor (click on the examples to view them at the actual size they were set at):


Now here's the same headline at the exact same point size, tightly kerned:


Even to the untrained eye, the difference is apparent.

Or let's look at some sample Greek text, set here in Times Roman.


This is somewhat typical of what you might find in many books or newsletters where type is set at default settings. There are so many things wrong here—widows, orphans, double space after periods, no extra space between paragraphs, double dashes (--) where there should be an em dash (—), rivers of space between words on some lines (caused by not having hyphens in text justified on both left and right…

Let's now change this to Gill Sans, add hyphenation and extra spacing between paragraphs, and take out the double spacing between sentences, and see if it makes a difference.


It does make it a little better and more legible, and the use of hyphens makes the words less spaced out. It's not quite there yet, so let's make a few more tweaks.

In this last example, let's use ITC Stone Serif, which by itself is not much to look at, but sets beautifully for long text.


This time, the text is set left rather than fully justified, which makes spacing between words a lot more consistent. There is slightly more spacing between lines (""leading"") and between paragraphs. The double dashes have been converted to em dashes and the two columns are vertically justified.

The point size has remained the same in all three examples, and there haven't been any ""major"" changes made; yet one block of text is easier on the eye than the others.

And that, essentially, is what good typography is supposed to do.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yt2iru09xhfwal8s', 'title': 'How important is typography in reading experience?', 'score': {'original': 0.9988, 'ai': 0.0012}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Very important.\n\nDone well, typography (especially in body copy) should not attract attention to itself.

Emory Kimbrough,Updated 6y,What are some examples of cheap products that were 'unintentionally well engineered'?,"Dog Toys versus Baby Toys

I read a humorous essay about this years ago, written after the author noticed that his baby much preferred the family dog’s toys over the expensive baby toys.

So, what are the criteria for an excellent dog toy?

1.) Extremely durable

2.) Colorful

3.) Safe to chew on repeatedly without a choking hazard

4.) Makes a squeaky sound.

Now, what are the criteria for an excellent baby toy?

1.) Extremely durable

2.) Colorf… OH MY GOD THIS SOUNDS AWFULLY FAMILIAR.

The ONLY difference is that the baby toys are way, way more expensive than the dog toys.

So, if you are among the 0.00001% of parents who are psychologically capable of buying dog toys for your infant without feeling horrible shame and guilt, then you really should do this.

I won’t tell on you.

Rodra Hascaryo,4y,What was the biggest fail as a design for military aircraft?,"As much as I don’t like talking in absolutes, I think the worst design to ever been proposed as a military aircraft (and indeed one of the objectively worst design in aeronautical history) is this monstrosity:

The Christmas Bullet

The Mike Foxtrot himself

Back in World War 1, this man named Dr. William W. Christmas (above), a medical doctor with a very questionable background in aeronautics, designed this ugly machine and tried to sell it to the Allies. He claimed that they could use variants of this airplane to:

Scout enemy positions
Fight enemy airplanes
Kidnap Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and fly him back (you read that right)

He also claimed that he had made airplanes before but evidence of them were suspiciously thin. Nonetheless, he was given the go and was even loaned a prototype Liberty-6 engine by the US Army.

The problem with his design is so obvious that any half-decent airplane mechanic could point out a serious issue even from that photo above. Here is what a proper WW1 airplane, the Sopwith Camel, looks like:

Notice how it has struts and wires supporting the two wings? Those structural elements are very important in keeping the wing rigid so that it can generate lift to enable the airplane to fly. The Bullet has none of those (i.e. it had cantilevered wings). Please keep the italicized sentences in mind as you read further.

By the time the Bullet was ready, it was 1919 and WW1 was over. Nonetheless, Christmas persisted in demonstrating his supposed aerial marvel. Even though many were skeptical, Christmas claimed that the lack of struts was not a bug, it was a feature! Most respectable people of the time rightly deduced that the good doctor’s senses had taken a permanent leave and they likewise abandoned him to his own devices.

Fortunately for Christmas, the end of the war meant that there were many military pilots who became unemployed as the military was demobilized. Many of them would pioneer modern aviation, but one poor, desperate, unlucky soul named Cuthbert Mills ended up in Christmas’ employ as he had nowhere else to go. Mills agreed to test Christmas’ Bullet that had been secretly and illegally fitted with the Liberty engine on loan from the Army.

On that one January day, in front of a small crowd — among which Mills’ mother was present — the brave aviator hopped into the infernal machine and started the motor. Little did he know that by then his fate was sealed. Did he realize how awful the design was? Nobody could say for certain.

When the wooden contraption gained sufficient speed, Mills pulled the control stick and the Bullet slipped the surly bonds and took to the wild blue yonder. Dr. Christmas, safely resting in Terra Firma, was probably smiling, sure that he had beaten the odds and proven right in the end. Mills’ mother was likewise probably elated, for her dearest son was once again in his element.

But no doctor, no matter how smart, no lawyer, no matter how eloquent, and no aviator, no matter how skilled, had a prayer against the iron laws of physics. The forces and moments acting on the wings (see below for an unrelated example) started bending and twisting Mills’ only means to stay aloft.

The doctor, having no discernible engineering experience, did not realize that the wood that he made the wing structure out of could not withstand the full rigors of flight. In fact, he supposedly went so far as to suggest that the flexing wing was desirable. For what? Perhaps the doctor had his own pet theory but it did not align with our understanding of physics.

Mills was probably alarmed, then aghast, as his machine started creaking and then cracked. The wing broke free from the aircraft. The spectators back in the aerodrome gasped in horror but there was nothing they could do. Having no implement to fight its own weight, the aircraft spun and hurtled towards the ground. The Bullet was destroyed and Mills was killed.

That surely put and end to the Bullet and Christmas’ reputation, right? But no! In fact, he touted the first flight as a success, purportedly reaching a speed of 198 mph (an achievement then) — conveniently leaving out the crash in his advertisement. He even had the gall to build and then showcased the second, unmodified prototype in Madison Square Garden. As if that wasn’t enough, he employed another pilot named Lt. Allington Jolly to fly it, leading to the exact same, predictable outcome.

Thankfully, no more Bullet was to be built and no more aviators had to pay the price of the doctor’s hubris. An unrepentant sinner he was, Christmas went on to claim many more patents and inventions, many of which probably were as insane and dangerous as the Bullet but probably none were put into actual use.

Though he had extinguished two innocent lives, the doctor lived scot-free for the rest of his life, dying from pneumonia in 1960. I could scarcely think any greater injustice in the history of aviation.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0mp38qk6tyxcuj59', 'title': 'What was the biggest fail as a design for military aircraft?', 'score': {'original': 0.96655, 'ai': 0.03345}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'As much as I don’t like talking in absolutes, I think the worst design to ever been proposed as a military aircraft (and indeed one of the objectively worst design in aeronautical history) is this monstrosity:\n\nThe Christmas Bullet\n\nThe Mike Foxtrot himself\n\nBack in World War 1, this man named Dr. William W.

Christmas (above), a medical doctor with a very questionable background in aeronautics, designed this ugly machine and tried to sell it to the Allies. He claimed that they could use variants of this airplane to:\n\nScout enemy positions\nFight enemy airplanes\nKidnap Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and fly him back (you read that right)\n\nHe also claimed that he had made airplanes before but evidence of them were suspiciously thin. Nonetheless, he was given the go and was even loaned a prototype Liberty-6 engine by the US Army.\n\nThe problem with his design is so obvious that any half-decent airplane mechanic could point out a serious issue even from that photo above. Here is what a proper WW1 airplane, the Sopwith Camel, looks like:\n\nNotice how it has struts and wires supporting the two wings? Those structural elements are very important in keeping the wing rigid so that it can generate lift to enable the airplane to fly. The Bullet has none of those (i.e. it had cantilevered wings). Please keep the italicized sentences in mind as you read further.\n\nBy the time the Bullet was ready, it was 1919 and WW1 was over. Nonetheless, Christmas persisted in demonstrating his supposed aerial marvel. Even though many were skeptical, Christmas claimed that the lack of struts was not a bug, it was a feature! Most respectable people of the time rightly deduced that the good doctor’s senses had taken a permanent leave and they likewise abandoned him to his own devices.\n\nFortunately for Christmas, the end of the war meant that there were many military pilots who became unemployed as the military was demobilized. Many of them would pioneer modern aviation, but one poor, desperate, unlucky soul named Cuthbert Mills ended up in Christmas’ employ as he had nowhere else to go. Mills agreed to test Christmas’ Bullet that had been secretly and illegally fitted with the Liberty engine on loan from the Army.\n\nOn that one January day, in front of a small crowd — among which Mills’ mother was present — the brave aviator hopped into the infernal machine and started the motor. Little did he know that by then his fate was sealed. Did he realize how awful the design was? Nobody could say for certain.\n\nWhen the wooden contraption gained sufficient speed, Mills pulled the control stick and the Bullet slipped the surly bonds and took to the wild blue yonder. Dr. Christmas, safely resting in Terra Firma, was probably smiling, sure that he had beaten the odds and proven right in the end. Mills’ mother was likewise probably elated, for her dearest son was once again in his element.\n\nBut no doctor, no matter how smart, no lawyer, no matter how eloquent, and no aviator, no matter how skilled, had a prayer against the iron laws of physics. The forces and moments acting on the wings (see below for an unrelated example) started bending and twisting Mills’ only means to stay aloft.\n\nThe doctor, having no discernible engineering experience, did not realize that the wood that he made the wing structure out of could not withstand the full rigors of flight. In fact, he supposedly went so far as to suggest that the flexing wing was desirable. For what? Perhaps the doctor had his own pet theory but it did not align with our understanding of physics.\n\nMills was probably alarmed, then aghast, as his machine started creaking and then cracked. The wing broke free from the aircraft. The spectators back in the aerodrome gasped in horror but there was nothing they could do. Having no implement to fight its own weight, the aircraft spun and hurtled towards the ground. The Bullet was destroyed and Mills was killed.\n\nThat surely put and end to the Bullet and Christmas’ reputation, right? But no! In fact, he touted the first flight as a success, purportedly reaching a speed of 198 mph (an achievement then) — conveniently leaving out the crash in his advertisement. He even had the gall to build and then showcased the second, unmodified prototype in Madison Square Garden. As if that wasn’t enough, he employed another pilot named Lt. Allington Jolly to fly it, leading to the exact same, predictable outcome.\n\nThankfully, no more Bullet was to be built and no more aviators had to pay the price of the doctor’s hubris. An unrepentant sinner he was, Christmas went on to claim many more patents and inventions, many of which probably were as insane and dangerous as the Bullet but probably none were put into actual use.\n\nThough he had extinguished two innocent lives, the doctor lived scot-free for the rest of his life, dying from pneumonia in 1960.

John Cate,4y,Is it true that Intel’s most advanced CPU designs were created in the Middle East?,"There is a grain of truth to this in that Intel’s Core and Core 2 designs, which have been the basis for all of the company’s mainstream CPU’s, were developed by the company’s development team in Haifa, Israel. This isn’t Intel’s only development team, but they did devise these chips.

The genesis of this microarchitecture came in the early 2000s, when Intel’s main CPU line was the Pentium 4 series, based on their Netburst microarchitecture. Netburst had been designed to achieve high clock speeds at the expense of IPC (instructions handled per clock cycle), but the design didn’t work as well as expected. The Pentium 4 was inefficient and had high power draw, although Intel’s manufacturing prowess still made it successful on the desktop and for servers.

Not so for mobile applications. Fitting the P4, or anything else Netburst, into a low-power envelope was basically polishing a turd. There was a mobile P4 line, but it wasn’t very good, and Intel was seeking a better solution.

Enter the Haifa design team. They approached the problem from a different angle, taking the final revision of Intel’s Pentium III design, the “Tualatin,” and modifying it to run on the Pentium 4’s AGTL+ bus protocol—a quad-pumped 100 MHz front-side bus, meaning it effectively ran at 400 MHz—in place of the Tualatin’s 133 MHz FSB. The design team’s ability to effectively marry the Tualatin to the P4 bus was codenamed “Banias,” after a town in Israel. Since the Tualatin was a much more efficient design, both power-wise and in terms of processing power, running it on a faster P4 bus made it a tremendous performer for the time. In fact, the resulting product, the Pentium M, can still be used for some modern computing tasks today. All CPU identification programs that came out before its Intel CPU string was divulged recognized Banias as a Pentium III, but Intel marketing tried its best to obfuscate what it was:

The arrival of the Pentium M on the market immediately gave Intel back the performance lead in the mobile segment. A second revision, the “Dothan,” increased this lead. The Pentium M was so superior to even desktop Pentium 4’s that many gamers bought them and ran them on desktop motherboards released for exactly that purpose. Of course, it wasn’t long before Intel started contemplating the release of a real desktop version of the Pentium M. When the next-generation Netburst design, called “Tejas,” proved to a disaster (engineering samples used 150W at 2.8 GHz), Intel cancelled it and decided to make the Pentium M design the basis of all future Intel releases.

The subsequent Intel Core and Core 2 Solo/Duo/Quad designs were based on enhancements to the Pentium M. The design has continued to evolve since. Older CPU identification programs will actually identify Pentium M, Core, Core 2 and Core i-series CPU’s through Ivy Bridge (at least) as Pentium II or III, because of the similarities in the architecture.

So if you’re running any Intel CPU with “Core” somewhere in its name, you can thank Israel for it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qv93x2jcf7pb05es', 'title': 'Is it true that Intel’s most advanced CPU designs were created in the Middle East?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'There is a grain of truth to this in that Intel’s Core and Core 2 designs, which have been the basis for all of the company’s mainstream CPU’s, were developed by the company’s development team in Haifa, Israel.

Niky Tamayo,Updated 3y,Why are more cars not made with gull wing doors considering how practical they are?,"Because gull-wing doors are not, in any way, practical.

Okay, okay… with the proper pivot point, gullwing doors are much easier to open in a tight parking space. Which is more a matter of convenience than practicality. But they’re quite a bit more complicated when it comes to indoor parking garages.

The Short, Chaotic History of the DeLorean

The Delorean DMC-12, for example, has doors that open up to six feet and five inches (1.961 meters) in height. Which is necessary because people, y’know, need to get in without banging their heads on the doors. Any less would be a danger. And the raised doors require pull handles to close, whereas your typical standard swing-door can be closed with a regular handle by a seat-belted driver or passenger.

It gets even worse with SUVs:

The Tesla Model X “Falcon Doors” manage to minimize the height gain for the tall SUV in terms of door clearance, but requires fancy software and sensors to keep from banging on parking lot ceilings, and a double pivot to ensure clearance when opening. Which adds complication to a heavy assembly that requires electric motors to open. Creating more failure points that can trap passengers in an accident that compromises the vehicle’s power supply.

Speaking of trapping, what happens when the vehicle flips over?

While a rollover can trap occupants behind swing doors, it’s not likely both sides will be wedged shut in a rollover, not without major roof deformation - and those doors will typically pop open, anyway, when that happens.

For cars with gullwing doors, you won’t be able to open them at all if the car is on its roof, so you need to add explosive bolts to pop them off:

VIDEO: Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG crash-test video shows off exploding door hinges

There’s a similar issue with scissor-doors…

BMW i8 Flips During Test Drive Crash in Mexico, Doors Open Tightly

Adding explosive bolts and emergency door removal systems adds more complexity and cost to an already heavy, expensive, assembly, one which will also wear out pneumatic struts and motors much faster than automatic tailgates, because you open them much more often. Gullwing doors also require you to redesign the roof for extra strength to meet rollover regulations.

Whereas you can avoid all these issues by simply using practical… regular… doors.

Kieran Doran,Updated 6y,What are some interesting things about the way the human body is designed?,"Quite disgustingly, some research has found evidence for the penis shape having evolved the way it has in order to scoop out semen from the vagina of a mate who had sex with someone else not long before
In the womb, the fingers are originally joined together. It is only when the cells between them die via apoptosis (planned cell death) that the fingers are formed
Pleasure is one of the most important survival tools we have (well, our evolution has) at our disposal. If not for pleasure, we would not eat or have sex and thus reproduce, for example. Unfortunately this tool can be hijacked by the likes of addiction
A problem with evolving intelligence and bigger brains is that women have to give birth while head size is still feasible to exit. This means that babies are born at a stage early in development, when a lot of care is still needed
Unfortunately for women, their pelvises are getting bigger in order to facilitate giving birth to large heads with big brains. This means their femur (thigh bone), the biggest bone in the body, attaches to the hip joint at a wider point, which destabilises the knee and thus women get more anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries
The body always starts off as female. This default position is only changed when a foetus has a Y chromosome. The Y chromosome contains the genes that make androgens like testosterone which creates the changes seen in a male body. So only androgens make a male a male, and the default is female.
Babies’ bodies are like a furnace! Babies have brown fat cells, whereas adults have white fat cells. White fat cells simply store fat and make people overweight and obese, but brown fat cells burn fat in a way not seen in adult bodies.

Philip Rabe,2y,What is a product design detail that only engineers will notice?,"Oh, they’re so ubiquitous nowadays, I doubt only product engineers who work on making a slightly better one would notice. The pop-top.

There’s really a lot going on here for two pieces of aluminum riveted together. Think about the failure per million rates… Pretty low. Old fashioned pull tabs that people would pull off and discard were sharp and injured thousands of people per year.

The lid was probably pretty simple: raw stamped discs would be stamped into the shape with the dimples and ring depression, then stamped again to score the pour opening and lettering.

The ring probably had to go through several more punching and finishing steps before getting a rivet, but it seems like an amazing bit of mechanical as well as product design too: Strong yet bendable without breaking off, and high enough above the lid to get the right lever function to pop open the can seal. It Must work at least once… lol

The can seal has to be sanitary, air tight, and yet be torn open with a few ounces of pressure (at exactly the right place).

Ciro Pabon,Updated 1y,What is the most efficient bridge design?,"It depends on the span and type of obstacle.

For spans of less than 3 or 4 meters, a box culvert is ideal, because it is simple to build.

For spans of less than 15 meters, a flat slab bridge is ideal, also because is simple and material is minmized.

For spans up to 30 meters a simple beam and slab bridge is usually the cheaper option.

For spans up to 100 or perhaps 200 meters, a tall beam or truss is usually more efficient, but is not unusual to see

truss bridges
cantilever bridges
hollow girder (the beams are hollow) and
continuous span bridges.

Truss

Cantilever which means that the large arches extend from the piers and meet using a smaller truss in the center

Hollow girder which means the beams are hollow

Continuous span which means the beams are continuous through spans, or monolithic or made of one piece

For spans over 200 meters you usually need a cable stayed bridge as best solution and for kilometres you usually find is more efficient and effective a suspension bridge.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rz0p4cs8k17ql6o2', 'title': 'What is the most efficient bridge design?', 'score': {'original': 0.9967, 'ai': 0.0033}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It depends on the span and type of obstacle.\n\nFor spans of less than 3 or 4 meters, a box culvert is ideal, because it is simple to build.\n\nFor spans of less than 15 meters, a flat slab bridge is ideal, also because is simple and material is minmized.\n\nFor spans up to 30 meters a simple beam and slab bridge is usually the cheaper option.\n\nFor spans up to 100 or perhaps 200 meters, a tall beam or truss is usually more efficient, but is not unusual to see\n\ntruss bridges\ncantilever bridges\nhollow girder (the beams are hollow) and\ncontinuous span bridges.\n\nTruss\n\nCantilever which means that the large arches extend from the piers and meet using a smaller truss in the center\n\nHollow girder which means the beams are hollow\n\nContinuous span which means the beams are continuous through spans, or monolithic or made of one piece\n\nFor spans over 200 meters you usually need a cable stayed bridge as best solution and for kilometres you usually find is more efficient and effective a suspension bridge.', 'result': {'fake': 0.0033, 'real': 0.9967}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1981086, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'It depends on the span and type of obstacle.\n\nFor spans of less than 3 or 4 meters, a box culvert is ideal, because it is simple to build.\n\nFor spans of less than 15 meters, a flat slab bridge is ideal, also because is simple and material is minmized.\n\nFor spans up to 30 meters a simple beam and slab bridge is usually the cheaper option.\n\nFor spans up to 100 or perhaps 200 meters, a tall beam or truss is usually more efficient, but is not unusual to see\n\ntruss bridges\ncantilever bridges\nhollow girder (the beams are hollow) and\ncontinuous span bridges.\n\nTruss\n\nCantilever which means that the large arches extend from the piers and meet using a smaller truss in the center\n\nHollow girder which means the beams are hollow\n\nContinuous span which means the beams are continuous through spans, or monolithic or made of one piece\n\nFor spans over 200 meters you usually need a cable stayed bridge as best solution and for kilometres you usually find is more efficient and effective a suspension bridge.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9967
John Stewart,Updated 1y,What could be considered a bad design in military equipment?,"The McDonnell-Douglas and Raytheon M47 (FGM-77) Dragon medium anti-armor weapon was first fielded in 1975. It was probably as much a hazard to the anti-tank gunner as it was to the tank. In 1988 I was an Army research psychologist on a team that examined the human factors issues with the Dragon, as part of a “lessons learned” approach to inform development of the future Advanced Anti Tank Weapon System-Medium (AAWS-M). The Lockheed-Martin FGM-148 Javelin won the AAWS-M competition, and Dragon was phased out of service in 2001.

The Dragon weighed about 50 pounds and the gunner was originally intended to fire the weapon from a prone position. It was found that the flames exiting the rear of the launch tube could burn the gunner’s legs, so it was decided safer to fire the weapon from a sitting position. The Dragon was wire guided, like the TOW (tube launched, optically tracked, wire guided) anti-tank missile. It was a “command to line of sight” weapon, which means the target had to be visible to the gunner, so the gunner was exposed while the missile went downrange. To be fair, there were some product improvements to the Dragon, and a lot of work in this respect implemented by the Marine Corps. Still, there is a fundamental problem inherent in a non-crew-served command to line of sight weapon.

Like TOW Dragon was not fast, going downrange at slightly more than 225 mph. Dragon had a sophisticated infrared guidance system built into the tracking sight that fixated on a heat source on the tail end of the missile and computed the difference between the missile’s location and the cross hairs in the optical sight. There were both day and night tracking sights. Theoretically the gunner only needed to keep the optical tracking sight’s cross hairs centered on the target and Dragon would find it.

The problem was that when Dragon was launched, there was a bright flash (especially at night) a loud report, that caused a startle response, and the gunner was surrounded by fumes for a split second, all while attempting to keep the tracking sight on target. This made tracking challenging. Add to this noticeable launch signature the fact that the gunner was sitting with the launch tube on his shoulder, exposed to counter fire from weapons that were faster than the Dragon missile. Live fire training was also a challenge, as the loud bang on launch could cause hearing loss with repeated practice.

Dragon was designed for the Cold War Air Land Battle Scenario, with waves of Soviet main battle tanks (MBT) attacking US combined arms heavy divisions. In this situation, it was estimated that attrition of infantry anti armor gunners would be on the order of 30%. Most of the data on the probability of killing an MBT with Dragon are based on benign, non combat test conditions, so we have no empirical data on Dragon’s accuracy in the real symmetric warfare environment, when facing a technically sophisticated enemy with advanced MBTs. This is also hypothetical, as the Dragon has been replaced by the much more capable “fire and forget” Javelin.

Predrag Gulan,Updated 9mo,"How did Ancient Greek hoplite armies identify each other if they were from different city states since each hoplite custom designed their tunic color, armor configuration, and shield design?","In pretty much the same way people identify each other in a modern mass brawl or football hooligan fight (which more often than not features no or very few recognisable jerseys, scarves or other features). Roughly speaking men to your left, right and back are friendly. Those who face you are the enemy. If that isn’t the case the battle turned into some kind of chaotic skirmish, and there is no way of saying men DID identify each other easily in that case.

But hoplite armies were initially small enough and groups of men would fight close to their friends and family members (initially, nobles had their own warbands/private armies that would join ranks with allied nobles), familiar people in any case, and most of their shield blazons and attire, number and faces of unarmoured attendants as well - would’ve been familiar. Hoplite battles rarely included more than few hundred to few thousand men at most. Sometimes even dozens. You’d know Ariston and Diokles sons of Orsippos, they had white plumes but the older, brutish brother had a bull on his shield, while the younger and swifter one had a leg on his. You’d also recognise Kalliteles son of Anochos, a tall guy with a tall plume and a chariot box on his shield, advertising the elite status of his family and their prestige.

When armies grew larger, into thousands and tens of thousands, notably during Peloponnesian wars, identifying did become a greater issue, and steps were taken to address it, such as putting letters instead of/to act as shield blazons - a practice many wrongly project back in time way too far. For example, mere 50 years earlier Persian wars were fought without any common state symbols. By the end of the century it did become a bit of an issue so steps were taken to make men more recognisable.

However, how widespread such practice was is questionable. Due to something called confirmation bias we have people eager to project back the practice of putting letters onto shields into past, and identify letters of the Greek alphabet on shields as evidence of city uniforms. However, the letters of the alphabet, most notably A, S and M...were seen in pottery from South Italy to Corinth throughout the mid to late Archaic age, without any connection to city states whose names started with A,S or M.

Simply speaking shield emblems at the time were not unit identifiers or city identifiers, just way of communicating a message to gods, to your friends and to your foes. And you could go to war without any symbol at all or the meaningless yet decorative one (or the meaning of which is lost to us).
