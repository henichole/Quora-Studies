Niklas Göke,6y,What are the most important things to know about personal finance?,"Let’s say you start investing when you’re 20. You manage to save $5,000 each year and put them into stocks and index funds, which net you 8% in returns per year on average. At 30, you stop putting in money for good, but keep the investments you’ve accumulated so far.

Now, a different scenario. You don’t want to save and invest $5,000 each year in your twenties, because hey, you’re young. You want to have fun, you can do the responsible stuff later. So, you start investing at 30, the same sum each year. However, because you started later, you don’t stop after 10 years. Instead, you put in $5,000 every year until you retire at 65.

Here’s the insane part:

The kid who invested from 20 to 30, then never again, ends up with more money.

$1,156,619, to be exact. The late bloomer, despite his continued efforts, only makes it to $930,510...

Kathy Pennell,2y,What is a piece of advice that changed you for the better?,"I was about eleven when my maternal grandmother told me this.

I walked to my grandparents’ house after school one day. We lived on a farm then and the school I attended was about a mile-long walk through the town to their house.

I was about this age at the time of the event.

I was normally a happy child, so when I walked through the door a bit mopey, Grandma implemented the cure that nearly always worked. She took me into the kitchen where she prepared hot chocolate and cookies then waited.

About halfway through my hot chocolate, I said. “I thought this girl at school liked me, but I don’t think she does. She said something mean to me today.” I let that sink in then added the punch line. “I don’t think anyone at school likes me.”

Grandma listened patiently while she sipped her coffee. When she replaced the cup on the saucer, I knew she was going to give me her sage advice.

“Totty,” Grandma often called me Totty instead of Kathy. “Totty, a few people will really like me and be my friend. There may be one or two people who may not like me. But the vast majority of people won’t care one way or the other about me. They may say hello and notice what I’m wearing. But as soon as I’m out of sight, they will forget me entirely.”

Even at 11, I understood what she meant. Some people will really like you. One or two won’t like you. But the vast majority of people don’t care about you one way or the other. It’s just human nature. So the idea that everyone doesn’t like you is false.

Just because someone walks past you and doesn’t speak, it doesn’t mean they don’t like you. It may mean they’re preoccupied. Sometimes, people may be a bit snippy with you. If you have done nothing wrong, then they are taking their bad day out on you and it has nothing to do with your personally.

I’ve tried to remember that when something unpleasant happens. If I’ve done nothing to warrant someone being a bit sharp with me, then I chalk it up to something that’s happened to them which has nothing to do with me.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fti3p2bzx69qn7uo', 'title': 'What is a piece of advice that changed you for the better?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I was about eleven when my maternal grandmother told me this.\n\nI walked to my grandparents’ house after school one day.

Vijaykumar Puri,6y,What is the single most effective piece of financial advice you've ever received?,"The best piece of financial advice was given to me by my professor of Economics.

Situation 1:

It is late night and you are walking home from office after a long and tiring day.

You are thirsty but your water bottle is empty. Your house is still far and you know that if you don’t drink water soon, you will not be able to walk.

Suddenly, you see an open shop in the distance. A convenience store!

You approach the owner and ask for a bottle of water.

He hands over a bottle of water to you

You are delighted to hold the bottle in your hand and a sense of happiness surrounds you.

You check the bottle for the MRP indication. It is Rs.10, you remove the cash and hand it over to the owner.

The owner looks at you and says “The price will be Rs. 20”

You look at him in disbelief. You know your legal rights and that the owner is unethical and wrong. There is no way out at the moment, and you eventually pay him Rs.20.

Situation 2:

It is again late night and you are walking home after a tiring day. You feel thirsty but you remember you have ample water with you.

So you remove your water bottle, quench your thirst and continue your journey home.

On the way, as you pass by a convenience store, the owner approaches you and says, “Today, we have an irresistible offer and you just cannot miss it. A water bottle of MRP Rs.10 is available at Re.1 only!!! Hurry up, offer expires midnight!”

You look at him, smile and walk away.

So what do we learn?

The principle is simple;

If there is a genuine need, it is okay to pay even Rs.20 for a thing costing Rs.10

but

if there is no need, it is not okay to pay even Re.1 for a thing costing Rs.10, no matter how good the offer seems!

This is such a basic principle that we always tend to ignore it.

So before you proceed to pounce on that next great online offer before it expires, ask yourself - “Do I really need this?”

This always helps me keep things in perspective while purchasing anything and is undoubtedly the most valuable financial advice that I have ever received.

And I would like to end by quoting Tyler Durden from Fight Club

Asim Qureshi,6y,Why isn’t gold considered to be a good investment?,"Throughout the ages, gold has been a universal currency and a great store of value.

It hasn’t really been an investment until recent times, in the same way the US$ isn’t really an investment today.

But the reason why gold isn’t a great investment today is as follows…

All the gold in the world is worth around US$7,500Bn. And it'd fit in a cube of 20m length.

Now, gold has uses, but none that are significant except jewellery, so, big picture, it’s pretty useless.

If you bought all the gold in the world for $7.5Tn after, say, 20 years, it’d be worth a little more than $7.5Tn (inflation and the global economy would push up the price).

Now sure, I'm ignoring the speculative element, but you don't invest long-term in the expectation you will sell in a speculative bubble - you look at fundamentals.

Note, you would get no dividend or yield on gold - in fact, you’d need to pay for storage.

What could you buy instead of that $7.5Tn worth of gold?

You could buy Apple ($900Bn), Facebook ($500Bn), Alibaba ($450Bn), Google ($750Bn), Amazon ($550Bn), Microsoft ($650Bn), Netflix ($80Bn), Uber ($50Bn), and Tesla ($55Bn).

That’d cost you $4Tn.

You could then buy all the property in London for $1.5Tn. Add New York for $1Tn. You would benefit from all the rent and still own it all after 20 years.

And with the $1Tn change, you could buy 250 million acres of income-producing farmland in the US. You would not only make money on the crop produced but own the land at the end.

So, 20 years down the line, which investment do you think would have been the better one?

This line of argument is exactly why the world’s best investor, Warren Buffett, doesn’t own gold.

And it’s why you shouldn’t either…","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5dw9bi2hmnog3r7c', 'title': 'Why isn’t gold considered to be a good investment?', 'score': {'original': 0.986, 'ai': 0.014}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Throughout the ages, gold has been a universal currency and a great store of value.\n\nIt hasn’t really been an investment until recent times, in the same way the US$ isn’t really an investment today.\n\nBut the reason why gold isn’t a great investment today is as follows…\n\nAll the gold in the world is worth around US$7,500Bn.

Ajay Pruthi,4y,Why is investing important?,"My maid came to me in 2002 and was looking a bit worried. I just had completed my engineering and we four friends were living in a 2 BHK in Mumbai.

I asked her what was bothering her? The answer was very simple- I have a daughter and I want her to be educated like you guys. I do not want her to be like me, going to people houses and cooking food.

I said ok, but what are you worried about? She said- I do not know how to save or invest. I asked her, how much she can save monthly and she said around 2,000 per month. It was a good amount at that point of time.

Give me a week`s time and I will let you know, was my answer.

I was also new to investing but I researched and after a week suggested her 2 mutual funds. To my surprise, she actually started investing after 1 month.

Another 2 years, I was in the same flat and she was still investing. But time changes and so does the jobs. I got a new job in Delhi in year 2004. Before shifting to Delhi, I advised her 2 things, just 2 things- Do not withdraw this money for any other things, whatever the circumstances may be. And withdraw all the amount 3 years before your daughter`s higher education and put it in a FD.

This is my number and you can call me if you ever face any problem regarding your investments.

I never received a call from her in next 14 years.

Year 2019- I received a call from an unknown number. She called me to tell that her daughter is now an engineer. In fact, after paying for her education, she still has money left for her daughter`s marriage.(The money had grown to around 18 Lakhs)

She said thank you and it was clearly visible from her voice that she was crying.

Perhaps Tears of Happiness and that is why investing is important.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/53lqy12fwpbgx96i', 'title': 'Why is investing important?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My maid came to me in 2002 and was looking a bit worried.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,6y,"If the government stopped investing in defence and rather invested the same amount of money in other sectors, how would the economy of the country be?","If the Indian government stopped investing in defence, its economy will shatter to pieces and civil wars would rip apart the region with 100x intensity of what is happening in Syria [India’s population is about 100x of Syria’s current population]. This would send hundreds of millions of refugees in an unimaginable scale humanitarian crisis for the world.

How will this unfold?

First, China would swoop into Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh and take over what is remaining of independent Tibetan culture. Same would happen to Jammu & Kashmir with Pakistan running through. Not to be left behind, the Nepali extremists who still have wet dreams about the Sugauli treaty would try to take over Sikkim, Darjeeling, Uttarakhand etc.

UN would be a muted spectator - just as it was when China took over Tibet in 1949 and Pakistan sent its irregulars into the independent kingdom of Jammu & Kashmir in 1948. The “international community” would do their own calculations and wouldn’t do much more than giving some noise. No one would dare to get into a scale of war this unthinkable.

Millions of Arunachalis, Ladakhis, Kumaounis, Jammuites and Kashmiris would run over to other parts of India as refugees. We would be revisiting the scenes of partition - with the incoming refugees showing their anger on a few segments of people, such as the Indian Muslims. Cities would be torn in chaos and squalor.

Second, the Nagas in the Northeast take over the Greater Nagalim. There is a “little” glitch though. Their Nagalim also includes most of Manipur, parts of Burma and Arunachal Pradesh. What would the Manipuris do in the absence of Indian army fighting for them? Of course break apart and fight a war. They would be aided by the Burmese and we would be seeing something as brutal as the Middle East conflict.

Third, our “friendly” terrorists from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Chechnya and elsewhere would setup bases across India - in Malappuram, Kozhikode, Aligarh, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Coimbatore etc. Everyday we would see a repeat of Mumbai 2008. Oh, but we are not done yet.

As the terror bases spread across a lawless India, the western powers would come after them and put up their bases across India to fight it out. Just like they did in Afghanistan. Americans would be dropping Daisy Cutters and MOABs and other nicer things on Indian villages, cities and weddings. Guns and bombs would fill India’s villages and slums [what were previously cities].

Fourth, Punjab would be ripped apart between the supporters of Khalistan and the loyalists of India. At some point the Indian loyalists would lose and would be either brutally murdered or would be thrown out. After they completely “liberate” Punjab to create a Sikh land, they will see the true face of Pakistan that was until now supporting them. The Wahabis coming out of their successes are not going to be content with yet another “infidel” religious country in their border. Oh, another sweet war in our backyard.

Fifth, as the Hindu population face the onslaught of terrorists, Khalistanis and foreign powers, they would organise their own gangs too. Imagine if 800 million organising in gangs and terror groups. It will bring a civil war of unimaginable scale. Millions of Bajrang Dal and other senas would fly with their flags through Indian cities, warring against the other groups.

Sixth, Bangladesh would be emboldened to push into parts of West Bengal and ask for a referendum in the way Russia did in Crimea. A lot of the didi’s constituencies might vote to join Bangladesh. Scenes of 1946 Direct Action Day would be played in Kolkata and other places.

Our didi would become jobless as they have two bigger didi’s in Bangladesh and our CPI (M) folks will also be sent home as there are bigger goons.

Seventh, as the Indian Navy vanishes in the Indian Ocean, pirates would find it a field day just as they did in Somalia after its military vanished. India’s shipping lines and global trades would break apart as the pirates would attack ships with impunity. While India would not have the power to fight back, as these pirates attack other nation’s ships there will be a massive reaction.

To fight these pirates, the major powers would send their navies who would not only kill the pirates but almost any boat - including Indian fisherman boats. If you thought a few Italians killing a few Indian fisherman was bad, wait for Indian coasts to be taken over in a battle between pirates and anti-pirates.

Eighth, as natural disasters strike different parts of India, there would not be a sufficient response. Since we would be used to having thousands of people killed everyday, we would not bother about a few million more dying in earthquakes and floods without the Indian army intervening with emergency help.

Ninth, just as the Tamil diaspora sent massive amounts of money during the Sri Lankan civil war, the Indian diaspora would send billions of dollars to the different groups fighting this civil war. This would eventually bring global sanctions and also discrimination against them in the west and elsewhere.

Oh, are you still thinking about the economy? Oh, so silly. Is any major corporation investing in Syria nowadays? How about their global trade?

What once used to be a cosmopolitan locality in a major city. Imagine your city.

India’s armed forces are the ones standing between me [peacefully typing this post, you peacefully reading this post] and the marauding civil war & chaos that is waiting at its seams.

The reason why some nationalists get so worked up on the mention of separatism or breaking apart India, is because of this scary picture. It is so scary to even imagine and even entertain 1% chance of this happening. When nations weaken this is what happens and we have seen this collapse many times in our history.

The answer will also hold if every army in the world drops all their weapons.

His entire family and friends contribute and take part with enthusiasm and excitement.

He keeps two big drums of cold water during summers outside the small house where he lives on the 2nd floor for thirsty people to drink during summers.

Every passing year he conducts a havan (religious ceremony) at his home to thank God for giving a stress free happy life in previous year.

He doesn't own many clothes but always wears well ironed clean clothes, and keeps his hair well combed.

I don't know how he manages his expenses in this financially draining world of today but lack of any stress on his forehead muscles, and the permanent smile shows how satisfied he is.

Asim Qureshi,6y,What is the best financial advice for young people?,"Some advice for those still in education. And while it may not sound financial, it is…

There is a MASSIVE shortage of technologists across the world, and it’s only going to get more acute.

Half of jobs paying over US$57k in the US require coding skills. HALF!

And in this space, no-one cares what degree you have. They want skills.

So, if the following apply to you…

You’re unlikely to get a tier 1 job (doctor, investment banking, lawyer, etc..)
…but you’d like to as you want lots of money
You have no particular career passions in life (like most people)

…then do this. Forget your degree. And go on an intensive coding course instead. You’ll probably get a solid job in 3–6 months.

Or if you have a degree, seriously think about getting into coding.

Around 5–10 years from now you’ll be able to command an annual pay of US$25–60k in today’s terms sitting in a village in India so long as you have a laptop and internet connection, and have worked hard.

If you work from an office in a developed country you’ll get a lot more.

And if you’re exceptional, there is nothing stopping you making US$300k+ at Google, Facebook, etc…

The thing is, the flexibility you’ll have is amazing, and you’ll always find it piss easy to get a well paid job - there is just so much demand for coders.

And programming is a great skill to learn if you want to be an entrepreneur.

Hector Quintanilla,Updated 3y,How do I improve my personal finances?,"Imagine you’re in the middle of the desert.

Imagine that when you work, you get paid in water.

The first problem you will bump into will be how to store your water.

Solution?

Use a glass instead of your hands.

Second problem?

The water will evaporate with time, correct?

To solve this you need a canteen with a cap to prevent evaporation.

Great!

The next challenge will be to resolve long term reserves.

This seems like a simple solution; you get multiple canteens and build up your store.

Amazing!

Next problem…

When you lose your strength to work, you will need to start consuming those canteens. Your life expectancy in the desert will be determined by the number of canteens you were able to accumulate during your work life.

Some people in the desert may have accumulated enough to drink during their elder years, some won’t.

Ideal solution?

Own a water well in the desert.

(Source of all images: Google)

Interpretation of the analogy:

Water = Money (cash)
Water in a glass that evaporates = Cash in a bank.
Water in a canteen = Assets that appreciate with inflation. They maintain their value over time. Some examples are commodities like oil, gold and silver.
Accumulated water in canteens = Savings in assets.
Losing strength to work = Retirement.
Water well = Cash flowing assets.

Lesson of the analogy:

Money is only a mechanism of exchange that holds a temporary storage of value.
If you save cash, time will ‘evaporate’ its current value.
Some assets protect us from monetary volatility. This is specially important in third world countries like my Mexico.
Accumulating assets may not be enough to guarantee your retirement because you will need to liquidate them to pay for your needs.
The water well represents cash flowing assets. These assets produce passive income, meaning they produce cash even while you sleep.

To answer your question, how can you improve your personal finances?

One of the best ways to improve your personal finances is by investing intentionally in cash-flowing assets.

The most common are real estate rentals, businesses and royalties.

Your first step is to protect your savings from the external influence of monetary policies that will “evaporate” the value of your hard work.

Yves Pircher,5y,Why hasn't a mathematical model to beat the stock market been found?,"Because the market is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system.

Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it (e.g. weather): It doesn’t care what the weatherman says; if it rains, it rains. Though it is influenced by a myriad of factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts.
Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it and therefore can never be predicted accurately (e.g. markets): They care a lot about predictions and rumours . What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise.

So many forces are at work and their interactions are so complex that extremely small variations in the strength of the forces and the way they interact produce huge differences in outcomes.

Hector Quintanilla,4y,What does it mean that wealth is created?,"You go to Walmart to buy:

One cup of salted butter — $0.65
One cup of white sugar — $0.15
One cup of brown sugar — $0.15
Two tablespoons of vanilla — $0.05
Two large eggs — $0.15
Three cups of all-purpose flour — $1.50
One tablespoon of baking soda — $0.05
½ Tablespoon of baking powder —$0.05
Total: $2.75 USD

Next, you go home and bake 30 cookies.

Then you deliver them to a party and get paid $30 for your 30 fresh-baked cookies.

You just created $30 minus $2.75 of expenses = $27.25 of wealth.

So, to answer your question, what does it mean that wealth is created?

“Created wealth” means the value that someone else was willing to pay for it.

In my example above, the value was:

Going to Walmart
Buying the ingredients
Preparing the cookies with your secret recipe
Delivering them to the customer

The profit of $27.25 was the value (wealth) you created during this transaction.

The more value you can deliver to the market… the more wealthy you will become.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1tfn4o9lpibauxy0', 'title': 'What does it mean that wealth is created?', 'score': {'original': 0.9396, 'ai': 0.0604}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'You go to Walmart to buy:\n\nOne cup of salted butter — $0.65\nOne cup of white sugar — $0.15\nOne cup of brown sugar — $0.15\nTwo tablespoons of vanilla — $0.05\nTwo large eggs — $0.15\nThree cups of all-purpose flour — $1.50\nOne tablespoon of baking soda — $0.05\n½ Tablespoon of baking powder —$0.05\nTotal: $2.75 USD\n\nNext, you go home and bake 30 cookies.\n\nThen you deliver them to a party and get paid $30 for your 30 fresh-baked cookies.\n\nYou just created $30 minus $2.75 of expenses = $27.25 of wealth.\n\nSo, to answer your question, what does it mean that wealth is created?\n\n“Created wealth” means the value that someone else was willing to pay for it.\n\nIn my example above, the value was:\n\nGoing to Walmart\nBuying the ingredients\nPreparing the cookies with your secret recipe\nDelivering them to the customer\n\nThe profit of $27.25 was the value (wealth) you created during this transaction.\n\nThe more value you can deliver to the market… the more wealthy you will become.', 'result': {'fake': 0.0604, 'real': 0.9396}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1976978, 'subscription': 0, 'content': 'You go to Walmart to buy:\n\nOne cup of salted butter — $0.65\nOne cup of white sugar — $0.15\nOne cup of brown sugar — $0.15\nTwo tablespoons of vanilla — $0.05\nTwo large eggs — $0.15\nThree cups of all-purpose flour — $1.50\nOne tablespoon of baking soda — $0.05\n½ Tablespoon of baking powder —$0.05\nTotal: $2.75 USD\n\nNext, you go home and bake 30 cookies.\n\nThen you deliver them to a party and get paid $30 for your 30 fresh-baked cookies.\n\nYou just created $30 minus $2.75 of expenses = $27.25 of wealth.\n\nSo, to answer your question, what does it mean that wealth is created?\n\n“Created wealth” means the value that someone else was willing to pay for it.\n\nIn my example above, the value was:\n\nGoing to Walmart\nBuying the ingredients\nPreparing the cookies with your secret recipe\nDelivering them to the customer\n\nThe profit of $27.25 was the value (wealth) you created during this transaction.\n\nThe more value you can deliver to the market… the more wealthy you will become.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9396

“Both him and I went client to client for 6 months, selling our product. After 10 clients we hired our first sales rep using our revenue”

“And that’s how we scaled - ploughing back client revenue to build a team which resulted in greater revenue”

Rick,Updated 1y,What is the single most effective piece of financial advice you've ever received?,"We were newlyweds. My wife moved into my rented apartment because the rent was cheap. Months later, a new landlord doubled our rent. Of course, both of us made very little money at the time. So we planned to save our money, and someday… maybe in 10 or 20 years… we would have a reasonable down payment to put on our own house.

While spending the weekend with older and more successful friends, we mentioned our plan. Our friend said, “No! By the time you save for that huge down payment, house prices will have skyrocketed! Get your hands on every penny you can. Cash in insurance policies if you have to. But figure out where you want to live and buy now!”

We decided on where we wanted to live. We hadn’t spent our “wedding money” yet, so we added every dollar we could afford to put aside… and bought a lovely 5-room house a few blocks from the ocean for $35,000. (1984). A year later, it was valued at more than $100,000. because AT&T built an office building in our town, its executives wanted to live near the ocean. Twenty years later, we sold it for $250,000, which bought our home in Maine. Ten years later, we sold our house in Maine, which paid for our present home in Santa Fe, NM.

…all because we trusted a friend’s advice and bought a $35,000 house in 1984.

UPDATE: Let me add something here. The question asked for the best financial advice I had ever RECEIVED. I answered it honestly based on our first home purchase in 1984.

Balaji Reddy,3y,"Is the saying ""it’s always a good time to buy a house” true?","It's not always the case. Let me tell you with an example.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala listened to his mother and took out the successful investment he made in a company called “CRISIL Ltd.” when the stock price is Rs.200 to 300.

But Rakesh being a stock trader made his analysis and found that if he had kept that stock instead of selling it at 27 crore in 2005, it would be worth 600 crore in 2015. That's a whopping 20 times!!!

Martin Bayer,Feb 7,Are expensive cookware worth the investment?,"Good quality cookware is a wise investment.

Quality cookware will help you make better food. Most of the cheap stuff is made from thin gauge aluminum, will have hot spots and give you unpredictable results. Quality cookware has some weight to it, heats evenly and helps you produce better food. When you spend an extra buck on cookware, you’re not just buying more material, you’re buying better materials and the fact that it was designed with a purpose.

Cheap stuff, like this set from Alibaba, is just stamped out and sent on its way. You can cook food with it, but it’s not going to give stellar results.

That’s the pretty in pink disappointing dinner cook set. Tell me those gold tone handles don’t set that shit off! Too bad your dinner won’t look that great.

Compared to quality pans, well, there’s no comparison. Quality pans like AllClad, Tramontina and Le Creuset are engineered to help you cook better, mostly to being cladded cookware. They’re stainless on the outside but aluminum in the core, so the heat up quickly and evenly, not randomly, like the pretty in pink set.

That’s what you’re paying for when you buy good cookware, predictable results, as well as good looks and a long lifespan. That’s why it’s a good investment.

You don’t have to dump a lot of money into cookware though. Buy the pieces you’ll use, not expensive sets that include pots and pans you’ll never touch. My wife and I do the majority of our cooking in a flat bottomed wok, a Lodge cast iron pan, a couple of AllClad pans, an old aluminum Leyseware pot and a Tramontina non stick pan. All those pans are good quality and give predictable results, but didn’t cost an arm and a leg. We also don’t clutter our kitchen up with cookware we don’t use, which means money never spent.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mjyn63ogac1e4f2i', 'title': 'Are expensive cookware worth the investment?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Good quality cookware is a wise investment.\n\nQuality cookware will help you make better food.

Ron Rule,Updated 6y,Why do lottery winners often blow through their winnings?,"If you’ve never made a lot of money, your brain works in month-to-month mode - you only think about the price tag, not the long term ownership costs. When I was last looking at houses in New Jersey, a place caught my eye that was about $2 million. I really liked the house, but decided not to get it - the problem wasn’t the $2 million, it was the fact that the taxes were nearly $52,000 per year.

Or to put it another way… even if you were to pay cash for that house, the taxes alone will still cost you $4,333 per month. If you plan on living there for 10 years, that means you’re going to be giving the government another $500k.

… And that’s if the house never appreciates in value.

Oh yeah, you forgot that part didn’t you. What do you think that $2 million house is going to be worth in ten years? Four million? Five? Let’s say it appreciates to $5 million - now your annual property taxes are $130,000. One hundred thirty thousand dollars going out the door per year, just to pay the property taxes on a house you already paid for?

Yeah. Screw that.

Someone who earned their income, and was continuing to earn an income, would think about this and decide whether or not they felt it was worth it. I decided against the $2 million house for this reason. But someone who won the lottery wouldn’t think that far ahead - they would only be focused on the fact that they could finally afford the $2 million price tag for their dream house.

Among the few lottery winners who did take the time to think about the property taxes, they would fixate only on the annual cost - not how much that number becomes over time. ($52,000? Chump Change. I have $7 million in the bank!).

Then the next round of expenses start. What do you think it costs to insure, heat, and cool that house? Chances are if you’re at or below the median income, you’ve never seen a power bill more than a couple hundred dollars. Multiply that by ten. ($2,000 a month for utilities? Chump change. I still have $5 million in the bank!).

By the way, you aren’t going to fill that house with furniture from Big Lots and Rent-A-Center anymore. No-sir-ee, you’re getting the good stuff. ($100K for furniture? Chump change. I still have $4.9 million in the bank!)

Then they pay off their parents’ mortgage - on both sides if the lottery winner is a married couple - and this could be a multiple of four if their parents are divorced. But fortunately, their parents don’t have huge expensive houses, so collectively it’s only about $400k. ($400k? Chump change! I still have $4.5 million in the bank!)

Then they go pick out their cars. She wants a $94,000 Mercedes. He wants a $200,000 Lamborghini. And they both agree they should also have a third vehicle that’s “more sensible”, like a $70k Yukon Denali and can tow the boat they might get later. ($364k? Chump change! I still have $4 million in the bank!).

And you know, we’ve always wanted a vacation house in the Smoky’s. Real estate isn’t too expensive out there, we could buy ourselves a really nice cabin at a reasonable price. ($250k? Chump change! We still have $3.6 million in the bank.)

Oh, and that nephew of yours who’s really good with computers wants $50,000 to help his startup get off the ground. Let’s make it $100k. This could be a good investment. And if it’s not, who cares, $100k is chump change. We still have $3.5 million in the bank.

And on and on it goes. The big expenses are out of the way, but here come the little chips. ATVs and wave runners here, an RV there, extravagant vacations, bad investments, friends who come out of the woodwork with sob stories and only need $5k-$10k to solve all of their problems. It’s always something.

When the winners get down to around $1.5 million, that’s when they start noticing something is wrong.

WTF? We had $7 million two years ago. Where the hell did it go?

Meanwhile, their monthly expenses have gone from $3,500 per month before they won the lottery to $20,000 per month after - which exceeds the interest income derived from the remainder of their winnings. Even if they stopped buying new things today, their income and balance will still go down every month.

In this example, at least they paid cash for everything and could sell stuff to turn it around. But a lot of people didn’t do that … they bought some things cash and other things on credit. Or bought their dream house cash, then turned around and mortgaged it and bought a bunch of over-priced rental properties - which they have no idea how to manage - and usually make two or ten other terrible investment decisions along the way too.

Before they know it, they’re way over their heads, and they never saw it coming. They didn’t care that they were over-paying for everything, because they could afford it. But over time, it catches up with you. And you’re still paying all of those ‘cost of ownership’ expenses, watching what was left of your winnings dwindle each year. When it’s all said and done, all they have left is a bunch of stuff they can’t afford, which they turn around and sell for less than what it’s worth just to get out of it.

If they can, that is. That house I looked at in New Jersey is still for sale a year and a half later.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/o4fscz0ujhripadk', 'title': 'Why do lottery winners often blow through their winnings?', 'score': {'original': 0.49355, 'ai': 0.50645}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'If you’ve never made a lot of money, your brain works in month-to-month mode - you only think about the price tag, not the long term ownership costs.

Shubham Bhatt,4y,Why would you invest in yourself?,"There was a guy in my college who used to live for others and never gave time to himself.

He was one the favoritos among boys and girls.

He got good marks in first semester but it deteriorated in coming semesters due to the same investment of time and energy for others instead of himself.

He used to love a girl from his class. When he came to know about a guy who used to love her, he made her a sister.

After the college, many of our friends got selected in various companies but he didn't. He scored a low percentage due to which he had to face “Not selected” tag.

“No problem, I have friends and family” he came out of the interview panel after last rejection.

What he saw?

Those friends and family of college got engaged with each other ignoring the guy who invested his whole graduation time, energy and money for them.

No one remembers the failure person once they get successful (except few ones). This is a harsh reality of today's society.

We should invest time, money and energy for others as much as we can but give priority to ourself in order to reach a stage from where few others might hear us as a “successful person”.

Steven Haddock,4y,Why do lottery winners often blow through their winnings?,"Comedy writer John Cheese, who writes for cracked.com, says most of this comes down to a fundamental belief poor people have about money.

To poor people, money is a perishable commodity like fresh fruit. If you try to hold onto money instead of spending it on stuff right away, it is very likely you will lose it as friends and family (who are also poor) will make increasing demands on your resources. He said that when he was growing up, and as a poor young adult, when he received his annual tax credit it was never “this will pay for the rent for six months” but “we have to spend this now while we still have it”.

So it doesn’t matter what the amount is. If you don’t spend money, it will disappear. It’s one of the reasons why poor people use cheque cashing places rather than banks.

“I used a bank once! Two months after I put my money in there, it was all eaten up by fees! I was once $10 overdrawn and they charged me $150!”

At least if they spend that money, they often have something to show for it.

There is a real fear that if they “put it away” it will disappear.

And don’t laugh. My cousin was a successful public relations consultant. She made a small fortune. She got a recommendation about a financial advisor. Who stole all her money, put her into a depression and that led her to quit the business.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/46uindo2aqkjcpgh', 'title': 'Why do lottery winners often blow through their winnings?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Comedy writer John Cheese, who writes for cracked.com, says most of this comes down to a fundamental belief poor people have about money.\n\nTo poor people, money is a perishable commodity like fresh fruit.

Prajwal,4y,Why is investment important for the future?,"This is Vijayalakshmi.

She is a famous South Indian actress. She has acted in around 37 movies including Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.

She has acted with almost all the big names of every South Indian film industry like Vishnuvardhan, Shivarajkumar, Raghavendra Rajkumar, Upendra, Mohan Lal, Vijay, Suriya, Arjun Sarja and so on.

She has also acted in a number of serials and hosted quite a few successful game shows.

Basically, every South Indian movie buff would be quite familiar with her.

Today, she is admitted in a hospital and is seeking monetary help from anyone she can. She says she doesn’t even have a house to go back to.

What happened?

How did such a successful actress fall from her grace?

Simple. When you are riding the high horse, you wouldn’t think of what would happen if the saddle comes loose. Basically, no investment for the future.

Sure, an actress has to splurge a considerable amount of money in terms of fashion and status to keep herself employable. But what happens when you are no more employable?

This situation can be averted by judicial investment of your finances.

A supporting actor for a serial today is paid around 3000 per episode excluding food and transport. So the main character will be obviously paid at least twice of that. For simplicity sake, lets consider it as 6000. Multiply that with 500 episodes (one of her serials ran for 845 episodes). 30 lakh rupees. And this is a conservative estimate. Main actresses get paid a lot more than that.

A 30lac investment over a period of 10 years in an SBI mutual fund would have generated 94lacs!

She is crying and blaming all her co stars that no one is helping her. They probably should, but how can you think that they owe you something?

Hopefully she gets better and gets back to the stardom she had achieved and this time build a better future.

And that’s why investment is important.

Hannah Scott,Sep 30,Is investing in 529 better than investing in index funds?,"Investing in a 529 plan versus index funds?

Ah, the eternal battle of education savings versus broad market returns.

Let me tell you, my friend, investing in a 529 plan is like sending your money on an educational adventure, full of restrictions and limited choices.

Sure, it may offer some tax advantages, but at what cost?

You're locking your hard-earned money away for a specific purpose, limiting your investment options, and subjecting yourself to potential penalties if you withdraw for non-qualified expenses.

Now, let's talk about index funds.

They're like the superheroes of the investment world, providing diversification, low costs, and long-term growth potential.

With index funds, you have the freedom to invest in a wide range of market segments, capturing the overall performance of the economy.

No restrictions, no limitations.

Plus, you get to enjoy the beauty of compounding returns over time.

So, my dear questioner, if you want flexibility, freedom, and the potential for higher returns, index funds are the way to go.

Leave the 529 plans for those who enjoy the thrill of educational bureaucracy.

But hey, that's just my opinion.

Take it with a grain of salt and make your judgment call.

Happy investing!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2bo8eu9ad0ijqc54', 'title': 'Is investing in 529 better than investing in index funds?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Investing in a 529 plan versus index funds?\n\nAh, the eternal battle of education savings versus broad market returns.\n\nLet me tell you, my friend, investing in a 529 plan is like sending your money on an educational adventure, full of restrictions and limited choices.\n\nSure, it may offer some tax advantages, but at what cost?\n\nYou're locking your hard-earned money away for a specific purpose, limiting your investment options, and subjecting yourself to potential penalties if you withdraw for non-qualified expenses.\n\nNow, let's talk about index funds.\n\nThey're like the superheroes of the investment world, providing diversification, low costs, and long-term growth potential.\n\nWith index funds, you have the freedom to invest in a wide range of market segments, capturing the overall performance of the economy.\n\nNo restrictions, no limitations.\n\nPlus, you get to enjoy the beauty of compounding returns over time.\n\nSo, my dear questioner, if you want flexibility, freedom, and the potential for higher returns, index funds are the way to go.\n\nLeave the 529 plans for those who enjoy the thrill of educational bureaucracy.\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt and make your judgment call.\n\nHappy investing!"", 'result': {'fake': 1, 'real': 0}, 'status': 'success'}], 'credits_used': 2, 'credits': 1976935, 'subscription': 0, 'content': ""Investing in a 529 plan versus index funds?\n\nAh, the eternal battle of education savings versus broad market returns.\n\nLet me tell you, my friend, investing in a 529 plan is like sending your money on an educational adventure, full of restrictions and limited choices.\n\nSure, it may offer some tax advantages, but at what cost?\n\nYou're locking your hard-earned money away for a specific purpose, limiting your investment options, and subjecting yourself to potential penalties if you withdraw for non-qualified expenses.\n\nNow, let's talk about index funds.\n\nThey're like the superheroes of the investment world, providing diversification, low costs, and long-term growth potential.\n\nWith index funds, you have the freedom to invest in a wide range of market segments, capturing the overall performance of the economy.\n\nNo restrictions, no limitations.\n\nPlus, you get to enjoy the beauty of compounding returns over time.\n\nSo, my dear questioner, if you want flexibility, freedom, and the potential for higher returns, index funds are the way to go.\n\nLeave the 529 plans for those who enjoy the thrill of educational bureaucracy.\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt and make your judgment call.\n\nHappy investing!"", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0

I also mine with them and most importantly store my bitcoin securely with them. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Be careful out there for there are so many fake investment website claiming to be paying.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has already acknowledged that its business is taking a hit from the coronavirus pandemic. The company said in a statement released earlier this week, ""We've seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.""

But I think that Facebook will emerge from the current crisis stronger than ever. Why? The issue with businesses cutting back on advertising will only be temporary. However, my view is that the heavy increase in usage of the company's social media and messaging platforms will have lasting effects. The more people use Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp now, the more likely they'll develop connections that they'll want to keep in place even after the coronavirus threat has diminished.

Several long-term trends will continue to work in Facebook's favor. Companies are shifting to digital advertising. E-commerce is growing (with Facebook's launch of its Marketplace looking smarter every day). Augmented reality (AR) is on the way -- and Facebook will be a leader in AR.

Meanwhile, the company's financial position is exceptionally strong. Facebook has minimal debt, with a cash stockpile of nearly $55 billion.

Why? The issue with businesses cutting back on advertising will only be temporary. However, my view is that the heavy increase in usage of the company\'s social media and messaging platforms will have lasting effects. The more people use Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp now, the more likely they\'ll develop connections that they\'ll want to keep in place even after the coronavirus threat has diminished.\n\nSeveral long-term trends will continue to work in Facebook\'s favor.

Melinda Fortney,Updated 2y,Is it worthwhile to invest in criptocurrency?,"Is cryptocurrency worth it? This is the question that comes up over and over again, whether it’s right before the market goes on a bull run or before it crashes. If you’re looking for a solid answer to this question then you are at the right place. Since we devote all of our time to researching cryptocurrencies, we consider ourselves qualified enough to give you a proper answer to this question.

The simple answer is, cryptocurrencies are totally worth it.

Now, we could finish this blog post at this point but then again, you want to know why and that’s fair enough. You shouldn’t blindly buy them only because you’ve read online that they will go up in price.

The thing about cryptocurrencies is that they are new technologies which means some of them will absolutely change our lives the way we know it. Meanwhile others will simply be forgotten.

If someone asked you whether it’s worth to own Amazon stock, you’d more than likely say yes considering that ecommerce in US pretty much means Amazon and the way this company grows. But let’s go back 15 years in time and ask that question then. Would investing in Amazon stock be so obvious? Most likely not. It would be a valid question to ask whether they were worth it or not.

This is exactly where the cryptocurrencies are at the moment. They’re at the stage where only a small group of people are incredibly convinced that this is going to be the future while the rest is still on the fence.

with the setup cryptosbinary Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptosbinary,com) Is a very reliable technology company and has become the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform .(total volume over 1,23 trillion dollars) where you get 40% ROI of your invested cryptocurrency in 7 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and others. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.

Is cryptocurrency worth it or should you ignore it?

The best bit about buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Nexus, iExec, Ethereum and so on is that you don’t need to spend a lot of money to invest. In fact, if you have spare $50 then that’s enough to make an investment. There is literally no entry barrier and that alone makes cryptocurrencies revolutionising. You don’t need anyone’s permission to buy them and you can buy as much or as little as you want.

Will cryptocurrencies be the future? Well that’s a topic for another blog post. But the question you should be asking yourself is whether it’s safe NOT to invest in cryptos. Because if the small amount of people who have an incredible faith in crypto as a long-term future turn out to be right, then you could be part of the next digital revolution even if you invested only a tiny bit of money.

Now if you said screw it, I’m not doing it and it went big, you’d simply regret it. In fact, you probably already regret not buying it earlier but on the other hand, hindsight thinking is not a good strategy.

I don’t have time to research it

It could be the case that you’re a busy individual and know that crypto technology is worth it but you simply don’t have the time to research it and stay updated with all the news. This is a fair point – crypto markets are super volatile so following them takes a lot of time. But then again, you don’t need to trade the markets. Simply find a solid investment strategy for long-term success and you’re good to go. And if that is too time-consuming as well then sign up to our newsletter where we analyse one cryptocurrency every month and deliver it to your inbox, for free.

What is the purpose of cryptocurrencies then?

If we know that it’s worth it then what exactly is the purpose of cryptocurrencies? The answer is: there is no one answer. Different projects tackle different problems and some projects are simply useless. With over 1600 cryptocurrencies out there (at least at the time of writing this), it’s not easy for a beginner to understand the purpose of all of them. The good thing is, you don’t have to. The truth is only a handful of cryptocurrencies will survive the test of time and truly change our lives.

Leon Schmidt,Updated 4y,Which is the best mutual fund to invest in 2019?,"I know that many mutual fund investors start their investment journey by typing the 'best mutual funds' in a search engine. Even if the search throws up some results, most investors don't proceed further. This is because they are still unsure about the dependability of the list. That is why I thought about compiling a list of Top investment schemes that have been productive for investors so far.

If your goals need to be met within a year, you may consider investing in the cryptocurrency market with www.cryptoassetsbay.tech with a guaranteed expectation of 25%, 50% or 70% yield in dividends, about 2 weeks after investment and also includes an option of operating with a diversified set of productive altcoins that have below-average expense ratios and can prepare your portfolio for volatility, rising interest rates and downside pressure on investments.

Here’s also a list of profitable mutual funds to invest

Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX)

Expenses: 0.015%, or $1.50 for every $10,000 invested

Formerly Fidelity Spartan 500 Index Investor Shares, the Fidelity 500 Index Fund(MUTF:FXAIX) is a smart and extremely cheap way to get diversified access to large U.S. companies. FXAIX tracks the S&P 500 index, which includes stocks of over 500 of the largest U.S. companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN).

While 2019 is sure to see more of the volatility and downside pressure on stocks like investors saw in the fourth quarter of 2018, FXAIX and similar S&P 500 index funds can be smart, core holdings for long-term investors.

2. Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (FSPHX)

Expenses: 0.73%

The health sector was a top performer in 2018 and its defensive qualities look to carry momentum through 2019. The best Fidelity fund to gain exposure to the health sector is the Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (MUTF:FSPHX). Since health sector funds make good defensive plays, FSPHX can provide downside protection should the market continue its downward trend during the year.

The FSPHX portfolio has a healthy dose of biotech stocks, at about one-third allocation, and the remaining two-thirds are in other health sub-sectors like healthcare equipment, pharmaceuticals and managed care. Top holdings in FSPHX include UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), Becton, Dickenson & Co (NYSE:BDX), and Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX).

3. Fidelity Total Bond Fund (FTBFX)

Expenses: 0.45%

For your fixed income core holding in 2019, you’ll need a low-cost, diversified total bond market fund like Fidelity Total Bond Fund (MUTF:FTBFX). Although bond prices could see downside pressure from rising rates in 2019, a slowing economy can cause the Fed to continue to pause its rate-hike campaign. Two to three rate hikes are already priced in. If the Fed pauses after one or two rate hikes in 2019, long-term bonds will jump in price faster than short-term bonds.

This uncertainty makes a diversified fund like FXAIX a wise fund to hold in 2019. The fund’s portfolio covers the entire U.S. bond market.

4. Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio (FSUTX)

Expenses: 0.78%

Stagflation in 2019 is increasingly looking like a real possible outcome making Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio (MUTF:FSUTX) a smart holding. A slowing economy and inflation combine to make stagflation, which can be a challenging environment for stocks. Sectors that can perform well relative to others in this environment include health, energy, and utilities.

The FSUTX portfolio consists of high-quality U.S. large-cap utilities like NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG) and Dominion Energy (NYSE:D).

5. Fidelity Short-Term Bond Fund (FSHBX)

Expenses: 0.45%

To help defend against interest rate risk in 2019, a smart complement to your core bond holding is Fidelity Short-Term Bond Fund (MUTF:FSHBX). When interest rates are rising, bond funds that hold bonds with short average maturity tend to perform better than those with long average maturity. This is because the demand for yesterday’s lower-rate bonds decreases while demand for today’s higher-rate bonds increases. Therefore, the longer the maturity, the greater the fall in price.

FSHBX can either complement a core bond fund or it can potentially provide greater yields than money market funds.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/a7tl0fskhgmuczwj', 'title': 'Which is the best mutual fund to invest in 2019?', 'score': {'original': 0.0934, 'ai': 0.9066}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I know that many mutual fund investors start their investment journey by typing the 'best mutual funds' in a search engine.

Indira Securities,3y,What is yeild to maturity in debt mutual funds and how it affects us?,"Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the total returns that are anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until its maturity period. Yield to maturity is long term bond yield but it is expressed as an annual rate. To put it in simple words, yield to maturity means the internal rate of return (IIR) of the investment made in bonds and held till maturity along with payment made as per the schedule with reinvestment at the same rate.

The debt mutual funds have a good track record of generating higher returns for the investors. Debt funds give returns to the investors through investment in various securities like non-convertible debentures, certificates of deposits, commercial papers and money market instruments, G-securities, etc. In comparison to fixed deposits, the debt funds also provide higher liquidity and tax efficiency.

While investing in debt funds, investors look for getting high returns by chasing funds having higher yield to maturity. They forget and underestimate the other risks that are associated with the debt funds. While investing in higher yield to maturity funds, you must know that you may be getting higher returns due to risky investments. The mutual funds often invest in risky papers that offer higher yields to give you higher returns.

Therefore, any fund that provides higher yield to maturity would have face the risk of default as well. The investors have to bear the losses in that case. This is because the fund has to write off such papers and the net asset value (NAV) takes a deep cut. The recent Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco is an apt example of such a case. Here the funds six debt fund schemes had to be shut because the fund managers took aggressive credit calls to get higher returns.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/1hwdulat2bxzksfc', 'title': 'What is yeild to maturity in debt mutual funds and how it affects us?', 'score': {'original': 0.9985, 'ai': 0.0015}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the total returns that are anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until its maturity period.

Bikrant Sarmah,3y,What are the dark secrets of stock markets that are unknown to ordinary traders?,"A telecom company which used to trade at 3 digits, used to be part of NIFTY 50 is now trading a single digit and now on the verge on bankruptcy. Company also filled the biggest loss in Indian corporate history.

But an ace investor believes company can turn around from here. It can’t go worse than this. Buys huge quantity at Rs 3.XX. Stock moves up from these levels. Few months later a speculative news pops up that an international well reputed firm is planning to buy a stake in that company. Suddenly stock moves up to 7.8 many retailers jumps to buy the stock. The ace investor generated almost 100% returns in a matter of few months at a time when markets are trading at three year lows and many investors lost huge portion of their wealth. And yes, company later clarified that it’s just a speculative news.

Whether such news are intentionally popped up for big players to take entry/exit I leave it upto you to decide.

Another NBFC which is as of now bankrupt, but earlier was a favorite stock among investors. One day stock almost fell 50% from its peak. An ace investor was already invested in this stock but at a very very lower levels. He increases his stake in the company asserting that his is sure of the fundamentals of the company. But later stock continues its downtrend. Bad news keeps popping up on that counter. Many traders/investors felt that investor lost heavily in this company.

Aabirah Poonawala,5y,Why don’t the ultra-rich invest in mutual funds?,"Mutual Funds are like entry level sedan cars that make you enjoy some horsepower without compromising on mileage.

Fixed income instruments such as NCDs, Fixed Deposits, Sovereign bonds etc are like small hatchback cars that give you good mileage but NO horsepower.

In the above two statements, ‘Mileage’ means ‘peace of mind’ while ‘Horsepower’ means ‘returns’.

Now, when you buy fixed income instruments, you know beforehand about the returns that you are going to get (which can’t even beat inflation). You buy mutual funds only for the long term hoping to beat fixed deposit returns by a margin (which most of the time do beat FD returns)

An ultra rich investor will not buy a small hatchback car or an entry level sedan car. He will only buy a super car that has ‘extraordinary horsepower’ without giving any importance to the ‘mileage’ because he can very easily afford the mileage.

He will put his money in private equity, venture capital, sometimes hedge fund etc. These ‘super cars’ give extraordinary horsepower but no mileage.

Let us have a look at some facts

A Maruti Alto or a Honda City is shown every minute in a television ad. So do mutual funds as ‘mutual fund sahi hai’. Fixed deposit rates of all banks are published in economic times and financial express every Saturday.
A Rolls Royce or a BMW or a Mercedes Benz is not shown in any TV advertisement because people who are going to buy these super cars are not watching TV. Similarly, private equity investments are not advertised on TV.

If I, as a middle class person buy a ‘super car’, I will only be able to place my hand on an ‘entry level BMW or Merc’, that too on EMI if my salary is very high or I have a second income source. I may enjoy superior horsepower, but the lack of mileage will take a toll on me.

I, as a middle class person, can’t even think of buying a Rolls Royce or a high end BMW because they are not available in EMIs. Even if I borrow money to buy a high end super car, I will have to sell it soon because I will not be able to manage the maintainance cost.

But as a super rich investor, I have 10 sources of income (what salary!! I don’t do jobs) and a net worth of more than Rupees 100 crores, I will have to shell out just 1% of my net worth to buy a high end BMW car that costs Rs 1 crore only.

Thus, a super rich investor is an informed and experienced investor to generate extraordinary returns through private equity funds and not even look at mutual funds as a choice.

He/she will easily manage the ‘maintainence costs’ associated with these investments.

SEBI & RBI also know these facts. Thus, they will not allow me to invest in private equity if my net worth is less than two million dollars or Rs 14 crores (excluding the valuation of the house I live in) or an annual income of more than Rs 1.5 crores.

Steve Chao,Updated 5y,Have you ever made a very risky investment that paid off big time?,"20 years ago, I was dating a woman and her older sister was dating another guy, Brian. We often double dated and I became very good friends with Brian. Fast forward a couple years, and he starts telling me that he wants to quit his job as a tax lawyer at Deloitte and Touche to start an internet company. At the time, the dot-com bubble was in full effect and internet startups were all the rage. Brian explained that law was ripe for disruption, and he and his best friend, who was also a lawyer, thought that they could start a company to revolutionize the legal document industry. I was in graduate school at the time, and I did not know much about internet companies, startups or law for that matter. But he was my close friend, and I liked what I heard, so I invested basically all the savings I had, which I would never do now of course. So to say this was risky for me, was an understatement. But since I was in medical school, and I was confident in my future earnings, I felt like I had enough time to weather the hit if/when the investment failed.

So I put up the money as one of the first investors in the company in 2000. Brian’s girlfriend came up with the name…LegalZoom. Brian also told me that he had cold called Robert Shapiro, OJ Simpson’s defense lawyer, and gotten him to jump on board as a co-founder. That was very exciting. They started the company out of their apartment in Los Angeles. Brian Lee, Brian Liu, and Eddie Hartman were the first 3 employees and they worked on the site day and night out of that 2 bedroom apartment. I still remember visiting them there shortly after investing. It looked like a college dorm room. The site was still being programmed and then the dot-com bubble burst later. It was a scary time and I recall that they had considered stopping their work, returning the investments to friends and family, and going back to their lawyer careers. Good thing they didn’t! They stayed the course. They raised more money later on despite the horrible stock market conditions. I even helped bring in more funds in later rounds from my friends and family. Fast forward 19 years and the company is the largest online legal services company in America with over 1k employees, and $200M in revenue. Even though I did not start the company, I still feel like it was one of my babies and seeing it become what it has become has been extremely rewarding. It was my first and most successful investments that I’ve ever made, and even though I liquidated some of the shares, I still have an interest in the company, and have thus far received in sales and distributions almost 70x my initial investment. Counting the shares I still own, it’s probably well over 100x.

And my friend Brian? He went on to found ShoeDazzle with Kim Kardashian. It is now merged with JustFab. After that, he founded The Honest Company, with Jessica Alba. Not too shabby.

Anurag R Nair,7y,How do I understand BSE and start trading?,"GO THROUGH PART 1 OF STOCKS DECODED FOR REFERENCE LINK: Anurag R Nair's answer to What are basic world and historic facts every person should know?

STOCKS DECODED PART 2-

What is Stock Exchange(SE)?

Stock Exchange is an exchange where traders can buy and/or sell stocks(aka shares),bonds and other securities.

Bombay Stock Exchange(BSE)- is an Indian SE located at Mumbai . Established in 1875, the BSE is Asia’s first stock exchange and it’s the world's 11th largest stock exchange with an overall market capitalization of $1.7 trillion as of January 23, 2015. More than 5500 companies are publicly listed on the BSE.

How are these 5500+ companies divided?

Companies are divided into various indices (Sensex being one of the indexes as mentioned in part 1 of my answer)

Various indices are calculated based on

1)Market capitalization which includes

BSE Sensex Index,BSE Mid-Cap Index,BSE Small-Cap Index,BSE-200 Index,Dollex-30 and many more.

The stocks in BSE Sensex approximately account for one-fifth of the capitalization of the exchange.

2)Type of industries which includes-

BSE Auto Index,BSE BANKEX,BSE Healthcare Index,BSE IT Index,BSE Oil and Gas Index,BSE IT Index,BSE Metal Index,BSE Power Index,BSE Healthcare Index,BSE FMCG Index,BSE Consumer Durables Index.

If a company like MARUTI is there in BSE Sensex Index then it can’t be there in BSE Auto Index.

So Conclusion—

BSE and Sensex are different, one is the stock exchange and another one is the Index which comes under BSE which includes various other indices.

Now coming to how Sensex is computed-

Sensex includes top 30 companies as per the market capitalization which is listed on BSE.

Calculation part for Sensex Index is explained in STOCKS DECODED PART 1 ,but these list of 30 companies gets revised in every quarter, i.e 3 months.

Suppose Co 1 to Co 30 are there in the decreasing order of Total free floating capitalization(TFFC). Now suppose cumulative Total free floating capitalization of these 30 Companies =Rs 1,00,00,000(1 crore) at the end of first quarter of 2016 and Sensex Index=25000 at the same time.

And suppose TFFC of Co 30=Rs 1,00,000(1 lakh) at the end of 1st quarter .

Now Co 31 did well in the 1st quarter with a Total free floating capitalization=Rs 2,00,000 which is greater than the TFFC of company 30 but less than that of Co 29 .

So now Co 31 enters into the top 30 companies of BSE(which we call new Top 30) and Co 30 goes out.

But now the cumulative TFFC of the new Top 30 = (Rs 1,00,00,000-Rs 1,00,000+Rs 2,00,000)= Rs 1,01,00,000(1 crore 1 lakh).

Now on the first day of 2nd quarter 0f, 2016 Sensex will indicate some different value.

What will be the new value?

For a TFFC of Rs 1,00,00,000 Sensex Index= 25000

So for a TFFC of Rs1,01,00,000 Sensex Index=25250 (Ratio Proportion)

Conclusion- Top 30 companies are not fixed and similar calculation is done after every quarterly report when there is a chance for”n” number of companies to get into top 30 list

Bouchard Wyatt,Updated 2y,What’s the magic formula to investing?,"Value investing.

This simply means getting the most bang for your buck, by purchasing a stock for less than what you believe it's worth. Some people look for stocks selling at low price-to-book ratios with high dividend yields.

You should focus on a holistic financial planning, making sure all aspects of your plan support your set of personal financial goals. You should also take tax avoidance strategies by investing in digital financial assets like cryptocurrency such that the returns of your investment are non-taxable. Investing with www.cryptoassetsbay.tech has been reliable over the years to deliver 1.1X, 1.2X or 1.3X returns on investments after 15 days of investing depending on the selected investment option. Although learning how to invest seems like a daunting task, putting your money to work while you sleep is a key step to gaining financial independence and retiring comfortably.

To be successful in the market one requires more than an ability to process numbers, incorporate projections and perceptions into quantitative outputs, but also the emotional intelligence to recognize one’s limits and opportunity areas.

You should;

1. Decide how much you can sock away:

Ask yourself, ‘How long can I get by on my savings without having any income? How many months or how many years of freedom and safety do I need?’ and make sure that you have more than that.

When I started working, I worked to get six months of savings freedom and security, then a few years, then I started to think about my kids’ needs over time and I calculated that number. I saved to get those amounts of money. I recommend that you do the same.

2. Create a diversified portfolio:

The next step is to decide what to do with that money:

Keeping all of your cash in a savings account isn’t a smart decision because of the value depleting effects of inflation. Right now, the national average interest rate for a savings account is only 0.10 percent, according to data from Bankrate, meaning you’re only earning a few cents for every dollar you save. Meanwhile, the consumer price index, which measures inflation (the rising costs of goods and services) — rose 2.7 percent in the past year.

That’s the worst thing you could do because it is the surest tax on your money, You will bleed slowly to death because the after-tax returns are lower than inflation by a little per year.

In order to prevent your savings from losing their value, the best choice is to invest your money into a diversified portfolio of assets that increase in value faster than inflation. Know how to diversify into non-cash assets like stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies and real estate. A typical portfolio might be split between 50 percent bonds and 50 percent stocks, but that isn’t really diversified.

When you look at most portfolios, they have a very strong bias to do well in good times and bad in bad times. To avoid your portfolio simply rising and falling with the market, my advice is to spread out and balance the risks of each investment. That mix is intended to do well under any condition, whether the economy is growing or shrinking, or whether inflation is rising or falling.

3. Learn the market’s long-term cycles:

For investors who plan be more active in their investing than just buying and holding in a diversified portfolio, it is crucial to understand the historical patterns of the economy and the stock market.

If you deviate from that balanced mix — which I don’t recommend doing because market timing is a tough game for a non-professional and for professionals to play well, know how to play the cycles. Know how to buy when everyone else wants to sell, and how to sell when everyone else wants to buy.

For example, after the financial crisis in 2008, the U.S. markets eventually recovered from the recession and entered the longest-running bull market in modern financial history, beating the bull market after World War II.
 In the 10 years following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the S&P 500 increased by 130 percent.

Cautious consumers, wary of risking their money to buy stocks after the crash, missed out on the chance to earn big returns. By understanding historical patterns, investors can avoid missing out on such opportunities.

The biggest mistake that most people make is to judge what will be good by what has been good lately. So if a market has gone up a lot, they think that’s a good market rather than it’s more expensive. And when it goes down a lot over the last few years, they think, ‘That’s a bad market, and I don’t want any of it instead of buying in bulk at that low price and selling when it’s much higher.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ep3uvtxr26imy5n7', 'title': 'What’s the magic formula to investing?', 'score': {'original': 0.1234, 'ai': 0.8766}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Value investing.\n\nThis simply means getting the most bang for your buck, by purchasing a stock for less than what you believe it's worth.

Doug Armey,5y,What common financial advice do you disagree with?,"My top 6.

They sound so right.

I’ve even been tricked. Thankfully not more than once.

Luck as a strategy. “Find the next Apple. You’ll be rich.” The only problem is the people who first invested in Apple didn’t know it was going to be Apple. And a couple of times they almost went bust. There’s simply no way to know ahead. And you’ll waste a lot of money trying.
Can’t lose. “You can’t lose money in tech stocks, real estate, ethanol, gold, Bitcoin.” Over the last 20 years I’ve seen all the latest sure thing investments. “Sky’s the limit. It’s the future. You can’t lose.” And just then, people figure out how.
Hot tips. “Invest in what financial pundits recommend. They’re experts.” Except they’re just entertainers. They get paid to keep people watching. And by the time you hear about it the party has almost ended. And it will, right after you invest.
Cookie cutter. “Put your money into a “target date” fund. Everyone, at a given age, invests the same.” Younger more aggressive. Older more conservative. Yet I’ve known really scared 20’s. And aggressive 70’s. Great way to under perform. But hey, it’s easy.
Smartest guy. “Put your money with hedge funds. Smart guys from Harvard run them. They can outguess the markets.” Except they don’t. Regularly. Most hedge funds go bust. Pretty fast. Then they move and start a new one. Until it goes bust. Hey, actually they are smart.
Hunch. “I think the markets are going to. . . .” Choose your hunch. Up, down, sideways or all three. People invest based on nothing but their gut feeling. And then are surprised when they blow up or miss out. Maybe don’t eat pepperoni pizza before making financial decisions.

So what can you do to avoid these traps?

Realize they’re waiting for you.
Realize you can’t outguess the markets.
Realize the smart people can’t outguess the markets.
Stop trying to outguess the markets.
Invest for the long haul.
Diversify broadly.
Continue saving and investing no matter what the markets.

Oh, and enjoy the wealth you build.

Actually, learning this wasn’t that hard for me.

But then, I’ve always known I’m not the smartest guy in the room.

You can build wealth, not by being the smartest guy. Just following the truly smart ones.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/nc3hpd6k0yi9vawb', 'title': 'What common financial advice do you disagree with?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'My top 6.\n\nThey sound so right.\n\nI’ve even been tricked.

Michael Fox,Updated 5y,How much should I invest and where should it be invested to be able to live off the return (approximately 30-$40k a year)?,"There are at least three ways, though only one of them looks rational today. First, you could mine your own bitcoins. Second, you could buy some from an exchange. Third, you could buy shares in a fund that has invested in bitcoins.

Please note that answering your question is not a recommendation, and I am not qualified to give advice on investments. However, as electronic payments expert Dave Birch put it to me on Twitter: “one doesn’t invest in bitcoin, one gambles on bitcoin”.

About 40 percent of those between 24 and 35 have at least $1,000 in their savings account. That may not sound like that much, but 19-year-old bitcoin millionaire Erik Finman says that's enough to invest in cryptocurrency.

The teenager has had some luck with the cryptocurrency growing up: At age 12, Finman used a $1,000 gift from his grandmother to buy his first bitcoin and by 18, he became a millionaire by investing with them here (www.coincrypto.tech). He currently owns 401 bitcoins, which equals $3.4 million at a rate of $8,512 a coin.

In an interview with CNBC Make It, he offers this advice to other young people looking to join the crypto-craze: Invest 10 percent of your income into the top cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin.

I applied to a few investment banks. I didn't do any prior reading, didn't know much about the banks I was applying to, didn't know what department I wanted to work for, didn't even really know what investment banking was.

But I got in.

When I was applying someone told me that for graduate jobs they don't care what you know - they care how you think.

Besides, I didn't really have time for much preparation as I was studying hard for my physics degree.

When they asked me questions in the interview that I didn't know the answer to I just confidently said “I don't know”. One interviewer even remarked how honest and refreshing that was of me, and told me how other interviewees had tried blagging him!

David Abrams,6y,"If you plan to start up a company, you have the business idea, you have contributed to the time and development of it already, and an investor has shown interest in investing in it and has more capital than you, who should have more shares?","Totally agree with Julian! The big question is WHY are you bringing in capital? Are you needing funding to hire quicker and get your marketing plan scaled more?

Or are they needed to initially build an MVP/Prototype of the products?

Typically if you are early on and you have nothing but an idea, an investor has complete leverage of the situation and the terms. You have nothing but an idea and they are taking insane risk with their money that you can execute on the idea, build the product, find the target market, market the right channels, sell enough to scale, get them money back AND returns.

It’s a big risk (that’s usually early stage angel investors) and they can ask for large %’s of your company especially if you have no sales. Also depends on the sum of investment you are asking for as the equation is based on company valuation and the capital requested.

If it’s developed and you’ve proven the concept with your MVP and sales, you’ll derisk the process more and increase your company valuation, thus reducing the shares given in your investment.

Many less risk-averse investors, are looking for a product that has been taken to market, has a solid sales history, some product market-fit, and are ready to help invest to scale marketing and team to the next level.

In that case, you can really own more shares as a founder as you did the early “hard” work of getting the business going and investing is more so to grow vs. to build (where the risk lies).

Also depends on the sum of investment you are asking for as the equation is based on company valuation and the capital requested.\n\nIf it’s developed and you’ve proven the concept with your MVP and sales, you’ll derisk the process more and increase your company valuation, thus reducing the shares given in your investment.\n\nMany less risk-averse investors, are looking for a product that has been taken to market, has a solid sales history, some product market-fit, and are ready to help invest to scale marketing and team to the next level.\n\nIn that case, you can really own more shares as a founder as you did the early “hard” work of getting the business going and investing is more so to grow vs. to build (where the risk lies).\n\nHope this helps!', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9998

Hilary Clinton,Nov 11,Mistakenly fell for an investment scam. Who can help me recover my stolen funds?,"If you believe you have been the victim of an investment scam and want your money back, immediately stop all contact with the scammer and avoid any further transactions.

Collect evidence by recording all interactions with the scammer, such as emails and chat logs, and keep all records.

You can also contact services such as proupshot, which are professional companies or individuals that specialize in recovering money lost to fraud and providing support or investigating the scam.

Use online resources, such as communities and websites where victims of scams share their experiences, to find support and information.

2. Divide this 1 crore among 10 banks atleast (preferably in nationalized or scheduled commercial banks) ..so that atleast 50% of your amount is protected in case of a bank failure..(DICGC ) guarantees this 5 lakh per account. remember PMC and YES bank?

3.Please look at the possibilty of moving to a smaller tier 2 town after renting out your flat Banglore at say 25 K/ month. You could probably open a HUF and make this also tax free. Now this means 17 lakh of tax free money per annum which is equal to Rs.140000/ month.

4. Try to curtail your expenses at Rs.80000/ month now and invest the rest Rs 60000/ month in a mix of debt and equity funds ensuring moderate risk through a SIP.This will ensure you are protected from inflation that people are scaring you about.

5.However Life could boring by sitting idle..so figure out some interest which can also if not regularly pay you some money.

Sachin Hooda,3y,How do I select the right mutual fund at an all-time high market?,"Thanks for A2A.

Very rarely we come across such a good question here.

Often people ask questions like —

Which is the best mutual fund to invest in the year 2021?

Which mutual fund will give me maximum returns this year?

Nobody wants to know how to select a good mutual fund by themselves. They just want to know the best fund and often end up putting their hard earned money in the top performing fund of last six months or a year at max.

Selecting a good mutual fund is not a rocket science. It is a pretty simple task, made to look difficult by the so called experts.

You have to check some parameters and compare the fund with its peers.

But there are few things to keep in mind before choosing a mutual fund

• Investment objective

• Time horizon

• Risk appetite

It is advised to keep the total number of funds between 3 to 5 for a balanced portfolio and for the ease of tracking.

We are taking Axis Blue Chip fund for the illustration.

As the name suggests it is a Large Cap fund.

Now first of all we will check it's past performance in comparison to its category and Benchmark ( Index).

Value of Rs 10000 invested 10 years ago.

The graph shows the returns over the past 10 years. We have to check the returns over the long time. 1–2 years returns do not tell the whole story.

Here the fund outperforms both the large cap category average and Benchmark Index.

Now we will check the risk factor.

Out of the 89 large cap funds Axis Blue Chip fund is among the least risk taking funds while giving the high returns.

Now let's check the Trailing Returns of the fund. Trailing returns are called point to point returns of a mutual fund.

Trailing returns are considered most relevant measures of the performance of a mutual fund.

Baring the last one year the fund has given good trailing returns which shows its strength.

Somemore ratios to check. Don't get nervous seeing so many of them. These are pretty simple terms, just check their definition on Google.

Alpha— Risk adjusted returns, more the better.

Beta- Volatility of fund, lesser is better.

R2- performance correlated to index, more than 85 is considered good.

Sharpe Ratio — Risk adjusted returns, higher is better.

Standard deviation- Shows volatility of a funds returns. Lesser is better.

Upside Capture Ratio- How the fund performed during uptrend markets.

Downside Capture Ratio- How the fund performed during down trend markets.

All screen shots- Morningstar India

The upside capture ratio is slightly less than the category, mainly because of not so good performance by the fund in the last one year.

But it has an excellent down side ratio which is more significant. It means the fund has performed very well in comparison to the category and Index during the bad times( market crashes).

If you are still reading this answer then I must tell you that the above mentioned process of selecting a good mutual fund might look cumbersome, but it is not.

If you understand all the ratios mentioned then it hardly takes a few minutes to select a mutual fund from any category.

If you are investing for long term via SIP then market level doesn't really matter. Even if you are doing lump sum, the procedure for selecting a mutual fund remains same.

The word of advice is- Ignore the Star Ratings, most of the times star ratings are biased.

I hope this answer is helpful.

Best of luck.

Bouchard Wyatt,Updated 4y,"If the best investments only get you 10-15% returns a year, how do people become rich from investing?","In an attempt to get rich, being frugal is important, but it’s only one side of the coin. Cutting your fancy cappuccino habit to save a few bucks isn’t going to push the needle for you. While there is a limit to how much we can save, there is no limit to how much we can earn.

An easy way to grow the money you’ve already saved is through investing in the stock market. The best part is it doesn’t take much work on your part; it can be put on autopilot. But No, investing in the stock market will not make you rich overnight. It’s a slow, steady and consistent way to build wealth. With a 7% average yearly gain or 10–15% maximum gain, your initial investment will double in ten years. You can’t do that keeping it in a savings account. In fact, in 10 years, your savings will be worthless because of inflation.

The easiest and the most efficient way to acquire wealth since 2017 has been to trade profitable cryptocurrencies or to invest in a reliable cryptocurrency investment firm like www.cryptoassetsbay.tech that starts paying dividends 2 weeks into the investment with an expectation of a percentage increase of 50% and higher before the end of the month. Investing now is a big plus to any investor because of the ongoing bull-run.

Also, real estate can make you rich, but you need a little more money to get started here. If you are reading this and you’re probably not ready for real estate investing just yet, you might want to put it on your list of goals. Investing in rental properties can have fantastic returns.

Having debt while trying to achieve financial independence is like driving with your foot on the brake. While debt can be valuable and even profitable if used correctly, too many people spend money they don’t have. Bad debt, like credit card debt, compounds many times faster than the best investments ever could and can quickly outpace your ability to earn and pay it off.

The good news is, you don’t have to bury yourself in debt. However, the minimum payment is not going to cut it. Attempting to escape debt with minimum payments is like trying to toast bread with a flashlight. You refinance all the debt you can and then prioritize the most expensive debt first, then pay them off gradually from the returns you must have earned through your investments while simultaneously diversifying your investment portfolio.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0gptkm95fcbrlijh', 'title': 'If the best investments only get you 10-15% returns a year, how do people become rich from investing?', 'score': {'original': 0.9936, 'ai': 0.0064}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In an attempt to get rich, being frugal is important, but it’s only one side of the coin.

Sahil Bhadviya,3y,What are the 10 principles of Warren Buffett for investment?,"Coronavirus has badly impacted the world economy. Stock market has fallen badly.
Most of the investors who have started investment in the past 3 years are currently in the loss. It is difficult to see the portfolio in red.
During such a difficult time, we tend to lose our calm and take emotional decisions. This could result in huge losses.
But we need to understand one thing- This is not the 1st time when the market has fallen badly. In fact, the year 2008 witnessed a fall of more than 50%.

So what can we learn from the past?

At this point in time, it is important to revisit the fundamentals. Learn from the experience of a wiser man who has spent more than 60 years in the world of investment.
Let’s revisit the principals of Warren Buffett and decode them to guide us in handling this difficult time.

Principle #1: “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.”

Meaning: In general, people tend to follow the herd. When markets are rising, everyone would jump in and start investing. The reason is greed. Everyone wants to earn quick money. This results in the overvaluation of the market. And when the market starts falling, people become fearful and end up withdrawing their investment. As a result, people end up in loss. Warren Buffett suggests that one should do the opposite. This is the time when everyone is fearful. The market has become undervalued. This is time to be greedy and invest. (But do not invest all the money in one go) Of course, this advice is for those who want to invest in the long term.

Principle #2: “Do not put all your eggs in one basket.”

Meaning: Never invest all your money in a single stock. Always diversify your investment. For those who do not have the knowledge to pick stocks, it is advisable to invest via mutual funds as they work on the principle of diversification.

Principle #3: “If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.”

Meaning: Do not spend crazy. No matter how much you earn, if you can’t save then you can’t create wealth. Hence, spend within limits. Optimize your expenses and invest them to create wealth.

Principle #4: “Honesty is an expensive gift. Do not expect it from cheap people.”

Meaning: Do not fall for Ponzi schemes. Do not invest anywhere without knowledge. A lot of people are willing to take advantage of your vulnerability. While investing in stocks, always check the management history. The recent cases of Vijay Mallya, Anil Ambani, Nirav Modi, etc. suggest that one should never invest in companies with dishonest management.

Principle #5: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price”

Meaning: Wonderful companies compound your wealth year-after-year. Poor quality businesses that are exceptionally cheap only grow your wealth once (when you sell them – hopefully for a profit). Note that Buffett does not say to buy great businesses at any price. “For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.”

Principle #6: “Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.”

Meaning: You can’t expect to get returns in a few weeks or months. It takes time to get a return on investment. You need to have patience. Those who can’t keep patience would lose money. Those who will keep patience would make money.

Principle #7: “The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble...We want to buy them when they're on the operating table.”

Meaning: Look out for great companies that are falling due to the current economic situation. Today, many quality stocks are available at a discounted price. This is a great opportunity to invest. Such events are rare. Ensure that you make the best use of this opportunity.

Principle #8: “The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.”

Meaning: Economic moat or competitive advantage is one of the most important parameters while investing in a stock. Always check- What is great about the company? Can it sustain the greatness for a long time? A company without a competitive advantage can’t sustain for long. A company with a competitive advantage will generate wealth for a long time.

Principle # 9: “You don’t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ.”

Meaning: Success in investing doesn't correlate with IQ. You don’t need to be a genius to create wealth in the stock market. If investing was all about knowledge, every finance and economic professor would be a millionaire. What you need is the temperament to control the emotions that get people into trouble in investing.

Principle #10: ""The most important investment you can make is in yourself.""

Meaning: Do not blindly trust anyone for stock tips or mutual fund tips. The best investment you can do is by educating yourself. First, understand how things work. How investment work. How the stock market work. If you invest in tips, you might earn profit in the short term but won’t be able to sustain it. Once you invest in knowledge, you will reap the benefits forever.

Those who are still concerned over the current economic situation, there is a message from Warren Buffett:

“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a fly epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”

Of course, this message was long ago.

Likewise, we have seen some terrible mishappenings in India in the last 40 years. Be it Harshad Mehta scam in 1992, Dotcom bubble in 2000, recession in 2008, attack on Parliament and Mumbai, various corruptions, Kargil War, Swine flu, etc. Yet, Sensex rose from the level of 100 to 42,000 before it recently fell to the level of 30,000 due to Coronavirus.

…Now you need to decide if it is the time to invest or withdraw.

Fernando Reyes,4y,"How can I make 50% of my investment of $2,000?","It has been more than an year since I started investing in cryptocurrencies. Following Warren Buffet’s advice of “Never Invest In Something You Don’t Understand”, I started reading more and more about cryptocurrencies to go get a sense of things before jumping into the world of cryptocurrencies.

Even today I am far from understanding cryptocurrencies completely, as it is a vast field. But I have learned enough to find my feet. When I started my learning stint, though there were lots of blogs and videos online, they were either very superficial or too deep. They were either too specific or too general. The learning path was not clear. After having spent almost an year in learnings I am writing this post so that newcomers like me will find it helpful and know enough to start exploring on their own. I have made it as a series of questions and answers. They are structured in the learning path I took. Most of the new users also might end up taking the same learning path and hence I felt that this order made sense.

A lot of people do not know there are so many ways to earn cryptocurrencies by investing legitimately in platforms like www.coastminers.tech where they can get double of their investment in 7 days without losing them(thank me later).

Before getting started with article, get a coffee or beer to keep your company. This is going to be a long article. I have addressed all the questions I faced. If there are a few things that you are familiar with, you can skip those questions and move to the next. You can also use this Table to Contents to skip to questions of your interest.

It took me more than two complete days to finish this article. So if you find anything useful, clap right away. Don’t wait to reach till the bottom of this article as this is going to be a very long one. If you reach the end of the article then you can clap 50 times because that is the max ;)

Let us get started now. See you at the bottom of this post.

What is cryptocurrency?

A digital currency in which code based on cryptography controls the generation of units of currency and verification of transactions for transfer of funds. A cryptocurrency is not backed by a government or a central bank of any country/countries. The account keeping is done in a distributed manner. Think of it as a distributed ledger one in which you can’t alter the order of transactions.

In short you can call it people’s money. Money created by the masses, for the masses and controlled by the masses.

Such money has various advantages compared to FIAT currency. That is the whole reason many banks and governments are opposing the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies takes the power out of centralised power centers, whether they are governments or central banks.

What is FIAT currency?

Currencies that are backed by a government are called FIAT currencies. So most of the currencies we are accustomed to like USD(United States Dollar), GBP(Great Britain Pound or Sterling Pound), AUD(Australian Dollar), CNY(Chinese Yen), JPY(Japanese Yen), INR(Indian Rupee) etc are all examples of FIAT currency. I had never heard of the term FIAT before learning about cryptocurrencies.

FIAT currencies have many disadvantages. They are centralised. These centralised agencies can make the existing money invalid just by a stroke of pen. Recently India carried out a massive demonetisation drive. They can print currency at will, leading to inflation. Inflation is stealing from the poor and gullible without their knowledge. You need agencies like Visa and Master-card to perform exchanges in business outlets. To store your own money you need to pay fees to banks while they make money in interests by lending out your money. If you want to transfer money across borders you need permissions from governments and pay huge fees to companies like Western Union. You pay your fees in percentages whereas it should have been only fee per transaction. The amount shouldn’t really matter.

FIAT lacks the characteristics of sound money. Cryptocurrencies fill most of these gaps. In addition to all these advantages it it also distributed which is a great advantage in itself, as we don’t need to trust any third party. All thanks to blockchains we are able to use this form of money called cryptocurrencies.

What is a blockchain?

Blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies. To be fair cryptocurrencies are one of the use-cases of blockchain. Blockchain is an irreversible(chain of order), incorruptible and distributed ledger of transactions. Incorruptible ledgers forms the basis of many valuable transactions. They might be in the field finance, record keeping in governments, international diplomacy or any record keeping of importance for that matter.

What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the first peer to peer electronic cash. Bitcoin solved a major problem in electronic cash called “double spending”.

Cam Rail,5y,"What’s the most underrated financial planning advice, which is highly effective?","Highly effective financial advice?

Avoid this mistake at all costs. There’s a mistake that is extremely damaging yet so common that over half of investors made it during the last downturn. It can reverse years of hard work, hinder future opportunities and even change the quality of the end of your life.

There are investment fundamentals that are obvious, and are easy to follow. These are the ones that you've got no excuse but to fulfill... start early, save consistently, control your spending etc etc

Then there are fundamentals that are far less obvious and potentially hard to fulfill, unless you know the trick to setting yourself up right. This is where this common mistake fits in.

What's the mistake? Crystalising losses when the market falls considerably. Or in other words, selling after the market crashes.

How do you avoid it? How simple you think - I just wont do that. Tell that to the 57% of investors which one study found sold during the global financial crisis, crystalising their losses, when all theory says they should have been buying.

If you have a diversified market portfolio (which you should have) then the single most self destructive thing you can do is lose your nerve and sell when there's a large shock to the economy. The market will always recover. Your losses will never be permanent. This time is no different to every crash in history where the world seemed like it was going to end but somehow, magically, it didnt. You just need to wait long enough for the market to recover, which it will always do in time. Always. If you wait those losses will turn back into gains. They always do.

Simple right? Wrong. There's a part of your brain that responds logically to external events and there's a part of your brain which responds illogically. The logical part can be relied upon to do what you know is the right thing to do. The illogical part can sometimes do the opposite of what you know is right.

When your hard earned investments fall, our brains have been shown to process this emotionally, thus calling on the illogical part of our brains. Losses have been shown to hit us psychologically twice as hard as gains. This means that even though as we have established, we know how bad it is to sell when our investments fall, sometimes we simply can't help ourselves. The fear and the worry becomes too great and we can't control ourselves.

So if we can't trust ourselves to do what we know is right then how can we avoid this devastating mistake? Its simple enough - we avoid a situation where our psychology might take over our logic. And we do that by making it less likely that our psychology comes into play at all - that's by matching our investments to our psychology. The worst thing you can do is hold assets that are going to worry you to the point of making you do something you never should - selling them at the market lows.

How do we know what's right for our psychology? Well this is called risk profiling which is the process of assessing how tolerant you are to risk (among other things). Some people are simply happier to take investment risk than others. Whether you are high or low it doesn't matter. All that matters is that you know yourself and match yourself appropriately to your investments. Your financial advisor can do this for you. Or if you don't have one you can take this free risk profile test below.

Find what investments might be right for your psychology with this Risk Survey

Whatever you do, make sure you match appropriately when times are good, because when times are bad you may not be able to hold the same dedicated sense of logic that you can now.

Goodluck.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/le9bqmz2xhkt03fg', 'title': 'What’s the most underrated financial planning advice, which is highly effective?', 'score': {'original': 0.4934, 'ai': 0.5066}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Highly effective financial advice?\n\nAvoid this mistake at all costs.

Barun Mohanty,3y,Why is the market not crashing when the Nifty PE is crossed 30? Is this a myth?,"You own a samosa center at your university. Your samosas are very tasty and the demand is too high. Your samosa business is growing bigger day by day.

Your samosa center is listed in the stock market. People are very optimistic about your samosa business. So, your share is trading at 100 rupees. But your earnings per share is 10 rupees.

So, the PE is 100/10 =10

Now, a pandemic happened.

People started thinking you would go out of the business as you can’t sustain it as you have operating costs to pay.

Now, your share price fell down. Your samosa company is trading at 5 rupees now.

Why? Because some people like teachers, admin staffs hold your shares and optimistic about your business as they have come to university regularly.

But your earnings per share become 1 as there are no students to consume your samosa. Now, samosa is consumed by the teachers and staff only.

Now, your PE is = 5/1 = 5

Now, the pandemic is almost over.

The university is going to reopen. Students feel optimistic about your company and started buying shares.

Now, your share is trading at 150 rupees. Why? Some people think students have not eaten your tasty samosas for a long time. So, when they come, they will consume 1.5 times more. Let’s say the student who was eating 2 samosas, will eat 3 samosas as he is craving for it for a long time.

But wait!

University is going to reopen. But it has not reopened yet. So, your earnings per share are still 1 rupee.

But your share price is 150 rupees.

So, the PE is = 150/1 = 150 (Highest PE ever recorded)

As you are going to do business as before, your earnings will go higher than 1 rupee and your PE (Share price/ Earning per share) will come down. Nobody knows what will happen to the price. It might get correct a bit but there is less chance it will fall down causing a market crash.

Abhishek Dwivedi,4y,How's Snapdeal still surviving without any new investment?,"Snapdeal is operationally profitable since late 2018. This means that for every order that is selected, purchased, brought to the warehouse and transported to the customer, Snapdeal makes a profit. Now, how big this profit is nobody outside Snapdeal can say. Nevertheless, it is an achievement given that other e-tailers like Amazon and Flipkart still make a substantial loss in the entire life-cycle of a product (from purchase to delivery).

In late 2017, after talks with Flipkart failed, Snapdeal has not raised any new funds. How did they survive without any new investments, and even make a profit ?

Note that Snapdeal still does an estimated Rs. 1,500 crores worth of business each year. Even though this is small compared to a few billion dollars done by Flipkart and Amazon each, by no means this is small change. So, making a profit on this no matter how small will at least be worth a few tens of crores at least. That is more than sufficient to not only keep sustaining operations, but also grow them.

This in turn is possible, due to the following:

In 2018, Snapdeal sold it's non-core assets like Freecharge for Rs. 400 crores, and Vulcan Express for about Rs. 35 crores. This is the capital it used to keep operations on for almost a year, before turning operationally profitable. Now as the former funds deplete, the profits now help run the company further.
It also has some subsidiaries like Unicommerce and some others, through which it gets some revenue.
Snapdeal is a pure marketplace i.e. it doesn’t own any inventory of its own. In contrast, Flipkart and Amazon, through a web of subsidiaries and partners, actually operate via an inventory-led model. Their subsidiaries /partners purchase items at a loss from distributors and sell them at the main website. Since Snapdeal doesn't do all this, costs here are reduced. Remember that the new Government regulations on e-commerce have shaken Flipkart and Amazon, but Snapdeal was undisturbed. It's marketplace model was the reason.
In a marketplace model, there is not much scope for ""prime delivery"" except for the most popular products, that are guaranteed to be bought on certain days. This also reduces costs, at the cost of lost customers who can get the same or next day delivery at either Flipkart or Amazon.
More importantly, why aren't their shark-like investors like Softbank insisting on selling out to a larger player, or liquidating the assets ? That's because both the founders along with their wives, have bought out the shares of Kalaari Capital, thus taking their shareholding to 17%. They're the 2nd largest holders after Softbank, and hold 3 of the 5 board seats. Effectively, the founders have full control and won't be dictated from Japan anymore.

While we keep talking about Amazon and Flipkart, this is a story of resilience and clawing back from the brink of shutting down. It should be a case study at Indian B-schools.

Snapdeal is probably preparing for an IPO according to reports. I'll subscribe to it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7l2hp6qoitsvkn1u', 'title': ""How's Snapdeal still surviving without any new investment?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Snapdeal is operationally profitable since late 2018.

Asim Qureshi,5y,I have 2 million dollars. What should I invest it in?,"I recently met an old university friend.

This guy is the only student I ever met that read the Financial Times (UK equivalent of The Wall Street Journal) daily. And it might be why today he manages US$3–4B of investments for BlackRock - he’s a fund manager.

He’s made a heck a lot of money for his clients, and himself, by being a mini Warren Buffett:

He never takes punts - he’d rather walk away from an investment than risk losing money.
He does tons of research. He reads and reads and reads, works out his own valuations and if he can buy at way less he’ll buy. If the stock drops, he’ll buy more.
He doesn’t care what other ‘experts’ are saying - because he’s done so much research he knows more than them.
He doesn’t like financial leverage.

Whenever we meet he gives me stock tips. But this time I gave him one.

Steven Haddock,Sep 14,"What does Warren Buffett mean by making a ""classic value bet"" on HP?","Unlike us mere mortals, Warren Buffett actually reads company financial statements. Even more than that, he understands them. Surprisingly, he’s not big on what lawyers call “due diligence”, where you have a team of accountants and lawyers look at the company to see if they’re hiding anything because, over his years of experience, Buffett has learned that companies always hide their weaknesses in plain sight.

The “Buffet Way” is to go over a company’s public information and then put a question mark next to anything that looks weird. Other people do that too, but then they start asking questions of the company’s management. Buffett doesn’t do that - if there are too many question marks he just stops looking at the company. Plenty of companies to invest in. He’s usually right too.

So, what does he mean by “value”? Well, throughout Buffett’s career, his favourite companies tend not to be “growth companies” or “the next hot technology”. Frankly, unless Buffett fully understands the company’s products and business model, those are both massive question marks and he would rather not risk Berkshire-Hathaway’s money on them. Instead, Buffett has always preferred companies with lots of revenue that are consistently profitable. I remember reading one of his annual reports where he explained why he bought a company that made chocolates - it had consistent revenue and profits, and had a good management team and workforce. Sold.

Now, HP has been in business forever and has often been at the forefront of technology, but lately it has settled down to produce everyday products for consumers instead of specialty products for engineers. It sells a lot of stuff (at wholesale, it’s not a retailer), has a good team of management and engineers, and can be found at both the high and low ends of the market. It has good revenues and profits.

Naturally, most investors ignore HP because its stock price is pretty steady. That’s not a problem for Buffett. He thinks that many stocks of profitable solid companies are undervalued. He bases a stock’s price on its fundamentals, how much it sells, what it’s profit is, and how much it spends on ongoing research and development. In other words, he’s not buying HP’s stock because he thinks it’s going to go way up. He’s buying it because based on its current price, he thinks the share price will keep up with inflation and still have money left over for shareholders.

And he may be right. I bought two HP laptops this year. My printer is HP. My three old computers are HP.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4h0qvfsyk9g168da', 'title': 'What does Warren Buffett mean by making a ""classic value bet"" on HP?', 'score': {'original': 0.9986, 'ai': 0.0014}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Unlike us mere mortals, Warren Buffett actually reads company financial statements.

Tom Costello,Updated 5y,"What should I do next? I invented a trading system which generates a profit of 50% on average. I developed it and tested it for 3 years. I can fund only $10,000 so it will end up very slow to quit my job. What are your suggestions?","I worked in quant finance for 25 years, the last portion of it as Head of Equity Trading at a 1B quant fund where a substantial portion of my time was spent interviewing and hiring Portfolio Managers. So if one of the things you’re thinking of doing is going to work as a PM at an established fund in order to increase your capital, let me tell you how the story you’re currently telling will be seen.

You aren’t really making 50%. (by that I mean 50% annually, which is the typical metric by which strategy returns are described.) Your ‘testing’ is back testing not paper trading, so it isn’t really ‘proven’. I assume this because the major listed markets are far too efficient for anyone to make 50% annually in a reliable and reproducible way. When you try to actually trade this strategy or to properly ‘test’ it with appropriate assumptions for execution costs, (or at the very least, to trade it in any volume) you’ll find that slippage eats most if not all of your profits.
If I’m wrong about that and you really have paper traded it with a reasonable estimate for costs and slippage, the strategy won’t scale large enough to make it worth it for a fund to participate in. Trading in size means worrying about issues that most people don’t understand. (How do you think all those execution traders have earned their money of the last 2 decades?) There are some strategies which will deliver a relatively high return at a VERY small size, but those don’t make sense for a large fund because of other fixed management costs. As a rule, they won’t make sense for you to do on your own either.
If by some miracle I’m wrong about ALL of that, then your risk is too high and I’ll see that from a quick glance at your cumulative return chart. Making 50% is easy if you are sometimes down 150%. But to properly scale a strategy you’ll need to show a cumulative return history that never exceeds a 20% drawdown. That 20% is as close as the hedge fund world gets to a universal rule. The other close to universal rule is that you’ll need a sharpe ratio above 1. Of the hundreds of guys I’ve interviewed for PM jobs, all of whom had several years of professional experience working in research, I saw only 4 strategies that met both those requirements. One of them lost its entire P&L to slippage, and one other wouldn’t scale enough when we tried to run it.

I’m not trying to discourage you, but these questions are very common on Quora and they all ignore the facts of the financial markets. They’re all version of “I’ve discovered the magic formula trading program that will make me a billionaire if I can just raise the money. What do I do?” But they’re all wrong. I tend to generously think that they’re just kids trying to understand the processes in the industry and not trolls or people looking to ‘game’ it. But whether their motives for the questions are innocence and ignorance, or malice, I and the entire professional end of the industry already know that the magic formula they’re looking for (or pretending they’ve found) doesn’t actually exist.

The truth is that in large hedge funds, decision making is very strictly constrained by risk limitations. You can’t just do ‘whatever you want’. In fact, the rules for hedge funds are actually defined by the typical investors in hedge funds, and their rules are determined by the cost of capital, and the best risk management thinking available.

Within those constraints, there is NO magic bullet. There is no secret formula that will give you a 50% return because there isn’t a enough ‘information content’ in the combination of price, volume, volatility and the statistics of derived markets that hasn’t already been studied to death by tens of thousands of the sharpest minds on the planet. If it were really there, someone (probably several people) would have found it, and they’d be doing right now - and in the process eliminating the profit opportunity for everyone else.

From the outside it looks like easy money. Analyze stock prices, make a prediction, and poof… you’re driving a lambo. It doesn’t really work like that.

In reality you’re considering getting into the single most intellectually competitive field on the planet. A field where people have been systematically doing for decades what you’re hoping to do by luck. Yes you may be the smartest person you know. But so is EVERYONE else in quant finance. And they’ve been at it for a good long while.

They’ve looked at high frequency, low frequency and everything in between. They’ve done market neutral, long only, short only, long Vol, short Vol, periodic regime change, and all the possible variants you could ever imagine while looking at price, market spreads, market splits, market gaps, volume and derived price and volume. They’ve done mean reversion, mean divergence, and mean stability on every one of those combinations. They’ve tested equity to futures. Futures to options. Equity to options, options to futures and all of the above against all the ETF’s and indexes. They’ve compared all of those to every conceivable predictable variant of yield curve trajectory across every major currency and bond market.

They've compared one market to the next in every conceivable possible way. And in the process they’ve teased out every fraction of penny of predictable inefficiency in every major market in the entire world. The odds that you have actually done better than all of them on one of your very first tries, is infinitesimally small.

Collectively, professional quant traders can be thought of as a single huge machine that tests every new rational potential theory of market relationships in a lightning fast way, looking in every conceivable corner for enough predictive certainty to turn a profit, for as long as they can. (They test all the irrational ones too… but those never leave the drawing board.) Those that win today can play again tomorrow and those that don’t have to go find something else to do. To call them highly motivated is a vast understatement.

With all that discouragement stated, let me give you the flip side.

There are other ways to approach this that still work, and can still make you a living. Try looking at “Alternative Data” or getting into a less efficient market like crypto. Take a look at trading illiquid assets because the accounting rules are more generous than daily ‘mark to market’. That’s what the leaders in the space are all doing now.

If you’re looking in the right place, it might be possible to come up with a model that will give a big return by ‘luck’. It might not work for very long, but maybe by then you’ll learn enough about the market to come up with something else. But if you think you’re going to write the magic formula in the major equity, bond, currency, future, option markets, that delivers a huge return with limited risk, think again. I don’t mean to be too harsh about it but you’re wasting your time.

I’d like to add one thing to this answer that has occurred to me since. One of the biggest challenges in designing a real ‘quant’ strategy is a low correlation. Your returns need to be uncorrelated (below .5) or ideally anti-correlated (below 0) to the market you’re trading, and the overall return of the fund you’re talking to. If your correlation to the S&P is 0.9, then I don’t need to pay you to obtain that risk, I just buy the S&P. I can pay someone 50K a year to do that, and to manage P&L and settlement at the same time. I can have a tech guy do it in between writing code.

This may not sound like much, but you’d be shocked at how difficult it is. It basically means that you have to have a truly unique idea. A new approach to understanding the relationships between markets and price behavior. And when all the competition is taken from the top few percentage points of the top schools on the planet, run through the best industry training programs in the world, and set loose in direct competition with each other for the better part of 2 decades where only the very best are allowed to continue in that role, it’s no easy trick.

It can be done. It’s done by a tiny number of people every year. But the odds that you are that person are very small. The odds that you are not only that person, but that you’ve found 50% annual return in the process by using data you downloaded from google finance, are non-zero.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/q501ifdlo3hkc7bv', 'title': 'What should I do next?

It doesn’t really work like that.\n\nIn reality you’re considering getting into the single most intellectually competitive field on the planet. A field where people have been systematically doing for decades what you’re hoping to do by luck. Yes you may be the smartest person you know. But so is EVERYONE else in quant finance. And they’ve been at it for a good long while.\n\nThey’ve looked at high frequency, low frequency and everything in between. They’ve done market neutral, long only, short only, long Vol, short Vol, periodic regime change, and all the possible variants you could ever imagine while looking at price, market spreads, market splits, market gaps, volume and derived price and volume. They’ve done mean reversion, mean divergence, and mean stability on every one of those combinations. They’ve tested equity to futures. Futures to options. Equity to options, options to futures and all of the above against all the ETF’s and indexes. They’ve compared all of those to every conceivable predictable variant of yield curve trajectory across every major currency and bond market.\n\nThey've compared one market to the next in every conceivable possible way. And in the process they’ve teased out every fraction of penny of predictable inefficiency in every major market in the entire world. The odds that you have actually done better than all of them on one of your very first tries, is infinitesimally small.\n\nCollectively, professional quant traders can be thought of as a single huge machine that tests every new rational potential theory of market relationships in a lightning fast way, looking in every conceivable corner for enough predictive certainty to turn a profit, for as long as they can. (They test all the irrational ones too… but those never leave the drawing board.) Those that win today can play again tomorrow and those that don’t have to go find something else to do. To call them highly motivated is a vast understatement.\n\nWith all that discouragement stated, let me give you the flip side.\n\nThere are other ways to approach this that still work, and can still make you a living. Try looking at “Alternative Data” or getting into a less efficient market like crypto. Take a look at trading illiquid assets because the accounting rules are more generous than daily ‘mark to market’. That’s what the leaders in the space are all doing now.\n\nIf you’re looking in the right place, it might be possible to come up with a model that will give a big return by ‘luck’. It might not work for very long, but maybe by then you’ll learn enough about the market to come up with something else. But if you think you’re going to write the magic formula in the major equity, bond, currency, future, option markets, that delivers a huge return with limited risk, think again. I don’t mean to be too harsh about it but you’re wasting your time.\n\nI’d like to add one thing to this answer that has occurred to me since. One of the biggest challenges in designing a real ‘quant’ strategy is a low correlation. Your returns need to be uncorrelated (below .5) or ideally anti-correlated (below 0) to the market you’re trading, and the overall return of the fund you’re talking to. If your correlation to the S&P is 0.9, then I don’t need to pay you to obtain that risk, I just buy the S&P. I can pay someone 50K a year to do that, and to manage P&L and settlement at the same time. I can have a tech guy do it in between writing code.\n\nThis may not sound like much, but you’d be shocked at how difficult it is. It basically means that you have to have a truly unique idea. A new approach to understanding the relationships between markets and price behavior. And when all the competition is taken from the top few percentage points of the top schools on the planet, run through the best industry training programs in the world, and set loose in direct competition with each other for the better part of 2 decades where only the very best are allowed to continue in that role, it’s no easy trick.\n\nIt can be done. It’s done by a tiny number of people every year. But the odds that you are that person are very small. The odds that you are not only that person, but that you’ve found 50% annual return in the process by using data you downloaded from google finance, are non-zero."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.3545
Jessica Fowler,3y,Is it too late to start investing in Bitcoin now in January 2021?,"The too late mindset isn’t good for your psychology. It makes you feel like shit. When people think about bitcoin I quickly see them become disappointed. They wish they had listened earlier. Or they wish they had bought at least one bitcoin when the price was lower.

Cryptocurrencies are an ongoing technology and socioeconomic experiment. As a result, the blockchain space is booming with new opportunities like being able to invest on Platform like CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoFXnetwork,com) where you get return on your invested cryptocurrency after 10days. With an approximate market cap of $280 million, rest assured that this industry is here to stay. This new industry is constantly evolving, therefore the earlier you get acquainted with it, the higher your chance are of benefiting from its future development.

Note: this article is a personal opinion. Before making any investment decisions, you should always consult with a professional.

The problem with bitcoin is you can never buy at a good price. Why? Bitcoin keeps being the best-performing asset each year, and is now the best performing asset of the decade. Think about that. This is the superpower of bitcoin. It doesn’t matter when you buy it. What matters is that you do eventually.

Buy low, sell high

We’re taught to buy assets at a low price and sell them at a higher price. What if this was industrial age factory worker thinking?

The best time to buy bitcoin is when you decide to.

The reason is, bitcoin has a fixed supply of coins and predictable code built into it that tells you its future. You don’t have to be a genius to understand bitcoin’s future price.

A Dutch institutional investor known as Plan B created a stock to flow model which helps investors understand where the price is going based on the hard-coded, predictable monetary policy of bitcoin.

Once you understand stock to flow, then you’ll understand the overwhelming dollar value of guaranteed scarcity.

Forget the price. What’s the opportunity?

I want to shake up your thinking. The opportunity of bitcoin has nothing to do with price. Bitcoin solves a problem. The current value of the circulating supply of bitcoin is roughly $355 billion.

The current value of the world’s supply of gold is about $9 trillion. The current value of the world’s supply of derivatives (a popular financial instrument people dump money into) is $640 trillion. The current value of the world’s supply of stocks is $95 trillion.

If only a small amount of money moves out of one of these asset classes and into bitcoin then the price will skyrocket.

Investment firms are buying bitcoin, not because they want to, but because they have to. There are very few places you can put your money and get a return. There are even fewer places you can put your money to store it safely in the event of a downturn or recession.

I don’t personally care about the bitcoin price. I care about the problem it solves and whether over the long-term there is a financial return likely to occur for doing so.

Long-term thinking

The worst way to invest as an everyday person is for the short term. One of my early investments in bitcoin was short term. I bought a lot and then sold it when the price crashed in 2017. That short-term thinking has meant I’m working a few years longer than I need to.

I would be retired if I still had all the bitcoin I owned in 2017. I’m okay with that. My investor psychology was weak back then. I needed to see a few 50% drops to learn my lesson. The March 2020 covid crash was certainly a good test, and I passed without selling any bitcoin.

Thinking about the assets you invest in over the long term helps reduce your stress levels. You’re less worried about whether it’s “too late” or “is now a good time” and focused on doing your research and understanding what you’re buying. This phrase sums it up better than I could:

Time in the market beats timing the market.

Euphoria Is Coming

It’s going to be bad for your psychology. When euphoria hits an asset like bitcoin, people lose their minds and throw a wall of money at it. How do I know? I lived through the euphoric phase of bitcoin back in 2017.

People I worked with went from IT professionals to wild gamblers in a day. Every computer screen in my office at one point was showing the bitcoin price. One guy in the office mortgaged his house to buy bitcoin.

The problem ended up being rather unusual: people didn’t buy bitcoin. They bought shitcoins that were worth less than $1, thinking they’d get rich. That’s what euphoria can do to people’s thinking. It isn’t pleasant to watch — and it will happen again. The use-case for bitcoin was born during the pandemic. This is going to create ongoing euphoria.

What can you do about it? Stay calm. Your life won’t end if you don’t buy bitcoin. Take your time and research it. Start by reading the book, “The Bitcoin Standard” and go from there.

Patience always wins when it comes to investing.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8j03f6qvatlik9y5', 'title': 'Is it too late to start investing in Bitcoin now in January 2021?', 'score': {'original': 0.26715, 'ai': 0.73285}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'The too late mindset isn’t good for your psychology.

David Henderson,Updated 4y,Why do lottery winners often blow through their winnings?,"Because when people win the lottery, they try and do all the things they always said they would do if they ever won the lottery. They don’t see an actual amount of money, they see it as getting a free pass to spend as much as they want and the idea that it may one day run out never crosses their minds.

The average lottery jackpot win of 5- 10million is a hell of a lot of money to the average person, but not enough for someone to live the rest of their lives in what people consider ‘millionaire style’ (constantly holidaying in 5 star resorts, owning a fleet of sports cars and several houses around the world, giving huge amounts of money away to family members etc)

A good example of this in action is Michael Carroll, AKA: King of Chavs. Mr Carroll won just under £10 million in 2002 at the age of 19.

Over the next decade, Mr Carroll spent/lost/gave away:

Almost £1m in buying and refurbishing a mansion, adding jacuzzi’s, a bar and a racetrack. It was later sold for a £700,000 loss (having been trashed by a decade of partying)
Over £1m gambling on dog and horse racing.
£1m to his mum
£1m to his aunt
£1m to his sister
£1m to friends
£1m to Rangers Football Club, his favourite team
He claims to have slept with 4 prostitutes a day - costing around £100,000 total
Claims to have smoked £2000 of crack cocaine every day
£130,000 to blackmailers
Hundreds of thousands on jewellery
Hundreds of thousands on failed property deals
Half a million on cars
The rest on holidays/party’s/living expenses.

By 2012, Carroll had 70p left in his bank account and signed into the dole, before getting his old job back as a binman

To be clear this answer isn’t about poking fun at Michael Carroll, the British press have done that enough, he says he has no regrets as to how he spent the money. Mr Carroll is just an extreme example of the kind of mindset people can get into when given exorbitant amounts of money.

People don’t want to accept the reality that if they invest their windfall wisely they could live on a mid-high salary for the rest of thier lives without losing any of the capital and still have plenty to pass on to future generations, they want to water ski behind a solid gold motorboat which is itself being pulled by a bigger motorboat.

Anbazhagan Ambrose,Sep 4,What are the risks of investing in the Indian stock market? What are the best options available for investing?,"My father’s generation wanted risk-free investments. They chose land (very good for their period), gold (again good considering no one sells gold in our households) and our good old LIC.

Even in my generation it took me sometime to understand the best risk-free investment scam of all times. LIC policies :)

Let us take an example of one policy. Jeevan Laabh. It says you “only” have to pay a monthly premium of Rs. 43,000 for 10 years only but by the end of 16th year you will get one crore. By investing only 52 lakhs, your money almost doubled in 16 years. Congratulations on becoming a crorepati. You just earned 6.3% returns on your investment.

Now you are someone like me who thinks working with Excel is the same as going on a hot date. So you decide to crunch the numbers.

Risk-free option - government bonds. Average return is 7.2%, gives 1.09 crores, about 9 lakhs more than LIC.

Wee risk option - debt funds, average return 8.1%, gives 20 lakhs more than LIC.

Small pinch of risk option - 85% debt, 15% index fund, average 10%, gives 45 lakhs more than LIC.

Medium pinch of risk option - 80% index funds, 20% debt fund, averages 12%, gives 78 lakhs more than LIC.

Big pinch of risk option - 50% index fund, 30% large cap, 20% mid cap, averages 14%, gives you 1.19 crores more than LIC.

Handful of risk option - Nifty 200 companies, averages 20%, gives you 3 crore more than LIC.

So you decide what you are willing to take on. By the way, inflation came and ate that magnificent 6.3% returns from LIC. Basically you ran hard to remain in the same place. So moral of the story is LIC also came with a risk, an assured risk at that.

Now let us come to the markets themselves. It is where fortunes are made and fortunes are lost. We want more on the credit column than in the debit column. That is not good book keeping I know but we are not bean counters, we are investors.

Best thing you should bring to the table - faith in your ability to learn, understand and analyze. Not faith in some finfluencer or TV guru, but absolute faith in your ability. Ability to balance things. Understand risks and react to them. Let me illustrate.

You had 1 lakh in 2007, were hearing about the hottest ticket in the town, RCom trading at Rs. 750.

Jump the bandwagon - You put the whole money in RCom and exited in 2023 with a grand total of Rs. 186. Not per share, but for all shares :(

One leg in, one leg out - You did bit of research, was not sure about CDMA so you wanted to bet with both CDMA and GSM. Half money in RCom and half in Bharti Airtel. Airtel is not a great stock, but you still managed to escape with 2.3 lakhs.

Deep thinker - spread the risk, so you put some for the hype, some for futuristic stuff like GSM and majority in plain boring business like BFSI and Consumer Durables. Your 1 lakh swelled up to 15 lakhs because you managed the risk well.

Mate, what about 40% large caps, 20% midcaps, 20% small caps and 10% micro caps? Ah, we are going to make a sensible investor out of you.

Compared to 15 years ago, being an investor now:

Advantages:

You have information at your fingertips, which we had to hunt hard back in 2007.
You have lot of technical tools like very advanced charting, screeners etc., which are mighty useful.
Learning has never been easier.
Ease with which you can do transactions.

Disadvantages:

The hype factory has grown exponentially due to social media.
“Get rich quick” scams, Telegram trading calls AND training programs :)
Too much of information, easy to lose focus.

So are the days of overvalued stocks like RCom over? Not at all, they are getting even worse. Yes, I am looking at companies like Olectra and pure EV plays. Moral of the story is do your own due diligence.

Glen Boston,Updated 2y,Will Bitcoin ever be worth 10K again?,"I think Bitcoin price can surpass $10,000. The real question is why and when.I will start with the “why” part.Let’s first take a look at some of the factors that affect bitcoin’s price and their impact.

Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies might be heading to, DON’T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don’t be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency.

Note: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.

1. Regulation After Bitcoin hit its all-time high of near $20,000 in December last year, regulators and authorities moved in to regulate the young industry.Their motive for the regulation was that the whole industry was nothing but a scam. China and South Korea were on the forefront of cracking down on the crypto industry.Initial coin offerings were banned and mining operations and crypto exchanges were shut down. Investors panicked.China and South Korea are a very important market for the crypto industry. At some point, around 70 percent of the world’s bitcoins were mined in China.Banning Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency operations obviously negatively impacted Bitcoin and its price fell significantly.Fast forward today and the regulatory is a bit different. South Korea is drafting a new blockchain classification system that would legitimize cryptocurrencies. in recent weeks, China has also shown signs of warming up to cryptocurrencies.These two factors can play a huge role in seeing the price of bitcoin going up.

2. Supply Bitcoins are a finite source. As its supply decreases, so will its price increase. Its supply will also be restrained by the increasing costs of mining Bitcoins.Those in the know-how say that Bitcoin’s price is always 2.5 times higher than the mining costs.Tom Lee, a Wall Street strategist who is bullish on Bitcoin, predicts that Bitcoin has the potential to reach or surpass $20,000 by year-end.

3. Investments in Bitcoin mining Bitmain, the largest company that manufacturers ASICs or specialized equipment for Bitcoin mining continues to receive funding from investors and is even considering an IPO so that its early investors could cash out.I doubt that the investors can fork out their money if they think that the value of Bitcoin will go up.

4. Acceptance Though Bitcoin has some flaws that limit it from being a mainstream currency, its adoption by several merchants will drive its price higher.Many companies are now accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.

5. Media coverag eIn part, bad publicity affects Bitcoin’s price. As many governments continue to accept the crypto market, the good news from the media plays its part in driving Bitcoin’s price high.When will this happen?I can’t give you an estimate of when the price might reach $10,000. I think that once the regulatory frameworks from several countries are put in place (especially S. Korea and China), Bitcoin’s price will start to go up.I am of the view that by the end of the year, Bitcoin might be trading somewhere between $11,000 - $14,000 per unit.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/f2c4thunlosa1zr8', 'title': 'Will Bitcoin ever be worth 10K again?', 'score': {'original': 0.50945, 'ai': 0.49055}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think Bitcoin price can surpass $10,000.

I still believe in Cryptocurrency.\n\nNote: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.\n\n1. Regulation After Bitcoin hit its all-time high of near $20,000 in December last year, regulators and authorities moved in to regulate the young industry.Their motive for the regulation was that the whole industry was nothing but a scam. China and South Korea were on the forefront of cracking down on the crypto industry.Initial coin offerings were banned and mining operations and crypto exchanges were shut down. Investors panicked.China and South Korea are a very important market for the crypto industry. At some point, around 70 percent of the world’s bitcoins were mined in China.Banning Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency operations obviously negatively impacted Bitcoin and its price fell significantly.Fast forward today and the regulatory is a bit different. South Korea is drafting a new blockchain classification system that would legitimize cryptocurrencies. in recent weeks, China has also shown signs of warming up to cryptocurrencies.These two factors can play a huge role in seeing the price of bitcoin going up.\n\n2. Supply Bitcoins are a finite source. As its supply decreases, so will its price increase. Its supply will also be restrained by the increasing costs of mining Bitcoins.Those in the know-how say that Bitcoin’s price is always 2.5 times higher than the mining costs.Tom Lee, a Wall Street strategist who is bullish on Bitcoin, predicts that Bitcoin has the potential to reach or surpass $20,000 by year-end.\n\n3. Investments in Bitcoin mining Bitmain, the largest company that manufacturers ASICs or specialized equipment for Bitcoin mining continues to receive funding from investors and is even considering an IPO so that its early investors could cash out.I doubt that the investors can fork out their money if they think that the value of Bitcoin will go up.\n\n4. Acceptance Though Bitcoin has some flaws that limit it from being a mainstream currency, its adoption by several merchants will drive its price higher.Many companies are now accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\n5. Media coverag eIn part, bad publicity affects Bitcoin’s price. As many governments continue to accept the crypto market, the good news from the media plays its part in driving Bitcoin’s price high.When will this happen?I can’t give you an estimate of when the price might reach $10,000. I think that once the regulatory frameworks from several countries are put in place (especially S. Korea and China), Bitcoin’s price will start to go up.I am of the view that by the end of the year, Bitcoin might be trading somewhere between $11,000 - $14,000 per unit.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.50945

Indrazith Shantharaj,2y,What is the best way for trading in share market?,"A few years back, I was struggling to make money in trading, and I used to say it to myself -

""If I consistently do what I'm intended to do for a long enough time, I'm bound to achieve great success in trading/life.""

But then, many times, I missed doing what I was supposed to do, and hence, I didn't see good results.

1 - Pick the Trading Type

There are many varieties of trading - day trading, swing trading, or investment.

Opportunity exists in all the timeframe, and hence you need to pick the proper trading method that compliments your personality and work schedule.

Suppose, if your day job demands more attention and time during the market hours, it will be foolish to pick day trading. It will help if you try swing trading or investment.

Similarly, if you are young and get a lot of free time during market hours, then you can explore intraday trading.

2 - Finalize a Trading System

Let's say you picked intraday trading.

There are many methods to manage your intraday trades—for example, price action trading, indicator-based trading, options selling, options buying, etc.

Every concept comes with its own style, risk, and reward. I will take an example to explain this.

I have designed an intraday system using RSI, and below are the backtested results (against 10 years of Banknifty):

Accuracy - 40%

Profit Factor - 1.2

Starting Capital - Rs.350,000

Ending Capital - Rs.1,790,000

Maximum Drawdown - 14%

Consecutive losing trades - 12

Number of trades - 22 trades per month

Image - Equity Curve of the RSI Day Trading System

So, if I decide to use this system, I shouldn't expect an accuracy of 80% or 90%.

Similarly, it generates 22 trades approx every month. Hence, I should keep a check on my expectation about the total number of trades each month. For example, expecting 50 trades each month from this system is foolishness.

3 - Define the Rules

Trading in the stock market is not rocket science. But most people lose money in trading because they randomly make decisions.

Hence, success in trading is all about your discipline action rather than about getting your calls right.

Having well-defined rules helps to sustain this business. Some of the examples are below:

What is the entry criteria
Where should be the initial stop-loss
What is the position size for each trade
How and when to trail stop-loss
How to increase the position size

4 - Money Management Rules

""Even a poor trading system could make money with good money management"" – Jack D. Schwager.

The key to success in trading starts with good money management. Having clarity on how much money you are willing to lose on every trade is crucial for successful trading.

Money Management is nothing but a set of rules to allocate the required position size to reduce the risk while aiming for good returns in trading.

5 - Trading Psychology

Psychology means the mental factors or emotions governing a situation or activity. So, when we say trading psychology, it implies cognitive factors related to trading.

4 primary emotions revolving around trading are greed, fear, regret, and hope. Please note, all these factors emerge because of a lack of knowledge.

Greed

Most people come to the stock market intending to make money. Well, this is not wrong. But most traders set high expectations from the market and that too in quick time.

Fear

Most of the fears in mind are created from our past bad experiences in trading.

The only way to eliminate fears in trading is by increasing your conviction in trading. You can do this by backtesting your system with more data, reading specific niche books on trading, or taking a particular Trading course.

Regret

In trading, our regrets are never-ending. If you exit a trade and the price keeps moving in a favorable direction, you regret your exit decision.

If you don't take profits from one trade and then the trade takes a turn into the negative zone, you will regret your decision for not exiting.

So, plan your trade and trade your plan. Please note, it is not possible to catch all the good moves in the market. Focus on learning and improving day by day, trade by trade.

Hope

A trader starts hoping for some miracle to happen as soon as he deviates from his trading plan.

For example, a trader plans to buy a stock at 200 with 198 as Stop loss level and book profit at 204 level.

The price moved to 200, and he is in the trade.

After some time, the price moves to 204, but he didn't book profit as he starts hoping that short covering will come into the market anytime and it will take his position to massive profit.

Now the market takes a U-turn. Our stock price moves back to 199, and now he starts to hope for a rebound.

The price falls below 198, but he doesn't book the loss as he thinks a rebound is just around the corner. Price is now 196, and he is still living in the hope of a rebound.

What has happened in the above example is that he has lost control of his trading plan.

Pre-decided stop loss and target are the two points where we need to act.

Once we do not reach those points, the situation is not in our control, and the decision we take after that is based on hope, which is a sign of weakness.

6 - Execution is the Key

Execution is the real Holy Grail in Trading.

Do you know why Usain Bolt runs only in 100M and 200M sprints?

Being the fastest athlete globally, why will he not choose to run in other categories such as 400M, 800M, 1500M, 5K, 10K, and other marathon events?

It is because he wants to achieve more in sprints than to become a jack of all the running types.

Suppose you have an excellent positive expectancy system and clear money management rules. In that case, you can make money in Trading in the long run if you execute the plan in all market conditions.

I hope this detailed explanation is helpful. If yes, please upvote and share it with your friends.

Michelle - MAD PIRATE QUEEN,Feb 13,"Fiancé wants an unfair prenup. We both have similar family financial backgrounds. He wants to keep everything separate (all future investments, house, stocks, bonus) except his base salary but wants me to be a stay at home mom. What should I do?","Say ‘no’.

The financial value of being the nanny, the cleaner and the cook (etc).

Colin Riegels,10mo,Why do lottery winners often blow through their winnings?,"That is - apparently - nothing more than a very common urban myth. Although you often read news reports of lottery winners who blow through their winnings and/or end up bankrupt, those cases end up in the news for obvious reasons - they are tragic and interesting. But in most cases that simply doesn’t happen.

There was a good FT article recently which was reporting on a systemic survey of lottery winners across a variety of countries (link below), and it was surprisingly boring.

First urban myth: lottery winners become estranged from their former friends. Not really. Apparently it tends to change their patterns of friendship, but even then - only in ways which are otherwise consistent with changes of wealth. Rich people tend to spend more time socialising with friends and less with neighbours and family. So too, do lottery winners. They both benefit from increased flexibility in personal leisure patterns brought about by greater wealth.

Second urban myth: lottery winners blow all their money and end up poverty. This one is a bit mixed. Whilst it is true that more lottery winners end up bankrupt (proportionately) than non-lottery winners, the number is still very small overall. Some people are not good at managing cash and get caught out. But most lottery winners manage their winnings sensible and live with financial security for the rest of their lives. A commonly repeated internet statistic is that 70% of lottery winners end up bankrupt. The true figure is apparently just 6%. Still more than the average population, but only a small proportion of winners overall.

Third urban myth: lottery winners jump up and quit their jobs as soon as they realise they have won. Not so much. A staggering 62% of lottery winners globally continue in their jobs after they have won. I have told this story before on Quora, but the only lottery winner I know personally used to be a pub landlady. She quit when she won the lottery, but two years later she was bored, so she bought a pub and went back to work, and has worked ever since. She drives a nice car with a very cool personalised number plate, but otherwise her life from the outside looks mostly unchanged.

I thought it was a pretty interesting look at the data - separating commonly repeated myths from the reality.

Russell Woodrow,2y,Is cryptocurrency a good investment for young people?,"Today, we're seeing more and more young people investing in cryptocurrency instead of stocks or bonds. There are many varying reasons for this shift, from technological advancements to a lack of faith in existing financial paradigms.

The ancestors of cryptocurrency date back at least as far as 1982, when David Chaum founded the DigiCash company and invented ""ecash."" However, the modern era of decentralized cryptocurrency began in 2009 with the advent of Bitcoin, which remains the standard by which all other digital currency is measured. Today, there are more young people investing in cryptocurrency than any other age bracket. Not only is the Millennial generation financially invested in cryptocurrency, it is also mentally invested in moving beyond the existing financial systems of the world. In other words, the younger generation is more willing to accept the risks of working with a relatively young market rather than maintain the current status quo.

A 2017 survey conducted by Blockchain Capital found that 42 percent of millennials have at least heard about Bitcoin, compared to less than 15 percent awareness among senior citizens aged 65 and up. The same survey also found that nearly one third of millennials in the 18-34 age bracket would rather invest $1,000 in Bitcoin than invest the same amount in the stock market or in government bonds. Younger generations consistently show greater interest in, awareness of, and support for Bitcoin, as well as all other forms of cryptocurrency. So why are so many young people investing in cryptocurrency compared to older generations? The answer, of course, is a variety of factors, all of which contribute to the reasons why the Millennial generation is more open to new and experimental forms of currency.

Millennials are familiar with economic instability.

Since the early 1980s, when the first Millennials were born, the world has never gone more than a few years without some form of financial crisis. Millennials have lived through the 1987 stock market crash known as Black Monday as well as the 1997 financial crisis and financial contagion that plagued eastern Asia. More recently, the younger generation experienced the brunt of the bursting of the housing bubble, which led to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis. Finally, Millennials have grown up surrounded by the frequent economic recessions that accompanied all of these crises, keenly aware of the debt of a nation. In other words, Millennials have never known a world that wasn't either in the midst of, or recovering from, economic turmoil.

This familiarity with instability has resulted in a lack of faith among Millennials in the centralized banking system they've inherited from older generations. Generally speaking, Millennials have spent their entire lives surrounded by instability in all world markets, and they have not experienced as many benefits from the centralized banking system as have members of older age groups. This unique relationship with the economy means that the younger generation does not feel compelled or obligated to support a system that they've only ever seen as insufficient. This is one of the root reasons we're seeing so many young people investing in cryptocurrency rather than government bonds or other traditional markets.

The younger generation is comfortable with technology.

While young people haven't lived in an economically stable world, Millennials arethe first generation to grow up in a world with modern personal computers and, more importantly, the internet. This isn't to say that people in older age groups don't understand the internet or that all young people are necessarily technologically literate. It is, however, important to understand why younger and older generations have different outlooks on the digital world. A big part of the reason why older generations are less comfortable with digital currency is that they grew up in a completely different world than did Millennials. Only time will tell whether investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the smartest choice for future economic stability, but it's easy to see why Millennials are more comfortable investing in digital currency when they are more intimately familiar with the digital world.

Young people are more willing to take risks.

One important aspect of the younger generation's willingness to participate in cryptocurrency trading and otherwise invest in digital currency is the simple fact that they are young. This concept transcends generational gaps, as the behavioral psychology of young people makes them more willing to take risks. This phenomenon occurs with every generation, as the willingness to take risks reduces with age. The relative youth of the cryptocurrency market makes it an undeniably high risk venture, as it hasn't (yet) proven itself resilient against the passage of time. As with many unusual investment opportunities, another inherent danger of cryptocurrency is believing it is a good way to ""get rich quick,"" when, in fact, this couldn't be further from the truth.

Today's younger generation is willing to make this gamble, as so many are unhappy with the current status quo. Many Millennials planning to invest their money are more willing to seek out a cryptocurrency exchange than put their money into a low-interest government bond. It's not that they don't understand the risks—they are generally well aware of the fact that their cryptocurrency could potentially become worthless, or at least worth much less than the dollar amount they originally paid for it. However, putting their faith in this new system and potentially doubling or tripling their money is often seen as preferable to putting their money in government bonds in exchange for a mere 2.75% interest.

The vast majority of these same investors will notbe making these same sorts of high risk investments ten, twenty, thirty years down the line. When you become older and take on more responsibility, such as starting a family or planning for retirement, a low risk, low return investment can be far more enticing than a mercurial investment like a cryptocurrency exchange. In truth, there's no telling what the future of cryptocurrency holds or what will happen to Millennials' investment in them. For now, however, we're seeing more young people investing in cryptocurrency to take advantage of their youth, and take a chance on a decentralized market that may or may not prove to be the future of the world's financial system.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fdhweait6pr2zvj9', 'title': 'Is cryptocurrency a good investment for young people?', 'score': {'original': 0.0098333333333333, 'ai': 0.99016666666667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Today, we\'re seeing more and more young people investing in cryptocurrency instead of stocks or bonds.

This isn\'t to say that people in older age groups don\'t understand the internet or that all young people are necessarily technologically literate. It is, however, important to understand why younger and older generations have different outlooks on the digital world. A big part of the reason why older generations are less comfortable with digital currency is that they grew up in a completely different world than did Millennials. Only time will tell whether investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the smartest choice for future economic stability, but it\'s easy to see why Millennials are more comfortable investing in digital currency when they are more intimately familiar with the digital world.\n\nYoung people are more willing to take risks.\n\nOne important aspect of the younger generation\'s willingness to participate in cryptocurrency trading and otherwise invest in digital currency is the simple fact that they are young. This concept transcends generational gaps, as the behavioral psychology of young people makes them more willing to take risks. This phenomenon occurs with every generation, as the willingness to take risks reduces with age. The relative youth of the cryptocurrency market makes it an undeniably high risk venture, as it hasn\'t (yet) proven itself resilient against the passage of time. As with many unusual investment opportunities, another inherent danger of cryptocurrency is believing it is a good way to ""get rich quick,"" when, in fact, this couldn\'t be further from the truth.\n\nToday\'s younger generation is willing to make this gamble, as so many are unhappy with the current status quo. Many Millennials planning to invest their money are more willing to seek out a cryptocurrency exchange than put their money into a low-interest government bond. It\'s not that they don\'t understand the risks—they are generally well aware of the fact that their cryptocurrency could potentially become worthless, or at least worth much less than the dollar amount they originally paid for it. However, putting their faith in this new system and potentially doubling or tripling their money is often seen as preferable to putting their money in government bonds in exchange for a mere 2.75% interest.\n\nThe vast majority of these same investors will notbe making these same sorts of high risk investments ten, twenty, thirty years down the line. When you become older and take on more responsibility, such as starting a family or planning for retirement, a low risk, low return investment can be far more enticing than a mercurial investment like a cryptocurrency exchange. In truth, there\'s no telling what the future of cryptocurrency holds or what will happen to Millennials\' investment in them. For now, however, we\'re seeing more young people investing in cryptocurrency to take advantage of their youth, and take a chance on a decentralized market that may or may not prove to be the future of the world\'s financial system.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0098333333333333

Mirabel Faulkner,Updated Nov 1,"How would you plan to turn $50,000 into $500,000 in 5 years? Assuming $50k is everything you have.","I will choose to invest in the Stock Market with such amount ($50,000)

Guide on how to invest on international stocks:

1. Contact a stockbroker: This is the most common way to invest in foreign stocks, as most American banks have relationships with global stockbrokers who can facilitate transactions. Stockbrokers are financial professionals who work in brokerage firms or other financial institutions, executing orders in the market on behalf of clients.

To contact one, you may start your research online and gather a list of brokers or reach out to friends and network who may be able to help. Once you have your list, set up a meeting with each of them and ask them questions about their services, how they work, what their fees are, etc. After you’ve met with them all, decide which one you want to work with and sign up for an account.

For most of the stock brokerage firms, they have limited amounts to start with. With a mutual interactive broker,”Victoria Grace Lindsay, an investor can begin with as low as $1000 to begin, this remove the barrier of entry for everyone who wants in invest in foreign assets

2. Sign up for an online trading account: A growing number of Nigerian investors are using online trading platforms like Risevest and Bamboo to buy and sell foreign stocks. This option may be more convenient and offer better prices than working with a stockbroker.

While this may sound like a great way to invest your funds, here are some of the demerits of using this option to invest in foreign stocks:

a. Lack of knowledge and experience – Trading stocks is a skill that takes time and practice to master. If you are new to the stock market, it is important to do your research and learn about the different strategies that can help you make money.

b. High risk – Trading stocks is a high risk investment and there is always the potential for losses. Before making any trades, it is important to understand the risks involved and have a solid trading plan in place.

c. Time commitment – In order to be successful at trading stocks, you need to be able to dedicate time to monitoring the market and making trades. If you are unable to commit the time needed, it may be better to hire a professional trader.

d. Stressful – The stock market can be a volatile place and traders can often experience a lot of stress when making decisions about their investments. This can be especially harmful if you are not used to dealing with stress in your everyday life.

e. Expensive – Trading stocks can be expensive, especially if you are not doing it yourself. Commission fees from brokers can quickly add up, so it is important to find a broker that offers low commission rates.

However with Risevest, we help you invest and manage your money by investing in our portfolio of 30 high-growth stocks across the US market with our equity portfolio of power stocks.

3. Buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are funds that track specific indexes or baskets of securities, and many of them include foreign stocks. This can be a cost-effective way to get exposure to a number of different foreign markets.

If you want to buy US exchange-traded funds from Nigeria, you need to open a brokerage account with a Nigerian broker that offers access to these products. Once your account is open, you can transfer money from your bank account to the brokerage account and then use this money to purchase the ETFs that you are interested in.

When buying ETFs, it is important to consider the fees that will be charged. Most Nigerian brokers charge a commission on each transaction, as well as a yearly maintenance fee. Make sure you understand these fees and how they will impact your overall investment returns.

Finally, always remember to do your own research before investing in any product. The best way to learn about ETFs is to read the fund’s prospects, which can be found on the broker’s website or on the website of the fund issuer. This document will give you a detailed description of the ETF, including its investment objectives, strategies and risks.

Below are a few examples of popular US exchange-traded funds:

– SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

– Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)

– iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)

– WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DGS)

4. Use mutual funds: Mutual funds also offer access to foreign stocks, and many of them have mandates that allow them to invest in companies from around the world. This can be a good way to diversify your portfolio across multiple geographies.

An example is the Stanbic IBTC Mutual Funds.

6. Buy shares through an international broker: If you have a specific country or region that you want to invest in, you can often buy shares of individual companies through an international broker. This can be expensive and may not be as convenient as using other methods, but it can give you direct exposure to specific markets.

When it comes to buying shares through an international broker, there are a few key challenges that investors need to be aware of.

The first challenge is that many brokers have different rules when it comes to which countries they can do business in. This can make it difficult for investors to find a broker that is able to execute their trade.

The second challenge is that most international brokers charge higher fees than domestic brokers. This is because they have to account for the additional costs associated with doing business across borders.

Finally, investors need to be aware of the potential for currency fluctuations when buying shares through an international broker. This can cause the price of the shares to change unpredictably, which can be difficult to manage for investors who are not familiar with foreign markets.

8. Consider alternative investments: Finally, there are a number of alternative investment options that can give you exposure to foreign stocks, such as venture capital funds, hedge funds and private equity investments.

You can begin immediately by establishing a brokerage account with Victoria Grace Lindsay to purchase online stocks.

In three months, I accumulated a portfolio worth $8,000. I began working on this guide under the supervision of Victoria Grace Lindsay, a mutual-services broker.

Pramod Kumar,3y,What is something no one will tell you about investing in blue chip stocks?,"The story of some blue chip stocks:

Market is full of success stories.

Stories of stock prices moving to stratospheric high levels. Some people then come up with stories of an investor going into coma and finally dying and the son inheriting a large number of WIPRO, INFY, RELIANCE or EICHERMOT, type of shares.

I have heard the story hundreds of times.

Maybe there are few people who actually made those kind of gains.

Today, we shall talk about the story that nobody likes to tell.

Old timers will remember the tagline on the advertisements for SHOLAY — one of the most successful Hindi movie —— Greatest Story Ever Told.

Today let us tell —- The Story Never Told

The story of Yes Bank:

Just two years ago it was among the bluest of the blue chips.

Today it is downgraded and down in the dumps. It went out of NIFTY index, out of BANKNIFTY index and finally NSE took it out of Futures & Options segment. The big FIIs have moved out of the stock. Few big banks who were forced to buy the stock by the government are keeping it alive and eternally hopeful retail investors still keep buying it.

Nobody told the investors to get out when it fell to Rs. 250 from Rs. 400 level.

Nobody advised them to exit when it went below Rs. 200.

Experts on TV were still discussing the move back to Rs. 300 and upward when the new CEO came in early in 2019.

Nobody had a clue as to what was cooking.

And if someone knew anything, surely it was never told.

Instead you were told that Rakesh Jhunjhunuwala has bought a stake at Rs. 68.00.

So what?

The journey did not stop there and may continue further.

From Rs. 404 on August 20, 2018, it crashed to Rs. 5.65 on March 06, 2020 and traded at Rs. 13.30 on October 23, 2020.

Jaiprakash Associates:

What?

What stock are we talking about?

Believe me, it was considered as a blue chip in the year 2008.

Then it started losing value.

Experts should have seen the trouble and talked about it. No, that does not happen. They were busy talking about revival and getting back to highs again.

We get this kind of news:

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala buys 3 crore shares in JP Associates; stock price jumps 10%

This gentleman picks up the shares at Rs. 18.37 per share. Few years back he had bought at Rs. 26.00.

Retail investors get lured. They think that big money is always right. To their dismay they find out that path to success is not found by following someone.

This is the stock price two year after the above news:

Rs. 3.75 is what it is today.

Market does not care for anyone.

Nobody talks about this story.

Anil Ambani Group Stocks:

Do not jump at me and tell that these were not blue chip stocks.

They were blue chips before they were not.

It is hard to believe today that Reliance Communications was among the top 10 NIFTY stocks in early 2008.

It is equally hard to believe that Reliance Capital had traded above Rs. 2900 in its heady days.

It is again hard to believe that fall like the one in Reliance Power is actually possible.

Today, these stocks have achieved junk status. People tell you not to touch them. Two years ago, there was no one telling that. Maybe someone was —- only that happened to be yours truly. But I am no expert.

Have a look for yourself as to how the mighty have fallen:

Reliance Capital:

Reliance Power:

This was the stock with the most oversubscribed IPO ever till 2008.

It made a low of Rs. 1.00 this year.

Draw your own conclusions about the wealth destruction.

Reliance Communication:

Those who ask the kind of question —- The stock is down to Rs. 50 from Rs. 200. How much further can it fall?

They will find their answer in this stock.

From Rs. 844.70 to Rs. 0.50.

Need another horror story.

Himachal Futuristics:

Another forgotten name.

It was a darling of the investors in the dotcom boom days of 1999–2000.

The stock saw its heady days before the dotcom bubble burst. It made its low in October 2008 and since then it is a stock that goes nowhere. Public memory is short. Specially about such stories of failure.

Let us see how spectacular the failure was:

From Rs. 2578 to Rs. 5.95.

These were some horror stories.

There are more but theme is the same, so numbers will not change the message.

To Summarize:

What no one tell you about blue chips is that they do not remain like that forever.

Technology changes, poor management, fraud and public perception can make even the brightest of the blues to lose their sheen.

In these stocks, chips have fallen and investors have been having the blues looking at their loss.

One has to exit at the first sign of trouble and not get deluded by one big investor buying a stake in the company.

We know that SBI bought stake in Kingfisher Airlines and Reliance Communications. That did not stop the stocks becoming worthless.

There is a lesson to be learnt from such stories. Let us learn that.

Thanks for reading.

Bryan Cryptoman,2y,"How can I invest in crypto with only $100 and get 100x in return? What are some low price coins to invest in, but it must be safe?","I think you have many choices to invest in crypto starting from 100$ and it's possible

One of the key things for 100x is by looking at the project's market cap.

If a project has a market capitalization of 10million , it is still very possible for it to hit 10billion in market cap given that the crypto market is almost doubling in market capitalization every year.

However in order to find a project that has the potential to go up 100x, simply by looking at the market capitalization is not enough.

A lot of the people in the market are investing in meme coins with no fundamentals, that is basically gambling, and these types of projects come and goes.

You have to choose the right type of project with the right team and is solving ""Real-world problem"" , and these type of project are resistant to crashes, because they are here to stay for long term just like the tier 1 projects we have today, and is expected to go 100x or even 1000x in the next 1-2 year to come.

Or you can find projects from reputable and experienced development team that does their due delligence in undertaking project such as Ideafactory Singapore

One of the Ideafactory's recent launch is LUMI COIN

LUMI coin is a protocol aim to solve the inefficiency in mining nickel through the help of blockchain technology and smart contract.

With Nickel being one of the highest demanded metal due to demands from companies such as Tesla, LUMI coin surely has a very bright future in the months to come.

You want to get in a great project that can become the next VeChain early, in order to get a 100x return, which can turn into 10k dollars or even 100k by simply investing 100 dollars.

LUMI in my opinion could be one of the best project of this year to get in, and they are on pre-sale now through their official website.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4qiagmnfehyxtkuv', 'title': 'How can I invest in crypto with only $100 and get 100x in return?
