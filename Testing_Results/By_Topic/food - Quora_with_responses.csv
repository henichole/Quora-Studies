Tan Turner,Feb 16,How should I tactfully tell a family who invited me for dinner that I'm still hungry?,"Oh my goodness! Isn't that the biggest dilemma??? Especially if your stomach growls…

When my daughter was about 4, we had some very close friends who used to invite us to dinner. They were the most generous and kind people you could ever meet.

However, everyone's plate would get exactly the same portion. I sausage, 2 pieces of broccoli, 2 little carrot sticks and a small portion of mashed potato. The kids would get about half that.

The first time it happened, my daughter came and whispered to me that she was still hungry. I told her it was okay, we'll probably have dessert. When no dessert arrived, and it was time to go, my daughter's stomach rumbled as she got in the car and her little friend said quite loudly, “your tummy is talking, saying you want more food!”

I looked at my daughter, dreading what the answer might be, but she just looked at everyone and said, “it's actually saying thank you for dinner.”

Everyone laughed and in that moment I could never have been prouder of my little girl and her display of tact and good manners.

We got take away on the way home and every other time after visiting these people, as the same meal was served each time over a number of years. They were just not big eaters.

For my daughter and I, It became a beautiful ritual to have take away afterwords, and we always looked forward to going to their place for dinner.

To answer your question - eat before or eat after visiting, but always be appreciative that someone took the time to think of you and invite you over. Say thank you and leave it at that!

She has grown up still tactful, well mannered and ALWAYS hungry!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/zhg2374ufcxrbdmv', 'title': ""How should I tactfully tell a family who invited me for dinner that I'm still hungry?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Oh my goodness!

Hafizullah Sufi,Sun,"How do I get my cat to eat vegan food? I am vegan and want him to be vegan too. I know he can do it, so how do I teach him?","You don’t. You can’t “teach” him.

Cats are obligate carnivores.

They must have meat — including “organ meats” — or they cannot remain healthy. Plant-sourced food is literally not food for them, anymore than cardboard is for you. Cats do not have the teeth, gut, or enzymes to extract nutrition from plant foods — full stop.

They’ve evolved this way for 50 million years, and no matter how much he loves you, he can’t change is body.

So here’s the likely scenarios.

Your cat becomes ill from malnutrition if he’s an indoor cat — with lethargy and then blindness as one of the first symptoms.

Or, your cat catches songbirds and mice, and/or applies at the neighbors for food that meets his/her nutritional needs.

Or you give your cat to someone who can care for it properly and get a rabbit.

Or you feed your cat properly.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gse2y894p5mofzar', 'title': 'How do I get my cat to eat vegan food?

Alex Cooper,7h,"Which nation's cuisine is the most unhealthy in the world (e.g. Korean, Japanese, Thai etc.)?","I don’t think there’s an official award for ‘unhealthiest cuisine’, but those are some strange examples. Japanese people generally have very good diets, and I’m sure the others aren’t far behind. East and Southeast Asian obesity rates put much of the world to shame.

No, for this answer we need to look at islands where traditional diets have largely been replaced by imported, processed foods… thanks, colonialism.

Let me get a bit more Pacific, because that’s where some of the main contenders reside.

Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji might be names you recognise, and all three rate highly in terms of overweight and obese population percentages.

But there is another, lesser-known island that stands atop this processed pantheon — Nauru.

Image in public domain.

The country may be Nauru, but inhabitants’ waistlines certainly aren’t, with an obesity rate of 61%.[1]It also has the highest level of Type 2 Diabetes in the world—almost a third of the population is diabetic, and this rises to 45% in the 55–64 age bracket.

Nauru is rich in phosphate deposits, something that the British (with an assist from Australia and NZ) saw and thought ‘jolly good old chap; let’s destroy most of the island. Papa needs a new monocle.’

So, much of Nauru is now unusable and unfit for growing anything; a stark contrast from the fertile land it used to be, where residents grew their own fruit.

This has led to a reliance on imported foods, including high fat meat like corned beef and spam, as well as lots of rice and sugar. Islanders used to fish for much of their protein, but these skills have largely been lost.

Nauru gained independence in 1968 and took control of their phosphate mining back from the British Phosphate Commission, with much of the earnings put into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. However, a series of bad investments, including financing 1993’s Leonardo the Musical*, has caused the money to dwindle, and impacted how well government can address the island’s many health concerns.

*no, I’ve never heard of it either, and that’s the point.

Sorry, that answer went off on a little bit of a tangent, but one does not simply Google ‘Nauru’ and not spend another half hour diving down this rabbit hole.

Martin Bayer,Mon,What are the differences between instant and real mashed potatoes? Which one do people generally prefer and why?,"Mashed potatoes are made by boiling potatoes until tender and mashing them with milk, butter, salt and pepper.

Instant mashed potatoes are made from dehydrated potatoes. They come in a box or can and look like flakes or a powder. We used to serve Pillsbury brand instant mashed potatoes in the Navy, so I’ve cooked and served lots of the stuff and I know what it tastes like. All you had to do was pour hot water into a mixing bowl and add potato powder, butter, salt and pepper, while mixing. The cans contained powdered milk, so you didn’t need to add milk, just water.

One thing that’s super important when making instant potatoes is to measure out the amount of water and powder you need before you combine the two. We had a Marine cook who had the smart idea of not measuring and he broke the beater for an 80 quart Hobart mixer. Yeah, he broke one of these with potatoes, right at the collar:

He snapped that baby right in half. He poured a whole bunch of mashed potato powder into the bowl, turned it on and then began to pour water into the bowl, which is backwards. Always pour potato powder into the water. Slowly the potatoes began to rehydrate and turned into a rock before he got enough water into them. There was a loud SNAP! and the beater broke against the rock hard potato mass in the bowl.

As for liking them, I won’t eat them. Instant mashed potatoes taste like regular mashed potatoes, flavor wise, but their texture is weird to me. They’re very smooth and kind of grainy, like real mashed potatoes that had been made from overcooked potatoes. I find their texture off-putting, so I won’t eat the stuff.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/fwb3j1s89xtrp64i', 'title': 'What are the differences between instant and real mashed potatoes?

Troy McDaniel,Sat,What foods or drinks do you prepare that taste better than restaurants and give you a feeling of success?,"[EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words and attention. For several years when my PTSD was at its worst my only real interaction was posting pictures of my cooking on Facebook. Literally hundreds of pictures like these, all made from scratch and plated to the best of my ability. You can often tell how old the picture is by how well it is plated. Cooking literally saved my life.]

Since I retired from the military, cooking has been a method I have used to help handle my PTSD. I have actually had many guest tell me I should start a restaurant (or vineyard) but how I cook would not work in a high speed rapid turn around situation.

I tend to make everything from scratch if I can. So the sausage, dry aged meats, sauces, salad dressing, infused oils, bread, pasta, roux, stock, mayonnaise, etc I all make. I grow my own herbs. I make my own wine and mead. For things I can’t make myself I am very picky in my selections.

Somethings I keep simple. So lets look at meat pastries. Like a sausage roll where I made the dough and sausage, used onions grown just down the road, and topped with a little parmigiano reggiano. Not very fancy looking but a great on the go meal.

I also like to make puff pastry stuffed with pork tenderloin and pan caramelized apples. It is a special dish though because making puff pastry from scratch really sucks and takes all day. Puff pastry is one of the few things I consider “cheating” and buying from the store.

How about a throw away burger for lunch?

The first are grass fed prime beef fresh ground with bacon, seasoned with salt, pepper, flavor bomb oil and Blu cheese. Slab of cold smoked Black Diamond 5 y/o unpasteurized cheddar. Toasted Hawaiian rolls with homemade smoked black pepper ketchup, black truffle mustard and homemade chowchow.

The second are sliders. Prime beef sliders with homemade ketchup, some unbelievable handmade bacon, and fresh veggies. On homemade Hawaiian sweet rolls, with smoked 3 year aged cheddar and baby swiss.

I like to make sandwiches to. Normally I serve them with homemade pickles in or on the side. So a grilled cheese, egg & ham on onion roll (using actual farm eggs), farm sandwich, and couple pictures of a roast beef sandwich.

If you ask me for a snack, most likely I will give you something like this. Seasoned potato hash, with smoked sausage. Topped off with bacon, green onions, and a home made sauce.

You say you want something British? Beer batter cod, brined pub chips, mushy peas, and homemade tartar sauce. Hit it with a splash of malt vinegar. Sadly I didn't have any British beer so I had to settle for a German one.

My own dry aged prime ribeye, thin sliced and tossed with tomatoes, peppers, and pickles in a demiglaze, topped with bleu 1924 cheese, shaved parmigiano reginio, and a drizzling of truffle barrel aged balsamic.

How about ham? Lots of pig farms local to me and all the butcher shops sell fresh local pork. Smoke it myself, honey glaze it with some honey a friend makes, and serve with pan seared apples and a herb & butter sauce. Picture of the plating didn’t come out very well though.

Another something simple. Beef and onion soup, using many different varieties and styles of onion.

Wife bought me a very fancy waffle maker for Christmas one year. Make buttermilk batter from scratch the night before, then caramelize apples, candy some bacon in the same pan, then toss in a little bourbon and butter to make a sauce after. Super decedent.

I actually do make a whole bunch of pasta from scratch, though for some reason it never wants to look good in pictures. The first is completely homemade Cacio e Pepe dopped with a little sausage and parmigiano reggiano. The second is homemade egg pasta twisted into ""roses"", some dry aged ribeye I happened to having ""just laying around"", and a butter-herb sauce that was finished with a little red wine, cream, and parmigiano reggiano rind. The sauce was lightly brushed over the pasta, the herbs stuffed between the ""roses"", and the meat shaved thin before being tossed with the last remnants of the sauce.

Would you rather a salad instead? Both of these use Wagyu, with the first having Japanese A5 and the second Australian grade 6. Other things in them include Schwarzwälder Schinken, bleu 1924, imported barrel aged balsamic vinegar (more expensive than the beef!), homemade black summer truffle oil, and parmigiano reggiano. Go figure that my salads are the thing I make that cost the most money.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/08ubt65qaxdlrh31', 'title': 'What foods or drinks do you prepare that taste better than restaurants and give you a feeling of success?', 'score': {'original': 0.9245, 'ai': 0.0755}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""[EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words and attention.

For several years when my PTSD was at its worst my only real interaction was posting pictures of my cooking on Facebook. Literally hundreds of pictures like these, all made from scratch and plated to the best of my ability. You can often tell how old the picture is by how well it is plated. Cooking literally saved my life.]\n\nSince I retired from the military, cooking has been a method I have used to help handle my PTSD. I have actually had many guest tell me I should start a restaurant (or vineyard) but how I cook would not work in a high speed rapid turn around situation.\n\nI tend to make everything from scratch if I can. So the sausage, dry aged meats, sauces, salad dressing, infused oils, bread, pasta, roux, stock, mayonnaise, etc I all make. I grow my own herbs. I make my own wine and mead. For things I can’t make myself I am very picky in my selections.\n\nSomethings I keep simple. So lets look at meat pastries. Like a sausage roll where I made the dough and sausage, used onions grown just down the road, and topped with a little parmigiano reggiano. Not very fancy looking but a great on the go meal.\n\nI also like to make puff pastry stuffed with pork tenderloin and pan caramelized apples. It is a special dish though because making puff pastry from scratch really sucks and takes all day. Puff pastry is one of the few things I consider “cheating” and buying from the store.\n\nHow about a throw away burger for lunch?\n\nThe first are grass fed prime beef fresh ground with bacon, seasoned with salt, pepper, flavor bomb oil and Blu cheese. Slab of cold smoked Black Diamond 5 y/o unpasteurized cheddar.

Hantani Sadahiko,Tue,Does a food dish have to look appetizing to you in order for you to enjoy the taste of it?,"Yes. I think the appearance of Japanese food is also a kind of taste.

For example, there is a technique called ""kazarikiri"" in cooking.

No matter how you shape the carrot, the taste will not change.

However, the laborious appearance soothes the viewer's heart and improves the taste.

For example, you can't eat the autumn leaves displayed in this dish. It shows a sense of the season.

Red autumn leaves indicate autumn. Green autumn leaves indicate summer.

In this way, the restaurant adds a sense of season to the food.

Chaise Murphy,Sun,What is the one food that your grandma made better than anyone else?,"Pies.

After Grandad died, Grandma moved in with us. For the last decade of her life, she spent six months of the year living quietly in the New Zealand summer. Then, when the weather cooled, she headed for the northern hemisphere summer and lived the jetset life, staying with her sons, nephews, nieces, and other more remote relatives. (One of my uncles gave her an Aston Martin to use while she was in the UK.)

She used to say she came back to New Zealand to relax. (She also used to say “I’ve been there!” when any number of exotic locations showed up on TV. It became her catchphrase.)

After she’d relaxed for a month or two, she got bored, and started cooking. Pies were her favourite, because they didn’t need to be eaten straight away, and could be frozen. (We had a huge chest freezer, a 100-cubic-foot commercial job.) She made all kinds of pies: chicken, mince, apple and rhubarb, steak and kidney, cherry, curried lamb, bacon and egg… They were all good. But they all looked the same.

After she died, there were several dozen pies still in the freezer, maybe a hundred. “Mystery pie” was our favourite dinner for years thereafter. We never knew what it was going to be, but the smell from the oven usually let us know whether we should make gravy or custard to serve with it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/judfrpa45hbwni1y', 'title': 'What is the one food that your grandma made better than anyone else?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Pies.\n\nAfter Grandad died, Grandma moved in with us.

David J Wong,Feb 16,How should I tactfully tell a family who invited me for dinner that I'm still hungry?,"I would tactfully hold my tongue.

Whilst living in London, my wife and I — along with another couple — were invited to someone’s home for dinner. The host was a pastor of a small church on the outskirts of London, and we knew that he was not paid a lot.

His wife had clearly gone to great efforts to prepare a nice dinner, but it was also clear the budget had been stretched and portions were small.

Zafar Iqbal,Sun,Which cat food ingredients are harmful to my cat?,"There are several cat food ingredients that may be harmful to cats if consumed in large quantities or if your cat has specific dietary sensitivities or health conditions. It's essential to read ingredient labels carefully and choose cat food that meets your cat's nutritional needs and preferences. Here are some ingredients to be cautious of:

1. **Artificial Preservatives**: Some artificial preservatives, such as BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole), BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), and ethoxyquin, have been linked to potential health concerns in pets when consumed in large amounts over time. Look for cat food that uses natural preservatives or is preservative-free.

2. **Artificial Colors and Flavors**: Artificial colors and flavors are often added to cat food to enhance its appearance and taste. However, some cats may be sensitive to these additives, leading to digestive upset or allergic reactions. Choose cat food that uses natural ingredients and avoids artificial additives whenever possible.

3. **Fillers**: Fillers are inexpensive ingredients used to add bulk to cat food, but they provide little to no nutritional value. Common fillers in cat food include corn, wheat, soy, and rice. These ingredients may be difficult for cats to digest and can contribute to obesity and other health issues. Look for cat food with high-quality protein sources and minimal fillers.

4. **By-Products**: By-products are secondary or lower-quality parts of animals that are not typically consumed by humans, such as organs, feet, and beaks. While by-products can provide essential nutrients, they may vary in quality and can be less digestible than whole meat ingredients. Choose cat food that uses named meat sources, such as chicken, turkey, or fish, as the primary protein source.

5. **High Levels of Carbohydrates**: Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet high in animal-based protein and low in carbohydrates. High-carbohydrate diets can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other health issues in cats. Look for cat food with a high protein content and limited carbohydrate content.

6. **Allergens**: Some cats may have food allergies or sensitivities to certain ingredients, such as grains, dairy, or specific proteins. If your cat exhibits symptoms of food allergies, such as itching, vomiting, or diarrhea, consult with your veterinarian to determine the underlying cause and identify potential allergens to avoid in their diet.

7. **Excessive Sodium**: High levels of sodium in cat food can lead to dehydration, hypertension, and other health problems in cats, especially those with kidney or heart conditions. Choose cat food with moderate sodium levels and avoid feeding your cat salty or processed foods.

It's essential to consult with your veterinarian to determine the best diet for your cat based on their age, breed, health status, and dietary needs. Your veterinarian can provide personalized recommendations and guidance on selecting cat food that meets your cat's nutritional requirements and supports their overall health and well-being.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yzslt50pux62m49h', 'title': 'Which cat food ingredients are harmful to my cat?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""There are several cat food ingredients that may be harmful to cats if consumed in large quantities or if your cat has specific dietary sensitivities or health conditions.

Elizabeth Denny,Wed,Can I stop feeding my cats dry food? I started cooking unseasoned beef for them but I still mix dry food in it.I do that to try and get them necessary nutrients but I've heard most dry foods are not the best for them.Should I mix in something else?,"Question Answered: Can I stop feeding my cats dry food? I started cooking unseasoned beef for them but I still mix dry food in it.I do that to try and get them necessary nutrients but I've heard most dry foods are not the best for them.Should I mix in something else?

Frankly, it's a terrible idea to think about feeding your cats plain cooked beef. It's true that some dry foods are poor quality. It's also true cats need to eat meat in some form (but that includes dry food.) And it's true that cats need more moisture than dry food alone can provide. But eating only plain beef (muscle) meat as a diet will very quickly lead to malnutrition. Beef also tends to be pretty fatty compared to, say, chicken. The extra fat may cause stomach upsets or even pancreatitis. So making plain beef into a complete and safe food for cats is not a matter of just mixing in “something else.”

For example, beef is a good source of some B vitamins (B6 and B12) and iron. But what about calcium? In the wild, cats eat the soft bones of freshly killed prey to get calcium. (They also eat internal organs, stomach contents, and bit of hair and feathers. Not just meat and certainly never beef!) Calcium is important for bones and teeth. But it's also needed for proper neural conduction including cardiac conduction. So cats definitely need it. But cooked bones splinter so you can't give cats those. And what about vitamins like A and D? Cats do need those too and won't get them from ordinary beef. They can get A from beef liver but you have to be very careful feeding liver to cats. Cats can get a Vitamin A toxicity easily (especially from liver.) And what about minerals like magnesium? Phosphorus? Do you know how much naturally-occurring sodium and potassium are in the beef?

It would be best to feed beef as an occasional treat and feed a good quality complete cat food for the regular diet, including at least some canned food for moisture. If you feel you must feed homemade food for some reason, you need to become an expert in cat nutrition. And that will take lots more reading and research than posting a few questions on Quora!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7tu9jwkbd0mez126', 'title': ""Can I stop feeding my cats dry food?

Beth Goldowitz,Feb 17,What are at least seven recipes that can get you through every cooking scenario?,"I wouldn't think in terms of recipes. Think in terms of mastering techniques instead.

Learn to make a braise. This will net you a vast array of dishes from vegetarian stews to Mexican pork shoulder to classic Jewish brisket. With a few adjustments it gives you a tasty ragu or a spicy curry.

Master a simple pan sauce. Fond deglazed with stock or wine, shallots or herbs, butter or beurre mani (butter and flour) to finish. It's always nice to finish a plate with tasty sauce and it ups your cooking game considerably.

Learn how to roast a chicken without drying out the breast meat. It's not that hard, but you need to pay attention. Get yourself a digital thermometer. You get a meal of roast chicken, the leftovers can become chicken salad or a chicken sandwich, and the bones go in the freezer until you've got enough to make stock.

Eggs. There are dozens of things you can do with eggs. Anything from a simple scramble to a lovely omelette to fancier dishes like eggs Benedict or Florentine. Understand tempering and you've opened to door to everything from ice cream base to pastry cream and custards to a lovely avgelemono soup. And meringues are incredibly useful in the kitchen.

Biscuits. I know I said concentrate on technique instead of recipes. But southern style biscuits with their layers of tender, buttery pastry are a delight. They can be served with sweet or savory dishes, and they have a shorter learning curve than good bread. And once you've learned ‘biscuit hands’ your entire pastry game will be improved. Next step, pie dough.

These particular pies are filled with curried chicken. But they can just as easily take a sweeter direction. Same dough, same technique.

Roasted vegetables are always handy. Roasted carrots and garlic add depth to soups. Roasted potatoes are a perfect side for just about anything. Roasted tomatoes can be turned into savory tomato confit. Combine seasonal veggies for variety throughout the year and you'll never run out of options.

The last technique I'll suggest is pan searing. It's a great way to turn out something fast and easy like a piece of fish or a pork chop or chicken breast. You can add flavor by marinating or using a dry rub, you can use the fond left in the pan to make a quick sauce, and you can serve it with those roasted veggies for a complete meal

There you go. Not seven recipes, but a gateway to understanding and preparing hundreds of dishes based strictly on local availability, what's handy in your pantry, and the kind of cooking you feel like doing.

There are a number of other techniques you can use, and some of this will depend on the kind of cooking you want to do. My list is definitely western/American oriented. Notice that I didn't include stir frying or a vast array of Asian dishes, because though I enjoy cooking them, they weren't part of my basic early repertoire. But the same notion applies. Focus on basic techniques that can be applied to a wide variety of different ingredients. Recipes are limiting. What if you can't find the ingredients you need? If you've mastered a few techniques you can improvise, using the ingredients you have on hand.

Beef stew, a super simple braise. Mine has onions, carrots, potatoes, some fresh thyme, bay leaves, garlic, beef stock and Guinness. But you can do the same thing with pork, chicken, fish, or just vegetables, change up the herbs, spices, and liquids, and have an entire repertoire of tasty dishes.

The knedliky dumplings are a yeasted dough. If you don't want to make that and then wait a few hours for it to ferment then proof, that biscuit dough I mentioned above will also make dumplings. Just drop little balls of it into your stew and let them simmer for half an hour or so.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dsmvpi54aj1wkqre', 'title': 'What are at least seven recipes that can get you through every cooking scenario?', 'score': {'original': 0.9641, 'ai': 0.0359}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I wouldn't think in terms of recipes.

Crystal Gillis,Mon,What specific flaws exist in vegan cat food?,"Cats canNOT survive on a vegan diet. They will literally starve death because they are unable to digest it. And as per another of your questions, yes, cat food contains meat.

Cats are obligate carnivores, which means that a meat based diet is required, not optional.

Obligate or ""true"" carnivores are those whose diet requires nutrients found only in animal flesh. While obligate carnivores might be able to ingest
 small amounts of plant matter, they lack the necessary physiology
 required to fully digest
 it. Some obligate carnivorous mammals will ingest vegetation as an emetic
, a food that upsets their stomachs, to self-induce vomiting.[5]

Carnivore - Wikipedia
A carnivore / ˈ k ɑːr n ɪ v ɔːr / , or meat-eater ( Latin , caro , genitive carnis , meaning meat or ""flesh"" and vorare meaning ""to devour""), is an animal or plant whose food and energy requirements derive from the consumption of animal tissues (mainly muscle , fat and other soft tissues ) whether through hunting or scavenging . [1] [2] Lions are obligate carnivores consuming only animal flesh for their nutritional requirements. Nomenclature edit Mammal order edit The technical term for mammals in the order Carnivora is carnivoran , and they are so-named because most member species in the group have a carnivorous diet, but the similarity of the name of the order and the name of the diet causes confusion. Many but not all carnivorans are meat eaters; a few, such as the large and small cats ( felidae ) are obligate carnivores (see below). Other classes of carnivore are highly variable. The Ursids , for example: While the Arctic polar bear eats meat almost exclusively (more than 90% of its diet is meat), almost all other bear species are omnivorous , and one species, the giant panda , is nearly exclusively herbivorous . [3] Dietary carnivory is not a distinguishing trait of the order . Many mammals with highly carnivorous diets are not members of the order Carnivora . Cetaceans , for example, all eat other animals, but are paradoxically members of the almost exclusively plant-eating hooved mammals . Carnivorous diet edit Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called hypercarnivores or obligate carnivores , whilst those which also consume non-animal food are called mesocarnivores , or facultative carnivores , or omnivores (there are no clear distinctions).

Teamedical,Feb 17,What is the most nutritious food for seniors?,"As we age, our bodies go through various changes and may require different types of nutrition to stay healthy. However, one thing remains constant - the importance of eating nutritious foods. Seniors often have unique nutritional needs due to factors such as decreased appetite, medication interactions, and potential health conditions. But what is the most nutritious food for seniors?

In short, the answer is not one specific food, but rather a well-balanced and varied diet. As we age, our bodies may not absorb nutrients as efficiently, so it's crucial to include a variety of nutrient-dense foods in our diet. Let's take a closer look at some of the most nutritious foods for seniors.

1. Fruits and Vegetables:
Fruits and vegetables are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which are crucial for maintaining good health. As we age, our immune system may weaken, making us more susceptible to illnesses. Consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables can help boost our immune system and protect our bodies from disease.
2. Lean Protein:
Protein is essential for our bodies to function correctly, and it becomes even more crucial as we age. Seniors may experience muscle loss, making it essential to include adequate amounts of protein in their diet. Lean protein sources such as chicken, fish, eggs, and legumes are great options as they are low in fat and provide essential nutrients.
3. Whole Grains:
Whole grains are a significant source of dietary fiber, which can help promote healthy digestion and prevent constipation, a common issue among seniors. Additionally, whole grains also contain essential vitamins and minerals that our bodies need to stay healthy.
4. Low-Fat Dairy:
Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese are excellent sources of calcium, which is crucial for maintaining strong bones and preventing osteoporosis. For seniors, it's essential to opt for low-fat or non-fat dairy options to avoid excess saturated fats and cholesterol.
5. Healthy Fats:
While it's crucial to limit our intake of saturated and trans fats, our bodies still need healthy fats to function correctly. Unsaturated fats found in foods such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.

In addition to consuming these nutritious foods, seniors should also pay attention to their hydration levels. Dehydration is a common issue among older adults and can lead to more severe health problems. Seniors should aim to drink at least eight cups of water a day and incorporate hydrating foods such as fruits, vegetables, and soups into their diet.

It's worth noting that as we age, our appetites may decrease, making it challenging to consume all the necessary nutrients through food alone. In such cases, supplementing with a multivitamin may be beneficial. However, it's always best to consult a doctor before starting any new supplement.

4. Promotes healthy skin

Carrots are rich in antioxidants, which help protect your skin from damage caused by free radicals. These antioxidants also play a role in preventing premature aging and keeping your skin looking youthful. Eating raw carrots daily can give your skin a natural, healthy glow.

5. Aids in weight loss

If you're looking to shed some extra pounds, raw carrots can be your new best friend. They are low in calories and high in fiber, making them a filling snack that won't pack on the pounds. By incorporating carrots into your daily diet, you can satisfy your hunger without overindulging in unhealthy snacks.

6. Portable and versatile snack

Raw carrots are an easy, on-the-go snack that requires no prep. Simply wash and pack them in a bag, and you have a healthy snack to munch on throughout the day.

Why not? Q4. Fine, why did she ditch you? …Fine, why did you mutually decide to ‘move on’? Have you jumped through a flaming hoop before? Q5. Did you notice that I messed up the question numbering? Q6. Did you refrain from telling me so? If you told me so, then you have failed the Sugar Lad application and need to quickly say 17 hail-molasses’s (…hail-molassi?) quickly before moving on to the next question. Q7. If a Sugar Mother asked you to jump, how high could you jump? Q8. That’s quite high. Why not just get a career in something that involves jumping? Q9. As part of a Sugar Lad’s duties, you may be required to mow lawns, weed gardens and rake leaves and your Sugar Lad allowance may actually be the same amount (or slightly less) than the Sugar Mothers pay the Sugar Gardeners.

Istiaque Ahmed,Sat,"How much of dry food should my 2-mo 1.5 lb toy poodle eat every day? I've found a wide range of info, from 20 to 80 g/day. I think I might be underfeeding her, as she craves for more food each time, but I'm also concerned about overfeeding her.","Feeding your precious 2-month-old, 1.5 lb toy poodle can be a delicate balancing act, as you strive to provide just the right amount of nutrition without overfeeding or underfeeding. Let's explore some guidelines to help you navigate this journey with confidence.

Understanding Your Toy Poodle's Nutritional Needs

At two months old, your toy poodle is still in the crucial stage of growth and development. During this period, proper nutrition is essential to support healthy bone and muscle development, as well as overall well-being. It's important to choose a high-quality, age-appropriate dry food formulated specifically for puppies to ensure that your furry friend receives the necessary nutrients.

Recommended Feeding Amounts: Finding the Sweet Spot

Determining the ideal amount of dry food to feed your toy poodle can be challenging, as individual needs may vary based on factors such as activity level, metabolism, and overall health. While the wide range of information you've encountered (from 20 to 80 g/day) may seem overwhelming, there are general guidelines you can follow to help you find the right balance.

Start with the Manufacturer's Recommendations

Many dry food manufacturers provide feeding guidelines on their packaging, typically based on the weight and age of your puppy. These recommendations serve as a helpful starting point but may need to be adjusted based on your toy poodle's specific needs.

Consider Your Toy Poodle's Body Condition

Monitoring your toy poodle's body condition can provide valuable insight into whether you're feeding the right amount. Ideally, your puppy should have a visible waist when viewed from above and be easily palpable but not overly thin. If you notice that your toy poodle is becoming too thin or too pudgy, you may need to adjust the amount of food accordingly.

Consult with Your Veterinarian

Your veterinarian is your best resource when it comes to determining the appropriate feeding amount for your toy poodle. They can take into account factors such as your puppy's current weight, growth rate, and any specific health considerations to provide personalized recommendations.

Addressing Signs of Hunger or Overfeeding

If you suspect that your toy poodle is craving more food due to hunger, it's essential to evaluate whether you're providing enough nourishment. Gradually increasing the amount of food based on your veterinarian's guidance can help meet your puppy's growing needs without overfeeding.

On the other hand, if you're concerned about overfeeding, it's crucial to be mindful of portion sizes and avoid free-feeding practices. Dividing your toy poodle's daily food allowance into multiple smaller meals throughout the day can help prevent overconsumption and promote healthy digestion.

Final Thoughts

Feeding your 2-month-old toy poodle requires patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to adapt as your puppy grows. By considering factors such as nutritional requirements, body condition, and professional guidance, you can provide your furry companion with the nourishment they need to thrive and grow into a happy, healthy adult dog.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3btzye269dnhmvq5', 'title': ""How much of dry food should my 2-mo 1.5 lb toy poodle eat every day?

Kristen Dias,Sun,"Which Indian dish do you really like, but it is not appreciated enough?","When I first moved to Bangalore I really knew nothing about South Indian food, I thought that Indian = North Indian, as that is what I had experienced in Melbourne Australia where I am from originally.

Initally when i tried dosa and idli, I thought idli was a little weird in texture and tasted a bit strange and sour, so I was not really a fan of it. However Masala dosa with the crispy dosa and the tasty potato inside was excellent.

After a year or so of eating both, slowly idli started to grow on me. I started noticing the differences of varieties of sambar and that there is a sambar in Bangalore that is kind of sweet and red with more tomato, and there is a less sweet one which I believe is from Tamil Nadu which I started to prefer the taste of.

Generally I would say foriegners like me are more likely to appreciate dosa over idli, but I now MUCH prefer idli sambar if it’s hot, with steamy spongy idli and the tamil nadu style sambar with ghee, it’s SO good. Amongst foreigners at least I would say it’s under appreciated.

I also love podi idli, ghee podi idli, mini idili’s, thattai idli, malliga idli… :)

2. Monitor Your Puppy's Weight: Keep an eye on your toy Poodle's weight and adjust their food intake accordingly. Puppies grow rapidly, so it's important to make sure they are getting the right amount of food to support their development without overfeeding.

3. Offer a Balanced Diet: Make sure your toy Poodle is getting all the nutrients they need by feeding a high-quality puppy food that is appropriate for their age and size. Avoid giving them table scraps or human food, as these can be harmful to their health.

4. Schedule Regular Meals: Establishing a consistent feeding schedule can help regulate your toy Poodle's digestion and prevent begging. Aim for 3-4 small meals throughout the day rather than leaving food out all the time.

Martin Bayer,20h,What is the best procedure to cook beef?,"It depends on the cut of beef.

The muscles in an animal can be classified as well exercised, weight bearing muscles and sedentary muscles. The well exercised muscles will be full of collagen, connective tissue, that’s tough and needs to be broken down with long slow application of heat, so it converts into gelatin and the meat becomes luscious and tender. Cuts like brisket, shanks, and chuck are of this type. They need to be braised or smoked to tenderness.

Some cuts contain less collagen and don’t need to be braised. Bottom round, top round and chuck eye can be roasted in the oven using dry heat, thinly sliced and served as roast beef.

More tender cuts, from relaxed muscles, like ribeye steaks, filet, flank steak and top blade steaks, can be cooked with direct heat in a pan, on a grill or under a broiler.

So, the best procedure for cooking beef depends on the cut. Beef can be braised, poached, grilled, fried, sautéed, whatever. You just have to select the method that best suits the cut of beef you’ve got on hand. If in doubt, ask your butcher. They’ll know.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/l0ugq8keichwz1j7', 'title': 'What is the best procedure to cook beef?', 'score': {'original': 0.9621, 'ai': 0.0379}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It depends on the cut of beef.\n\nThe muscles in an animal can be classified as well exercised, weight bearing muscles and sedentary muscles.

Ava Dash,Mon,Is it healthy for a cat to only eat one type of wet or dry food without switching to different varieties occasionally?,"Feeding a cat a consistent and well-balanced diet is generally healthy, and many cats thrive on a consistent diet without the need for frequent switches. However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

Complete and Balanced Nutrition: Ensure that the selected cat food provides complete and balanced nutrition to meet your cat's dietary needs. Look for cat food labeled as ""complete and balanced"" to ensure it meets the necessary nutritional standards.
Variety Within a Brand: Some cat food brands offer a range of flavors or formulations within their product line. If you find a brand that your cat enjoys and that provides balanced nutrition, you may be able to offer variety within that brand.
Individual Cat Preferences: Cats can be finicky eaters, and some may become accustomed to a specific flavor or texture. If your cat is thriving on a particular food, and there are no health concerns, there may not be a need for frequent changes.
Consultation with a Veterinarian: It's always a good idea to consult with your veterinarian regarding your cat's specific dietary needs. They can provide guidance based on your cat's health, age, and any specific requirements.
Transitioning Gradually: If you decide to switch your cat's food for any reason, it's essential to do so gradually to avoid digestive upset. Mix small amounts of the new food with the old, gradually increasing the proportion of the new food over several days.

Ultimately, the key is to provide a nutritionally complete and balanced diet that suits your cat's preferences and meets their individual health requirements.

Loren McCune,Feb 15,How does the choice of cooking method impact the texture and flavor of onions?,"There’s a variety of flavors and textures available when onions are an ingredient in a dish. Cooked onions are all soft in texture, and less pungent than raw onions which have a delightful crunch.

Temperature. If onions are chopped and added to a stew or soup and allowed to cook in the liquid in the pot, the onions will cook at no more than 212℉ which is fine, but has a different flavor than cooked at higher temperatures, which do flavorful things with onions. They can caramelize to various degrees, lightly brown with the Maillard reaction, or just sweat as they are sautéed. Each has its own flavor, I had French Onion soup tonight and the caramelized onions were sweet and wonderful.

Raw. Depending on the type of onion, raw onion in a salad or in dish such as enchiladas, can be pungent or sweet as well as somewhere in between. Raw onion has a crunch that I particularly like.

Sweated. A lot of recipes call for sautéing onions in a little oil or butter until transparent. This removes most of the pungency and slightly sweetens the flavor. Also some of the aromatic ingredients in onion and garlic are oil-soluble. Your dish may taste and smell better if you sauté the onions first.

Grilled: Grilled onions can be cooked to the degree of softness desired as well as to the degree of browning or char desired. A smoky flavor can be easily obtained as well. Grilled onions are great onions.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wuyq4ejtrhvncs9k', 'title': 'How does the choice of cooking method impact the texture and flavor of onions?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'There’s a variety of flavors and textures available when onions are an ingredient in a dish.

Ava Dash,Mon,What is the reason behind dogs not liking raw eggs but enjoying cooked ones?,"Dogs' preferences for raw or cooked eggs can vary from one individual to another. Some dogs may not show a preference, while others may have specific reactions based on their tastes, experiences, or even individual sensitivities. It's important to note that not all dogs dislike raw eggs, and some may consume them without any issues.

Here are a few reasons why a dog might prefer cooked eggs over raw ones:

Texture and Smell: Cooking eggs changes their texture and smell. Some dogs may find the smell or consistency of cooked eggs more appealing than raw ones.
Temperature: Cooked eggs are warm, and some dogs may prefer the warmth of cooked food over something cold or room temperature.
Sensory Appeal: The cooking process alters the flavor profile of eggs, and dogs, like humans, have individual taste preferences. Cooked eggs may have a more pronounced flavor that some dogs find enticing.
Digestibility: In some cases, dogs might find cooked eggs more easily digestible than raw ones. The cooking process can make certain nutrients in eggs more accessible for absorption.

It's essential to observe your dog's reactions and preferences while introducing different foods. If your dog enjoys cooked eggs and you want to incorporate them into their diet, it's generally safe as long as the eggs are prepared without added seasonings, oils, or other ingredients that could be harmful to dogs. Always consult with your veterinarian to ensure that any additions to your dog's diet align with their specific nutritional needs and health conditions.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/qbmre81xnhw5l7as', 'title': 'What is the reason behind dogs not liking raw eggs but enjoying cooked ones?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Dogs' preferences for raw or cooked eggs can vary from one individual to another.

R Claire Mitchell,Feb 16,Why don't (generally) old white people like spicy food?,"Why do you say that? Roast beef with horseradish and/or mustard – and I mean Colman’s English mustard made up from powder – are deeply ingrained into English culture. Those of us who are now old remember the pre-McDonalds days when hamburgers and hotdogs were something you bought from a van after a night in the pub, and if we had American students with us we encouraged them to slather mustard on their food as they were accustomed to, just to see them turn red and sweaty. Yes, there’s a cruel streak in British culture to be sure.

I’m going to turn 70 in a little less than six months, so I suppose the average Quora hypogephyrean would consider me old, though there’s life in the old girl yet. I like a good curry as much as anybody. although to be sure I don’t take them quite as hot as I once did, and I do enjoy the emergence of a relatively new breed of Indian restaurant truer to the real cuisine and with more stress on flavour than pure heat, yet still pungent. I like an occasional doner kebab with hot chilli sauce. I’m fond of spicy Sichuan-style Chinese food where I can find it. So no, this old (for some values of ‘old’) likes spicy food a lot.

I know that’s just me, but of course the original premise is rather sweeping and we are all different. We have been exposed to spicy food most of our lives, and a very significant number of us like it. What is undoubtedly true is that throughout Britain there are far more Indian carry-outs and restaurants than there are the more ‘traditional’ chippies.

Not food I know, but my nanna (born in 1890) made a non-alcoholic ginger wine that took the roof of your head off. She passed on the recipe to my mum and she used to make it at Christmas. It required a trip to the chemist for a special fiery tincture to be made up. The recipe has not, alas, come down to the granddaughter. The nearest I’ve found was when I did a bit of contracting work for United Distillers (now Diageo) and had access to the company shop which sold discounted company products to contractors as well as permanent staff. There was one product not marketed in Britain (alas!), I can’t remember what it was called but it was essentially Bell’s (cooking) whisky infused with chillies (you can do that with Bell’s but they wouldn’t dare do it to the Lagavulin!).

Roast beef with horseradish and/or mustard – and I mean Colman’s English mustard made up from powder – are deeply ingrained into English culture. Those of us who are now old remember the pre-McDonalds days when hamburgers and hotdogs were something you bought from a van after a night in the pub, and if we had American students with us we encouraged them to slather mustard on their food as they were accustomed to, just to see them turn red and sweaty. Yes, there’s a cruel streak in British culture to be sure.\n\nI’m going to turn 70 in a little less than six months, so I suppose the average Quora hypogephyrean would consider me old, though there’s life in the old girl yet. I like a good curry as much as anybody. although to be sure I don’t take them quite as hot as I once did, and I do enjoy the emergence of a relatively new breed of Indian restaurant truer to the real cuisine and with more stress on flavour than pure heat, yet still pungent. I like an occasional doner kebab with hot chilli sauce. I’m fond of spicy Sichuan-style Chinese food where I can find it. So no, this old (for some values of ‘old’) likes spicy food a lot.\n\nI know that’s just me, but of course the original premise is rather sweeping and we are all different. We have been exposed to spicy food most of our lives, and a very significant number of us like it. What is undoubtedly true is that throughout Britain there are far more Indian carry-outs and restaurants than there are the more ‘traditional’ chippies.\n\nNot food I know, but my nanna (born in 1890) made a non-alcoholic ginger wine that took the roof of your head off. She passed on the recipe to my mum and she used to make it at Christmas. It required a trip to the chemist for a special fiery tincture to be made up.

Scott Hattis,Feb 15,Does working fast food suck as much as people say it does?,"Yes, It kinda does. I work as a shift manager at a fast food restaurant. (I won't mention the name, I still need the job for a little longer.)

Don't get me wrong, there are some good days where everything goes smooth.

There are many reasons I hate working fast food.

There's never a fixed schedule. I have to find out what my hours are every Sunday. Even then, I have been called in on my only off day more than once.
Absolutely no benefits. Except 1 free combo each shift worked. No paid time off, no insurance of any kind, nada!!! Just free food and a bi-monthly paycheck.
It's a very stressful job. When a car pulls up to to the menu, a sensor triggers a timer to start. When that same car pulls from the window to leave, a sensor stops that timer. Management wants each car to be timed at a maximum of 107 seconds.
You haven't seen how ugly people can behave until you have worked fast food. I have been pelted with coins, spat at, cussed at, screamed at, punched, doused with soda, and have received countless threats of assault, and a few death threats. People don't respect fast food employees.
It's a dead end job. The most you can progress is to a shift manager. Don't get too excited, they hand that promotion out to anyone who lasts more than a year. Yes, you'll get an okay pay raise, but don't expect your checks to be any bigger. The more you are paid per hour, the less hours you will be scheduled for. This is due to the labor percentage. The store computer keeps track of how much money the store is taking in hourly, and tells the GM how much of the money coming in is already spent on wages for the people who are clocked in. The higher your hourly rate, the closer you are to the first pick to be sent home early.
There's a HUGE language barrier for a lot of my coworkers. They are all from south America. They all speak different varieties of Spanish. They are really cool people, but it's frustrating to have to pull out my phone to translate what needs to be done, or to simply communicate. Especially during a busy lunch rush.

I can't wait to finish college. I graduate September of 2025. The moment I walk across the stage with a cap and gown, I'm putting in my two weeks.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kuwqx8mel9hdv504', 'title': 'Does working fast food suck as much as people say it does?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Yes, It kinda does.

Ava Dash,Sun,Can my dog eat prawn crackers? What are your expert reviews?,"While prawn crackers themselves are not toxic to dogs, it's important to note that they are often fried and can be high in salt and fat. Feeding your dog prawn crackers in moderation is generally okay, but there are some considerations to keep in mind:

Salt Content: Prawn crackers may contain a significant amount of salt, which can be harmful to dogs in excess. Too much salt can lead to sodium ion poisoning, causing symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and in severe cases, it can be life-threatening.
Spices and Flavorings: Some prawn crackers may contain spices or flavorings that could be irritating to a dog's digestive system.
Portion Control: If you decide to give your dog a small piece of prawn cracker, ensure it's a small amount, and monitor for any adverse reactions.
Individual Sensitivity: Dogs can have varying sensitivities to different foods, so observe your dog for any signs of allergies or digestive upset after eating prawn crackers.

It's always a good idea to introduce new foods gradually and in moderation. If you have any concerns or if your dog has a known sensitivity to certain ingredients, it's best to consult with your veterinarian before offering prawn crackers or any unfamiliar food.

Remember that the primary diet for dogs should consist of nutritionally balanced dog food to meet their specific dietary needs.

Beth Goldowitz,Feb 16,Are weed brownies more healthy than normal brownies because weed is a plant so there's vegetables in the brownie?,"This is the type of logic one might expect from someone who has recently consumed a weed brownie.

Consider the ingredients in a typical brownie recipe. Flour made from wheat. Wheat is a plant. Sugar derived from sugar cane. Sugar cane is a plant. Chocolate made from cocoa beans. Where do we get cocoa beans? From plants. Brownies will also include eggs and butter, both of which come from animals and include fats and protein, both necessary macronutrients. If you really want your brownies to be healthier, add some nuts.

In fact, a well made weed brownie doesn't include any vegetable matter from marijuana, because you first extract the active ingredients by infusing them into butter, then you strain out the vegetable bits and use the butter to make your brownies or any other baked goods you want to use it in.

Like any other food, even foods that make you feel good, weed brownies and ordinary brownies are neither healthy nor unhealthy. Both should be consumed in moderation, as much because they have lots of carbs as because of any additional content. As with any diet, exercise is important.

Family Garden,Tue,Is it harmful to feed a cat too much fruit or vegetables?,"Yes, feeding a cat too much fruit or vegetables can be harmful for several reasons:

Dietary Needs: Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily composed of animal protein to meet their nutritional needs. Fruits and vegetables contain carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamins that are not essential for cats and can even upset their digestive system.

Digestive Issues: Cats lack the necessary enzymes to properly digest large amounts of plant material. This can lead to stomach upset, diarrhea, vomiting, and even intestinal blockages.

Health Concerns: Excessive sugar intake from fruits can contribute to obesity and diabetes in cats. Certain fruits and vegetables also contain toxins that can be harmful to cats, such as grapes, raisins, onions, and garlic.

Overall Impact: While small amounts of certain fruits and vegetables might be tolerated by some cats, they should never be a significant part of their diet. Feeding your cat too much fruit or vegetables can displace essential nutrients they need from meat-based proteins and potentially cause health problems.

Here's a breakdown of what's safe and what's not:

Safe in Small Amounts (with Supervision):

Apples (peeled, cored)
Bananas (ripe, small pieces)
Blueberries
Cantaloupe (rind removed)
Green beans (cooked)
Melon (rind removed)
Peas (cooked)
Spinach (rinsed well, small amounts)
Strawberries

Never Give to Cats:

Avocados
Citrus fruits
Grapes
Raisins
Onions
Garlic
Tomatoes (green parts)

Remember:

Always consult your veterinarian before introducing any new food to your cat's diet, including fruits and vegetables.
If you notice any signs of digestive upset after your cat ingests fruits or vegetables, discontinue immediately and seek veterinary advice.
Prioritize a complete and balanced commercial cat food formulated to meet their specific nutritional needs.

By understanding your cat's dietary requirements and practicing caution, you can ensure their health and well-being while avoiding the potential harm of feeding them too much fruit or vegetables.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7ubhsx301gezrtym', 'title': 'Is it harmful to feed a cat too much fruit or vegetables?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Yes, feeding a cat too much fruit or vegetables can be harmful for several reasons:\n\nDietary Needs: Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily composed of animal protein to meet their nutritional needs.

Feeding your cat too much fruit or vegetables can displace essential nutrients they need from meat-based proteins and potentially cause health problems.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's safe and what's not:\n\nSafe in Small Amounts (with Supervision):\n\nApples (peeled, cored)\nBananas (ripe, small pieces)\nBlueberries\nCantaloupe (rind removed)\nGreen beans (cooked)\nMelon (rind removed)\nPeas (cooked)\nSpinach (rinsed well, small amounts)\nStrawberries\n\nNever Give to Cats:\n\nAvocados\nCitrus fruits\nGrapes\nRaisins\nOnions\nGarlic\nTomatoes (green parts)\n\nRemember:\n\nAlways consult your veterinarian before introducing any new food to your cat's diet, including fruits and vegetables.\nIf you notice any signs of digestive upset after your cat ingests fruits or vegetables, discontinue immediately and seek veterinary advice.\nPrioritize a complete and balanced commercial cat food formulated to meet their specific nutritional needs.\n\nBy understanding your cat's dietary requirements and practicing caution, you can ensure their health and well-being while avoiding the potential harm of feeding them too much fruit or vegetables."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.0
Ellen Fleischer,Mon,Why don't pet food manufacturers offer cat food with a mouse flavor?,"As I understand it, (and paraphrasing from some past Googling):

There are quality standards for pet food. If mice were used in cat food, it would mean that mice would need to be bred for cat food. Fed properly. Under veterinary supervision. Millions of them. (Remember, one chicken produces about 9 cups of food, an average of 18 meals, according to Whole Chicken Cat Food Recipe
. The cat food you buy in the store isn’t 100% pure chicken, so it probably stretches farther. But if one chicken makes… oh, let’s round it up to 20 meals (probably still low, especially if you’re buying the cheap foods with more filler), according to the Animal Medical Center of Chicago, a cat needs to eat 5–6 mice per day to meet their nutritional needs (Source: Demystifying the Cat Diet - Animal Medical Center of Chicago
). According to the Fear Free Happy Homes blog (A Mouse Has Only 30 Calories, and Other Things You Didn't Know About Caring for Cats
), that’s more like 8–12. I’m speculating that the 5–6 is for more-sedentary indoor cats, but the 8–12 is more like what your average outdoor, struggling-for-survival-and-running-from-predators cat would need, but I’m not an expert, just a random person who knows how to Google. Want to meet in the middle and say 8 or 9 mice per cat per day? Yeah, breeding facilities for millions of mice aren’t a ridiculous notion. How many people would be comfortable living up the road from one of those facilities, in the event that someone doesn’t lock the cages one night and they happen to get loose?
Once you’re actually taking care of your cat food ingredient-to-be, all the feeding and housing and vet care becomes another cost to pass onto the consumer. And right now, there aren’t a whole lot of vets specializing in mouse care. Those that are would suddenly be in demand and likely expecting (quite rightfully) to be paid for their expertise. Likely at a higher rate than your typical dog/cat specialist.
Ever notice how cat foods have names like, “Tuna Luau” or “Tiki Cat after Dark” or “Luv Ya Chicken n Lamb”? Those cutesy names aren’t to make them more appealing to the cat. Cats aren’t buying the products. Humans are. And like it or not, a lot of us humans can’t help anthropomorphizing our furry friends to a degree. Or at least, thinking, “What would I rather eat? Roasted chicken or roasted mouse? Bet my cat would rather have the chicken too. Sure, he’ll eat mice if that’s what’s available. But what would he rather have? And don’t mice carry disease? What if he gets bubonic plague from an infected rodent?” (No, it doesn’t really work that way, but some people don’t want to take that chance). Same logic that makes cat hotels/kennels look like human 5-star accommodations, even if your cat would probably be happiest at home, in familiar territory, with a sitter coming in once a day to feed/water/clean/play.

Gena HealthX Pvt Ltd,Mon,"How can I make healthy food choices when dining out or ordering takeout, without feeling deprived or sacrificing social enjoyment?","Making healthy food choices while dining out or ordering takeout can be challenging, but it's definitely possible with a bit of planning and mindfulness. Here are some tips to help you make healthier choices without feeling deprived:

Scan the menu strategically: Look for keywords like ""grilled,"" ""steamed,"" ""baked,"" or ""roasted"" which indicate healthier cooking methods. Also, pay attention to dishes that emphasise vegetables, lean proteins [which includes plant protein, cottage cheese as well], and whole grains.

Start with a salad or broth-based soup: Beginning your meal with a salad or soup can help fill you up with fewer calories and provide valuable nutrients. Just watch out for high-calorie dressings, creamy soups or fried croutons.

Control your portions: Restaurants often serve oversized portions, so consider sharing an entree with a friend or ordering an appetiser as your main course. If you're dining alone, ask for a to-go container upfront and pack away half of your meal to enjoy later.

Customise your order: Don't be afraid to ask for substitutions or modifications to suit your dietary preferences. Requesting sauces or dressings on the side, choosing whole grain options, or swapping out sides for steamed vegetables can make a big difference.

Choose water or unsweetened beverages: Instead of sugary sodas or alcoholic drinks, opt for water, sparkling water, unsweetened iced tea, or other low-calorie beverages.

Practice portion control with takeout: When ordering takeout, be mindful of portion sizes and avoid ordering more food than you need. Consider ordering appetisers or sides instead of a full meal, or splitting a larger dish with someone else.

Don't skip meals beforehand: Arriving at the restaurant overly hungry can lead to poor food choices and overeating. Have a small, balanced snack before you go out to help take the edge off your hunger.

Practice moderation, not deprivation: It's okay to indulge in your favourite foods occasionally. The key is to enjoy them in moderation and balance them out with healthier choices the rest of the time.

Focus on socialising: Remember that dining out is not just about the food – it's also about enjoying the company of friends or family. Focus on the conversation and connection rather than solely on what's on your plate.

By implementing these strategies, you can make healthier choices when dining out or ordering takeout without feeling deprived or sacrificing social enjoyment.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ron35zxebc2wy6sl', 'title': 'How can I make healthy food choices when dining out or ordering takeout, without feeling deprived or sacrificing social enjoyment?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Making healthy food choices while dining out or ordering takeout can be challenging, but it\'s definitely possible with a bit of planning and mindfulness.

Kane Mollins,Tue,Is it safe for cats to eat different foods at different times of the day?,"Feeding cats different foods at different times of the day can be safe, but it's important to do so with caution and consideration for their nutritional needs. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily consisting of animal protein. It's essential to provide them with balanced nutrition that meets their dietary requirements.

If you're considering varying your cat's diet throughout the day, here are some key points to keep in mind:

1. **Nutritional Balance**: Ensure that each meal or snack provides essential nutrients, including protein, taurine, vitamins, and minerals. Consult with your veterinarian to determine the appropriate portion sizes and nutritional content for your cat's specific needs.

2. **Gradual Transition**: Cats can be sensitive to sudden changes in their diet, so it's best to introduce new foods gradually. Start by mixing small amounts of the new food with their current diet and gradually increase the proportion over several days.

3. **Food Safety**: Only offer foods that are safe for cats to consume. Avoid feeding them foods that are toxic or harmful, such as chocolate, onions, garlic, grapes, and raisins. Additionally, be cautious with dairy products, as many cats are lactose intolerant.

4. **Avoid Overfeeding**: While it's tempting to offer treats or additional meals throughout the day, overfeeding can lead to obesity and other health issues. Stick to recommended portion sizes and monitor your cat's weight and body condition regularly.

5. **Hydration**: Ensure that your cat has access to fresh water at all times, especially if you're feeding them dry food. Cats have a low thirst drive compared to other animals, so proper hydration is essential for their overall health.

6. **Routine and Consistency**: Establish a feeding schedule and stick to it as much as possible. Cats thrive on routine, and consistent mealtimes can help prevent behavioral issues and promote a sense of security.

Ultimately, while it's generally safe for cats to eat different foods at different times of the day, it's crucial to prioritize their nutritional needs and overall well-being. Consult with your veterinarian for personalized advice and guidance based on your cat's age, health status, and dietary requirements.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hy5msbx7v82daw3u', 'title': 'Is it safe for cats to eat different foods at different times of the day?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Feeding cats different foods at different times of the day can be safe, but it's important to do so with caution and consideration for their nutritional needs.

Michelle Mac,Sun,"Can cats eat raw chicken instead of canned cat food? If so, what is the recommended amount per day?","Raw meat of any kind is a bad idea - for the same reason it’s a bad idea for YOU to eat raw chicken. There’s a significant risk of food poisoning, parasites, etc.
Yes, stray/feral cats eat raw meat all the time. They also get food poisoning and parasites all the time. At the cat rescue, whenever we take a cat in from living outdoors, we routinely de-worm them, because almost all cats that have been living outdoors pick up some kind of parasite; and we frequently find strays that are horribly sick, often from eating contaminated foods.
The best thing to feed a cat is cat food. It doesn’t need to be canned - kibble is generally cheaper, just as nutritious, and better for their teeth.
If what you’re really wondering about is how to make homemade food for your cat, know that it is more difficult than it appears at face value. A cat’s nutritional requirements are different than those of a human; cats are ‘obligate carnivores’ - they MUST have a high percentage of animal protein in their diet. However, they also require certain amino acids and vitamins in their diet, which might be present in organ meats and bones but are NOT present in most home-cooking. For this reason, homemade cat foods are all too often lacking in critical nutrients. You’ll often need to include a vitamin or mineral supplement. And a lot of the recipes out there are actually not adequate for a cat’s dietary requirements. If you’re determined to feed your cat homemade food, here’s a guide to doing it right:

Sky High,Feb 16,Which foods should I avoid after a dog bite?,"Foods to Avoid After a Dog Bite:

1. High-Risk Foods:

Raw Meat and Eggs: Consuming raw or undercooked meat and eggs increases the risk of bacterial contamination, including Salmonella and E. coli, which can exacerbate infection from a dog bite.
Unpasteurized Dairy Products: Unpasteurized dairy products, such as raw milk and cheese, can harbor harmful bacteria like Campylobacter and Listeria, posing a risk of infection.

2. Spicy or Acidic Foods:

Spices and Hot Sauces: Spicy foods may irritate the wound and increase discomfort. Additionally, spicy ingredients can potentially introduce harmful bacteria into the bloodstream, complicating the healing process.
Citrus Fruits and Juices: Acidic fruits like oranges, lemons, and grapefruits can irritate the wound and delay healing. Avoid consuming citrus fruits or juices until the wound has fully healed.

3. High-Sugar Foods:

Sugary Treats: Foods high in sugar, such as candies, pastries, and sugary beverages, can weaken the immune system and promote bacterial growth. Elevated blood sugar levels can also impair wound healing and increase the risk of infection.

4. Hard and Crunchy Foods:

Hard Snacks and Chips: Crunchy foods like chips and pretzels may pose a risk of injuring the wound or causing irritation. Avoid consuming hard or crunchy snacks that could disrupt the healing process or introduce debris into the wound.

5. Alcohol and Caffeine:

Alcoholic Beverages: Alcohol can impair the immune system and interfere with the body's ability to fight infection. Avoid consuming alcoholic beverages until the wound has healed to minimize the risk of complications.
Caffeinated Drinks: Caffeine-containing beverages like coffee, tea, and energy drinks can dehydrate the body and potentially delay wound healing. opt for hydrating fluids like water or herbal teas instead.

6. Processed and Junk Foods:

Processed Meats and Fast Food: Processed meats and fast-food items are often high in saturated fats, sodium, and additives, which can compromise the immune system and impede the healing process. Choose nourishing, whole foods to support recovery.

Conclusion:

After a dog bite, it's essential to avoid foods that can increase the risk of infection, delay healing, or exacerbate discomfort.
Steer clear of high-risk foods such as raw meat, unpasteurized dairy, and spicy or acidic items that may irritate the wound or introduce harmful bacteria.
Opt for nutrient-rich foods that support immune function and promote healing, such as lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Stay hydrated and prioritize a balanced diet to aid in the body's recovery process. If you have concerns about your diet after a dog bite, consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/clg0pntyxvza6bem', 'title': 'Which foods should I avoid after a dog bite?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Foods to Avoid After a Dog Bite:\n\n1.

Feifei Wang,Tue,What is your favourite American dish?,"First of all, what is an “American” dish? Is there an American “home-grown” dish that isn’t brought to the US by immigrants? Are there American dishes devoid of any distinctive/recognizable influences from other countries or cultures? Certainly not Pizza, Steak, or burger, anything you might consider trade-mark “American,” most likely came from Europe or had European influence.

I felt that if we want to find “home-grown” Americans, there are two places you might look: Black cuisine and Indigenous cuisine. Black people created their unique cuisine by being creative with the material they could get (often cheap meat nobody wanted and foraged vegetables). They drew inspiration from multiple diverse places, Africa, France, Spain, England, and Germany… to create unique tastes and textures. While you can find European-inspired cooking methods, the end result is uniquely Black American. I’m a fan of Cajun and Creole food.

On top of that, there are plenty of indigenous foods that are uniquely American, such as pemmican and fry bread.

There are some southern foods that I think might be considered American, like shrimp and grits. I mean… who, other than Southerners, would put shrimp in oily porridge and eat it at breakfast? One could also make an argument that Tex-Mex is American. Even American Chinese food is American. Any Chinese with self-respect would not claim sweet and sour mystery meat as our own.

As for me, my favorite American dish was Cajun seafood boil and Jambalaya until my stomach decided it did not want to process butter anymore, and I had to stop, which really truly was a sad day of my life.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/spbqifteg5k8nu0j', 'title': 'What is your favourite American dish?', 'score': {'original': 0.9947, 'ai': 0.0053}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'First of all, what is an “American” dish?

Hantani Sadahiko,Feb 16,What is the best Japanese soy sauce?,"High-quality soy sauce ranking[1]

1st [Inoue Shoyu Store] Inoue Koshiki Soy Sauce 720 ml

It is a naturally brewed dark soy sauce made by an ancient method inherited from the end of the Edo period. The amount of soybeans is 20% higher than that of the general preparation to make the umami and flavor stand out.

2nd [Yamarok Soy Sauce] Yamarok Tsuru Shu

Yamalok Soy Sauce is a 150 year old company with a brewery in Shodoshima, Kagawa Prefecture. ""Tsurujiang"" is said to be a confident product of Yamarok soy sauce that pursues deep richness and mellowness.

The raw soy sauce that has been matured for two years is put back into the barrel and reprepared for another two years. You can enjoy the mild taste that has been carefully made.

Number 3 [Yuasa Soy Sauce] ""Miracle Soy Sauce"" Rozanjin Soy Sauce 200 ml Born from Miracle Soy and Wheat [Limited Edition]

I use this.

This product was developed by Rosanjin Club Co., Ltd., which was established for the purpose of preserving gastronomy for posterity, in order to make traditional soy sauce without additives.

Using only soy beans, wheat, rice, and salt as raw materials, the soy sauce is carefully made using a method that is contrary to the recent soy sauce production method.

It is manufactured and sold every year on Rosanjin's birthday (March 23). They are limited in number, so please check them out if you are interested.

Number 4 [Hita Soy Sauce] Hita Soy Sauce One Piece

It is soy sauce made with the traditional method handed down from the Edo period using the inscriptions of Kyushu's Kokonoe mountain range and Hikoyama mountain range.

It can be used not only as kake soy sauce, but also in a wide range of dishes such as simmered dishes. It is characterized by a slightly sweet and rich taste, and goes well with simple tamago kake gohan.

5th 【 Ozora Zanmai 】 Shijimi soy sauce (thick) 200 ml

It is a slightly sweet soy sauce with the flavor of shijimi broth. It is extravagantly added by directly extracting the extract of natural shijimi from Lake Abashiri in Hokkaido and concentrating it 4 times.

The point is that the flavor of shijimi is not lost even if it is diluted. You can use it not only for tamago kake gohan, meat and fish dishes as soy sauce, but also for noodle dipping sauce.

Ava Dash,Mon,"What are the potential risks of feeding dogs human food, such as chocolate and grapes/raisins?","Feeding dogs certain human foods can pose serious health risks. Two common examples are chocolate and grapes/raisins:

Chocolate: Chocolate contains substances called theobromine and caffeine, which are stimulants that dogs metabolize more slowly than humans. Ingesting chocolate can lead to symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, increased heart rate, restlessness, and, in severe cases, seizures or death. The type and amount of chocolate (dark chocolate, milk chocolate, etc.) determine the level of toxicity.
Grapes/Raisins: The exact toxic substance in grapes and raisins is unknown, but ingestion can lead to kidney failure in some dogs. Even small amounts can be harmful. Symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and decreased appetite. Kidney damage can occur within a day or two after ingestion.

It's crucial to be aware of other harmful foods, including onions, garlic, alcohol, caffeine, certain nuts, and foods containing xylitol (a sugar substitute). Always consult with a veterinarian if you suspect your dog has ingested something toxic. Additionally, avoid offering table scraps or sharing human food unless you are sure it's safe for dogs.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/69w58oe2x3c14q0f', 'title': 'What are the potential risks of feeding dogs human food, such as chocolate and grapes/raisins?', 'score': {'original': 0.0001, 'ai': 0.9999}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Feeding dogs certain human foods can pose serious health risks.

Cooked chicken, like any other perishable food, can quickly develop harmful bacteria if left at room temperature for more than 2 hours (or 1 hour if the ambient temperature is above 90°F or 32°C).

Hello everyone who loves dogs! I'm Dr. Arif Aziz, and I've been taking care of pets especially dogs at my clinic for a long time, exactly 14 years! I'm here to share some valuable information with you that I've gathered from books during my study time written by experts in veterinary medicine (DVM) and MSC (Master of Science), as well as from my own experiences working with dogs. I've been running my Veterinary Clinic for the past 14 years…for more information visit my site at www.askpetcare.com

Feeding your cats chicken that has been sitting out for too long increases the risk of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella or bacterial contamination, which can make your cats sick and lead to digestive problems or other health issues.

To ensure the safety of your cats, always refrigerate cooked chicken promptly after serving and discard any leftovers that have been left out for an extended period. It's best to feed your cats freshly prepared food and to follow proper food handling and storage guidelines to minimize the risk of foodborne illness. If you're unsure about the safety of a food item, it's better to err on the side of caution and avoid feeding it to your cats.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ifvghnm5yqz0749x', 'title': 'Is it safe to feed our cats cooked chicken that has been out for a while?', 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""It's not safe to feed your cats cooked chicken that has been left out for an extended period of time.

Ethan James,Sun,What are some weird facts about food?,"Let’s talk about chips. More specifically, these chips.

These chips are called “The Whole Shabang”, and apparently, are one of the most delicious snacks to ever be created. One customer described them like this

“think of the most awesome thing you have ever tasted, then spin all that flavor times a million into one potatoey thin wafer”

Now, you might wonder why this flavour isn’t more popular, if it’s really as good as people say it is. Well, that’s because the chips are pretty much only available in prison commissary stores.

The Whole Shabang was created by the Keefe group, a company that specialises in making food products for the prison population. The flavour is described as a mix between salt-and-vinegar and barbecue flavour, and prisoners just can’t get enough.

Many prisoners - including some who only spent 60 days in jail - found themselves to be obsessed with the chips. Some even tried to find these chips online after getting out, leading to a small market of these chips on eBay.

“why did i have to go to jail to experience the best chips ever made…”

Jordan Jay,Mon,How should I tactfully tell a family who invited me for dinner that I'm still hungry?,"When my stepmother split up with my dad, he was forever running her and her family down.

However, one point he returned to repeatedly was the portion size when they visited my stepmother’s sister.

He would talk about her making a small roast chicken go between 8–10 people. You’d get a wafer thin slice of breast meat each and there would be chicken leftovers for the family during the week. You’d think that maybe she made up for this with big helpings of vegetables and roast potatoes? Nope. My dad would say that you got a single roast potato, twenty peas, and a tablespoon of boiled cabbage and that was it.

Family Garden,Tue,"Can hamsters eat fruits and vegetables? If so, which ones can they eat and how much should they eat per day?","Hamsters and the Fruity Feast: A Guide to Safe Snacking

Hamsters can indeed enjoy fruits and vegetables as occasional treats, but it's important to be mindful of what they can and cannot eat, and in what quantities. Here's a breakdown to keep your furry friend happy and healthy:

Safe Fruits and Vegetables:

Fruits: Apples (cored and peeled), bananas (small pieces), blueberries, cantaloupe (rind removed), cherries (pit removed), cranberries, grapes (seedless), papaya, peaches (pit removed), pears, raspberries, strawberries, watermelon (rind removed).
Vegetables: Broccoli (florets), carrots (small pieces), cucumber, dandelion greens, green beans, kale, romaine lettuce, spinach (rinsed well).

Fruits and Vegetables to Avoid:

Fruits: Avocados, citrus fruits, grapes (seeds intact), persimmons, prunes, raisins, rhubarb.
Vegetables: Garlic, onions, potatoes (raw), rhubarb, spinach (high in oxalic acid).

Quantity and Frequency:

General rule: Offer fruits and vegetables no more than twice a week, and keep serving sizes very small. A pea-sized piece of fruit or a small sliver of vegetable is enough for most dwarf hamsters.
Fresh is best: Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly and remove any spoiled parts before offering them to your hamster.
Variety is key: Rotate different fruits and vegetables to provide your hamster with a diverse range of nutrients.
Monitor closely: After introducing a new food, watch your hamster for any signs of digestive upset, such as diarrhea or bloating. If you notice any issues, stop offering that food immediately.

Important Tips:

Sugar content: Fruits are naturally high in sugar, so overindulging can lead to health problems like diabetes. Stick to small portions and low-sugar fruits like berries.
Wet content: Avoid watery fruits and vegetables like lettuce, as they can cause diarrhea.
Seeds and pits: Always remove seeds and pits before offering fruits to your hamster, as they can be choking hazards.
Moderation is key: Remember, fruits and vegetables should be occasional treats, not a dietary staple. Your hamster's primary food source should be a balanced commercial hamster pellet mix.

By following these guidelines, you can safely share the joy of fruits and vegetables with your hamster, enriching their diet and adding some variety to their lives. Remember, always prioritize your hamster's health and consult your veterinarian if you have any concerns.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/0j5viaw82qt6kobd', 'title': 'Can hamsters eat fruits and vegetables?
