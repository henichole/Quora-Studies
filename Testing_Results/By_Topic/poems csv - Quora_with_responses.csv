Eleftherios Tserkezis,Updated 4y,"How were Greeks able to orally pass down the Iliad and Odyssey despite there being nearly 28,000 total lines of metered poetry between them? Without memorizing the words verbatim, they would have had difficulty speaking the poem in meter.","This question did trouble researchers for quite some time. You see, our modern societies differ from the archaic Greek world in numerous ways, and even the most objective and impartial mind cannot always fully grasp the discrepancy and walk in the shoes (or sandals) of people who lived 3,000 or 2,500 years ago.

A major difference between the two worlds is the level of literacy. That doesn’t have to do only with the number of people who knew how to read and write, but goes even deeper. The ancient Greek society was an oral one in general. Everything, including written texts, existed to be read aloud. Wealthy Classical-age Athenians had slaves called anagnōstai ‘readers’ read to them aloud (fun fact: Plato used to teasingly call Aristotle anagnōstēs, because the latter often stayed at home to read by himself instead of going to the Academy). It’s believed that this changed only during the Roman-Byzantine era, when silent reading became prevalent.

In the early 20th c., a young American Homerist named Milman Parry thought of studying actual bards or rhapsodes in an attempt to better understand how the Homeric epics were passed down before their official recording, which came later. To do so, Parry travelled to Yugoslavia, where literacy rates were low, and small oral cultures still existed, almost detached from the so-called modern world. Parry found that those bards were capable of reproducing thousand-verse long poems.

Above: Milman Parry (right) in Yugoslavia.

Parry’s study and the scholarly tradition it created also answers what seems to trouble the OP the most. You see, for a modern literate person, poetry seems more difficult than prose, right? After all, you have to think about the meter, the rhyme etc., while in prose you simply write anything you want.

Well, for pre-modern oral communities, it seems that the opposite was the case. Poetry is more primitive than prose, at least as far as literature is concerned, because it makes memorization and repetitiveness simpler. Rhythmic schemes offer the bard a strong frame which he simply has to fill in and make it easier for him to recall what remains to be said at any given time.

Closely connected with this trait of poetry is the matter of formulas, also studied by Milman Parry in the context of oral composition and transmittance. The Homeric epics are full of formulas, standard phrases that occupy specific places in verses (usually half-a-verse each) because of their metric pattern. Formulas can also be adapted so that various names can fit in them.

One example will suffice, I think. One of the most commonly used formulaic verses in both the Iliad and the Odyssey is ‘Answering to x, y said.’ Just see how many different forms it can take.

First part—note that all four versions follow exactly the same metric pattern.
Ton d’ apameibomenos prosephē…: Both x and y are male.
Tēn d’ apameibomenos prosephē…: X is female, but y is male.

Roland Bartetzko,2y,Why do people go to poetry readings?,"If I say that I'm not fond of poetry, it's an understatement. I even wrote an anti-poetry answer here (“poetry is dead!”). Nevertheless, I recently went to my first poetry reading.

It was a rather small event (about 30 people in the backyard of a local pub). With poetry, you clearly can’t attract the masses. While our poetess, a very smart and talented young woman, was reciting from her work, I took a good look at the people around me.

Our young poetess, Uresa Ahmeti, reading from her work.

Here are my thought on why I think they were gathered there:

Friends and family of the poet(s). More than half of the people knew the artist. Most of them were her friends from high school and university, the rest family. I know that because she mentioned them all by name.
Other poets. Unlike people like me who are into prose, poets seem to be less jealous of each other. Maybe it's because they are all suffering from the same non-recognition of their efforts.
People who work in the pub. Our lovely pub manager was there and one of her staff members.
Guests of the pub. People like me and my buddies. I saw this quite often: when artists put their venue in a semi-public place, you get a crossover public. The beer-drinkers listen to the poetry while the poetry lovers have a beer.
People who helped the poet or worked with them (patrons, publishers, editors, translators, etc.).
Often, you also have some journalists at these events but not in this case.

Last but not least:

People who like poetry. Yes, these folks do exist! There was an actress sitting right next to me who has worked for the same TV production company I have worked for. I know that she loves poetry, after the recital, I had a chat with her about it.

It must be said that for poetry, having the author recite their own poems really makes a big difference in how you perceive their work. It’s also interesting to learn how the poems were created, especially how the author felt when she wrote them down. With prose, it doesn’t matter that much.

Although I’m still not a fan of poetry, I didn’t regret going there. It was a good evening and a quite a change to the usual bar atmosphere.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/k47z2njathblm1go', 'title': 'Why do people go to poetry readings?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""If I say that I'm not fond of poetry, it's an understatement.

Catherine MacLeod,Updated 3y,Can you write a limerick about your cat?,"This limerick was inspired by Tippy, a beautiful short haired silver tabby. She was originally my sister's cat, but when my sister had to travel for her work, she left Tippy and her other cat, Max, with my parents. I was in my early twenties at the time and still living in my parent's home.

Max was a dominate and gregarious cat that everyone loved, so Tippy was overlooked. I felt sorry for the timid little tabby, so I made it my mission to give her the attention she deserved. Tippy repaid me by selecting me as her favorite human. She followed me everywhere and literally never left my side. It's been 30 years since my dear little Tippy passed away. As I type these words there’s a lump in my throat and tears blur my vision. I miss her still.

My dear little tabby named Tippy,

Found a box that was just itty bitty,

She knew she could fit

And determined to sit,

Her success was exceedingly iffy.

Photo source: Why cats love boxes so much

At this time, I don't have a picture of my dear Tippy to share, as all my photos from that long ago are old fashioned prints from film. The cat in the above photo looks very much like my beloved companion. As soon as I figure out how to scan my old photos, I'll replace it with one of the real Tippy.

The following image is of an adorable linocut print that I discovered on Etsy. I think it also perfectly illustrates my limerick.

Neman Ashraf,5y,"What should I know about plagiarism? If I copy an idea for a poem or a story, is that plagiarism too?","You should know that it’s insanely counter productive.

5/6 years back when the idea of writing online struck me… I was confused about what to write actually. How do I attract readers, get traffic and earn couple of million dollars by running advertisements.

All I had was a stupid domain name.

I didn't even understand the concept of blogging back then actually. Some idiot guru had told me to “write on the topic you’re really good at”. Well… I wasn't good at anything, excuse me! I don’t know gardening, cooking, gadgetries or anything else.

What does a person write about when they are not good at any topic?

I’ll be frank… this question bothered me.

So I thought of copying someone else’s work.

Mainly for kicks and giggles, I wanna say but that doesn't make it acceptable.

I looked and carefully researched for a few good websites and blogs and decided to copy/steal/plagiarize a wordpress tutorial blog, it is one of the most famous blogs out there for worpress tips and tricks.

And it had thousand of posts with multiple authors.

So what I did? I copied two or three of their latest posts, every single line of text including html codes that clearly flew above my head. And after restlessly and shamelessly completing that task…. I sat there looking at my blog having mixed emotions.

Yes, that’s wrong and unfair to the real author and how hurtful it would be for them seeing their content stolen and published elsewhere without credits.

How cheap and deep throat of me for doing that! Is this the way I am going to start my blogging venture!

But most importantly and stressfully what bothered me was the thought that by doing this, I’m accepting that I’m no good at writing, I have nothing to say or share of my own, there’s nothing original, unique and attractive about me or my opinion.

It disturbed me to the core.

So I deleted the stolen content right there and clearly understood it’s erroneous, dishonest and above all…. highly damaging to me a thousand times more than the person I stole this content from.

It will kill me as a writer. Plain and simple.

So I learnt my lesson in couple of hours.

But the dilemma of writing my own content remained with me for months.

What do I write?

So one day I started writing whatever crap that came to my mind, stories, thoughts and rants. It was a personal blog instead of niche-specific obviously. Including that very experience of stealing content. Heading was “Confessions of a content thief” I remember.

Anyway… after a month of writing, the next thing I experienced just blew my mind.

One of my stories was stolen and published on a website. It was clearly a case of plagiarism, they changed the images and swapped few sentences. But story was the same about a constable’s thoughts while doing sentry duties in public.

It didn't infuriate me to be honest but otherwise!

hallelujah! I’m making content that is worth reading and even stealing! :)

Sadly I couldn't carry on with writing, work, laziness and procrastination including the fears of technicalities about sustaining a self hosted blog…. even to this day.

But I understood the idea, I got the picture and I learned what works.

Hopefully I’ll write on a blog of my own sooner. But that’s not the point. So my dear….

You should know that plagiarism will practically decapitate your pen for good. You won’t be a writer but a content thief. You will do something wrong and will be caught both by people and bots….and you’ll have your ass handed to you, promise. Humiliation and regret will be your companions instead of real readers. Nobody will appreciate you. So it’s a big NO from me, don’t even consider doing it.

Get your own idea for a poem, story or whatever.

How? very simple.

Just be yourself. That very ordinary thought of yours is original and unique, just tell your story as ordinarily and imperfectly as it truly is and you’ll find your share of audience.

I assure you… it will be beautiful and worth reading.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/d6219i3rnwgvsco8', 'title': 'What should I know about plagiarism?

Diana A.,1y,"What are two characters from two different books, movies, or poems that are similar?","Two early 20th-century novels for young girls, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1903) and Anne of Green Gables (1908) have very similar plots.

Rebecca is a thin, precocious 10 year old with long braids, a poor relation who is being sent to live with two unmarried aunts, sisters, whom she doesn’t know. At the beginning of the book Rebecca’s vivacious personality captivates the driver of the wagon who is taking her to the farm where she will be living.

When she gets there, she finds that her Aunt Miranda, the sister who really runs things, is rather crusty and stern in her expectations. (As the story goes, Miranda is disappointed, because she would have preferred Rebecca’s more practical sister, Jane, instead.) But Rebecca succeeds in ultimately winning her over, because she’s such a charming child.

Meanwhile, Rebecca learns about life through a series of misadventures, as she grows to young womanhood. The story takes place in a fictitious small community in Maine.

Anne is a thin, precocious 12 year old with long braids, a poor orphan who is being sent to live with two unmarried siblings (brother and sister) whom she doesn’t know. At the beginning of the book Anne’s vivacious personality capitivates the brother, who is driving her to the farm where she will be living.

When she arrives, she finds that his sister, Marilla, who really runs things, is rather crusty and stern in her expectations.

Jenns Xin,Updated 5y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","I love my family. I’ve got mommy and daddy and we live in a beautiful apartment in Hong Kong. Well not actually daddy. My second daddy.

I don’t remember my first daddy. The only thing I remember is us playing Rock Paper Scissors on the stairs at our lobby. It was so so fun. After a while, he turned around and disappeared. I couldn’t find him. Daddy was really good at hide and seek. Mommy said that he left because I had too many barbies. I love barbies. But it’s okay, second daddy loves me too.

Whenever mommy’s around he would play thumb war with me and I’ll use my tiny thumb to squash him. Sometimes, when mommy was busy, he would come sleep with me, tucked under my warm warm blankie. Just like the other night when mommy was having a massage in the other room. He wore a pair of undies just like he always did and came to sleep with me. He’s afraid that I would fall off the bed. Silly daddy.

He slipped under the blankie with me and hugged me all night long… a little too tight though. I could barely move, but he was snoring so I didn’t want to wake him up. Poor daddy, he’s always tired. As he was hugging me, I felt something against my back. It was so uncomfortable. It was like a stone or something rubbing against me. Maybe daddy was wearing a belt? How does mommy sleep with daddy? But, I’ll just pretend to be sound asleep as I’m sure daddy must be very tired. The next morning I told mommy what happened and how brave she was to sleep with daddy. She just laughed but didn’t say anything. Did I say something wrong? When I asked mommy what’s wrong she just ignored me. That’s weird.

Anyways I love my family. That’s just some of the happy moments we had together. There’s lots of different things too! Like Friday movie nights and Sunday night outs. You should try it sometime you know. It’s super fun. Mommy says this will have to stop for a while though because… I’ll be moving to America. Yayyyyy! I’m going there alone though, mommy says she and daddy will come a few months later. At the mean time, I’ll stay with Mrs. Tam’s family. I don’t want to leave mommy and daddy but I have to be a big girl now. I want to make mommy happy and proud.

Hop hop away in my backpack and luggage, I went to the United States of America. They should shorten it you know, like how China is only one word. Oops, I sidetracked a little. Anyways, as I was there, I would video call mommy ever single day. Something doesn’t seem right though. Mommy seems thinner and thinner every day. Mommy says it’s because she misses me. I miss her too. She says she can’t come yet because my best best friend, Dr. Chang, wants her to stay in Hong Kong for a little bit. I trust Dr. Chang. She’s very smart.

After 3 months later, I finally get to go back to Hong Kong to see mommy again! I’m so so sooo excited. I packed my favorite chocolates, mommy’s favorite almonds and daddy’s favorite sugar packs. Mommy’s friend Lizy came and pick me up. We flew high up the sky and finally landed at the airport, but we didn’t go back home, which was very weird. Peaking out the taxi window, I saw the sign Prince Edward Hospital. Hm. Is Aunt Lizy sick? I didn’t ask though, she seemed sad.

When we arrived she took me to the fifth floor. Wow, there are so many beds and so so cold. Aunt Lizy should have told me to bring a jacket. As we were walking, Aunt Lizy brought me to a bed where a lady was sleeping in. She has a big big belly but was thin everywhere else, kinda like the skeleton I had during Halloween, but pregnant. She had a tube around her face and many many computers around her making beep beep beep noises. Then, I saw uncle Thomas, aunt Kelly, uncle Ryan, they were all there! Well except for daddy. Nonetheless I was so happy. This is the best day ever!

Aunt Kelly came up to me and told me to say hi to mommy. Mommy is here? Where? She pointed at the lady laying on the bed. That’s mommy? She doesn’t look like mommy. The lady whispers my name. I recognize that sound. THAT REALLY IS MOMMY! What happened to her?

She brings her hand to my face and smiles like she always does. I like her smile. Mommy is very pretty. But before she could say anything, she coughs so hard that her tissue became red. I stood there. I didn’t know what to say. Mommy said that it’s just bad guys in her belly and the doctors in this hospital are fixing her. Bad bad guy. I hate to see mommy sick. My eyes began to water but I told my eyes to stop because I am a big big girl and I have to be strong for mommy.

Not long, the nurses told us to leave because the doctors are coming to fix mommy. So I followed my aunts and uncles out of the room. As we were walking, I heard them talking.

“ She had it coming.” Hmm. I wonder what was coming. Ice cream trucks? Mmm I want that. My tummy is growling.

“I’m not raising anything.” What do they have to carry? Maybe I could help. Don’t underestimate me. I am small but I am strong.

A few minutes went by and finally Aunt Lizy spoke to me.

“Hey little one. I know you haven’t met daddy before but he really loves you. We called him and he wants to take you back home. Are you happy?”

“Silly Aunt Lizy. I have met daddy before. I lived with him too.”

“No, not that daddy. Your real daddy.”

“Oh.”

There he was. A tall tall man standing at the entrance of the hospital, a bit scary. It’s going to be alright though. After the doctors fix mommy, mommy can leave the hospital. We would be a happy family again with Friday movie nights and Sunday nights out with Daddy, second Daddy.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/x2iut1j97yas0erl', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.76456666666667, 'ai': 0.23543333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I love my family.

Nonetheless I was so happy. This is the best day ever!\n\nAunt Kelly came up to me and told me to say hi to mommy. Mommy is here? Where? She pointed at the lady laying on the bed. That’s mommy? She doesn’t look like mommy. The lady whispers my name. I recognize that sound. THAT REALLY IS MOMMY! What happened to her?\n\nShe brings her hand to my face and smiles like she always does. I like her smile. Mommy is very pretty. But before she could say anything, she coughs so hard that her tissue became red. I stood there. I didn’t know what to say. Mommy said that it’s just bad guys in her belly and the doctors in this hospital are fixing her. Bad bad guy. I hate to see mommy sick. My eyes began to water but I told my eyes to stop because I am a big big girl and I have to be strong for mommy.\n\nNot long, the nurses told us to leave because the doctors are coming to fix mommy. So I followed my aunts and uncles out of the room. As we were walking, I heard them talking.\n\n“ She had it coming.” Hmm. I wonder what was coming. Ice cream trucks? Mmm I want that. My tummy is growling.\n\n“I’m not raising anything.” What do they have to carry? Maybe I could help. Don’t underestimate me. I am small but I am strong.\n\nA few minutes went by and finally Aunt Lizy spoke to me.\n\n“Hey little one. I know you haven’t met daddy before but he really loves you. We called him and he wants to take you back home. Are you happy?”\n\n“Silly Aunt Lizy. I have met daddy before. I lived with him too.”\n\n“No, not that daddy. Your real daddy.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nThere he was. A tall tall man standing at the entrance of the hospital, a bit scary. It’s going to be alright though. After the doctors fix mommy, mommy can leave the hospital. We would be a happy family again with Friday movie nights and Sunday nights out with Daddy, second Daddy.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.76456666666667
Justin Franco,6y,What is zeugma in poetry?,"Zeugma is a fun little way to turn phrases and heads in your writing.

See? I just used one, and you didn’t even notice…and yet, you did. As a figurative technique, zeugma largely goes unnoticed, but it’s effective in creating dramatic and comedic contrasts.

To create zeugma, a writer takes a word that can have multiple meanings and connects a single instance of that word to two or more parts of a sentence to exploit those meanings separately.

That definition was confusing, so we’ll clear it up with examples!

He took his hat and his leave.

This sentence uses multiple meanings of the word took. “He took his hat” means he literally put his hands on his hat and carried it off with him. “He took his leave” means he walked out. The writer combines these two meanings with one use of the word took. It’s intentionally a bit jarring when you read it at first, but that’s the intent of zeugma—to force your brain to pause and reevaluate the meaning of the sentence.

You could put the multiple meaning word at the end of the phrase too, as we see in Dolly Parton’s rendition of “The House of the Rising Sun”:

…a house they call the rising sun, where love and money are made.

This zeugma uses the figurative meanings of “making money” (earning it) and “making love” (sexual intercourse) to create the effect.

You can see more examples on the Wikipedia page
 for the device.

You may note that the definition of zeugma is a bit flexible depending on how it’s analyzed, but I’ve always considered the “take his hat and his leave” example as the purest definition of its poetic use.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/us2mig9nezj0wxky', 'title': 'What is zeugma in poetry?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Zeugma is a fun little way to turn phrases and heads in your writing.\n\nSee?

Alex Johnston,5y,"Can the British read ancient English nowadays, like Shakespeare's poems?","Shakespeare’s poems aren’t in ‘ancient English’.

‘Ancient English’ looks like this:

Those are the opening lines of Beowulf, the most famous poem in Old English, which was probably written between 975 and 1025. Here’s a translation, taken from http://www.heorot.dk/beowulf-rede-text.html

Listen! We --of the Spear-Danes in the days of yore,

of those clan-kings-- heard of their glory.

how those nobles performed courageous deeds.

Often Scyld, Scef's son, from enemy hosts

from many peoples seized mead-benches;

and terrorised the fearsome Heruli after first he was

found helpless and destitute, he then knew recompense for that:-

he waxed under the clouds, throve in honours,

until to him each of the bordering tribes

beyond the whale-road had to submit,

and yield tribute:- that was a good king.

No native English speaker in Britain can automatically understand Old English. Grammatically speaking it has more in common with modern German than it has with modern English, and as you can see, it has a different vocabulary. But Shakespeare’s works are written in modern English. It’s just a more complex version of modern English than some people are used to.

It was also spelled a bit differently in the earliest editions. Here’s the opening of Shakespeare’s Hamlet as it was printed in the First Folio edition, which came out a few years after Shakespeare’s death:

THE TRAGEDIE OF HAMLET, Prince of Denmarke.

Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.

Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels.

Barnardo. Who's there?

Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold your selfe.

Bar. Long liue the King.

Fran. Barnardo?

Bar. He.

Fran. You come most carefully vpon your houre.

Bar. 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco.

Fran. For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold, And I am sicke at heart.

Barn. Haue you had quiet Guard?

Fran. Not a Mouse stirring.

Nishi Uppuluri,5y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Dear Diary,

Yesterday, Mommy told me that we are getting… I forgot the word. I think it started with an e. Or a u. Or an i. Sometimes those letters sound the same.

Anyway, Mommy said that that meant that we couldn’t live in our house anymore. She said that we have to live in our car. I don’t like our car. It’s old. And it’s small. And it smells stinky!

I told Mommy that I don’t want to live in her car, but she said we have to. She said that I can only bring my teddy bear named Thomas and a bag of clothes. And a blanket. She said it would be like camping. But I don’t think so.

I asked her why we have to live in the car, and she mumbled “because of your f***ing father who hasn’t payed child support in years.” I don’t know what that means.

Dear Diary,

Sometimes I notice my Mommy taking out a bag of powdered sugar out of her purse. I always ask her if I could have some, but she says no, it’s adult sugar. She then sniffs it, and I ask if I can sniff it too, but then she gets mad and yells at me that’s it’s not meant for kids. After she sniffs the adult sugar, her face turns red, and she gets even more angry.

These days, she sniffs even more sugar. I don’t understand why she doesn’t just eat it, or better yet, bake with it. I ask her to make some frosting with this sugar, and she says no, because we are broke. But if we are broke, then how come she always goes to the groceries to get more sugar? I don’t know.

I don’t like adult sugar.

Dear Diary,

At school today, my friend asked me why my hair was greasy. I wanted to tell her that I couldn’t take a shower because I was living in a car, but mommy told me not to tell anyone this. So I told my friend that I’m not very good at washing my hair. And then she said “ask your mom to do it for you.” I said okay. My friend won’t remember this anyways.

Dear Diary,

I’m so hungry all the time. I can’t eat because Mommy said that food is too ‘spensive and we’re broke. But I don’t care! I’m hungry!

Two days ago, I was so hungry, that I desided to try some of mommy’s adult sugar. It wasn’t fair that she didn't share it with me just because I’m a kid. I found the bag in Mommy’s purse when she went outside the car for a trip to the groceries to buy more adult sugar.

I took a taste of the sugar. And everything went black.

Dear Diary,

When I woke up this morning, I was in the hospital I think. There were tubes from my hands and beeping machines. My hed and stomac hurt hurt hurt!

A few minutes later, a lady with a white coat and hat come in. “I see you’re awake”, she says. She then walks out of the room again.

A police man enters a little later. He asks me qweshuns about my Mommy and where we live. I tell him that I live in a house and that Mommy buys a lot of adult sugar. He shakes his head. I ask him why he’s there. He shakes his head again.

The lady with the white coat and hat lets me get up two hours later. I try to find Mommy, but the police man from erliar grabs me by the wrist, and takes me to his police car.

He drives me to a place with a bunch of other kids in it.

“Where is mommy? “, I ask, once we get there.

Mom is very sad. 4 the past five days she has staid in her room and wont come out! when im hungry she says 2 eat whats in the pantree but we are runnin low on food and she will have to get grosheries soon. i am worried about mom becas shes never hidden from me like this before! i want to cry and cry and see if that will make her get out

yesterday 1 of the neihburs asked me if i had a mom and i laughed becas it was a funny joke! i said my mom is sad and resting thats y the neigbor had not seen her. the neighbor did not find it very funny and just kinda pursed his lips like

:l but with a frown too.

he said to tell him if my mom did not come out of her room soon, or if any more men came to visit.

4/21/18

that night thes woman showed up and talked to mom, who had 2 come out of her room for the 1st time in a while! mom was crying tho, so it wasnt happy. she sobbed a bit and hugged me. right now i am in the car of the nice lady.

Dear Dia,

It's my birthday today. When Daddy came, he gave me a cupcake. Daddy never smiles, but he didn’t look mean today. I shared my cupcake with Mamy after we ate our beans. Daddy gave Mamy a book. Mamy gave it to me and said I can write to you when I am lonely.

Mamy said your name is Die-a-ree, but I think Dia is a prettier name. Do you like it?

. . . . .

Entry #56

Dear Dia,

I fell in the shower today. I yelled very loud and Mamy came running. She looked scared. My wrist hurts bad. I cried but I stopped when Mamy cried.

Mamy yelled at Daddy when he came today. The last time Mamy got mad was a long time ago. Daddy didn’t hit Mamy like last time. She told Daddy my left wrist broke and that I’m sick. My wrist is still on my arm so I don’t think it broke. And I don’t feel sick like when I have a cold.

Mamy put a towel around and around my wrist and said don’t move it. I don’t move it anyways cos it hurts.

Before Daddy locked the door today, he said he’ll bring milk. Mamy said I had milk before but I don’t remember.

. . . . .

Entry #58

Dear Dia,

Daddy gave Mamy milk today. When Daddy left, Mamy gave me milk in my bear mug. It’s yummy! Mamy said it’ll make me big and strong and I won’t break anymore.

I asked Mamy today where Daddy goes when he leaves, and she said upstairs to work. I asked Mamy why Daddy doesn’t live down here with us like the Daddies in the TV. Mamy said he’s too busy. I asked Mamy if we can see upstairs. Mamy said yes, we can see upstairs soon. Mamy looked sad.

. . . . .

Entry #82

Dear Dia,

I got Mamy in trouble. I didn’t hear a click today when Daddy left. When Mamy was sleeping, I opened the door. There was tall stairs after the door, and I went up. There was another door at the top. I tried to open it, but it didn’t open. I tried and tried and it opened!

Daddy was standing there and his face was red. He took my arm and took me back downstairs. Daddy yelled at Mamy and said I was dirty and sneaky. Daddy came to hit me, but when I closed my eyes, I didn’t feel anything. Daddy was hitting Mamy when I opened my eyes. I cried to Daddy. I told him I was sorry.

When Daddy left this time, I heard the click. Dia, I just wanted to see upstairs.

. . . . .

Entry #126

Dear Dia,

Mamy said I don’t have to wear the towel on my wrist now. There’s a funny bump on the wrist, but it doesn’t hurt anymore. We saw animals in the jungle and fish in the ocean on TV today. Mamy said she’ll take me to see fish after we go upstairs.

. . . . .

Entry #193

Dear Dia,

I saw a lady with pretty silver and red hair on TV. Mamy turned the TV so it talks low like always. The lady in the TV was sad. Mamy said the lady is my grandma. Mamy cried when grandma talked in the TV. I asked Mamy why grandma doesn’t come see us like Daddy. Mamy said Grandma can’t find us cos we’re lost.

Silly Mamy. How can we be lost if we’re here?

. . . . .

Entry #287

Dear Dia,

We went upstairs today! When Daddy left, I didn’t hear a click. Daddy was mad last time so I didn’t open the door. After lunch, Mamy said we are going upstairs. She held my hand and opened the door and we went up together. At the top, Mamy tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t open. I thought we have to go back down but Mamy yelled and knocked. I said to Mamy we’re not supposed to yell.

A lady opened the door. She has silver in her hair like Grandma but she isn’t Grandma. Mamy and the lady talked and let me see upstairs. Dia, there are so many pretty things upstairs! Just like in the TV!

I heard a bell and the lady opened the door. Police came inside and talked to Mamy and the lady.

The lady gave us soup and samwiches. The soup was tomato and the samwich was turkey. It was good. We are sleeping upstairs, but I don’t see Daddy. Mamy said Daddy’s going to be away for some time.

. . . . .

Entry #301

Dear Dia,

We saw Grandma today. She is even prettier in person and she didn’t look sad like in the TV. Grandma and Mamy cried even though Mamy says she is happy. We are sleeping in Grandma’s house and Mamy says we are staying here.

When are we going to see Daddy?

I don’t know why. She is usually really happy! I wanted to make her happy, so I gave her a drawing of a butterfly. She said she got happier, but I heard her crying again. I can’t believe that the butterfly didn’t make her happier!

Yesterday, when it happened again, I made her a bigger butterfly! I thought that if the butterfly was bigger and happier, it would make her happier too! I gave it to her, but she still wasn’t happy. If only the butterfly would work…

Today, I didn’t notice her being sad. I was too busy drawing my own butterfly. I really like butterflies!

Later, I heard Mommy and Daddy crying in my sister’s bedroom. My butterfly wasn’t finished, but when it got finished, it would be the biggest and happiest butterfly in the world! I was going to give it to them once I finished it.

After I finished the butterfly I brought it to Mommy. She was still crying! I guess she really needed the happy butterfly. I gave it to her, and she told me to sit down with her. She said, “Robert, I… I have to tell you something.” I wanted her to be happy, so I listened! “Robert, your sister… she’s, well, she had to go away. She had to go away to a happy place.

Jerrica Coyle,4y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Mommy is so pretty, like a princess from my favorite movies!

We watch those movies all the time, mommy likes them too. Daddy used to like those movies, but then Daddy went away. I was a very little baby when Daddy went away, but Mommy says he loved us very much and he didn’t want to go. Mommy says he lives with God now just like Grandma and Grandpa, but I think he went to live with God too early.

Grandma and Grandpa were old when they went to live with God. Daddy wasn’t old. He didn’t even have any grey hair or anything. He’s always very happy in the pictures Mommy shows me. She says I am just like him, we have the same eyes and the same smile. I wish Mommy would smile like she does in her pictures with Daddy. I give Mommy big hugs because she gives me big hugs when I am sad, but I guess grown up sad is stronger than hugs.

Daddy had an accident with a big, big truck. That’s why he went to live with God. Uncle Jimmy told me when I asked why Daddy went there. I love Uncle Jimmy. He takes me to get ice cream and he lets me pick the songs in the car! He even lets me play the game where you pop balloons on his phone. He says that Mommy needs time to be alone sometimes because she misses Daddy very much. Uncle Jimmy says Mommy started to see a special doctor who helps people not be so sad anymore.

Mommy says she the special doctor gave her medicine so that she will be able to miss Daddy, but not be so sad. I hope the special medicine makes her feel better and that she will smile and look pretty like a princess again.

Mommy tells everyone that the doctor is helping her. She sure does smile a lot now. We watch princess movies and we go to the beach. Mommy collects shells with me. We see Uncle Jimmy a lot too. Mommy gives him a lot of my clothes so that they will be at his house when I sleep over. She gives me a pretty necklace that Daddy gave to her. It is so sparkly and pretty. She puts it around my neck after she puts me to bed. I tell her I love her, and she starts to cry just a little bit before she smiles and says she loves me too.

Mommy says that bathroom time is private time, but I really need to go. I knock on the door but Mommy doesn’t say anything. I can’t hold it anymore.

Mommy is in the tub, but she forgot to take off all her clothes. Her hair floats just like the Little Mermaid, but Mommy’s hair is brown and not red like the mermaid’s hair is. I tell her that I am sorry, but she doesn’t say anything. She is sleeping. I step on something tiny and white on the floor. It’s some of her special medicine. The bottle is next to the tub.

Uncle Jimmy comes with hospital people and a policeman. They bang on the door real loud. I tell them that Mommy is sleeping, but they go in the bathroom anyway. The hospital people take Mommy away with all kinds of wires sticking out of her. They put a scary looking mask on her face. The policeman wraps me up in a soft blue blanket. Uncle Jimmy gives me big hugs and tells me we are going to have a sleepover at his house.

The policeman tells Uncle Jimmy that he did a good job. They tell him if it had waited another ten minutes it would have been too late. I don’t know what he did a good job on, or what he was late for. I ask where Mommy went. Uncle Jimmy says Mommy got sick in the tub, and that I will stay with him until she gets better.

Mommy just closed the bathroom door and told me to go to my room. I do what Mommy says, because Daddy didn’t, and now Daddy isn’t here anymore. Maybe Mommy sent him to his room and he didn’t listen.

There’s a police car outside! I can watch it from my window. The red and blue light on top is flashing, and the doors are opening. Men with belts covered in guns are walking up to our door. Mommy doesn’t like visitors.

Veronique Helmridge-Marsillian,3y,Why are there so many dark nursery rhymes?,"Censorship—when you are not allowed to call out the ruling class, you have to call it out through “nonsense” rhymes.
And these have survived as little songs or poems told to children.

See here, this is how you were treated in England in 1569 (under Queen Elizabeth I) if you had no job, no food, no shoes, and your clothes full of holes.[1]
Anyone who objects to his taxes going on welfare should have a good look.

A nobleman is tossing a coin at a beggar. The beggar stinks—he makes the nobleman feel bad—so the nobleman turns his nose and eyes away as he hurries past.
The nobleman does not know whether, round the back of the house, the beggar’s mates are not about to ambush him and his purse… so he clutches the pommel of his sword.
(This is an engraving from a drawing, so the image, hence the action, is reversed.)

Okay, now you have now seen a real beggar.
But there were other beggars—the ruling class itself.
Did you notice how the beggar and nobleman looked similar?

What kind of begging did the ruling class do?
Well, 50 years later (under King James I), they would tell Parliament to tell the King to tell the middle and lower classes to pay taxes!
Import duties, export duties, taxes on livestock and produce, you name it, the lower classes paid it.
As a result of which, the top noblemen looked like this.[2]

George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, painted by Rubens, 1625.

The Duke of Buckingham was one of King James’s “favourites”—I say, favourites—all beautiful youths—there were many of them,
and they poured into England from Scotland when Scottish James took the throne in 1603.[3]

Obviously, you weren’t allowed to say anything. Especially if you were lower class.
So you wrote a song:

Hark, hark, the dogs do bark,
Beggars are coming to town.
Some in rags,
Some in jags,
And some in velvet gowns.

(A “jag” is a jagged cut in a velvet surcoat, revealing the fine lawn shirt beneath.)

If you were really bold, you might even sing this song—loudly, raucously, mockingly—as some Duke or Count or Marquess swept past you in the street.

And, because rich beggars have continued until the present day,
so has this rhyme.

Sonya Naima,5y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","Mommy said to not worry. I heard a weird scream while I was playing with Mr. Elephant and I ran to her. She had these weird marks on her hand. Like a zebra. I like zebras. But Mommy looked like a red zebra instead of a black and white one. Does she want to be a zebra? I go to bed and have a good dream about zebras. Maybe I’ll become a zebra soon, maybe when I’m as old as Mommy.

Daddy comes home really early today. He starts yelling at Mommy when he notices her zebra marks. I don’t think Daddy likes zebras. Mommy started crying and she left to the other room. She dropped a weird stick thing. She was using it yesterday to turn into a zebra. I wonder…

Slice.

Ouch. I didn’t know becoming a zebra would hurt so much. Does it hurt Mommy too? I hide the stick thing and go to bed.

Mommy found a new stick thing. I remember how much it hurt me and I try to take it from her, even though Daddy told me not to steal. Mommy just smiles. Why would she smile? Is becoming a zebra really worth it? I’m confused. Mommy gives me a long note for Daddy and leaves me home alone. I leave it at the front door for Daddy to read and I take a nap.

I wake up. Daddy looks at me with tears in his eyes. He’s holding the note. Did Mommy write something mean? I wish I could read… I take the note and tear it apart with the stick thing I hid awhile ago. Maybe Daddy will feel better? I show the tiny pieces of paper to Daddy to see if he feels better. He just smiles at me, like Mommy did. He’s crying too. I’m still confused. He gives me a hug.

“I’m so glad…”

“Why, Daddy?”

“At least I still have you.”

I’m six.

I didn’t have a birthday party bekus of mommy.

She kept on drinking water. A lot of water. I kept telling her to stop drinking water, but she wouldn't listen to me. I don’t know why.

On my birthday, daddy came to mommy’s house to take me. I don’t no why they don’t live together.

When he came in, mommy was drinking colored water with bubbles in it and daddy started yelling. I told him to stop because mommy was going to hit him like she hits me and I don’t want daddy to get hurt.

Daddy looked down at me and started crying. I felt reely bad bekus I yelled at daddy, and I told him I’m sorry.

But he didn’t listen, he kept on telling ME he was sorry bekus he “left me here”.

I don’t get it.

He went to the kitshun where mommy was.

“Mommy, daddy doesn’t want you to drink water, so can you stop plea-” I herd plates crashing, like my toy trucks.

And then it was quiet.

“Daddy? Mommy?”

Daddy came running to me. Mommy came with more colored water. I told her I liked her bubbles, and she got mad. I put my arm on top of my head, bekus that’s where she always hits me. And it hurts, even when I say stop.

Daddy picked me up and ran to his car. He put me in the back but forgot the seat belt. “Daddy!” I started lafing. “You forgot my sea-” “SHHH” he told me, so I stayed quiet.
We were driving but daddy was driving fast. I like it when he drives fast but this was scary. I didn't like it.

He looked in the mirror at me and asked me how mommy hits me. I told him with her colored water bottles. “They’re hard and it hurts” I told him.

He started crying again. “No no, daddy, I’m sorry, never mind it doesn't hurt”. And then he cried even more. It made me sad.

“Where are we going?”, I asked.

But why is he going to a lake? And into the water? “Daddy, stop” but he didn’t stop. He kept going and going and going but then I don’t rememember anything.

I woke up in the hopsital, and the pohleese was there. They told me daddy is gone and im living with someone else.

I see grandma next to me. And she’s crying.

Now they’re yelling at each other because I don’t fit in and my black sneakers will make it worse.

I wish I didn’t get black sneakers. I hate it when they fight. Daddy gets really scary sometimes. But that’s good, because if he’s angry that means he isn’t smoking drugs.

They’re mad because I don’t have friends at school. But I have a kitty and my flowers outside. I water them every day and I imagine them talking to me. Sometimes I sit in a bush so my sister can’t find me. It’s quiet and peaceful.

Alex Johnston,2y,Does rap (musical genre) actually stand for “rhythm and poetry”?,"No. This is what’s called a backronym, where people take existing words and assume that they must be acronyms of previously existing phrases.

The most well-known examples of backronyms are ‘For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge’ and ‘Fornication Under Consent [of the] King’, both of which are erroneously claimed to be the origins of the word ‘fuck’. ‘Fuck’ is a much older word which can be traced back to the medieval period.

‘Rap’ used in reference to speech is actually much older than it looks.

The OED has five definitions of ‘rap’
 used in reference to the act of speaking. Who knew that Thomas Wyatt in 1541 was such a homeboy:

I am wonte some tyme to rappe owte an othe in an erneste tawlke.

Henry Fielding in 1742 had this:

Adams then rapt out a hundred Greek Verses.

Here, ‘rap’ meant to speak sharply or vigorously.

Later, it came to mean talking generally. Here’s F.H. Tillotson in 1909, in the intriguingly titled How To Be a Detective:

‘Rap’ means to speak. If you ‘rap’ to a man you speak to him or recognize him.

And Damon Runyon in 1929:

I wish Moosh a hello, and he never raps to me but only bows, and takes my hat.

And Eldridge Cleaver writing in 1965:

In point of fact he is funny and very glib, and I dig rapping (talking) with him.

By 1979, however, it’s come to mean the practice of talking over a beat or speaking rhythmically in the style we associate with rap. Cf. the Sugarhill Gang in 1979’s ‘Rapper’s Delight’:

I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat.

So, as we can see, ‘rap’ has been used to mean a style of speaking for five centuries.

But only in the last five decades has it come to mean a particular form of speech associated with the music known as hip-hop.

It does not ‘stand for’ anything.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8iox3r7yp6heafm5', 'title': 'Does rap (musical genre) actually stand for “rhythm and poetry”?', 'score': {'original': 0.998, 'ai': 0.002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""No. This is what’s called a backronym, where people take existing words and assume that they must be acronyms of previously existing phrases.\n\nThe most well-known examples of backronyms are ‘For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge’ and ‘Fornication Under Consent [of the] King’, both of which are erroneously claimed to be the origins of the word ‘fuck’. ‘Fuck’ is a much older word which can be traced back to the medieval period.\n\n‘Rap’ used in reference to speech is actually much older than it looks.\n\nThe OED has five definitions of ‘rap’\n used in reference to the act of speaking.

If you ‘rap’ to a man you speak to him or recognize him.\n\nAnd Damon Runyon in 1929:\n\nI wish Moosh a hello, and he never raps to me but only bows, and takes my hat.\n\nAnd Eldridge Cleaver writing in 1965:\n\nIn point of fact he is funny and very glib, and I dig rapping (talking) with him.\n\nBy 1979, however, it’s come to mean the practice of talking over a beat or speaking rhythmically in the style we associate with rap. Cf. the Sugarhill Gang in 1979’s ‘Rapper’s Delight’:\n\nI'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat.\n\nSo, as we can see, ‘rap’ has been used to mean a style of speaking for five centuries.\n\nBut only in the last five decades has it come to mean a particular form of speech associated with the music known as hip-hop.\n\nIt does not ‘stand for’ anything."", 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.998
Prashant Tiwari,Updated 3y,Which is a must-read poem by Sadhguru?,"Anyone even slightly acquainted with Sadhguru knows what mischief he can pack in a verse and what profoundness he can effortlessly deliver through poetry.

Here are some of my favorite Sadhguru poems:

On the Glory of ‘Kailash’

2. On ‘Mukthi’, or the Ultimate Liberation, the highest goal :

3. On the possibilities of a life ‘Unformed’ :

4. Mystical Depths of ’Manasarovar’

5. We experience life ‘Here- Yes Here’ :

Sadhguru has countless more witty, pragmatic as well as profound poetry.

However, For Must read, my money is on: ‘Be or Busy’

Its so poignant as it talks of Sadhguru leaving. I cried when I heard it the first time. The mere thought of it sends shivers down my spine. Yet, this poem hurries me up to prepare myself, for when he ‘sings his last song’.

Who knew just four lines of verse and a couplet would have such capability to stir a soul.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mjoz0rx6ylfidcnp', 'title': 'Which is a must-read poem by Sadhguru?', 'score': {'original': 0.9992, 'ai': 0.0008}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Anyone even slightly acquainted with Sadhguru knows what mischief he can pack in a verse and what profoundness he can effortlessly deliver through poetry.\n\nHere are some of my favorite Sadhguru poems:\n\nOn the Glory of ‘Kailash’\n\n2.

Dear diary,

Today's my birthday! I'm now six years old. Mommy forgot to greet me again this year. Silly mommy. But our maid, Anna, made me breakfast of waffles with a candle on top! Yum, I love waffles! I like them with chocolate syrup but we only had strawberry so Anna ran to the grocer's to get some. She must be super tired 'cause our unit's on the top floor and maids aren't allowed in the elevator.

Anna gave me a gift! It was a pink stuffed elephant. I like elephants. We went to Bali last summer and there were big elephants there. I think I'm gonna name her Ellie. Ellie the Elephant.

Anna drove me to school and I played tag with my friends before class started. I got a boo-boo on my knee when I fell. My teacher made the class sing happy birthday to me and she brought out a cupcake with a candle on top. I blew the candle and shared it with my classmates but I got sad 'cause the purple frosting got on my uniform's jacket. I think Anna calls it a blazer.

When I got home, I tried to make a bowl of cereal on my own 'cause Anna was busy washing the frosting off my blazer. Mommy saw me and started yelling at me because I spilled the milk on the counter. She yelled that it was expensive marble and that brats like me shouldn't do things on our own. I told her I was sorry but she got more mad and she punched my nose and my mouth and my eye.

Mommy pulled on my hair until clumps of it came off. I cried and cried and cried but mommy got more angry and put a lot of salt on the ground and made me kneel on it. It hurt a lot because of my boo-boo but I tried my best not to cry. Anna saw what mommy was doing and got angry. Anna told mommy she'll call the police but mommy hit her and told her that if she ever calls the police, mommy will tell the police that she was the one who hit me.

Then, someone knocked on the door. We have a visitor! Mommy opened the door and a man i don't know came in. The clothes he was wearing looked like what my daddy wears. A white shirt. A tie. A blazer. A pair of black pants. Mommy told Anna to take me to bed. She gave the weird man a grown-up juice. I know it's grown-up juice 'cause it's colorful and has a teeny tiny umbrella on it. I'm not supposed to drink it, but I smelled it once, and it smelled funny. They went to mommy and daddy's room and mommy told me that she'll hit me again if I tell daddy about her friend.

That night, Anna tucked me to bed with Ellie. She was crying a bit but I told that I'm sorry but she told me it wasn't my fault.

But mommy got angry at Anna cause of me. It's my fault.

Dear diary,

Daddy came home today! He didn't ask about the purple marks on my face but he did smell like mommy's grown up drink. I don't care, though. He gave me an iPad and greeted me Happy Birthday. He told me he was doing business stuff yesterday so he couldn't come.

After school, dad picked me up and took me to his condo! It wasn't very far from mommy's and it was the top floor too. There was a nice lady there. Her lips were red and her clothes were tight. I told her maybe she needs to get a bigger size of clothes and she laughed. She told me her name was Lucy and she braided my hair.

When daddy saw me and Lucy talking, he gave me a box of chocolates and told me he'll give me more if I don't tell mommy about Lucy. I like daddy a lot.

Lucy downloaded games on my iPad and we played this funny game with cats and dogs. She helped me with my homework and gave me chocolate ice cream. Lucy’s so cool. She’s like Anna and mommy (when mommy’s not angry) together.

Daddy and Lucy order a pizza. Lucy taught me how to eat pizza with a knife and fork. The knife and fork were kinda heavy and it was hard and daddy laughed and told me to just eat with my hand.

Daddy and Lucy tucked me to bed and I told Lucy I like her better than my mommy. She laughed again and told me that maybe one day. Daddy kissed my forehead good night.

Dear diary,

Daddy woke me up early and he smelled like mommy's grown-up juice again. Lucy was gone. Daddy told me she went back home.

Daddy drove me to mommy's condo on his purple car. It only had two doors and it went fast! We swerved a lot and I got a little bit dizzy but I'm okay now.

When we went to mommy's unit, the weird man from a couple days ago was there. Daddy got angry and he went to their room and mommy was there with another man. They had a sleepover! I love sleepovers!

Daddy started yelling at mommy and called her bad words and something that starts with the letter W. Then, mommy got angry and yelled at daddy too, and told him that she knows about Lucy too and that she just didn't say anything 'cause he pays her money to take care of me. Then they started throwing things and I cried and I tried to separate them so they won't fight and daddy punched me.

Everything looks wet 'cause of my tears but I can see Anna trying to stop daddy but mommy slapped her. His punches are worse than mommy's and they hurt more and I'm crying and crying and mommy started kicking me and it hurts so bad and I'm seeing stars and I'm just begging them to stop to please stop mommy daddy please don't someone help me someone please help me I'm sorry mommy I'm sorry daddy I thought you weren’t like mommy please stop please it hurts so bad pl","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/6wafibsg9q7xdhnv', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.49046666666667, 'ai': 0.50953333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""March 14, 2019\n\nDear diary,\n\nToday's my birthday!

Sometimes I listen too. Sometimes we listen to fun music, but usually we listen to the news. I was showing Mommy the pretty red leaf I found for school for show and tell but Mommy was just quiet.

“I’m sorry honey but I need to listen to the radio right now.”

Grown-ups do that a lot and they always are listening to boring grown-ups talk about big things. When they listen they get really quiet and their eyebrows get real close and they look mad. But Mommy wasn’t real mad quiet.

“Mommy, why are you sad?”

Mommy was still quiet. She parked at a Dunkin Donuts and I don’t know why because then I would be late for school and I couldn’t show my red leaf to Sarah and Liam and Samantha. But we were at Dunkin Donuts and Mommy always ordered a French vanilla latte with two sugars and one cream. I asked her if she wanted one but she shook her head.

“No, honey. You get yourself some Munchkins.”

She handed me a whole $5 bill and there were a bunch of red and yellow and orange leaves in the parking lot so I got some and put them in my pockets. A nice lady held the door open for me because I guess she wanted a French vanilla latte with two sugars and one cream because coffee is a grown-up drink. But the nice lady was quiet too and she was watching the TV in the store. So was the boy at the cash register. So was the grumpy man who pushed his eyebrows down and frowned. He was mad quiet.

I looked at the TV. I didn’t know what was on the TV. It looked like really tall buildings to me so it had to be the city. But there was a building and it was on fire. I don’t like fire. It’s scary. There were clouds of black smoke and I listened to the news.

“…hundreds estimated dead…”

I don’t know what “estimated” is but I know that hundreds is a lot because I can count to a hundred because I’m good at math. And I know what dead is because last year my dog died and grandpa also died.

I ran out to the car because the word dead makes Mommy quiet sad and I don’t like that. Mommy was crying when I saw her. The radio was quiet.

“Sweetie, your Daddy isn’t going to be home tonight.”

“Why not? Where’s he gone?”

Mommy cried harder now. Louder.

“He’s in heaven now. I’m so sorry.”

It was quiet in the parking lot of the Dunkin Donuts that morning in early fall when I gathered my red and yellow and orange leaves.

When they listen they get really quiet and their eyebrows get real close and they look mad. But Mommy wasn’t real mad quiet.\n\n“Mommy, why are you sad?”\n\nMommy was still quiet. She parked at a Dunkin Donuts and I don’t know why because then I would be late for school and I couldn’t show my red leaf to Sarah and Liam and Samantha. But we were at Dunkin Donuts and Mommy always ordered a French vanilla latte with two sugars and one cream. I asked her if she wanted one but she shook her head.\n\n“No, honey. You get yourself some Munchkins.”\n\nShe handed me a whole $5 bill and there were a bunch of red and yellow and orange leaves in the parking lot so I got some and put them in my pockets. A nice lady held the door open for me because I guess she wanted a French vanilla latte with two sugars and one cream because coffee is a grown-up drink. But the nice lady was quiet too and she was watching the TV in the store. So was the boy at the cash register. So was the grumpy man who pushed his eyebrows down and frowned. He was mad quiet.\n\nI looked at the TV. I didn’t know what was on the TV. It looked like really tall buildings to me so it had to be the city. But there was a building and it was on fire. I don’t like fire. It’s scary. There were clouds of black smoke and I listened to the news.\n\n“…hundreds estimated dead…”\n\nI don’t know what “estimated” is but I know that hundreds is a lot because I can count to a hundred because I’m good at math. And I know what dead is because last year my dog died and grandpa also died.\n\nI ran out to the car because the word dead makes Mommy quiet sad and I don’t like that. Mommy was crying when I saw her. The radio was quiet.\n\n“Sweetie, your Daddy isn’t going to be home tonight.”\n\n“Why not? Where’s he gone?”\n\nMommy cried harder now. Louder.\n\n“He’s in heaven now. I’m so sorry.”\n\nIt was quiet in the parking lot of the Dunkin Donuts that morning in early fall when I gathered my red and yellow and orange leaves.

Radhika Mundra,8y,Which is the simple but most motivational poem ever?,"'Don't Quit'

When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
When the road you're trudging seems all uphill.
When the funds are low and the debts are high,
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh.
When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.

Life is queer with its twists and turns,
As everyone of us sometimes learns.
And many a fellow turns about,
When he might have won had he stuck it out.
Don’t give up though the pace seems slow,
You may succeed with another blow.

Often the goal is nearer than
It seems to a faint and faltering man.
Often the struggler has given up,
When he might have captured the victor’s cup.
And he learned too late when the night came down,
How close he was to the golden crown.
Success is failure turned inside out,
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt.

And you never can tell how close you are,
It may be near when it seems afar.
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit,
It’s when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.


And that’s worth thinking about.

Wednesday 27th of June

My friend’s mommy is nice. She smells nice and she looks nice. She gives her treats and picks her up after school. She always picks her up in a car. It’s nice.

I like my friend’s mommy more. My mommy doesn’t give me candy and she doesn’t pick me up in a big red car. We walk very far, and my feet hurt so much she has to carry me. If we’re lucky, we get onto a big dirty car with lots of other people. She says it’s called a bus. She never lets me go to my friend’s house.

My friends all go to after school care. They say it’s because their mommy and daddy are working. My mommy never works. She is always home.

I’ve seen other kids, with their new neatly ironed purple and white uniform at the supermarket. I haven’t been to the supermarket. I have seen inside though. It’s very big and with lots of food. Not just yucky toast and weird white powder mommy calls icing sugar. She said to never tell anyone we had icing sugar. It is very special. I’ve tried it, but it doesn’t taste very sweet.

Maybe it’s a grown-up thing, like coffee or beer.

I miss my daddy. Mommy says it’s normal for daddies to disappear sometimes, but my friends’ daddies are always there. Hugh heard Miss R on the phone. He says my daddy is sick and he is in the hospital.

We visited the hospital yesterday. It wasn’t very clean. It didn’t have the white walls or moving beds I saw on the TV. Mommy says this is a special place for sad people. Daddy doesn’t look very sad. Maybe he’s sad because he doesn’t like me. Everyone there looks sad. I don’t like sad.

There is no more food in the cupboard. I’m hungry. Sometimes though, my mommy will bring food. It never lasts for long. I don’t know how she gets the food. She’s taking me to the supermarket today to show me how to get food. She says you don’t need to bring money if you are as smart as her.

My mommy doesn’t look nice or smell nice. She smells yucky, like the icing sugar I found in her bedroom when I was trying to find a pencil. She always has purple spots on her body. Her hair is tangled and messy. I always ask her why she can’t be like the other mommies. She says that she loves me, and that is all that matters. She seems very tired when she says this.

I want a car when I’m older. I want to work when I’m older. I don’t want to eat icing sugar when I’m older. I want to be a good daddy to my kids when I’m older. I don’t want to be like Mommy when I’m older.

Sissy is always sleeping, she's always so tired but I wanna play with her, we never play pirates anymore. I knock on her door and I ask what's wrong she wouldn't answer me, I opened the door myself and jumped on her back, “wake up!” I say, she groans and shoves me off. I ask “what's wrong with you, your sooo boring now” she ignores me, I don't like it, soon daddy comes in and tells me to leave sissy alone and that she's tired from school, and that she needs rest.

2nd month

Sissy is shedding ALOT, like Henry our dog, but she's not fat like Henry or has brown hair like Henry, she has red hair, but it's short now, I don't like it, it makes her look ugly. She doesn't race eat with me anymore at Thanksgiving to get to the pie first, BUT SHE HAS TO EAT.

2 weeks later…

Sissy looks weird, I wish she'd put her hair back on, but she just where's A hat instead.

Sissy takes forever to get down the stairs with her…tank? We have to almost wait an hour to pray grace over our food, I just wanna eat. Sissy pukes all the time…doesn't she know she can swallow her food? I laughed one time I got in BIG TROUBLE I don't know why though, but I had to give her hug I didn't like it she wasn't squishy Sissy she was…

1 year later

It's Sissy’s 17th Birthday she looks so sad, why is she crying, why is there no cake, why is everyone so…

4 months later

I hear Sissy on the phone next door I hear her saying “but I'm getting better, that's not fair” so I walked to her door and knock “yes” I hear her say in a sad voice “ can I pleasssee come in” she tells me to come in, I am so happy I hop right on her lap. She gasps in pain but grins at me “why do you have these”I point at her…I don't know clear nose thingy…? She tells me its for her to breathe I tell her you don't need to use those you have a nose like me. She laughs, for the first time in a really long time Sissy laughs, she tells me I should go back to sleep, I sleep with Sissy she's not as warm as she used to be…

2 months later

I sit in mommy's lap and watch Sissy sleep in the hotbital bed Sissy's getting…sirjury,I keep hearing a beep sound its so loud

4 hours later

Mommy leaves me in the room sitting watching Sissy sleep after sirjury…agian…boring. I drink my soda the nice lady that werk at the hotbital give me, I want mommy and daddy but i want mommy NOW. I hear a long beep sound its loud it's coming from Sissy, there's a red line and Sissy isn't making a Woosh sound from her machines anymore. the nice lady that gave me the soda takes my hand and I leave the room, what's wrong with Sissy? why is mommy crying? why are they putting things on her chest and screaming numbers?. I'm scared…

1 week later

Sissy looks so pretty, but why is she sleeping in a box. Daddy tells me softly Sissy isn't coming back, I'm an only child now, that I'm little Sissy with no big Sissy, daddy seems a little upset at me, mommy won't talk to me, I want Sissy! I go to Sissy’s room I see I see her bed but no Sissy. I see a box on her dresser it says it's for me, I open it there is a note that says “if I die from cancer I want you to have a the bracelet you keep asking me for. because I love you”. I only understand bracelet and I love you, so I take the bracelet and I wear it guessing I'm supposed to. I get in big Sissy's bed I …feel…lonely.

I'm sorry Sissy, I'm sorry…

Geraldine Cheung,4y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","I don’t know what the policewoman wants.

She says call her Michelle, even though she’s a grownup and Mummy said it’s rude not to call policemen or policewomen officer.

Where is my Mummy? I want to know where Mummy is.

I want to know where Daddy is too. I kept asking Michelle, but she just kept asking me all her questions, and they were all the same. She keeps wanting to know what the man who kicked down our door and walked into our house looked like. And if he had a gun with him. Or a knife.

I don’t think Michelle is very clever, even if she’s a grownup.

She’s outside now talking with the big policeman, and she still didn’t tell me when Mummy and Daddy will come back. She said soon but she’s a liar. It’s not fair. I already answered all her questions.

She’s mean.

I can hear Michelle talking to the big policeman outside. She calls him Dave, she doesn’t say officer. Dave is even older than Michelle, he must be a hundred years old or even maybe a thousand hundred.

What’s she saying?

I don’t understand. She keeps on using big words to sound clever.

Maybe when Daddy comes back I’ll ask him what “suspected homicide” means.

Now Dave’s talking. He’s nearly whispering to Michelle. I think he doesn’t want me to hear what he’s saying. Mummy sometimes does that when she’s on the phone with someone.

Dave says they found the murder weapon on the floor.

Maybe him and Michelle are playing one of those games my big brother Oliver likes playing?

I miss Oliver. He goes to a school in America that teaches grownups how to be doctors. Michelle asked me about him, and she said she’ll phone Oliver to come pick me up. She lied because she still hasn’t phoned him yet and it’s been ages.

Michelle is saying something now. She keeps on talking about the father and the mother. That means Daddy and Mummy, I think.

She said the father was found unconcsious on the couch and he’s in the hospital now.

Michelle’s a liar. She said Daddy would be here soon. What’s unconcious?

Maybe they mean Daddy was pretending to be dead. Sometimes Daddy lies on the couch and sticks out his tongue, and I tickle him until he sneezes and I win. Maybe grownups don’t know how to play dead like Daddy. I should tell Michelle.

Dave is talking now. He’s telling Michelle to be quieter.

I’m going to listen even harder.

Dave says they found the mother upstairs in the same condition as the father.

I don’t understand at all. Now they’re talking about suspects. Daddy said one time that those are people the police think did something wrong.

Michelle is saying Alan Thompson. I know who he is! Daddy likes talking about him with Mummy all the time whenever they talk about when Daddy fired Alan from his shop. Only “fire” is not like proper fire and Daddy sometimes calls him that bastard. Mummy sometimes forgets to tell him to speak quieter.

Dave just said my name. Maybe Michelle is going to come in again and ask me more dumb questions.

No, she didn’t. She’s still outside. She says they have good reason to suspect Thompson. What’s that mean? She says the description matches what they’ve got. She says without a doubt it was him because our guys caught him when he was running away.

Now Dave is calling him that bastard too. He sounds angry. Michelle just sounds upset.

Why aren’t they talking about Oliver? I want my big brother. Where is he?

Michelle is talking about that poor girl. She just blew her nose. Dave is saying something about getting more tissues.

He’s gone. I can hear his feet, he’s really loud.

Maybe when he comes with the tissues Michelle will come back and tell me where Mummy and Daddy are.

Dave is taking ages.

I’m hungry and I’m sleepy. Michelle is still blowing her nose. I don’t know where Dave is. I can’t hear anyone else.

I think they forgot about me.

I want to go home. Why can’t they just take me home?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gs6k1w4zf5n9d8xh', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.6542, 'ai': 0.3458}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I don’t know what the policewoman wants.\n\nShe says call her Michelle, even though she’s a grownup and Mummy said it’s rude not to call policemen or policewomen officer.\n\nWhere is my Mummy?

Ray Williams,4y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","It’s summer! I love the woods behind my house. Those big big trees in the backyard have big big purple berries on them now! Squish they make my fingers pretty!

Mommy likes pretty things, so I run into the kitchen and show her my pretty purple fingers.

Now I am sitting outside on the back porch, wet from my outside shower. I guess Mommy doesn’t think purple is pretty.

My sisters are inside, I can see them coloring through the window. Now Mommy looks happy. She looks at my sister’s drawing of a yellow flower. She’s smiling. I see her say,“Oh pretty!”

My hands are cold from the shower but my face is hot. My eyes feel hot and sore and big. I cover them with my cold fingers. That’s a little better.

I peep through my fingers. There is no house right next to ours. Just tall tall itchy scratchy grass and flowers all over. I like to catch butterflies there sometimes. Maybe there is a butterfly now?

Ah! AH! No, no butterflies, but I see the flowers! Yellow flowers. Mommy thinks yellow flowers are pretty! I should get some for Mommy, then she will smile at me like sister. I can pick so many so many for her! Then she will be happy.

Mommy… Mommy doesn’t like flowers. She only likes picture flowers. Flower flowers get yellow on the white carpet. She yells, the yellow makes her sneeze! I didn’t know yellow can make you sneeze. I’m outside again. I’m wet again.

There’s only one flower left in my hand. Mommy dumped too much water on them. They look like little pieces of yellow paper on the porch.

My sisters are playing dolls on the carpet now. I think they had a hotdog for lunch. Mommy is in the kitchen washing their dishes. She doesn’t look happy.

Daddy walks in from the garage, he’s home! I can come in soon probably. I watch him kiss Mommy’s cheek. My sisters run over and hug him, “How are my pretty girls?” Daddy kisses Mommy again. She smiles and kisses him too. Everyone smiles.

Kisses, Mommy likes kisses!

I can come in a little later, when I’m dry. I get to eat some goldfish and apples. Daddy lets us watch some cartoons before bed. I get a room all to myself because I’m the biggest. My sisters share.

Mommy is in her big bed. Some old man is shouting on the TV. He sounds angry. Maybe he needs a kiss too. Mommy is watching the man, she doesn’t see me come in. Surprise kiss!

MUAH! I give my best kiss on her cheek.

Mommy makes a long big noise, like her tummy hurts, and wipes all of my kiss away with a tissue. She goes into the bathroom and brushes her teeth. Spit spit spit.

She asks why I’m still standing there. It’s bed time. GO. TO. BED.

I guess Mommy only likes Daddy kisses.

Daddy always reads us a story before we sleep. Tonight God is in a garden, with two brothers. They both give God a gift but he only likes one. God doesn’t like what the older brother gives him. So God loves the little brother more. The big brother is the bad brother so he has to go away. Forever.

Daddy finishes the story so I walk to my room. He kisses my sisters goodnight. I can still hear the angry man Mommy is watching on TV. Then he kisses me goodnight. My heart wants to tell Daddy Mommy doesn’t like my gifts either. That Mommy never smiles at me like at my sisters. That Mommy loves them more, like God loves the little brother more in the story. That mommy wants me to go away.

My heart feels too close to my mouth, like a big rock. I can’t tell him again. Again.

I’m like the bad brother in the story,

I won’t tell him.

Daddy leaves the door open a little, so I don’t see the monsters in the window. I can see my sisters’ room across the hall. Their door is open too. But the TV man stops yelling.

Mommy! I can see her, in the hallway! She is kissing us goodnight too! My heart is big and close to my mouth again but now like a big balloon! When she comes in I will say sorry for my purple fingers. Sorry for the yellow sneezing. Sorry. Tomorrow I will be better and make her happy at me. I’ll tell her I pinky promise. I’m so happy I get to say goodnight.

She’s going into my sisters’ room but that’s okay. That’s ok, they can get their kiss first. They whisper and giggle for a few minutes. Oh good oh good. She is happy. I get to say goodnight. My big happy heart balloon gets bigger. It will all be ok. I snuggle into my pillow, waiting for Mommy.

Waiting

waiting…

Mommy?

I hear the angry man in the TV shouting again.

Mommy doesn’t like me.

I… I don’t want to go away.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/04i1flxuj3dgmw5y', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It’s summer!

Sayoni Mitra,9y,What are some of the most badass poems ever?,"Definitely badass from one of my favourite poets, Maya Angelou:

Phenomenal Woman
By Maya Angelou


Source:
153. MAYA ANGELOU: Phenomenal Woman


Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
But when I start to tell them,
They think I'm telling lies.
I say,
It's in the reach of my arms
The span of my hips,
The stride of my step,
The curl of my lips.
I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please,
And to a man,
The fellows stand or
Fall down on their knees.
Then they swarm around me,
A hive of honey bees.
I say,
It's the fire in my eyes,
And the flash of my teeth,
The swing in my waist,
And the joy in my feet.
I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

Men themselves have wondered
What they see in me.
They try so much
But they can't touch
My inner mystery.
When I try to show them
They say they still can't see.
I say,
It's in the arch of my back,
The sun of my smile,
The ride of my breasts,
The grace of my style.
I'm a woman

Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

Now you understand
Just why my head's not bowed.
I don't shout or jump about
Or have to talk real loud.
When you see me passing
It ought to make you proud.
I say,
It's in the click of my heels,
The bend of my hair,
the palm of my hand,
The need of my care,
'Cause I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

Allen Mable,Updated 4y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","*Trigger Warning: mentions of mental illness and suicide*

Daddy always used to take me to the swings whenever we went to play in the park.

After he came home from work, he’d take me by the hand and we’d run to the park. And when I got on the swings, he’d push my back as I swung higher and higher, until the sky looked so close it felt as if I was flying.

When I was over, he’d pat my head with shining eyes, saying “Did you have fun, Emma?” And then, I would always nod and tell him how wonderful it was to feel like I can touch the blue sky.

I loved my daddy, very much.

A few months ago, daddy stopped taking me to the park to play and stayed alone in his room after he came home instead. I missed going to the park with daddy.

I asked mommy why he wouldn’t come out from his room, and she told me that it was because he was really sad.

I wondered if he was playing with his toys in his room, just like how I play with my dolls when I’m sad. So I decided to share my dolls with him so he can be happy again.

When I knocked on daddy’s room, no one answered. I called for daddy many times, but he didn’t say anything.

I gave up on waiting and twisted the doorknob. The room was really quiet and a whole lot messier than when I last saw it. I saw daddy asleep on his bed, so I poked his warm body a couple of times until he woke up.

“Sorry I didn’t realize you wanted to get in the room, my little Emma,” he said quietly. “What’s wrong?”

“I heard from mommy that you’re really sad right now. So I brought you my dolls so you can be happy again!” I proudly showed him the dolls I brought for him— my three favorites, Molly, Daisy and Alex.

“Thank you for the dolls, Emma. I love you,” daddy told me, his eyes shining ever so slightly.

“I love you too, daddy!” I exclaimed, giving him a kiss on his cheek. “And when you’re happy again, will you take me to the park so we can go on the swings?”

“Of course I will, my darling. I’ll take you to the park so we can play on the swings,” daddy promised me.

I loved my daddy, very much.

My daddy still won’t come out from his room. Now, he won’t even go to work and just stays locked up in his room all day.

I asked mommy if daddy was still sad, and she told me he was. I even asked mommy if she would take me to the park instead, but she said no because she had to take care of daddy.

I really missed my daddy. I wanted to see him happy again. So, I decided to bring him even more of my favorite dolls so he can play with them all the time.

I knocked on daddy’s door, but again, there was no answer. Unlike last time, I didn’t call for daddy but just opened the door instead.

The first thing I saw were daddy’s feet. Behind him were my dolls, Molly, Daisy and Alex, lined up perfectly on his bed. When I looked up, I saw that his eyes weren’t shining anymore — it stared blankly towards the wall instead. His neck had gotten really long, and it looked like he had made his own personal swing inside his room.

I wished he took me to the park and let me go play on the swings instead of him playing by himself.

Mommy came behind me and I heard her gasp, the way she always does when something’s wrong.

“Daddy went to play on the swings without me,” I pouted, hugging the dolls I had brought for him tightly.

With her phone in one hand and tears in her eyes, mommy replied, “Emma darling, he went to the park in heaven. Let’s go downstairs and wait until the police officers come, okay?”

I miss my daddy.

But I’ll always love him, very much.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/8ib16nxmo42gv3jf', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.8654, 'ai': 0.1346}, 'blocks': [{'text': '*Trigger Warning: mentions of mental illness and suicide*\n\nDaddy always used to take me to the swings whenever we went to play in the park.\n\nAfter he came home from work, he’d take me by the hand and we’d run to the park.

He let me sit in the front seat, Mommy never does that. He even said we would get to have ice cream soon!

Daddy doesn’t like listening to music. In his car we always listen to the news, even though he knows I think it’s boring.

I try to tell him how boring it is again, but he tells me to be quiet, he’s waiting to hear something.

I wonder what he wants to hear.

I’m tired of waiting. I just want to go home. I think we passed our house, but it doesn’t matter because we’re having ice cream soon.

Daddy looks worried still, I don’t know what he needs to listen for.

He gives me his phone to play on, but he makes me promise not to text Mommy because she is busy.

I didn’t want to text her anyways. Games are more fun.

When it starts to get dark, the screen lights up the car a little and the walls glow.

My favorite game to play is Candy Crush but sometimes I like pretending to write emails like Daddy does.

I am trying to write a pretend one to Mrs. Schmidt when Daddy’s phone starts shaking.

There’s words at the top of the screen.

I try to sound them out like we practiced in class.

Ah-mm-ber A-leer-t, I say in my head.

I don’t know what it means so I hand the phone back to Daddy. I’m tired anyways.

He looks worried again. I wish I hadn’t given it back.

He starts driving faster and he tells me we’re going to play a game.

“Just like hide-and-seek, you can go a little under your seat.”

Hide-and-seek is my favorite game, Daddy and Mommy and me used to play it all the time.

I can’t see very much under the seat. It’s dark but there is also sometimes little bits of red light. It’s like it’s flashing.

Daddy keeps going faster.

I don’t want to play this game anymore.

The lights got brighter and I can hear another car going fast just like us.

Finally, Daddy stops the car. I go forward a little, but it’s OK because it doesn’t hurt.

Daddy tells me to get back in my seat.

I can see lots of police near the window now. I wonder what is happening.

Daddy looks at me, he still seems worried.

today we had to go to the hospital, Because I have an ouchie lump on my neck And it keeps growing. It hurts lots and makes me cry. When we were there the doctor was nice, the doctor told me my lump was naughty for hurting me.

daddy then took me outside and we played with the little house in the room with the lots of chairs. Mummy stayed and talked to the doctor. I think the doctor was mean to mummy, as she made mummy cry. I don’t like it when mummy cries it makes me want to cry. Mummy gave me a hug and said she loves me.

Bye diary

hi diary,

we Went to the hospital again, we didn’t see the mean doctor today. We got to see a nice lady instead. She played with me and we put a dolly in a big white donut. She said that the donut is loud. but I get to watch movies when I go in. She showed me lots of movies and I chose a mermaid one. There was a mean man, he put a needle into me and it hurted. He put some big plastic ear muffs on me but they weren’t fluffy like mummy’s . He made me lie in a big donut like the nice lady had shown me, but it was loud and hurt my ears. I don’t like it.

i had to lie on a tray and it hurted my back. I cried lots as i didn’t like atall. Mummy then told me to stay still and I get ice cream. I tried my best.

mummy got be ice cream after I got out the loud donut. She got me mint ice cream and it had chocolate in it, it was very yummy.

mummys phone rang and she cried again. Why is mummy always crying

Bye diary

hi diary,

mummy had to take me to new hospital today. She said I was going to go in a quiet donut. But I need to lie very still. These aren’t donuts, donuts should be yummy not hurty.

another mean doctor came in, they said I was going in a pet scan. I like pets pets are nice. They put me in a room for ever. And put more needles into me. The mean doctor said that it’s fairy magic. I like fairy’s. I’m hungry as mummy won’t feed me. Does mummy not love me no more?

this Donut isn’t loud like the other donut, I like this donut more. Now I can eat some food. I had some cookies. They were very yummy. We had to sit in a room for ages. I then needed another time in the donut. This isn’t fun.

after I left that donut, I could go home.

we had sausage and mash for dinner my favourite.

night diary.

diary

im scared, why do mummy and daddy make me go to hospital all time. I haven’t hurt my leg again.

mummy says I’m going to have a magic sleeping juice. She says doctors aren’t mean. She says they want to help me. But they hurted me that don’t help.

mummy says they want to see if my lump is a bad one or not.

im having magic sleeping juice now. I can’t drink it. They put it in a plaster on my hand.

bye diary.

hi diary

mummy cried today. She sed I have canser. Gran gran had that. But now gran gran is in heaven. I want to see gran gran. Daddy keeps kiss my head and hugging me. Mummy keeps crying. Am I going to heaven like gran gran.

I need more magic sleeping juice, as the doctors need to put a door in me for a thing called keemo.

night diary

diary

keemo is mean. She’s made my hair go away. Now I have no hair like grandad I’m not that old. Silly keemo. Mummy got me a pink wig! I like pink!

keemo makes me sick, a mean doctor put a worm up my nose and puts milk down it. silly doctor. Milks for me not for worms.

hey diary

its my 8th birthday today. And my final round of chemo. I hope to be able to go to school more now. I’ve had lots of doctors now. And some doctors have made me sleepy to help my neck. I hope I don’t need chemo again.

i might get to be a nurse when I’m older. The nurses who look after me are all very kind.

bye diary

dear diary

I guess I haven’t updated for a long time. I’m now 11 and am starting secondary school in September. I got the all clear after my last entry. I have relapsed though, but I hope to get better again. The cancer has spread to my lung my brain and my spine. The doctors are now unsure what they can do for me. I am going to have more chemo to see if they can help me again. I hope so, I do much want to attend secondary school with Anna and Millie.
good night diary.

diary

I've made it it’s my 12th birthday. The doctor said my cancer is terminal quite a while ago. Sorry I didn’t update. I’m going into year 8 soon an I’m so excited. It’s half term in 3 weeks and we’re going to Disney land. I still can’t believe I’m 12, we didn’t think I’d make it. I feel very ill on my chemo but have had a slice of birthday cake, which I hope to keep down. I’m going to go celebrate with my family now. I’ll update soon.

dear diary, OMG it’s today. I’m going to Disney and I can not wait. I have never been so excited before. It’s odd to think it’s my dying wish, but yay Disney. I hope I stay well as I’ve been stable the last 2 weeks.

dear diary

omg Disney is amazing, I’m exhausted but it is great. I’ve been on the Peter Pan ride and I’ve flown on dumbo. I know childish. BUT WHO CARES!!! Yolo. This is my wish and I will make the most of it.

dear diary,

I can’t breath. I passed out on a ride. They had to stop it to get me off. They put me in an ambulance and I’m currently in the hospital.

im coughing up blood and my lungs are getting tighter. I think I’m going to die soon. I want to be a nurse, I want to go to school. I want to dance at prom. I really want to dance at prom more than anything. Mum and dad are sobbing uncontrollably. Holding and kissing my hands.

everything's gone dark as the heart monitor beeps. My mum howls. As my dad falls over his feet running for the nurse. I stand at the end of the bed, I look at my body lying there. My mum whispering to me that I’ll pull through. The cardiac arrest buzzer gets pulled as everyone runs in to try and bring me back. Mum asked for some time alone. She pulled me into her arms squeezing my body tight and sobbing. I slowly walk towards her. Kiss her forehead. Dad walk in putting his hand on her shoulder. I stand and I hold both their hands. Tears stream down both their cheeks, as they stare at my body one moment longer. The doctors walk in and Wheel the bed to the door. I look at the bed, then at my parents. I whisper “ I love you mummy, I love you daddy. I’m so sorry”

they fall to the floor as I follow my body out. I’ll never be a nurse, I’ll never go to prom, I’ll never get to go to school again. I smile as I see the corridor of light. I hope Gran gran is up there. I hope my parents will be okay.

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow--
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?

Barun Patra,9y,How can ,"I had answered a similar question on ""How do I write?""
Here goes the same and pretty lame answer.

I wait for the clock to strike 12, I wait for the night,
That is when I start to write.
I pick up the diary gifted by my friend and a pen,
Start scribbling sitting in my den.
I want no disturbance, I close my door,
Think of people who I am writing for.
I like it when the story is emotional, when there is a twist,
Look at my window covered in mist.
There are days, when a real life incident takes up a form,
I get excited, hoping the story would cause a storm.
There are days when I fail to think, though I try hard,
Not able to write anything, I feel sad.
I follow the principle of KISS: keep it simple, stupid,

Jake Williams,7y,If you are on a high caliber poetry site and 100 people read your poem but no one comments does that indicate your poem sucks?,"Not at all.

The Internet is divided into three main groups when it comes to content:

Passive viewers- these are people who will read, watch, or listen to, but nothing more. They won't like, share, upvote, rate, thumbs up, or comment. If the site doesn't have a view counter, you won't even know they were there. These account for around 95-99%

Active viewers- these are people that view and submit their opinion in the form of likes, ratings, etc. They don't want to offer criticism in any real sense, but are happy to click some button to say what they enjoyed. If no such button exists, they become indistinguishable from the passive viewers.

Interactors- these are the people who will comment. They will write their opinion and their views. These account for around 0.05% of people who actually saw what you produced.

Don't believe me, compare the number of views to the number of upvotes on Quora answers. It's usually 1–2 upvotes per hundred views, if that. Now compare the comments to the upvotes. It's usually 1–5 comments for every hundred upvotes.

Raj Abhishek,Updated 8y,What are some interesting poems you have written during hard times of your life?,"*LIE



Lie,
A beautiful thing that can bring a smile.

Lie,
A word that can brighten up my eyes.

Lie,
‘Coz it reminds me of love and bliss.

Lie,
‘Coz I am used to it.

Lie,
‘Coz that’s the only truth.


Those late nights early morning talk,

At 3A.M. when it was time for ghost souls to take a walk.

When you used to tell me a sweet lie,

That you will not give up on me, will stay by my side.

And I used to believe them all that you say,

And stick that smile on my lips for whole next day.

Take me again to place I used to be,

Where I used to believe that you and me,

Will remain forever, even though it was a lie,

It has that power to keep my soul alive.

This truth is hurting me, killing inside.

And it feels like am stabbed with a sharp edged knife.

Lie to me,
‘Coz I believe each love words said by thee.

Lie,
‘Coz it has beautiful rhyme in it.

Lie,
‘Coz it has all the promises, even though fake,

Lie,
‘Coz I am used to it.

Lie,
‘Coz that’s the only truth.

Scott Krager,Updated Jan 4,Are there poems to send to a friend whose dog died?,"Absolutely, there are poems that can help console a friend grieving the loss of their furry family member. The loss of a pet is no trivial matter—they’re part of the family, and for some, this might be their closest companion we’re talking about.

Do Not Stand At My Grave and Weep by Mary Elizabeth Frye is one that jumps to mind. It’s not specifically about dogs, but it’s been adapted by many who have lost pets. It reads:

Do not stand at my grave and weep,
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken in the morning’s hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there. I did not die.

It’s a touching way of saying that while the dog may not be physically present, its spirit endures in the beauty all around us.

There’s also The Rainbow Bridge, author unknown, which is a poetic prose piece that promises a reunion with our pets after death in a serene place. Though not a poem in the strictest sense, its message is overwhelmingly comforting to pet lovers.

But if you want something more directly tailored to our canine friends, A Bridge Called Love by an unknown author offers a beautiful sentiment:

It takes us back to brighter years,
to happier sunlit days
and to precious moments
that will be with us always.
And these fond recollections
are treasured in the heart
to bring us always close to those
from whom we had to part.
There is a bridge of memories
from Earth to Heaven above...
It keeps our dear ones near us
It’s the bridge that we call love.

Sending any of these poems can be a tender gesture of understanding and shared sorrow. Grieving for a pet is hard, undeniably hard. Recognizing that with a poem is to acknowledge the depth of the bond your friend had to their beloved pup, and that can mean the world during tough times.

By the way, if your friend is a reader, and if it seems appropriate for their character, you might consider bringing them a copy of the incredibly touching novella, “The Art of Racing in the Rain” by Garth Stein. It’s told from a very thoughtful and introspective dog’s point of view and does a magnificent job of exploring the bond between humans and their canine companions.

And lastly, just being there for your friend is the most poetic gesture of all. Sometimes listening and a hug go a lot further than any words can.

Gill Bullen,5y,Which is the first poem in the English literature?,"The usually accepted answer to this Question is that the oldest recorded English poem is Caedmon’s Hymn, which dates from the sixth century. This is much earlier than works such as Beowulf, and about eight hundred years before Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, which I see someone else has nominated. Caedmon was an illiterate farm worker, at the Abbey of Whitby, which was at that time run by a remarkable woman, the Abbess Hilda. Bede records the story for us, explaining that Caedmon worked with the abbey’s cows. In the evenings he would join the other lay brothers (i.e., people who worked in the Abbey but were not in Holy Orders) in eating and drinking together, but as soon as any singing began he would slip out to the cowshed, because he was very self-conscious about being ignorant and unable to sing, and would sleep there with his cows. He was clearly pretty miserable. One night when he had done this, he fell asleep as usual, and had a strange dream. A voice asked him, “Sing to me, Caedmon!” He refused, saying, “No, Lord, you know I cannot sing.” But the voice persisted, and finally he asked, “What shall I sing?” And the voice told him to sing of the story of Creation. So he did. The words just seemed to come to him as if from nowhere. And when he woke up in the morning, he could still remember the whole thing! He was so excited about it that he went and told one of the Brothers, who thought it was so amazing that he took Caedmon to the Abbess Hilda to sing it for her. And she had it written down, and we still have the words today. So that's it. Fifteen hundred years ago, the earliest recorded English poem. I should say that the extract below is only the opening - there is a fair amount more that follows. But this is how it starts, at any rate:Nu scylun hergan hefaenricaes uard  metudæs maecti end his modgidanc  uerc uuldurfadur sue he uundra gihuaes  eci dryctin or astelidæ  he aerist scop aelda barnum  heben til hrofe haleg scepen.  tha middungeard moncynnæs uard  eci dryctin æfter tiadæ  firum foldu frea allmectig Which, being interpreted, is to say: Now let me praise the keeper of Heaven's kingdom,  The might of the Creator, and his thought,  The work of the Father of glory, how each of wonders  The Eternal Lord established in the beginning.

Dasha Alkina,4y,"Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?","I love my sister Manya.

She’s my best friend! She’s older than me and doesn’t live at home anymore but that’s okay, because I see her a lot. She takes me to eat ice cream after school, and sometimes she takes me to soccer practice.

Manya is fun. She plays with me, and tickles me until I almost can’t breathe. For my birthday, she got me a big book with all the dinosaurs in it! I love everything about Manya.

Well, almost. I don’t like Manya’s cat. He’s a meanie. He scratches and scratches her until she has a million billion cuts all over her arm! But I’ve never seen her cat before. She told me that he leaves during the day and only comes back at night.

Why doesn’t she just lock her door? One time a bear came from the woods, and everybody locked their doors so the bear couldn’t come in. Maybe Manya could lock the door and the cat won’t come anymore.

I told her this and she didn’t say anything. Maybe she’s still thinking about it. She said not to tell Mommy and Daddy about the cat or the scratches on her arm because it’s a secret. I love secrets! When Manya tells me secrets I feel almost like a grown-up.

Manya tells me a lot of important secrets. I remember once she had a bruise on her neck. It was big and purple. Like my arm was when I fell out of the swing. When I asked her about it she cried. I don’t like it when Manya cries because it makes me very sad.

She told me she wouldn’t cry if I didn’t say anything to Mommy. I said I wouldn’t, but she cries anyway.

Manya cries a lot. I want to help her be happy, like she is in my photo album. I love looking at pictures of Manya. She used to be so little, and she smiled all the time. I don’t know why she stopped.

Yesterday, Mommy and Daddy dropped me off at Manya’s house for a sleepover! We watched Winnie the Pooh and she made me pizza rolls. Before we went to sleep, Manya cried again and she hugged me for a long time. But then she smiled, so I think she’s better now.

It’s morning now. I’m drawing Manya a pretty picture. She’s still sleeping next to me.

There’s an empty bottle on the table. I think it’s Manya’s grown-up candy that she eats sometimes. It’s small and round like M&Ms. But M&Ms are rainbow colored and Manya’s candy is plain white. I tried one when she wasn’t looking and it didn’t even taste good.

Silly Manya. Doesn’t she know that M&Ms taste better?

I don’t know why Manya ate the whole bottle. But I know that sometimes candy helps me when I’m sad. Maybe Manya was very sad and eating a lot of candy helped her feel better.

I’m all done with my picture. I drew me and Manya chasing her cat off a cliff. Take that, evil cat! Maybe my picture will make her so happy that she’ll never cry ever again!

Manya’s been sleeping for a long time. I tried waking her up, but she’s still sleeping. Maybe’s she’s very tired.

I hope she wakes up soon.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/j5v1w8e4m0z2b6h9', 'title': ""Could you write a paragraph that uses most innocent (childlike) words while describing the dark side of adults' world (betrayal, hypocrisy, etc.)?"", 'score': {'original': 0.47875, 'ai': 0.52125}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I love my sister Manya.\n\nShe’s my best friend!

Stephen Tempest,5y,"If Gaelic was the common language of Medieval Scotland, why did John Barbour compose his poem ""The Bruce"" in a dialect of English?","Gaelic wasn’t the common language of Scotland by the 14th century, and hadn’t been for nearly the last 300 years.

At the beginning of the 1st millennium there were two languages spoken in Scotland, neither of which survive there today: Pictish north of the Forth-Clyde line and Brittonic south of it. (Brittonic is related to modern Welsh and Cornish. Pictish was most probably a Celtic language as well, but so little record of it survives that we can't even be sure of that.)

During the course of the first millennium three invader languages were imposed on Scotland as well: Gaelic from Ireland, English from northern Germany and Norse from Scandinavia.

Norse was primarily confined to the islands and the far northern tip of Caithness. English took root in the south-east, which was geographically a small area but contained a high proportion of Scotland's population.

As for Gaelic, it was initially the most successful of the new languages, starting in the south-west but replacing Pictish across most of the Highlands. This trend was linked to the merging of the Irish kingdom of Dál Riata with the various Pictish kingdoms.

In mediaeval Scotland and afterwards, it was generally held that the invading Gaels of Dál Riata had conquered the Picts to form the Kingdom of Alba, later known as Scotland. 'Scot', in those days, actually meant 'Irish', and 'Scotland' meant 'Land of the Irish'. Modern historians argue that it was more complicated than a simple conquest: for example, that the traditional 'first king of Scotland' Kenneth macAlpin was actually a Pict himself.

What is indisputable, however, is that the Pictish language became extinct and was replaced across most of Scotland north of the Forth-Clyde line by Gaelic. This extinction seems to have been quite rapid, occurring over the course of the 8th and 9th centuries, and very thorough. Gaelic, not Pictish, was the language of the Kings of the Scots.

Gaelic also eventually spread into south-west Scotland, the area where the Brittonic or Cumbric language had survived longest. This was actually due to a second Irish invasion in the 9th to 11th centuries, by hibernicised Vikings, the Gall-Ghàidheal people. They gave their name to Galloway, which was a semi-independent kingdom eventually absorbed by Scotland.

English, however, remained the common language of south-east Scotland, the area of Lothian and the Borders. This was part of the Angle kingdom of Bernicia and later Northumbria, but was isolated from the rest of English territory by the establishment of the Viking Kingdom of York in the 9th century.

The area of Lothian was thus vulnerable to a takeover by the Kingdom of Scotland. The year 973 is often taken to mark when this happened, since in that year Edgar, King of the English, formally acknowledged that Cináed ('Kenneth') mac Maíl Coluim, King of the Scots, was now the ruler of Lothian. Other historians say it happened later, in 1018. Written records from this period of history are sparse.

During the late 10th and 11th centuries, therefore, the area from Edinburgh to Berwick was an English-speaking region ruled by Gaelic-speaking kings. Unlike the Pictish and Cumbric-speakers to their north and west, however, the English of Lothian never adopted Gaelic as their language. Presumably they were too numerous to be absorbed or displaced. The fact that English was also spoken in the kingdom to the south is also likely have contributed to the survival of the language in Scotland.

However, by the middle of the 11th century Gaelic was already declining in prestige and influence.

In 1040 King Donnchad mac Crinain was killed in battle by the rebellious Mormaer of Moray, Mac Bethad mac Findláich, who seized his throne. (Shakespeare anglicised those names as 'Duncan' and 'Macbeth' in his play, though he fictionalised the circumstances of Duncan's death.) Donnchad's nine-year old son Máel Coluim (Malcolm) was probably taken to England for safety, and grew up speaking English at the court of Edward the Confessor.

As an adult Máel Coluim returned to Scotland in 1057 with English military assistance, defeated and killed Mac Bethad and his son, and became King of Scots the following year. A few years later Máel Coluim returned the favour when he allowed English exiles fleeing the Norman Conquest of England to reside in his kingdom. These exiles included Edgar Ætheling, who was regarded by many as the rightful heir by descent to the English throne.

In 1070 King Máel Coluim married the sister of Edgar Ætheling, Margaret. Since Edgar was childless, this meant that Máel Coluim's children with Margaret would be in line to the English throne. The King of Scots seems to have been very aware of this, since he did not give his sons traditional Gaelic names like his own, but thoroughly English names: Edward, Edmund, Ethelred and Edgar (followed by the more classical and Biblical Alexander and David).

Máel Coluim and his English wife Margaret, anachronistically wearing heraldic garments which would not actually be invented for another two centuries.

With an English-speaking king on the throne, married to an Englishwoman, and with many exiles from England having favoured positions at court, the Gaelic language was in eclipse among the elite. This trend seems to have been resented by the Scottish nobility: at least, when Máel Coluim died in 1093 they backed his Gaelic brother Domnall mac Donnchada to the throne instead of the king's anglicised sons.

However, Domnall did not hold the throne for long: in 1097 he was overthrown by Edgar with help from the King of England, William II. King Edgar ruled for ten years before being succeeded by his brother Alexander, who in turn was followed by their youngest brother David who became King of Scots in 1124.

Like his father, David had spent many of his younger years in England -- though by this time the elite language of England was Norman French, not English. Also like his father, David was closely related by marriage to the English monarchy, in this case because King Henry I of England married David's sister Margaret. (Which also meant that the Empress Matilda was David's niece.) David himself married an Englishwoman, Maud the Countess of Huntingdon, and by right of his wife was an English Earl before becoming King of Scots.

When David took the Scottish throne, by force, he did so at the head of an army of Anglo-Norman knights. He rewarded them later with lands and titles, resulting in the creation of a Scottish nobility with French roots. The most notable example is the Stewart or Stuart dynasty, founded by the Anglo-Norman nobleman Walter fitzAlan, who originally owned land in the Welsh Marches and whose father came to England from Brittany. Walter became the King of Scotland's steward, a title which became hereditary in his family and gave the dynasty its name.

David ruled Scotland for nearly three decades, and enacted sweeping reforms. He introduced a feudal system modelled on that of Norman England, with fiefs and oaths of vassalage. He divided his heartland where his power was strongest into counties controlled by sheriffs, again copying the English institution. He reformed the Church, reorganising its system of bishoprics and parishes, and setting up many new monasteries. The monks for these monasteries mostly came from England and France, and they provided a class of literate administrators to support David's reforms.

This meant that Scotland's new elite under King David included a very high proportion of Normans. The knights and barons who made up his army, and the monks and clerks who made up his administration, were most likely to speak French, secondly to speak English, and unlikely to speak Gaelic at all.

Finally, David reformed the economy as well. He minted Scotland's first coins, closely based on the English coinage. He also set up about 15 new towns, or burghs, which were given special privileges to allow them to become centres of trade and commerce. These burghs were mostly in the south-east, and up the east coast: they included Roxburgh and Berwick, the first two, followed by Aberdeen, Dundee, Lanark, Edinburgh, Dunfermline, Elgin, Forres, Linlithgow, Montrose, Peebles, Perth, Rutherglen, Stirling and Tain.

Not much is left of Roxburgh, King David’s first burgh, in modern times.

These were not all brand-new settlements as such, but David gave them royal charters and a new organisation. He also encouraged immigration of merchants and craftsmen from abroad -- these included many Flemings from Flanders, but also English, French and German inhabitants.

These new cities were mostly established in the English-speaking parts of Scotland, the area that was once part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. Immigrants to the burghs, if they were not already English-speaking, thus tended to learn English rather than Gaelic to get by.

The result of this century of change, from the accession of Máel Coluim Ceann Mòr (Malcolm III Canmore) in 1058 to the death of David I in 1153, saw the decline of Gaelic as Scotland's elite language. By the last years of David's reign the Scottish aristocracy mostly spoke Norman French, the urban middle class mostly spoke English, and only the peasants and the Highland clans still spoke Gaelic. Even they would often learn some English as a second language for use when they went into town to trade, or had to deal with the government and law.

Over the next two centuries, the primary development was that English spread its influence, Gaelic continued to retreat, and French gradually ceased to be the language of the nobility -- a change mirrored south of the border in England.

The Scottish wars of independence against England in the late 12th and early 13th centuries were eventually won by Robert de Brus, descendant of an Anglo-Norman baron who came to Scotland under King David I and brought up in the English-speaking region of Annandale, though he is believed to have also spoken Gaelic.

An important change was that by 1365 Edinburgh was being referred to as 'the capital of Scotland', replacing the more northerly city of Perth with that honour. That moved the centre of gravity of the royal court from the formerly Gaelic speaking realm of Alba to Lothian, which had been English-speaking for the last 750 years.

John Barbour wrote Brus in English in the year 1375, but he is noted as being the father of Scots literature. In other words, he was the first major Scottish literary figure remembered in history as writing in that language -- and the surprise is that he did not write in French or Latin, the main language of the Scottish elite for the last three centuries.

It seems that by the late 14th century English, the language of the merchants and urban classes, was rising in status and could now be spoken without embarrassment by poets and nobles. Early in the following century English replaced Latin as the official language of the government used for recording laws and the public accounts.

Sometime around the year 1500 an important change occurred. Until that point, the language now spoken by Scotland's elite was called English (or Inglis) while the term 'Scottish' (Scottis) referred to the language spoken in both the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland — that is, Gaelic.

However, at about that point in time, the English-speaking Scots began using the term 'Irish' or 'Erse' to describe Gaelic, claiming the name Scottish, Scots or Scotis for their own language instead.

This can be seen as a rejection of the clan-based, Gaelic-speaking lifestyle of the Highlands as foreign, barbaric and unScottish. It was not until the 19th century that a romanticised picture of Highland life, with its bagpipes and tartans, was embraced as 'Scotland's heritage'.

Equally, it was an assertion of Scottish nationalism that the language they spoke was not 'English', but 'Scots'. Whether Scots is a language in its own right or a dialect of English is a question that most linguists will back away from nervously. Though as the saying goes, ""a language is a dialect with an army and a navy"".","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/va1ktwsxn2reqpul', 'title': 'If Gaelic was the common language of Medieval Scotland, why did John Barbour compose his poem ""The Bruce"" in a dialect of English?', 'score': {'original': 0.5108, 'ai': 0.4892}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Gaelic wasn’t the common language of Scotland by the 14th century, and hadn’t been for nearly the last 300 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1st millennium there were two languages spoken in Scotland, neither of which survive there today: Pictish north of the Forth-Clyde line and Brittonic south of it.

(Brittonic is related to modern Welsh and Cornish. Pictish was most probably a Celtic language as well, but so little record of it survives that we can\'t even be sure of that.)\n\nDuring the course of the first millennium three invader languages were imposed on Scotland as well: Gaelic from Ireland, English from northern Germany and Norse from Scandinavia.\n\nNorse was primarily confined to the islands and the far northern tip of Caithness. English took root in the south-east, which was geographically a small area but contained a high proportion of Scotland\'s population.\n\nAs for Gaelic, it was initially the most successful of the new languages, starting in the south-west but replacing Pictish across most of the Highlands. This trend was linked to the merging of the Irish kingdom of Dál Riata with the various Pictish kingdoms.\n\nIn mediaeval Scotland and afterwards, it was generally held that the invading Gaels of Dál Riata had conquered the Picts to form the Kingdom of Alba, later known as Scotland. \'Scot\', in those days, actually meant \'Irish\', and \'Scotland\' meant \'Land of the Irish\'. Modern historians argue that it was more complicated than a simple conquest: for example, that the traditional \'first king of Scotland\' Kenneth macAlpin was actually a Pict himself.\n\nWhat is indisputable, however, is that the Pictish language became extinct and was replaced across most of Scotland north of the Forth-Clyde line by Gaelic. This extinction seems to have been quite rapid, occurring over the course of the 8th and 9th centuries, and very thorough. Gaelic, not Pictish, was the language of the Kings of the Scots.\n\nGaelic also eventually spread into south-west Scotland, the area where the Brittonic or Cumbric language had survived longest. This was actually due to a second Irish invasion in the 9th to 11th centuries, by hibernicised Vikings, the Gall-Ghàidheal people. They gave their name to Galloway, which was a semi-independent kingdom eventually absorbed by Scotland.\n\nEnglish, however, remained the common language of south-east Scotland, the area of Lothian and the Borders. This was part of the Angle kingdom of Bernicia and later Northumbria, but was isolated from the rest of English territory by the establishment of the Viking Kingdom of York in the 9th century.\n\nThe area of Lothian was thus vulnerable to a takeover by the Kingdom of Scotland. The year 973 is often taken to mark when this happened, since in that year Edgar, King of the English, formally acknowledged that Cináed (\'Kenneth\') mac Maíl Coluim, King of the Scots, was now the ruler of Lothian. Other historians say it happened later, in 1018. Written records from this period of history are sparse.\n\nDuring the late 10th and 11th centuries, therefore, the area from Edinburgh to Berwick was an English-speaking region ruled by Gaelic-speaking kings. Unlike the Pictish and Cumbric-speakers to their north and west, however, the English of Lothian never adopted Gaelic as their language. Presumably they were too numerous to be absorbed or displaced. The fact that English was also spoken in the kingdom to the south is also likely have contributed to the survival of the language in Scotland.\n\nHowever, by the middle of the 11th century Gaelic was already declining in prestige and influence.\n\nIn 1040 King Donnchad mac Crinain was killed in battle by the rebellious Mormaer of Moray, Mac Bethad mac Findláich, who seized his throne. (Shakespeare anglicised those names as \'Duncan\' and \'Macbeth\' in his play, though he fictionalised the circumstances of Duncan\'s death.) Donnchad\'s nine-year old son Máel Coluim (Malcolm) was probably taken to England for safety, and grew up speaking English at the court of Edward the Confessor.\n\nAs an adult Máel Coluim returned to Scotland in 1057 with English military assistance, defeated and killed Mac Bethad and his son, and became King of Scots the following year. A few years later Máel Coluim returned the favour when he allowed English exiles fleeing the Norman Conquest of England to reside in his kingdom. These exiles included Edgar Ætheling, who was regarded by many as the rightful heir by descent to the English throne.\n\nIn 1070 King Máel Coluim married the sister of Edgar Ætheling, Margaret. Since Edgar was childless, this meant that Máel Coluim\'s children with Margaret would be in line to the English throne. The King of Scots seems to have been very aware of this, since he did not give his sons traditional Gaelic names like his own, but thoroughly English names: Edward, Edmund, Ethelred and Edgar (followed by the more classical and Biblical Alexander and David).\n\nMáel Coluim and his English wife Margaret, anachronistically wearing heraldic garments which would not actually be invented for another two centuries.\n\nWith an English-speaking king on the throne, married to an Englishwoman, and with many exiles from England having favoured positions at court, the Gaelic language was in eclipse among the elite. This trend seems to have been resented by the Scottish nobility: at least, when Máel Coluim died in 1093 they backed his Gaelic brother Domnall mac Donnchada to the throne instead of the king\'s anglicised sons.\n\nHowever, Domnall did not hold the throne for long: in 1097 he was overthrown by Edgar with help from the King of England, William II. King Edgar ruled for ten years before being succeeded by his brother Alexander, who in turn was followed by their youngest brother David who became King of Scots in 1124.\n\nLike his father, David had spent many of his younger years in England -- though by this time the elite language of England was Norman French, not English. Also like his father, David was closely related by marriage to the English monarchy, in this case because King Henry I of England married David\'s sister Margaret. (Which also meant that the Empress Matilda was David\'s niece.) David himself married an Englishwoman, Maud the Countess of Huntingdon, and by right of his wife was an English Earl before becoming King of Scots.\n\nWhen David took the Scottish throne, by force, he did so at the head of an army of Anglo-Norman knights. He rewarded them later with lands and titles, resulting in the creation of a Scottish nobility with French roots. The most notable example is the Stewart or Stuart dynasty, founded by the Anglo-Norman nobleman Walter fitzAlan, who originally owned land in the Welsh Marches and whose father came to England from Brittany. Walter became the King of Scotland\'s steward, a title which became hereditary in his family and gave the dynasty its name.\n\nDavid ruled Scotland for nearly three decades, and enacted sweeping reforms. He introduced a feudal system modelled on that of Norman England, with fiefs and oaths of vassalage. He divided his heartland where his power was strongest into counties controlled by sheriffs, again copying the English institution. He reformed the Church, reorganising its system of bishoprics and parishes, and setting up many new monasteries. The monks for these monasteries mostly came from England and France, and they provided a class of literate administrators to support David\'s reforms.\n\nThis meant that Scotland\'s new elite under King David included a very high proportion of Normans. The knights and barons who made up his army, and the monks and clerks who made up his administration, were most likely to speak French, secondly to speak English, and unlikely to speak Gaelic at all.\n\nFinally, David reformed the economy as well. He minted Scotland\'s first coins, closely based on the English coinage. He also set up about 15 new towns, or burghs, which were given special privileges to allow them to become centres of trade and commerce. These burghs were mostly in the south-east, and up the east coast: they included Roxburgh and Berwick, the first two, followed by Aberdeen, Dundee, Lanark, Edinburgh, Dunfermline, Elgin, Forres, Linlithgow, Montrose, Peebles, Perth, Rutherglen, Stirling and Tain.\n\nNot much is left of Roxburgh, King David’s first burgh, in modern times.\n\nThese were not all brand-new settlements as such, but David gave them royal charters and a new organisation. He also encouraged immigration of merchants and craftsmen from abroad -- these included many Flemings from Flanders, but also English, French and German inhabitants.\n\nThese new cities were mostly established in the English-speaking parts of Scotland, the area that was once part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. Immigrants to the burghs, if they were not already English-speaking, thus tended to learn English rather than Gaelic to get by.\n\nThe result of this century of change, from the accession of Máel Coluim Ceann Mòr (Malcolm III Canmore) in 1058 to the death of David I in 1153, saw the decline of Gaelic as Scotland\'s elite language. By the last years of David\'s reign the Scottish aristocracy mostly spoke Norman French, the urban middle class mostly spoke English, and only the peasants and the Highland clans still spoke Gaelic. Even they would often learn some English as a second language for use when they went into town to trade, or had to deal with the government and law.\n\nOver the next two centuries, the primary development was that English spread its influence, Gaelic continued to retreat, and French gradually ceased to be the language of the nobility -- a change mirrored south of the border in England.\n\nThe Scottish wars of independence against England in the late 12th and early 13th centuries were eventually won by Robert de Brus, descendant of an Anglo-Norman baron who came to Scotland under King David I and brought up in the English-speaking region of Annandale, though he is believed to have also spoken Gaelic.\n\nAn important change was that by 1365 Edinburgh was being referred to as \'the capital of Scotland\', replacing the more northerly city of Perth with that honour. That moved the centre of gravity of the royal court from the formerly Gaelic speaking realm of Alba to Lothian, which had been English-speaking for the last 750 years.\n\nJohn Barbour wrote Brus in English in the year 1375, but he is noted as being the father of Scots literature. In other words, he was the first major Scottish literary figure remembered in history as writing in that language -- and the surprise is that he did not write in French or Latin, the main language of the Scottish elite for the last three centuries.\n\nIt seems that by the late 14th century English, the language of the merchants and urban classes, was rising in status and could now be spoken without embarrassment by poets and nobles. Early in the following century English replaced Latin as the official language of the government used for recording laws and the public accounts.\n\nSometime around the year 1500 an important change occurred. Until that point, the language now spoken by Scotland\'s elite was called English (or Inglis) while the term \'Scottish\' (Scottis) referred to the language spoken in both the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland — that is, Gaelic.\n\nHowever, at about that point in time, the English-speaking Scots began using the term \'Irish\' or \'Erse\' to describe Gaelic, claiming the name Scottish, Scots or Scotis for their own language instead.\n\nThis can be seen as a rejection of the clan-based, Gaelic-speaking lifestyle of the Highlands as foreign, barbaric and unScottish. It was not until the 19th century that a romanticised picture of Highland life, with its bagpipes and tartans, was embraced as \'Scotland\'s heritage\'.\n\nEqually, it was an assertion of Scottish nationalism that the language they spoke was not \'English\', but \'Scots\'.

John Sierra,Nov 11,"What is the significance of J.R.R Tolkien's poem ""All that is gold does not glitter""?","This was from Bilbo’s poem about Aragorn, and Tolkien was paraphrasing Shakespeare a bit to get the meaning across.

The line from the poem first shows up in Gandalf’s letter to Frodo, which Barliman had forgotten to send, but hands it to him in Bree once he realizes that “Mr. Underhill” is Frodo. The letter tells Frodo to meet a man named Strider in Bree, who will guide them to Imladris. He includes the line along with a warning to be sure that it is the real Strider and not an imposter - he should be carrying a broken sword and his real name is Aragorn.

This positively identifies Strider as genuine, but Frodo states he had guessed the truth already, as an imposter would appear “fairer and fouler”. Aragorn, at this moment, is not looking his best. He is dirty and disheveled and Barliman thinks he is just some untrustworthy tramp, he “appears foul” But Frodo could tell from the kindness in his voice that he was no enemy, he “acts fair”. Frodo reasons that an imposter would go through great pains to appear fair, but would not act fair. This plays into the line in Gandalf letter, all that is gold does not glitter, Aragorn is the “gold” of great worth, but he does not “glitter” he is a dirty hobo.

We learn later that Aragorn cleans up nicely, but Boromir is initially dismissive of and disrespectful to Aragorn, something that angers Bilbo, who recites his poem angrily at Boromir, who does not see a king in Aragorn. There is more to it, of course, and the second line is just as important “not all who wander are lost” Aragorn wanders, but he is not lost, he is not in Gondor, but he is it’s rightful king.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/5p4tg1ucnkyfs8oi', 'title': 'What is the significance of J.R.R Tolkien\'s poem ""All that is gold does not glitter""?', 'score': {'original': 0.9986, 'ai': 0.0014}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'This was from Bilbo’s poem about Aragorn, and Tolkien was paraphrasing Shakespeare a bit to get the meaning across.\n\nThe line from the poem first shows up in Gandalf’s letter to Frodo, which Barliman had forgotten to send, but hands it to him in Bree once he realizes that “Mr. Underhill” is Frodo.

Anshu Bharti,Oct 28,What is the recent poem you wrote? What inspired you to do so?,"Last month, a lot of noise in my head birthed this poem. Hope, you comprehend my feelings through this poem:

I wonder

They travel to space

Many here

couldn't step out of four walls.

I wonder

They talk about freedom

Many here

couldn't make decisions for their own life.

I wonder

They lecture about morals and ethics

There are souls here

dying every day, following them.

I wonder

They make rules and feel proud

There are already many

Rotten and broken.

I wonder

They insist on maintaining silence

The noise in the head

has already created a menace.

I wonder

They go to war, claiming to bring peace

There are lives inside

Already shattered.

I wonder

They boast about gods and blessings

There are many here

Unblessed and deprived.

I wonder,

Yes, I wonder

At the contradictions

All around the world!

Thank you for reading.

Stay Calm!

Kate Scott,6y,What are some tricks to memorizing poems?,"In 6th grade, I had an assignment.
In this assignment, we were given one week to memorize a poem by the author we were given.

I got Emily Dickinson.

Since I am me, I waited until the night before it was due to go “Oh shit! I have homework!” and frantically looked up a poem that had the minimum word count needed to pass.

I found Hope Is The Thing With Feathers.

I desperately tried to memorize the poem all night, but it was fruitless.
I was too tired and the words refused to stick in my brain.

The next morning, as I was being driven to school, I suddenly came up with an idea:
I would make up a tune to go with it!

Genius!

Throughout first period, I quietly hummed in the back of history class until I turned the poem into a song.

By the time I got to English class, I had it down solid. I could sing it in my sleep!

When my name was called, I proudly walked up to the podium in front of all my classmates and recited my poem.

No.

Wait.

That’s not how it happened.

Oh, right!

Actually, I belted my song out like I was Mariah fucking Carey.
Like, full vibrato and everything.
I’m pretty sure I was doing the ‘Christina Aguilera hands’ as I was singing, too.

I was feelin’ it.

It wasn’t until I finished that I noticed the laughter bubbling up from the corners of the room.

Shit.

Oops.

It’s been 15+ years and I can still recite that poem flawlessly.

Turn the poem into a song.

It really, really works.

Just don’t sing it in front of your entire class.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/z4exavtlo381c9ip', 'title': 'What are some tricks to memorizing poems?', 'score': {'original': 0.9994, 'ai': 0.0006}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In 6th grade, I had an assignment.\nIn this assignment, we were given one week to memorize a poem by the author we were given.\n\nI got Emily Dickinson.\n\nSince I am me, I waited until the night before it was due to go “Oh shit!

Lynne Appino,Updated 4y,What is a poem that has a hidden dark meaning?,"A Poison Tree by William Blake

I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I watered it in fears
Night and morning with my tears,
And I sunned it with smiles
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright,
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine,--

And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning, glad, I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

Blake’s poem is about the suppression of anger and how it leads to the cultivation of anger. The tree is the speaker’s anger, which he carefully tends. He waters it “Night and morning with my tears”. He “sunned it with smiles”, as his anger grows stronger. Until, the tree (his anger) produces “an apple bright”, which his foe then steals and eats, killing him. The speaker is happy to see “My foe outstretched beneath the tree.”. The foe has been ultimately destroyed by the speakers anger.

Blake wrote this poem in 1784, a time where it was important to keep your emotions bottled up inside, to show a happy face to society. Blake did not agree with this and in his poem he is telling us to let go of anger. We should not let it fester inside us and grow.

Alex Johnston,Updated 2y,Are the Homeric epic poems still available to us in the original ancient Greek language that Homer himself used? How have the poems been preserved over time?,"Yes, they’re all written in a particular dialect of ancient Greek which is actually known as Homeric Greek. And that’s still the form in which we read them today, if we attempt to read them in the original.

I used to have a copy of the Iliad, bought in a Salonika bookshop, which had the original on one page and a modern Greek translation on the facing page, because modern Greek people have to learn classical Greek too. (Well, they don’t have to, I don’t think, but they do if they want to read classical Greek.)

One of the interesting things about the text of Homer is that, although the poems themselves are among the oldest in Greek literature, and indeed in European literature, so you’d think that they might have been altered or fiddled with over time and that the originals are lost beyond recall, in fact, the Greeks so revered Homer that they made copy after copy of his poems. So, even though he’s their classic just as he’s ours (if he’s ours), his text is one of the best established of all the Greek and Latin classics.

Compare the fate of Catullus, a Latin poet from around 750 years later than Homer, around half a century before the time of Christ.

Almost all of Catullus’ poems were lost for centuries, with the vast majority of them surviving in only one copy, which no longer even exists, and the only reason we know it existed is that other copies were made from it which contain notes from the scribes who made them, complaining that the manuscript they were copying from was obviously itself a poor copy of an earlier manuscript.

But Homer? You can walk into a bookshop and buy a copy of Homer in the original, and be reasonably sure that you’re reading the same poem that the Athenians were reading in 500 B.C.E.

I studied classical Greek in the hope that I would learn enough to be able to read Homer in the original. Unfortunately, his dialect is so different from the Attic Greek that I studied that I can’t. But it is possible to learn Homeric Greek, if you have the right textbook and a good teacher.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/2ijbcl1w3kq95snf', 'title': 'Are the Homeric epic poems still available to us in the original ancient Greek language that Homer himself used?

Matthew Bates,3y,"As a teacher, what are your ways or your considerations in selecting the reading materials for your students, particularly in selecting poems?","For novels, it’s fairly easy for me now. This is my twelfth year as a teacher, so I try to stick to novels I’ve already taught once before. That narrows it down to about 50 possibilities. I may add one new novel per year, but for the most part, I stick with what I know, because I already have the material, and there’s a good reason I taught it before… it’s relevant in some way to students in the age ranges I teach.

For poetry, I look for poems that are:

Catholic middle school-appropriate. So no graphic sex, violence, or drugs.
Relevant to middle school students. “Coming of age” or “growing independent” poetry is always a winner, since they’re in that phase of their lives.
Narrative. The students just seem to get more out of a poem that tells a story, rather than a poem that’s trying to capture an emotion. The big exception here is haiku.

About half of the poems I teach are actually just lyrics to popular songs. We read the lyrics, listen to the songs, then talk about them. It’s one of the most enjoyable things about being an English teacher. Country songs and 90s alternative hits, like from Counting Crows and the Gin Blossoms, work well for this.

Students also really enjoy reading “famous” poems or poems by poets they’ve heard of before: Poe, Shakespeare, etc…

The students’ literature anthology also has some pre-selected poems, complete with questions and discussion points, which makes my life easier.

The only poems I tend to avoid, because the students hate them and I don’t think they have much teaching value anyway, are free-verse poems by amateurs, like you may find on some poetry blogs online.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dzp17vlw9tban8jx', 'title': 'As a teacher, what are your ways or your considerations in selecting the reading materials for your students, particularly in selecting poems?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'For novels, it’s fairly easy for me now.

Bhakti Vashya,2y,What is your favourite poem on Krishna?,"My favorite poems on Krishna, are the ones written by the great saint Meerabai.

One of the favorite poems describing the pain of separation which touched my heart:

As the lotus dies without water, as the night is blind without the moon, so is my heart without You, Beloved.I wander alone at night, driven by my longing for You. I hunger for You all the day, I thirst for You all the night.My grief is beyond words; my mind is beyond rest.

Come and end my grief, Beloved. Come and bring joy to my heart. You know my inmost secret; then look at me with eyes of love, Your slave for countless lives since the dawn of time.

A few lines from Meera’s poems shows us how to win over the Lord’s heart by treating him as our very own, and not as an authoritative god/dictator:

“Love in which there is laughter and sobbing, throbbing and clasping in tight embrace, that alone is liberation for me, I care for no other.”

” I will fasten the bells of His love to my feet and dance in front of my Beloved. Dancing and dancing I will please His eyes; My love is an ancient one. My love is the only truth.”

”I do not care about social norms nor do I keep my family's honor. I cannot forget, even for a moment, the beauty of my Lover. I am dyed in God's color. “

Finally Meera expresses the joy of having received Krishna’s vision in the below poem:

The Beloved has come to my house. After many an age of expectation, the abandoned one has found her Lover. The Beloved is compassionate and sent me a message.

My Beloved has come, every limb in my body throbs with joy. My love is for that Ocean of Love, the Beloved. His love has entrapped my eyes. Says Mira: He is joy abundant, I have enthroned Him on my brow.

I offer a thousand thanks to the astrologer who predicted my Beloved would come. My joy is overflowing, my soul has access to an incalculable storehouse of joy!

O my dear companion, now that I have seen the Lord, all my desires are fulfilled and my sufferings forgotten. My Master, the Ocean of Joy, Mira’s Lord, has entered her home.

Eugene Pierson,Nov 9,Can you write a poem on your dog?,"Please Leave Me Alone

11/5/2023 — God Guides What I Write, & Please Don’t Blame Gifted People for Your Problems nor Be Jealous of Their Gifts. Writing What Is in the Future…

Today, I buried my magnificent Black Chihuahua Cha Cha.
I loved her like music solfege — Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La.
Our love was bright & honest — but now a dark eclipse remains.
Now, there is an insidious, sinister viciousness that stains.

She kept up with me, walking quite rapidly & cheerfully.
Some days, it would appear as though I drained her energy.
But typically, Cha Cha would wolf down her doggy food,
And she would always run to me with a longing, obedient mood.

Many on social media were quite jealous of our love,
How our devotion & grace flew to Sistine, Everest heights —
Past the stained-glass windows of St. Paul with a peaceful dove,
Enveloped with the spirit of Mother Teresa’s theological rights.

Cha Cha barked at intruders who she knew were suspicious,
Doubtful of their intentions — likely hiding that which is egregious.
As writers, we must not stop writing what we notice in the periphery,
And as musicians, we must keep singing to awaken the scenery.

Cha Cha’s pink collar made it all the more salient that she was female,
Evident when I apparated through the door — how she would wail.
Her blackness reminded me of George Floyd & Breonna Taylor,
The lives they could have lived — but we as a society are a failure.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/l0hmz27kbjygc536', 'title': 'Can you write a poem on your dog?', 'score': {'original': 0.9964, 'ai': 0.0036}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Please Leave Me Alone\n\n11/5/2023 — God Guides What I Write, & Please Don’t Blame Gifted People for Your Problems nor Be Jealous of Their Gifts.

What’s the point of telling you how I could do this… Let’s look at how YOU could do it…

To analyse the poem ""A Freedom Song"" using a delightful combination of intrinsic and feminist approaches, you must dance delicately on a grammatical tightrope. Imagine a linguistic circus act where the performer balances on the fine line between the inherent qualities of the poem and the empowering lens of feminism.

Now, delve into the poem's essence, its very soul. Scrutinize its structure, rhyme, and rhythm, dissecting each syllable with surgical precision. Seek to unravel the intricate tapestry of imagery, metaphors, and symbols woven by the poet. Unearth the underlying meaning and examine the linguistic devices that bring this freedom song to life.

And then, don your metaphorical feminist spectacles and gaze at the poem through their empowering lenses. Decipher the gender dynamics, challenge the patriarchal norms, and uncover the subversive messages lurking beneath the verses.

With these two approaches intertwined like a beautifully braided sentence, you can analyse ""A Freedom Song"" in all its glory. You honour the poem's intrinsic qualities while embracing the feminist lens, allowing them to dance together like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

Now, venture forth and unravel the secrets of this remarkable poem!

Dylan Owens,5y,Can you write a poem about Quora?,"The Quor.

Once upon a midnight dreary, I piddled, eyes weak and dreary.

Youtube shown before my eyes, top 10 lists becoming quite the bore—

With attention dropping, nearly stopping, a thought formed in my head.

Perhaps the internet went beyond, perhaps it offered something more,

A place to speak, a place to write, a place with knowledge to adore.

I thought back to a website by the name of Quor’

-

I stopped the vide’o robbing me of all intention,

Opening the site, for which creativity was the penchant.

Ideas bubbling, intuition doubling, I waited for the site to load.

As the page materialized, my concern began to soar.

For when it fully loaded, I saw to my abhor,

Deepak Mehta,4y,What is the meaning of the Hindi poem posted by ADG PI of IAF after it attacked the Pakistani terror camp?,"The lines are from the famous “शक्ति और क्षमा” / “Shakti aur Kshama” / “Strength and Forgiveness” by the Indian poet रामधारी सिंह “दिनकर” / Ramdhari Singh “Dinkar”.

The crux of the poem is that in order to be benevolent and forgiving, one has to be powerful and feared first. Only then does the world take you seriously.

Only 2 of the 9 verses of the poem were posted.

'क्षमाशील हो रिपु-समक्ष
तुम हुए विनीत जितना ही,
दुष्ट कौरवों ने तुमको
कायर समझा उतना ही।

सच पूछो, तो शर में ही
बसती है दीप्ति विनय की,
सन्धि-वचन संपूज्य उसी का
जिसमें शक्ति विजय की।'

which roughly translates to

The more, in front of the enemy,
You were gentle and humane,
The more the evil Kauravas,
Pegged you as a craven.

Truth be told, it’s in the quiver,
Where lies the brilliance of humility.
And only his peace-offer is compelling,
Who are capable of victory.

The current situation between India and Pak is apt for this compilation. India has always championed peace and collaboration. And Pakistan has always mistaken it as India’s weakness. But India has to realize that you can only be magnanimous and forgiving if you are also perceived to be powerful and menacing.

There are three more paras that narrate the sequence of event in Ramayana where Lord Ram prayed to the Indian ocean separating India and Lanka asking for a way. He fasted and meditated for three days, but Lord Varuna (the Lord of the Seas), in all his haughtiness, did not respond.

On the fourth day, Lord Rama stood up, an embodiment of fury. He warns Varuna that he would dry up the entirety of the ocean if he did not pave way. Only then does Varuna realize the folly of his ways and takes on a human form, begging for mercy from the Lord.

तीन दिवस तक पंथ मांगते
रघुपति सिन्धु किनारे,
बैठे पढ़ते रहे छन्द
अनुनय के प्यारे-प्यारे।

उत्तर में जब एक नाद भी
उठा नहीं सागर से
उठी अधीर धधक पौरुष की
आग राम के शर से।

सिन्धु देह धर त्राहि-त्राहि
करता आ गिरा शरण में
चरण पूज दासता ग्रहण की
बँधा मूढ़ बन्धन में।

Finally, all of the poem’s core message is also contained in one single paragraph.

क्षमा शोभती उस भुजंग को
जिसके पास गरल हो
उसको क्या जो दंतहीन
विषरहित, विनीत, सरल हो।

Leon Brennan,4y,Can you write a poem about your lover?,"Casting shadows that are awkwardly placed.

There is no light that dances at her face.

She fumbles at night and kicks the bed edge.

Late morning riser she acts like she's dead.

Hogs up the bathroom, forgetting to flush.

I walk in behind her. Man it’s too much.

She leaves late for work. I'm always to blame.

She spent too much time, her hair wouldn't tame.

Forgetting her phone, in such a hurry.

Our house a mess, she left in a flurry.

Home after dinner, deciding I can't.

Asked her a question, her head took a slant.

“Everything ok, my sweet jelly bean?”

“The hell is your problem, what do you mean?”

“You seem so frazzled, I just had to ask.”

“Put it behind us. The past is the past.”

She turned on the stove and cooked us a meal.

It was burnt to a crisp, pasta and veal.

My composure I kept, so tightly wrapped.

Just couldn't tell her, thought it was crap.

Flipped on the telly and put on her show.

God it's so boring. She really not know?

She woke me for bed, the show now done.

I'm starting to think that she is the one?

She fell asleep fast, was left to my mind.

Is she my lover? This poem will find.

I don't hate when she's late, leaving lights on.

I don't hate when she sings, out of tune songs.

I don't hate when she yells — kicks, bites and screams.

Don't hate her at all, ’cause she's on my team.

She pulled my hair back, whenever I puked.

I know I'm in love. This isn't a fluke.

Puts on her makeup to act out a scene,

All in the name of keeping me clean.

She lifts me so high, with all of my flaws.

A lover like her, gives room for a pause.

Each of us is cracked, and broken in two.

But not for the world, would I trade Jessica Sue.

Deepak Mehta,Updated 4y,What are the best poems written by Kabir Das?,"कबीर/Kabir ji was a poet without equals. The Indian poetic style of couplets (दोहे) are synonymous with him, as is the Bhakti (भक्ति) movement.

Almost every Indian would be familiar with some of his best couplets, e.g.

बुरा जो देखन मैं चला, बुरा न मिलिया कोय,
जो दिल खोजा आपना, मुझसे बुरा न कोय।

These lines are a critique of the inherent human nature to find faults in others all the while remaining blissfully unaware of their own prejudices and shortcomings.

Translation:

I ventured out to find evil, but to no avail.
But one search of my heart revealed evil nonpareil.

जिन खोजा तिन पाइया, गहरे पानी पैठ,
मैं बपुरा बूडन डरा, रहा किनारे बैठ।

Here is Kabir adjuring the reader to actually get up and get to work, to take risks, to go big.

Translation:

If you seek, you will find, but search the depths you should,
The timid are doomed to remain on the bank, muttering “I too could”.

अति का भला न बोलना, अति की भली न चूप,
अति का भला न बरसना, अति की भली न धूप।

Kabir warning of the evils of excess.

Translation:

An excess of words isn’t desirable, neither is prolonged mum.
Just like the extremes of a deluge and the sweltering sun.

However, my favorite, and sometime philosophical compass is his longform poem — मोको कहां ढूँढे रे बन्दे !

मोको कहां ढूँढे रे बन्दे
मैं तो तेरे पास में
ना तीरथ मे ना मूरत में
ना एकान्त निवास में
ना मंदिर में ना मस्जिद में
ना काबे कैलास में
मैं तो तेरे पास में बन्दे
मैं तो तेरे पास में

ना मैं जप में ना मैं तप में
ना मैं बरत उपास में
ना मैं किरिया करम में रहता
नहिं जोग सन्यास में
नहिं प्राण में नहिं पिंड में
ना ब्रह्याण्ड आकाश में
ना मैं प्रकुति प्रवार गुफा में
नहिं स्वांसों की स्वांस में
खोजि होए तुरत मिल जाउं
इक पल की तालास में
कहत कबीर सुनो भई साधो
मैं तो हूं विश्वास में

Translation:

Why do you search for me elsewhere, my son!
If you seek me, look inside.
Neither with pilgrimages, nor with idols,
Nor with solitude do I abide.
I am not fond of temples or mosques,
In Kaaba or Kailasa, I do not reside.
I have always been with you, my friend.
If you seek me, look inside.

Prayers, invocations, fasts, or rituals,
Everything you can lay aside.
Not over the body, or the soul,
Not over the earth or sky do I preside.
I can’t be found in caves or whirlpools,
Or in the life force allied.
If you sincerely pursue me,
You will find me in a single stride.
Kabir says, “heed my words!”
Just with faith am I gratified.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/yw8g4h6xq1sc0z3o', 'title': 'What are the best poems written by Kabir Das?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'कबीर/Kabir ji was a poet without equals.

Samriddhi Sinha,6y,What are the best poems written by you after your breakup?,"I guess a lot of you must be familiar with the page The Scribbled Stories on Facebook. Well the following poem was written in response to one of their micro tales. This was written close to after a month after my breakup

Picture Courtesy: The Scribbled Stories

And here is my poem in response to their tale

I bowed down to your anger,
not once, not twice, but every-time
it showed up in an otherwise calm being.
I bowed down to your anger,
cause after the tumultuous raging storm,
that calm self would return.
I bowed down to your anger,
cause when you are finally out of its clutches,
you would place my head on your lap
and run your fingers through my hair.
I bowed down to you anger,
so that I could close my eyes,
in utter bliss as your fingers
drew curls out of my otherwise straight hair.

I bowed down to your anger,
just like everytime,
however the anger wasn’t there to be found.
The calm self was still calm,
but now emotionless.
I was shoved down naked to the steel floor,
trampled on over and over again.
I still bowed down to your anger,
hoping this too shall pass.
I was waiting for you to pull me
to your bosom and soak in all my pain.

I was left waiting on the icy cold floor.
