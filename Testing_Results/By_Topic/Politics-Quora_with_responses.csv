Samantha Kelly,Updated 1y,Do pro-choice people see fetuses as human beings? Why or why not?,"I spent 5 years getting and being pregnant. Only one pregnancy resulted in a living child. My son is now 15. The others all died on their own or were terminated at the hospital, sometimes violently, nearly taking me with them (2 ectopic), all tragically.

Each and every one of those pregnancies were planned and desperately wanted. To me, each one was my baby. To me, each was a potential human being.

I was willing to risk my own death for potential life by repeatedly getting pregnant, but was completely unwilling to accept that same risk once there was no longer a viable potential life inside me. That is why I have one living biological child, one adopted child, and five more that never made it to the world.

As a woman…as a human…I don’t care when life begins, or when an embryo becomes a fetus, or when a fetus becomes a baby during a pregnancy. Living humans are allowed to decide how they want to use their own bodies and their own internal organs. They are allowed to decide when or if they are willing to sacrifice themselves for another. This is not a public decision. It is a personal decision.

Every child should be born wanted. And every woman who sacrifices her body to grow a baby, should be a parent by choice, not by force. I am uncompromising on this. Anything less is a breach of human rights. Anything less is a form of slavery.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/24j150kicxqw7bmy', 'title': 'Do pro-choice people see fetuses as human beings?

Swatanshu Shekhar Singh,3y,What is the best example of a PM and opposition leader duo who worked for the betterment of the country? Share a picture also.,"India's economy was bankrupt in 1991.

The then Prime Minister Narsimha Rao called Finance Minister Manmohan Singh and asked how much money is there in the treasury, Manmohan Ji's answer was that only 9 days we can run the country, that much money is left.

On this, Narasimha Rao ji asked how to deal with this situation? Manmohan Singh said that the value of the country's rupee should have to fall by 20%. Narasimha ji said, okay call the meeting of the cabinet and get approval. Manmohan ji got up and started going towards his room.

After going a few steps away, he turned back and said to Narasimha Rao that if the cabinet convenes the meeting, we will not be able to take these tough decisions. All ministers will address the vote bank.

Narasimha ji told Manmohanji that right now you go to your room. After 20 minutes, the secretary went to Manmohanji in his room by giving him a letter and in that letter.Narasimha Rao Ji had written, Done!!

Later, when he asked that what had happened in 20 minutes that you had surprised everyone, including the Cabinet meeting, then Narasimhav ji had said that I had spoken to Atal ji and done it.

Means you look at Atal ji was more than his cabinet, PM knew that Atal ji will speak in the interest of the country. It happens that after the announcement of the Nationalist Opposition and that drastic decision, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not organize a protest movement, but supported the immediate Congress government to bring the country's economy back on track.

Gone those Politicians, gone those day…

Derrick Murray,Updated 5y,Why do people stare at you?,"I am a black African studying in India. Basically,i'm a foreigner.

This is me

Every time I take a walk outside campus people stare at me (well, not everyone).

At first it was a gruesome experience for me but nowdays I'm used to it.

I think it's often out of curiosity or, needless to say, out of stupid reasons. Sometimes when people stared at me, especially kids i would greet them or wink at them and say “ Yo bro aap kaise hain ?” and the reply would be amazing. I would get a broad smile or perhaps the conversation would go deeper especially if I'm not in a hurry. A new friendship would be made ASAP!

However, i do appreciate it so much when somebody just starts up a conversation with me instead of giving stares. I am free minded and can discuss just anything.

I am not bragging in any way or trying to make a big deal out of it. Also being a black African in India ain't something making me so special. I didn't say everyone stares at me and by the way, i have met quite a good number of friends. Finally, please disagree constructively.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9ihvr3tfdm8y7k25', 'title': 'Why do people stare at you?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""I am a black African studying in India.

In this picture i am with my twin brother. My brother is 3 minutes elder than me. Same cloth, same haircut and same face. This is the reason why even unknown people stare at us.

Let me share one story with you.

This is the picture of Ayodhya temple. Our family planned a trip to Ayodhya. This trip turned out to a little different trip. When our family entered in the temple, people were looking and smiling at us. I thought that people were watching other things not us.

Then suddenly some people came to us and ask me “Are you both twins ?”

I answered “Yes.”

They smiled and said in loud voice “ Luv and Kush in Ayodhya.”

Many people were smiling with joy while watching. That trip was funny and lovely too.

From childhood we are people’s mode of attraction.

We always dress in similar cloth.

We always stay together.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,5y,"Given an option, which country will you move to and why?","Thanks for asking — but I would just settle in India, even though I could practically move to any country I want.

US is probably the one country outside of India I loved the most. I had the chance to get a US greencard — my colleagues and classmates from India have become citizens by now — but I have declined to even apply. I dodged the bullet everytime my paralegal at Microsoft pushed me those forms to sign.

I could have had a PR from Canada or many of the European countries. I love visiting those countries and doing business there, but not considered settling. Middle eastern countries like UAE also don’t interest me as a place to settle, just as a place to setup subsidiary business.

I fly thrice a week and out of the country every month — but India is where I would love to come back every time. Not because of family or friends (I have more family and friends outside India than inside), ageing parents or a family business to take. I have none of those issues. Not because I hated the US — I love it.

We have a historic opportunity to get India out of its temporary state of poverty. That challenge looks an amazing thing to solve. As an engineer I want to solve toughest problems, as an entrepreneur I want to take the biggest markets and as an amateur historian I want to be on the history books.

Krishna Suryakanth,Updated 4y,Has Narendra Modi successfully polarised Hindu votes?,"Let me illustrate the whole story with the help of Fair & Lovely.

Fair & Lovely was launched in 1975 by Hindustan Unilever. Unfortunately, this product was only for females. Males who wanted to look fair had no other option. Some used to manage their urges by using this female product. This is how 30 years passed.

Emami noticed the domination of Fair & Lovely in Indian market. However, it realised that nearly 50% of the market, that is male gender, is left untargeted. So in 2005, Emami introduced Fair & Handsome, for men. They started discouraging men using female fairness creams via ads. In the end, they captured the market easily.

Now tell me, did Emami polarise the market? Maybe a little. However, actual polarisation began in 1975 when only female gender was targetted.

Similarly, in politics, the actual polarisation began on the day when separate laws were drafted for Muslims. BJP has just targeted a community that was not targeted by anybody.

If Congress had taken care of Hindu interests also, then there would have been no scope for Modi to rise. Modi would have been in Gujarat.

In short, the seeds of Hindutva were actually sown by Congress. RSS, VHP and BJP have only watered it.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/9c5splzhwvfmry2n', 'title': 'Has Narendra Modi successfully polarised Hindu votes?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Let me illustrate the whole story with the help of Fair & Lovely.\n\nFair & Lovely was launched in 1975 by Hindustan Unilever.

This is how 30 years passed.\n\nEmami noticed the domination of Fair & Lovely in Indian market. However, it realised that nearly 50% of the market, that is male gender, is left untargeted. So in 2005, Emami introduced Fair & Handsome, for men. They started discouraging men using female fairness creams via ads. In the end, they captured the market easily.\n\nNow tell me, did Emami polarise the market? Maybe a little. However, actual polarisation began in 1975 when only female gender was targetted.\n\nSimilarly, in politics, the actual polarisation began on the day when separate laws were drafted for Muslims. BJP has just targeted a community that was not targeted by anybody.\n\nIf Congress had taken care of Hindu interests also, then there would have been no scope for Modi to rise.

Shefali Naidu,5y,What is wrong with our society today?,"Aashi is a young woman who just got married. Her husband had been the most ideal bachelor and his mother-in-law praised him a lot.

Her husband was a gentle, caring and wonderful husband. The only thing that Aashi didn't understand was why would he never initiate to have sex.

At first, Aashi thought she was getting the space every bride craves for but the duration of no physical touch made her crave for him. She made a move putting her shyness aside when he said he is tired but ultimately made love in a hurry so as to finish the job.

Aashi couldn't sleep that night.

Three months passed and her husband had made love to her only twice, both the time she had begged and pleaded with him. Aashi knew something was wrong. She asked him to visit her therapist but he brushed off her advice.

Her parents in law were pressuring for a baby. She didn't know whom should she confide such a big thing.

She made up her mind to tell her mother-in-law.

Her mother-in-law listened to her say and when Aashi finished her complaint she got a slap on her face.

“How dare you say things like this to me? My son is not handicapped. You must have said something to make him dislike you. He is a man. And an able man at that. Don't give me excuses for your incapability to produce children.”

Aashi cried and decided to tell her mother.

“Don't you feel ashamed to talk to me about this thing, Aashi? You have the power to make him come to you. Do something. Please don't ask me. Just have a baby. And then even if he doesn't do it, it would be fine.”

“Fine? I have the urge too.”

“Shut up! You are a woman. What craving you have? And don't you talk on this topic with me again.”

Aashi sat on the bed with the phone still near her ear, unable to understand.

Aashi was unhappy in the marriage. But could she think of asking for a divorce on no physical intimacy grounds? Would her parents and relatives let her do that? No. They won't. They will tell her to adjust. Because that's why women are born. To adjust in every stage of life.

Woman have a sexual drive just as men do. To say a woman shouldn't think of sex but should just take it as a procedure to bear children is ridiculous. And this isn't something about a village or a town related instance. It happens in cities too.

Everyone wants grandchildren but no one wants to talk about the method through which we get children. A woman has to suppress her sexual desires.

A friend confided in me how she craved for intimacy but her workaholic husband was least interested. And when she told this to her mother, her mother was baffled on why was she complaining. That it was a good thing.

But let's just turn the tables for a second. What would happen if a man complains that his wife doesn't give him the physical pleasure. How would his parents and his wife's parents react?

Got my point?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/b7ptm6ufyc0o1ig2', 'title': 'What is wrong with our society today?', 'score': {'original': 0.26485, 'ai': 0.73515}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Aashi is a young woman who just got married.

Smita Mishra,Updated 5y,What is wrong with our society today?,"A few months back, I was in a beauty salon getting my eyebrows shaped.

Two girls enter and make themselves comfortable there and try to decide the service they could take.

A few minutes later, someone called them from outside. He was an autorickshaw driver.

He complained to them about giving him a critically torn 500 Rupee note.

They tried to convince him a lot. He didn't agree.

They asked him to take on some other day. But he didn't agree. How could he possibly have known where they lived? Even if he did, it was fair on his part.

It was merely 30 Rupees.

They got angry with him and started to taunt.

They didn't understand one thing. It was his work, time and money. If that note didn't work out, he might lose 500 Rupees plus his precious time.

500 is a big thing for an auto driver.

Now comes the funniest part.

They asked the salon owner for 30 Rupees and paid the driver and paid the owner through paytm since owner didn't take the 500 Rupees note either.

Suddenly one of the girl asked, “Aunty please batao is note ko kaise chala sakte h?”

(Aunty how can we use this useless 500 Rupee note?)

Aunty replied, “Beta ek kaam karo, ye note muje de do. Mere husband bank me kaam karte hai. Notes ki gaddio k beech me kahi daal denge, pata bhi nahi chalega”.

(Dear, give this note to me and my husband who works in a bank will make sure to slide this useless note in the note bundles)

I was shocked to hear that.

Do you get what's wrong with our society?

Most of us don't like to face problems but create one for others and think, “Wo ab uski problem hai, wo dekhe”.

(It's his problem now, he will sort it out)

She could have taken the effort to go to the bank and get the note exchanged but she wanted to get rid of her problem at the cost of making it someone else's problem.

Nobody wants to solve anything in a decent way because we don't want to worry about it and waste our time.

This was just one example. There are several.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,7y,"Even after 70 years of stable democracy, why is the Indian political system so corrupt and governance inefficient?","I’m not sure that the DAWN op-ed: Three questions from Pakistan that India needs to answer
 is a sincere one. For DAWN’s standards, it was of pretty poor quality.

First, the author asks how India can be corrupt if it is also democratic. The assumption is that democracy is a magic wand that removes all illnesses. For its size and poverty, India ranks fairly well in the Corruption Perceptions Index
. 100 nations [including China and Pakistan] rank behind India. Of the poorer countries, only 4 [Bhutan, Senegal, Lesotho, Rwanda] rank ahead of India and all of them are very small. India is corrupt, but most of the world is far more corrupt.

Second, the author wonders how India can have religious violence when it is secular. Again, the assumption is that having a secular Constitution would magically bring about all the necessary security infrastructure such as a modern police force to contain riots. For the size of its population, India’s religious violence rate is quite low. And way lower than Pakistan. The status of Muslims in India is infinitely better than that of Hindus in Pakistan.

Third, the author asks how the people can love their army in a democratic setup. I guess the author knows nothing of US. Democracy doesn’t mean you hate the military. In fact, being in a dangerous neighborhood with a key terrorism sponsor next to us, Indians are quite thankful that their army contains most of the bad stuff trying to get past our borders.

All in all, a very poor article. India has its share of problems and is poor, given the circumstances of the past few hundred years. However, when it is compared to its non-democratic neighbors, India fares way better.

Manas Saha,Updated 6y,What are some of the costliest mistakes ever made in history?,"The time when a harmless Microsoft office font forced a Prime minister of a country to resign.

In 2015, an anonymous source leaked 11.5 million financial documents from law firm and corporate service provider company Mossack Fonseca. This leak is known as Panama Papers.

The leak reveals that high profile politicians across the globe, including 12 national leaders are buying overseas assets for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions.

Not only that, it was also found that the families and close associates of the politicians are also exploiting the system and evading tax using offshore tax havens.

Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the leak (image courtesy: Wikipedia)

Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif was one of the accused in the leak.

Panama leak connected Nawaz Sharif with two objectionable properties in London.

When the case went to Pakistani supreme court, Nawaz Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz submitted two documents in the court. The documents were dated back to 2006 and they were supposed to prove that Sharif’s family has nothing to do with the properties in London.

The blunder:

The documents submitted to the team dated to 2006, but were written in Calibri, a font that was not commercially available before January 31, 2007.

Microsoft word used Times New Roman font as the default font before 2007. From Office 2007 and onwards Calibri was made the default font for Microsoft Word.

This proved that the documents submitted by Sharif’s family were fake and forged.

There were also other evidences against Sharif, but the font blunder significantly weakened his case in Pakistan supreme court.

Sharif’s family lost the case and On 28 July 2017, Sharif was disqualified for public office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Sharif submitted his resignation on the following day.

A simple Microsoft word font changed a government!

Bonus fun fact:

Calibri is a Sans-Serif font. or you can call it Sans-Sharif now ;-)

Update:

Some friends are asking what a sans-serif font is. In typography, a “Serif” is the extended edges of an alphabet. The below image can demonstrate it better.

“Sans” means “without”. A font which does not have the Serifs are sans serif fonts.

Times New Roman is a serif font. Calibri is a sans-serif font.

The font which Quora uses is Tiempos Text, and it is also a serif font. Serif fonts are easier for readability. This is why Amazon uses a serif font called Bookerly in Kindle ebook readers.

On the other hand Facebook, Twitter and most other sites use sans-serif fonts. Wikipedia uses Serif font for the article title only, and the content of the article is in sans-serif fonts.

Edit -

He was actually not disqualified because of the font issue, but due to holding a public office during his tenure as prime minister.

Aman Gupta,Updated 4y,What is wrong with Indian Politics?,"We Indians don't deserve this country.

Indian Airlines Flight 814, commonly known as IC 814 was an Indian Airline's Airbus A300 en route from Tribhuvan 
International 
Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal to Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, India on Friday, 24 December 1999, when it was hijacked and flown to several locations before landing in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen
 was accused of the hijacking with the support and active assistance from ISI
.[1]
[2]
[3]

The demands of terrorists were 1400 crores and release of 36 terrorist who were in jail.

The hijack forced the Indian government release three captive islamic terrorist- Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, Ahmed Omar Saed Sheik and Maulana Masood Azhar(founder of terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad).

When people were protesting after kandhar hijack to force government to full fill every demand of the terrorists then widow of squadron commander Ajay Ahuja who martyred in Kargil war came voluntarily to make the country understand that nation is more important than the family, government is trying its best to handle and negotiate with the terrorists and we should not pressurize the government to accept the demands of the terrorists.

People shouted:

“Ye pagal vidhwa sabko vidhwa karana chahti hai”

“Are kargil kya kashmir bhi dena pade to de do”

“Bhag ja yaha se vidhwa”

(Translation: if kashmir is required to give then give it also, this mad widow wants everyone to become a widow, go away from here you widow)

This is how some Indians treated the family members of a martyr who died for our security when our own family was in danger.

Selfish citizens and opportunist politicians made the country to bow down and accept their demands after some negotiations.

Nation first then should be your religion and family! 🇮🇳","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3yb9djvsxohr4zn6', 'title': 'What is wrong with Indian Politics?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""We Indians don't deserve this country.\n\nIndian Airlines Flight 814, commonly known as IC 814 was an Indian Airline's Airbus A300 en route from Tribhuvan \nInternational \nAirport in Kathmandu, Nepal to Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, India on Friday, 24 December 1999, when it was hijacked and flown to several locations before landing in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

Dr. Shashank Sneham,Updated 5y,What is wrong with our society today?,"Its a baby Girl!

We were in the operation theatre today to watch the first Caesarian section delivery of our career!

After completing the formalities, the operation finally began. All the steps were being operated smoothly.

Meanwhile I promised my colleague standing by my side that I will throw a treat if its a girl child! :)

(Yeah, I'm a little biased) ;)

Then came the moment when the amniotic fluid started oozing out rapidly , was being sucked up by the machine and baby's head became visible to us.

The doctor slowly pulled her out, and yes! It was a baby girl! I was happy that I am going to lose some bucks this evening ;)

The first cry of the baby was the best music I have heard in my entire life!

“Welcome to this world champ”, we wished her.

I was happy, until a moment later when the mother of the child asked the doctor,- “What is it, doctor?”

“It’s a baby Girl, and it’s healthy!”, said the doc as we were waiting to see her reaction on this one.

She went pale! The gloom on her face became evident! SHE WAS SAD, INDEED!

This really hurt me. All those claims of a developing society seemed false to me at that moment. I went blank.

My colleague felt the same, went out of the OT to relax herself out of this. There were relatives of the mother waiting outside for “the news”.

“Its a baby girl!”, they heard and all of a sudden there was an awkward silence around there. Not just that they were sad, they were actually consoling each other, “Its ok!”

Looking all this, I was indeed taken aback. I kept saying these words to my friends- “The way these people are reacting on the birth of this baby, I wish she grows up to do wonders one day. She has my blessings and wishes. I truly pray to God!”

Yes, this is indeed what's wrong with our society today.

But the bigger problem is- this reaction is not unique! This is a normal reaction on the birth of almost every single girl child in our society!

Edit: Thanks to brother Suraj Rawat for suggesting correction regarding the use of word gloom! Appreciated!","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/us24v0rjy6maqkge', 'title': 'What is wrong with our society today?', 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Its a baby Girl!\n\nWe were in the operation theatre today to watch the first Caesarian section delivery of our career!\n\nAfter completing the formalities, the operation finally began.

David W. Rudlin,1y,What is seriously wrong with Marjorie Taylor Greene? Did you see her behavior during Biden’s speech? How did she ever get elected?,"She’s a rude, ignorant, nasty troll.

But she knows what sells.

And in her district, and her party, what sells is “owning the libs.”

It’s not at all clear how this helps anyone. I think it has something to do with being seen as “strong,” in the same way bringing an AR-15 into a Starbuck’s makes a pitifully endowed little boy feel like a man.

Stunts like Mags’ are what get you on Fox News. They get you invited to CPAC, where everyone studiously avoids asking Matt Schlapp about the accusations he repeatedly groped a young male staffer. They get you speaking gigs at conventions held by Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist and misogynist who managed to get himself thrown off Twitter in less than 24 hours after being allowed back on.

Even Elon ain’t a fan of Nazi fan-boys.

What she’s doing is really entertainment. She’s a spectacle, like the bearded lady at the circus. And she makes really bad people feel better about their hatred of anyone who isn’t just like them.

And it works. Here’s a woman who banged random guys at her gym while preaching about the sanctity of marriage. Hubby dumped her. She started banging guys from online-only news stations, thereby ensuring favorable coverage.

And now there’s somewhat serious talk about her being trump’s VP in 2024.

Fame. Attention. Money. Respect from the minority of Americans who don’t realize what a bad joke she is.

So what if you have to make a complete ass out of yourself to get that stuff?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/ygnocq1je0lpd235', 'title': 'What is seriously wrong with Marjorie Taylor Greene?

Amy Winn VOTE BLUE,Updated Jan 17,"Why do liberals want to force everyone to believe there was no election fraud? In any democratic society, if elections were deemed fraudulent they should be nullified and held again. But no, libs want to force people to believe they were fair. Why?","Don't you think it's odd that Trump never complained about the election results when he won? Don't you think it's odd that many Republicans on the ballots in 2020 won their elections? Don't you think it's odd that Trump claimed that the election was stolen before a single vote was cast?

Don't you think it's strange that after three years, several recounts and 60 lawsuits, no voter fraud has been found…. except for a few Republicans?

Rudi Guiliani testified the had no evidence of any voter fraud. Fox news claimed that the voting machines were incorrect. They lied about it and were sued and had to pay 787 million dollars to the voting machine company for their lies.

Trump is a spoiled brat, a narcissist and a sore loser. He lied to his supporters about the election being stolen. He wanted to steal the election by having fake electors submit fraudulent documents. He called a Georgia official asking him to find 11,780 votes. He incited an insurrection on the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the votes. That all failed. He was the first president in history to refuse the peaceful transfer of power.

There was no election fraud. You were lied to. Trump was fact checked to have lied over 30,000 times in one term, and yet for some unknown reason, his supporters believe every word out of his fat orange lying face. It's just bizarre!!

Those who support Trump are misled. They are being used for donations for his legal fees and he will continue to lie to keep the money coming. He has sold everything from red MAGA hats and flags, to Trump mugshot tshirts, to silly trading cards, and his supporters fall for every single bit of it.

William Weir,Nov 13,"Why does everyone collectively agree to vote for mainstream presidential candidates? Both Biden and Trump are more or less the same, so why do leftists consider Biden to be simply the better of 2 evils, why not just vote for someone not evil at all?","Actually there probably haven’t been two Presidents back-to-back who were less alike in all of history.

Donald Trump entered office as the least-politically experienced President in history. Biden entered office as the most politically-experienced.

Trump failed to accomplish the bulk of his campaign promises. Biden has already accomplished virtually everything he promised.

Trump immediately slowed a strong economy, in 2018 ending the longest bull market in American history, in 2019 slowing the economy enough that the Fed started lowering interest rates for the first time since Bush was President, and in 2020 ushered in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Trump became the first President since Hoover to lose jobs and the first President in history to increase the deficit every year he was in office.

Biden immediately restarted a failed economy. We saw the fastest economic recovery in history, the Fed has repeatedly raised interest rates to try to slow the booming economy, and we’ve seen the best GDP growth in decades. Biden has already set a record for most jobs created in a single Presidential term, and is only the second President in history to decrease the deficit every year of his presidency (at least so far).

No one sane thinks Biden is evil, and no one sane thinks Trump is good. This isn’t a “lesser of two evils” situation. It’s good vs. evil, qualified vs. unqualified, and competent vs. incompetent.

But even if you’re dumb enough to think Biden is doing a bad job, we have a two party system that can’t be shaken, so voting third party is a waste. Either you vote for the idiot who collapsed the economy, set records for corruption, and who is currently on trial; or you vote for the candidate who repaired the damage his twice-impeached predecessor did in record time.

Rohini Ramachandran,5y,"How do pro-choice people respond to the question ""What if your mom had aborted you?""","I know the answer to this one.

If my mother had aborted me, she would have completed her Master’s degree, and got a much better job than what she currently has.

I have fairly young parents. My father and mother got married when they were 23 and 21 respectively. My father got a great job very young, he was ‘settled and ready to get married’ by Indian standards, and he was smitten when he met my mother. At that time my mother had just completed her Bachelor’s degree and agreed to get married, on a condition that my father should be supportive about her studying more.

She went on to get a second Bachelor’s degree in Education. She was 23 and working her way through a Master’s degree when she was pregnant with me. And thanks to me, she was not able to complete her program. We often joke in our house that instead of getting an M.A., she got to be an Amma (Mother).

So to answer the question, I’m sure my mother would have been better off if she aborted me.

I fail to understand what this question has to do with pro-choice philosophy though. First of all, you wouldn’t exist to complain if you were aborted. And who wants to be born if they would have caused physical or psychological harm to their mother?","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/kc2myjue81asg6qo', 'title': 'How do pro-choice people respond to the question ""What if your mom had aborted you?""', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I know the answer to this one.\n\nIf my mother had aborted me, she would have completed her Master’s degree, and got a much better job than what she currently has.\n\nI have fairly young parents.

Robert Side,1y,"In other countries with socialized healthcare, why are they comfortable with the government managing their healthcare? The government shouldn’t be responsible (or trusted) to provide healthcare for its people.","My wife is worried about melanoma. We pay a private clinic $209.00 once a year to map her whole body for suspicious moles etc. We do this because it is a dedicated expert service, and takes pressure off the GP system. This year they found one.

Off to the doctor, who agreed to whip it off that afternoon. So a 15m consultation, 30 minute operation, nurse assisting, etc. Total cost $12. The excised flesh was sent to a diagnostic lab for analysis. Unfortunately positive. Total cost $0. Doctor called, said a referral to a specialist surgeon was needed.

This took place the following week: 30 minute consultation, further surgery was scheduled. Total cost $6.00 for parking.

Although the surgery was deemed a priority, it was 2 weeks before it was scheduled as it had to be coordinated between plastic surgeons, radiologists, and overnight bed availability. On the day of surgery, there was an hour’s scanning to locate lymph nodes, then 4 hour’s surgery to remove a larger area around the melanoma, plus 4 lymph nodes, followed by an overnight stay on a ward in a private room.

The next day she was discharged, total cost $3.00 for parking.

Praveen SV,Updated 5y,What is wrong with our society today?,"Recent days, when ever I log in to Facebook, every where people are discussing about sexual harassment that has been going on against women in India and what laws we needs to implement to prevent this.

As like any other Indian, I was too ashamed of innocent girls suffering at the hands of some brutal animals. It is really applaudable that people are raising issues, concerning this important thing.

Now look at this man.

He is Digambar Gaikwad. He is a Director of Agriculture Department in Pune. One of his co-worker Sunanda Kurhade accused him of molesting her and Digambar was arrested on the very same evening, Sunanda filed the complaint.

Digambar was shocked at the complaint. He was released on bail, but he (57) opted for voluntary retirement in order to prevent himself from shame, he will have to endure. But later chief judicial magistrate after conducting internal inquiries, concluded Digamabar is not guilty.

Still that bi*** Sunanda went on to High court, but high court too ruled out. It was later reveled, that bi*** Sunanda filed complaint against Digamabar, so that he will be suspended and she will be promoted to his position.

Digamabr later filed defamation case against Sunanda. He lost his 3 years service and endless mental and emotional torture because of that sick bi***, Digambar’s co-worker recalls the incident saying that, ‘Digambar indeed treats Sunanda as his daughter’.

Despite proved innocent, what Digambar suffered because of that is something much much terrible,

Top Woman Officer Asked To Pay Rs 10 Lakh As Fine For Filing False Molestation Case

This is just one case. We know what happened in Zaira’s case. And these were not the only two.

53.2 per cent rape cases filed between April 2013-July 2014 false, says DCW

Indian court rules that men need protection from women making unsubstantiated domestic harassment claims

Does India have a problem with false rape claims?

So here comes my question. Why the society, that was quick enough to respond, when the victim was a woman but fails to do the same, when the victim tends to be a man?

Doesn’t men’s life matter in India? Or is it the curse to give birth to a boy in India? What safety measures, Indian judiciary system is providing for the men who are suffering because of some fu***** bi*** like Sunanda?

Looking at the statistics, don’t you feel, India is becoming a very dangerous place to be a man?? Where are those feminists, who are screaming for equal rights voice their opinions on this??

Getting accused of sexual violence, being sent to jail, FIR, media going crazy, even before justice was delivered as like in Zaira’s case. This is something that is as worse as sexually molested. You are literally killing the soul of the innocent men.

But does this matters to so called Indian society? Fuk**** not. Indian men are really doomed and should be very very careful, even with your co-workers.

For this answer, I am sure gonna receive a lot of hate comments and hardly any positive response, but do I care? Hell no. The truth is Man is just a forgotten gender in India. When a bit** can simply file one false complaint and have ability to destroy the life of a man, then it means Men are doomed.

Rajan Singh,Updated 5y,What is the main cause of corruption in India?,"One common question I faced when I was serving in the IPS was, “Why is there so much corruption in government/police?”

Let me start by asking you a question. Imagine you are building a power plant or constructing a high-rise building (say in Mumbai). You have put in all the applications to get the government approval, but you don’t bribe anyone or put any pressure, and just follow the process.

How long will it take to get all the approvals?

One month? One year? 5 years?

Call me a cynic, but I think there is a good chance it won’t happen in your lifetime. You will need approval of 20–25 departments, and you may not even have heard of some of them.

The bureaucracy’s real power is the power to obstruct. This brute power to wreak havoc in lives of citizens is the one of the root causes of corruption in India.

Let us dig deeper.

Our red tape ridden government machinery has evolved from the Licence Permit Raj, a monstrous life sucking machine, even if well intentioned. Here is how it works.
If you need anything done, you need approval from every department on the planet, even if the relevance maybe in one in a million cases. Revenue, fire-force, police, pollution control, environment… the list goes on. Everyone has to say yes. And they can take as much time as they want.
Since there are so many laws and rules, a babu can block things for hundred different reasons. Nobody is fully sure about things.
See below a report in Wall Street Journal, where we are top of the charts in red tape.
Here is an example: Now, say you need approval from 20 government departments. In each department, say 5 people go through your file. While none of them can say yes, each can put an obstacle. So you are facing 100 guys who can stop your dream project.
Unless each of those 100 guys is sensible and honest, your approval is in trouble. And trust me, you will be in trouble.
I will give you an example. In 2005 I was SP Security and I came across a file in which a resort owner had asked for permission of use of wireless walkie-talkie for coordination among staff in a resort near Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. Our Special Branch head-constable reported that there may be LTTE sympathisers in that area who could snatch the walkie-talkie sets and use it for illegal purposes. By this logic, no technology can be used by anyone since everything can be misused. This file was stuck for years because of this.
In short, everybody can block you. So nothing moves, unless you pay up. As they say, “Nothing is allowed, but everything is possible.”
Another important point is that not everybody is corrupt. In Kerala, most IAS and IPS officers are honest. Even lower down, there is a mix of honest and corrupt guys. But even an honest officer will not be able to stop others from corrupt activities, when so much negative power is vested in them. We have a deadwood of a system.
Why are our corruption scandals typically 100–1000 times larger than than those in rich countries like US, France, or Israel?
What is the scandal involving Israeli PM and his wife? $100,000 (Rs 75 lacs). And that is for ordering free food! You will get beaten up if you offer such minuscule bribe to even a low level political functionary in India.
Such massive corruption is not possible without blessings and support of the political class at the top.
Why is the political class so corrupt? Is it just bad people? No, there are deeper reasons.
Political parties need money to operate. And that money has to come from somewhere.
Let us say a party organizes a dharna or rally for which 10,000 people have to be brought. You will have to spend on marketing (loudspeaker announcements, house visits), food, transportation, and in some cases liquor. Assuming Rs 500 per person, the cost of a 10,000 person rally is Rs 50 lacs. I suspect it is even higher.
Each party is running an army of workers and a massive machinery, which has to be well-oiled.
Election campaigns: Crores are needed to fight each parliamentary seat. We have not even talked about the horsetrading and things like that.
Where does that money come from? Donations cover it to an extent. But it is often not nearly enough. Rest comes from contracts, government appointments, purchases, roads and infra, government schemes, licenses and approvals, you name it...
What about political party workers?
How much salary do they get? Maybe a few thousand rupees. Do they live on bread and water? No.
While some are ideologically motivated, many become corrupt over time. Why would they come to your rallies and stand in hot sun, throw stones, and get beaten up by police? How do you compensate them?
Senior guys get perks like Chairmanship of PSUs or other positions, where they can make money. Other guys just use their influence and act as middlemen for everything. From contracts, transfers, recruitments, and peddling favours, they make money.
In essence, if you are an honest politician, your followers will be poor and unhappy. I have seen honest politicians struggle to stay relevant.
Indian government spends a lot. Too much money to be siphoned off. Too many schemes, too many projects. Look at fodder scam. I am not even getting into all the ‘spending for the poor’.
Before we blame the politicians and wash off our hands, just wait. What about rest of us?
Do we attach any social stigma to corruption? Let us say, if a guy is accused of double murder, he may find it difficult to get a bride for his son. But if he has piled up hundred crores through corruption, there is absolutely no such problem. He will have a queue of people lined up.
Even though we rail against corruption, we elect corrupt politicians. We want our neighbour to be honest and all laws applied to him. With ourselves, we are much more lenient.
The reality is, ‘corrupt is the new smart’. The corrupt guy is the ‘practical guy’.
Enforcement is poor because investigation and prosecution is also done by the people who come from the same society.
It is like trying to wash dirt on your white shirt with muddy water. Good luck with that!
Also, the prosecution process and evidence required is very complicated. Even God would not be able to get most cases convicted.

We don’t have universal healthcare or education, but we do have universal corruption. Decentralized, and democratized.

The way we all complain against corruption, it looks like it is perpetrated by aliens. It is as if our politicians were imposed on us by the British. Really?

We have built this country. We own it. And we are responsible for all the good and evil around us. If not through complicity, through our silence. The shame is ours. The blame is ours. This mess we are gifting to our children, is ours.

No amount of waving of national flag, no amount of donation to temples and churches, no amount of blaming politicians will wash this stain.

There has been way too much slogan shouting in public. What matters is what we do in our private lives.

Manu Pandey,2y,What is wrong with our society today?,"‘Society rapes a girl more than the rapist himself’

I recently saw a clip on Instagram from Satyamev Jayate where Kamla Bhasin was talking about being raped.

She talked about how society starts blaming the victim instead of the attacker.

She further said that society thinks that it’s a girl’s fault because she got raped and everyone from the society starts torturing and blaming the girl.

She further made a statement where she said that “It’s wrong to say that a woman loses her honour after being raped. Well, a woman’s honour doesn’t exist in her Vagina, it’s the rapist who loses his honour.”

Rapists should be ashamed of their deeds, it’s not a fault of a woman.

But our society doesn’t think this way. They think it’s a woman’s fault and she should be ashamed.

Well, we will never understand from what circumstances a girl goes through when she gets raped and when she gathers all her courage to stand up, we should support her.

No one is stronger than a girl who got raped and gathering her courage to stand up again.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/pcbhfzgx7aru514q', 'title': 'What is wrong with our society today?', 'score': {'original': 0.9987, 'ai': 0.0013}, 'blocks': [{'text': '‘Society rapes a girl more than the rapist himself’\n\nI recently saw a clip on Instagram from Satyamev Jayate where Kamla Bhasin was talking about being raped.\n\nShe talked about how society starts blaming the victim instead of the attacker.\n\nShe further said that society thinks that it’s a girl’s fault because she got raped and everyone from the society starts torturing and blaming the girl.\n\nShe further made a statement where she said that “It’s wrong to say that a woman loses her honour after being raped.

Jean-Marie Valheur,2y,What was the most ridiculous accusation to come out of the #MeToo movement?,"It has got to be the accusation against legendary singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. A woman alleged he had sexually abused her when she was just a teenager and Dylan in his early twenties. She gave a time and location for when the assault took place, and people got mighty worked up over the whole thing.

People were preparing their pitchforks, media got their panties in a bunch, surely some tabloids were smelling blood! Can we still listen to his songs, do we need to petition radio stations to stop playing them? You know, the usual questions one needs to confront when a legendary icon falls out of favor with the world. Do we cancel the man, do we cancel the art of the man, how can we best erase his entire existence from the face of the earth?

I was a bit scared for a moment. Like, legit ‘heart jumping up in my chest’ levels of scared, because to see Bob Dylan getting accused of something so heinous is rough. He’s a man I admire. The injustice of it also struck me… why on earth is there anyone alive today who would ‘cancel’ Dylan, in a world that has failed to cancel the likes of Andy Dick?[1]

Then, finally, words of relief came! Wisely and in typical Bob Dylan fashion, he did not immediately reply. He likes to leave people guessing a bit; like when he won a Nobel Prize for literature and sort of just… ignored the whole thing, for a while. When he did decide to finally dignify the accusation with a response? The whole story instantly died… because at the time of the supposed assault, Bob Dylan was not in the same country as the alleged victim, who claims the indecent attack happened in her parental home in America.

Bob Dylan had been in England, the girl in America. He was filming a documentary, for which he was being filmed pretty much 24/7. Rock solid alibi. Bob Dylan was lucky enough to avoid cancellation, or worse. And the world is a better place for it.

FSIN YANAO REPORTED ABOUT NAVALNY’S DEATH

Alexey served his sentence in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, in the famous “Polar Wolf” village of Kharp, where he was transferred from the Vladimir region and regularly ended up in a punishment cell.

Information about his death has been officially confirmed. The reason is being established.

Navalny felt unwell after a walk, almost immediately losing consciousness, reports the Federal Penitentiary Service for the region.

Emergency doctors confirmed the death of the convict.

The Federal Penitentiary Service presumably could have already sent a notification to the relatives and lawyer of the late Alexei Navalny.

One way or another, the examination begins and an interdepartmental commission is expected.

Relatives will be allowed to see the body, but it is unlikely that the body will be given away for burial until all examinations are completed. The admission of Western experts to the investigation is being discussed. Even from a number of unfriendly countries.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/rlwet706uc8f21d9', 'title': 'What is the political system in Russia and why do Russians not protest more often?', 'score': {'original': 0.9896, 'ai': 0.0104}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'RUSSIAN JAILED OPPOSITION POLITICIAN ALEXEI NAVALNY IS DEAD\n\nFSIN YANAO REPORTED ABOUT NAVALNY’S DEATH\n\nAlexey served his sentence in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, in the famous “Polar Wolf” village of Kharp, where he was transferred from the Vladimir region and regularly ended up in a punishment cell.\n\nInformation about his death has been officially confirmed.

Ajax Mackintosh,Updated 5y,What is wrong with our society today?,"I got suspended from school until August on Tuesday. Now, you’re probably thinking, damn they fucked up, or they must be a bad kid.

Nope. I maintain passing grades, I may not be a genius, but I’m passing all of my classes with a B or a C. I wasn’t rude to a teacher, I didn’t get into any fights, I did nothing wrong that should be considered wrong.

Now, do you want to hear why I was suspended?

I went to my friends for help when I was feeling suicidal and was scared of my mom.

Yup. That’s right.

I asked for help, and got punished for it.

My mom is abusive, both emotionally and physically. She calls me worthless, tells me I shouldn’t exist, and hits me regularly. Because of this, I have some pretty fun anxiety attacks and some odd triggers, such as people moving quickly around me, doors opening unexpectedly, and loud noises when I am asleep.

I have some pretty fucking great friends. They’ve let me sleep on them during our free periods, they bring me food because my mom doesn’t like to feed me. And they comfort me when I have anxiety attacks or am feeling suicidal.

Recently, my mother’s abuse got worse, and they got more worried, and, being the wonderful, amazing, caring people they are, they told adults. January of this year, the first CPS report was filed.

I was called a liar by my mother, and CPS went along with it, as did the Police.

A second report was filed in February, which was again ignored due to my mothers insistence that I was lying. But this time, we had photos, and when the report was filed, I had a bruise on my face.

My mom said the bruise was fake, just make up (even though it clearly wasn’t), and all of my photos were fakes.

Again, I was called a liar and my claims were dismissed.

About a week ago, a third report was filed.

This time, my friends refused to allow it to go unanswered. They’ve made phone calls, talked to so many people, teachers, everyone.

Two weeks ago, I attempted suicide and was taken to the Crisis Center. Not by my mother. She actually tried to turn the police away when my friend got his mom to call in a welfare check.

I continued to be depressed due to the fact that nothing was working.

I am seeing a therapist.

But on Tuesday I got suspended indefinitely from school, to be re-evaluated in August.

Their reason?

I worry my friends and it distracts them. The police officer I met with at one point forbid me from talking to them when I was scared or hurting anymore.

I informed my friends of this and got various responses ranging from “Fuck them” to “Hell no” to “I don’t care”.

Now to actually answer your question.

You wanna know what is wrong with our society today?

CPS listens to parents over children, even when the kids have evidence.

Depression and suicidal thoughts and anxiety is considered toxic and bad and a thing to be ashamed of.

That’s what’s fucking wrong.

EDIT #1

Holy shit, over 5k upvotes? That’s insane. Thank you all for supporting me through this, and for recognizing and spreading awareness that there is a serious issue with our society believing that things like depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts are something we should be embarrassed about, something that should be suffered through silently. Because nobody, not a single person, should ever have to fight through anything alone.

EDIT #2: 8/27/18

So the situation right now is this;

I left and went to a wilderness program for three months in an attempt to find better ways to handle my anxiety and suicidal-ness. When I came back, and requested to return to my school, I was told that I have yet to gain enough “insight” (whatever that means), and that they will not allow me back this fall. The current plan is for me to return in January, but that too is still up in the air. This fall, I am doing independent study work. What sucks the most right now is the fact that, well, I can’t do any of the stuff that I loved to do through my school. Additionally, I can’t see my friends very often, which sucks even more.

Thank you all for all of the up votes. We’re at over 16K right now, which I think really is amazing. The situation that I have been placed into really is sucky, and sharing it with more people helps to make sure that it does not happen to somebody else.

EDIT #3: 12/16/18

I didn’t get to go back.

I tried so, so damn hard. I did everything they asked, I got B+’s and A’s for the first time in my life. I worked my ass off, I went to therapists and I learned anxiety coping strategies. I learned how to combat my ADHD and I worked as hard as I could to become someone who could go back to that school.

But the reason I didn’t get to go back was because they felt that it was unhealthy for the community, and while I have made progress, I haven’t made enough progress.

I feel like I’ve lost everything that I was trying so damn hard to achieve. I loved that school with all of my heart. My friends are there. The activities I love to do are there. My freaking life is there.

And now that I’ve been officially told, non-negotiably, that I am never going to be allowed to return…I feel like my freaking life has been destroyed.

I’m never going to get to see my friends every day ever again. I’m never going to get to do extracurriculars with them ever again. I’m never going to be able to fucking graduate along side my closest friends in this whole damn world. And it hurts more than I ever possibly imagined.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tvby1lrp27fu4sjd', 'title': 'What is wrong with our society today?', 'score': {'original': 0.97775, 'ai': 0.02225}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I got suspended from school until August on Tuesday.

But this time, we had photos, and when the report was filed, I had a bruise on my face.\n\nMy mom said the bruise was fake, just make up (even though it clearly wasn’t), and all of my photos were fakes.\n\nAgain, I was called a liar and my claims were dismissed.\n\nAbout a week ago, a third report was filed.\n\nThis time, my friends refused to allow it to go unanswered. They’ve made phone calls, talked to so many people, teachers, everyone.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I attempted suicide and was taken to the Crisis Center. Not by my mother. She actually tried to turn the police away when my friend got his mom to call in a welfare check.\n\nI continued to be depressed due to the fact that nothing was working.\n\nI am seeing a therapist.\n\nBut on Tuesday I got suspended indefinitely from school, to be re-evaluated in August.\n\nTheir reason?\n\nI worry my friends and it distracts them. The police officer I met with at one point forbid me from talking to them when I was scared or hurting anymore.\n\nI informed my friends of this and got various responses ranging from “Fuck them” to “Hell no” to “I don’t care”.\n\nNow to actually answer your question.\n\nYou wanna know what is wrong with our society today?\n\nCPS listens to parents over children, even when the kids have evidence.\n\nDepression and suicidal thoughts and anxiety is considered toxic and bad and a thing to be ashamed of.\n\nThat’s what’s fucking wrong.\n\nEDIT #1\n\nHoly shit, over 5k upvotes? That’s insane. Thank you all for supporting me through this, and for recognizing and spreading awareness that there is a serious issue with our society believing that things like depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts are something we should be embarrassed about, something that should be suffered through silently. Because nobody, not a single person, should ever have to fight through anything alone.\n\nEDIT #2: 8/27/18\n\nSo the situation right now is this;\n\nI left and went to a wilderness program for three months in an attempt to find better ways to handle my anxiety and suicidal-ness. When I came back, and requested to return to my school, I was told that I have yet to gain enough “insight” (whatever that means), and that they will not allow me back this fall. The current plan is for me to return in January, but that too is still up in the air. This fall, I am doing independent study work. What sucks the most right now is the fact that, well, I can’t do any of the stuff that I loved to do through my school. Additionally, I can’t see my friends very often, which sucks even more.\n\nThank you all for all of the up votes. We’re at over 16K right now, which I think really is amazing. The situation that I have been placed into really is sucky, and sharing it with more people helps to make sure that it does not happen to somebody else.\n\nEDIT #3: 12/16/18\n\nI didn’t get to go back.\n\nI tried so, so damn hard. I did everything they asked, I got B+’s and A’s for the first time in my life. I worked my ass off, I went to therapists and I learned anxiety coping strategies. I learned how to combat my ADHD and I worked as hard as I could to become someone who could go back to that school.\n\nBut the reason I didn’t get to go back was because they felt that it was unhealthy for the community, and while I have made progress, I haven’t made enough progress.\n\nI feel like I’ve lost everything that I was trying so damn hard to achieve. I loved that school with all of my heart. My friends are there. The activities I love to do are there. My freaking life is there.\n\nAnd now that I’ve been officially told, non-negotiably, that I am never going to be allowed to return…I feel like my freaking life has been destroyed.\n\nI’m never going to get to see my friends every day ever again. I’m never going to get to do extracurriculars with them ever again. I’m never going to be able to fucking graduate along side my closest friends in this whole damn world. And it hurts more than I ever possibly imagined.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.97775
R J Holland,Updated 1y,"As a conservative, do you feel that Jimmy Carter is a good person?","Above photo from Google

Some years ago Jimmy Carter was in our city with the Habitat For Humanity people building some houses. He was staying at the residence at the University close to where I live. I was walking by the residence when coming toward me was Jimmy Carter in long sleeve check shirt and blue jeans. His eyes looked right at me, he gave me that big smile of his and said, “Hello, isn’t this a marvellous day?”

I said giving him a smile back,”Yes, it sure is.” He nodded and we both just kept walking. That’s it, but from those few seconds I felt he was genuine and friendly. I don’t get star struck, I’ve seen a lot of stars in my professional musician days and I always give them their space and don’t bother them unless introduced.

At any rate, Jimmy Carter seemed to be the real thing. Just a down to earth, friendly man who took the time to say hi to me.

Shayn M.,8mo,"How can leftists justify furries? Isn’t this going too far, even for them?","What the hell do furries have to do with leftists? Leftism is about fighting for social, political, and economic equality- furries are not a subject that rates significant interest from the Left one way or the other. İt’s like asking what conservatives think about people who eat hotdogs- why should they have any opinion on a more or less apolitical non-issue?

All I know about furries is that they are people who enjoy dressing up as animals and that this is some kind of a sex thing.

I don’t know how it’s a sex thing and I don’t care to know.

As a leftist somewhat on the libertarian side of the Left, I don’t concern myself with what consenting adults do in their private spaces. It’s simply none of my business.

In other words, I feel no need to either “justify” or “condemn” things that have nothing at all to do with me and cause nobody any harm. Why do conservatives care?

As far as I, or anyone else, knows, many conservatives may well also be furries- it’s not a political thing, it’s a sex thing and if years of conservative sex scandal have shown us anything, it’s that right-wingers are pretty much into everything but a bath and the more they publicly scream and rant about “depraved perversions”, the more likely it is they are privately going at them like gangbusters when they think nobody can find out.

So there might be a whole bunch of furry conservatives out there and I couldn’t give a rat’s derriere.

I don’t care what anybody is into as long as it is fully consensual. I might find a lot of it weird or totally icky but as long as I don’t have to participate, it really does not concern me.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/r86mc4oh5avjfktb', 'title': 'How can leftists justify furries?

Sean Kernan,1y,What is the scariest thing a politician has said?,"There's a lot of recency bias in these answers. I’ll do ya one better.

In 1907, Joseph Stalin stood at his wife’s funeral and said, “This creature softened my heart of stone. She died and with her, died my last warm feelings for humanity.”

He meant it. He proved it. His legacy was written in blood.

46 years later, after killing 6 million people, Stalin laid in his bed dying.

Stalin’s personal physician was unavailable. Why? Because he was in a dungeon being tortured — for having suggested Stalin didn’t look well and needed rest.

This is the legacy of Russia’s leadership: savage paranoia and power consolidation. Imprisonment for doing your job.

When Stalin’s security guards found him unconscious, they were too afraid to call for help. Decision-making was too centralized. They feared Stalin would wake up and realize they’d called for help without his permission.

Prakhar (प्रखर),1y,Is Tamil Nadu a liberal or a conservative state?,"Religiously, Tamil Nadu is a pretty traditional state. People follow the daily rituals and move on with life.

Dr. Balaji Viswanathan,4y,"If not Nehruvian socialism, then in which way would have right-wing Indians love to see India during its initial period, post-independence?","In 1947, India had 3 choices to develop.

The Gandhian one was to develop India from its villages — focusing on agriculture, irrigation, developing lakes, small industries etc.
The Patel-Rajaji one was to develop India through its entrepreneurs and traders encouraging them to build great enterprises. Indian trading houses like the Birlas were quite critical to British logistics in the World Wars.
Nehruvian model was to develop through large public enterprises including IITs and large steel plants.

As Gandhi and Patel died early, and Rajaji losing out of favor with other Congressmen (for showing faults in the Quit Indian movement) Nehruvian model won out.

Nehruvian model was headline grabbing — big dams, big steel plants and big colleges, however these big things floated in an unsupported way.

There was no big push in farm productivity and agriculture languishes in the same state it was 70 years ago. While our peers in 1947 have mastered agriculture and graduated the farmers to factories, we still are figuring out basic agriculture.

Because of the failure to execute agricultural reforms, Naxal movement picked up across India at the end of the Nehru period and continues to trouble to this day. Nehruvian big industry-big dam stuff didn’t really touch most of the Indians.

While Nehru gave an impetus to build the IITs, there was no push to improve the quality of primary and secondary schools that can educate the students to go to the IITs. Schools for the poor India continues to be poor which forced the government to put band-aid such as reservation. If the poor people were educated as well as rich people in the government schools, we might need reservation at all.

With just 400 million people at the time of independence and millions of educated Congress volunteers available, Nehru could have had a massive project to make India 100% literate in just 1 year. If each congress worker had taught a class of 30–40 poor people that was definitely possible. It was not done. Nehru skipped all the basics.

While we built the big hospitals like AIIMS where the politicians can go for getting cured, there was nothing done to rural healthcare. Mao built an amazing network for foot doctors to drastically improve healthcare quality in China. Nehru did nothing like that in his 17 years rule. Life expectancy of Indians continue to be among the poorest.

While the Japanese and Germans recovering from the WW2 unleashed the power of their entrepreneurs [Hitachi, Toyota, Mitsubishi, BMW, Daimler etc] Indian entrepreneurs were shackled with more regulations and taxes. Entrepreneurs could have made government’s job of economic growth much easier, but their hands were tied from the back.

I accept we have the benefit of hindsight and Nehru did have to take a lot of challenges. But, it is impossible not to compare India with its peers including China and Indonesia — both of whom were poorer and large. If Nehru had better economic advisors and a senior leader like Gandhi to keep him in check, India could have progressed much better. No other major country is still looking at its basics such as literacy, electricity, running water and toilets — these many decades after independence.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/hg8f4qrpnmab9udj', 'title': 'If not Nehruvian socialism, then in which way would have right-wing Indians love to see India during its initial period, post-independence?', 'score': {'original': 0.20485, 'ai': 0.79515}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'In 1947, India had 3 choices to develop.\n\nThe Gandhian one was to develop India from its villages — focusing on agriculture, irrigation, developing lakes, small industries etc.\nThe Patel-Rajaji one was to develop India through its entrepreneurs and traders encouraging them to build great enterprises.

While our peers in 1947 have mastered agriculture and graduated the farmers to factories, we still are figuring out basic agriculture.\n\nBecause of the failure to execute agricultural reforms, Naxal movement picked up across India at the end of the Nehru period and continues to trouble to this day. Nehruvian big industry-big dam stuff didn’t really touch most of the Indians.\n\nWhile Nehru gave an impetus to build the IITs, there was no push to improve the quality of primary and secondary schools that can educate the students to go to the IITs. Schools for the poor India continues to be poor which forced the government to put band-aid such as reservation. If the poor people were educated as well as rich people in the government schools, we might need reservation at all.\n\nWith just 400 million people at the time of independence and millions of educated Congress volunteers available, Nehru could have had a massive project to make India 100% literate in just 1 year. If each congress worker had taught a class of 30–40 poor people that was definitely possible. It was not done. Nehru skipped all the basics.\n\nWhile we built the big hospitals like AIIMS where the politicians can go for getting cured, there was nothing done to rural healthcare. Mao built an amazing network for foot doctors to drastically improve healthcare quality in China. Nehru did nothing like that in his 17 years rule. Life expectancy of Indians continue to be among the poorest.\n\nWhile the Japanese and Germans recovering from the WW2 unleashed the power of their entrepreneurs [Hitachi, Toyota, Mitsubishi, BMW, Daimler etc] Indian entrepreneurs were shackled with more regulations and taxes. Entrepreneurs could have made government’s job of economic growth much easier, but their hands were tied from the back.\n\nI accept we have the benefit of hindsight and Nehru did have to take a lot of challenges. But, it is impossible not to compare India with its peers including China and Indonesia — both of whom were poorer and large. If Nehru had better economic advisors and a senior leader like Gandhi to keep him in check, India could have progressed much better.

Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,14h,Why are you anti-Modi?,"I admit I may have called Modi a Bungler and a Doofus numerous times

I was Angry

I had a lot of hope when Modi came to power. I believed it would usher a new era in Indian Politics

One where Men of Ability became leaders and where Meritocracy would prevail

Instead when I see horse trading , quid pro quo 'I drop your criminal investigations if you come to my party' using agencies to bully opposition & crony capitalism - I felt really let down by the man

I thought so many right wingers and fans of Modi would point these out and be angry and ask questions as to WHY MODIJI was doing all this and why was the BJP acting in a manner that was worse than Indira 1975

Yet I saw with increasing disbelief that more and more people were becoming Sycophants calmly ignoring the situation and developing amnesia

Add to this i saw virtually no impactful development in India that impressed me

Sure the Airports are nicer

Yet I am sure the Colombo Residents felt the same way, walking through their nice airports back in ‘22

I see no improvement in the Job Situation or Quality of Students or Quality of Education or Quality of Technological Development

Plus frankly all this religious talk gives me the heeby jeebies. No issue if 70–80 years do it. Scary when 15–20 year olds do it.

So I personally believe Mr Modi to be among the worst leaders we have had

That's my opinion at the end of the day

Sure there are 70 in 100 who regard the man as a God for their own reasons

I don't

Yet I am no longer angry at him

He is a Mediocre Man painted as a Legendary Leader by Narrative and I along with many others believed the nonsense

Now i don't call him Bungler or Doofus

You can be angry at a Youngster with Potential who can get a top IIT Rank if you feel he isn't pulling his weight

You can't be angry at a below average 55 mark kid who you know has no chance of ever coming near the IITs except on a tour

I am not really Anti Modi

I just don't care anymore

Sometimes I still get angry when my naive fellow men celebrate mediocrity and I respond fiercely but those moments are becoming rarer and rarer

Neither am I Pro Rahul or AK or Mamta

I regard all of them cut from the same cloth now

So I focus mainly on writing about China, Russia and the few nations that in my opinion are better than the so called poisonous and misguided democracies

Of course being an Indian, if India does do something well, I would praise the people involved

David W. Rudlin,Feb 13,"Would it be possible for Biden, without the support of Congress, to do some type of ""Lend-Lease"" to Ukraine until Congress gets its act together, or perhaps the 2025 Congress?","Interesting question.

One that got me to do a little homework.

And there I found that Lend-Lease provided weapons to be used for free until returned or destroyed.

Most of what was provided fell into the latter bucket, obviously, but apparently a few ships were sent back. Some other equipment was sold to the UK, at a greatly reduced price. And they didn’t finish paying the bill until 2006.

So basically what we’re talking about is arming Ukraine by Executive Order.

Therefore it certainly seems there is precedent for doing this, though Congress would undoubtedly raise holy hell if Biden tried.

But here’s the thing: the money we sent to Ukraine is the best investment we’ve ever made. Ukraine is fighting and dying, while we sit comfortably back watching a global adversary being diminished at no risk to us. Russia has lost 87% of its active-duty troops — more than 300,000 men — and 2/3 of its tanks. That rips a massive hole in Putin’s opium dream of bringing the Soviet Union back together, something we haven’t managed to do on our own.

Moreover the majority money allocated is spent in the US. In the beginning we were sending outdated and surplus items, and then replenishing them with the Ukraine aid funds — thus creating high-paying manufacturing jobs for Americans. We’ve basically cleaned out the closet at this point, but we’re still generating economic benefits at home.

No matter what Moronic Taylor Greene says.

If we didn’t help, Russia would likely overpower Ukraine — not least because they no longer have us to fear. Putin is already threatening Poland, a NATO ally. If he made good on that threat, we would have no choice but to send troops to fight the Russians.

This way is better, at least for us.

Finally, China’s Xi is looking at all of this, and feeding it into his calculations on whether to make a move on Taiwan. Here, too, we have treaty obligations to observe.

So THE DUMBEST THING WE COULD POSSIBLY DO is cut off aid to Ukraine.

Which is exactly why this trump-controlled do-nothing Congress is hoping to do exactly that.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/v0mqlo8hfkixpgyw', 'title': 'Would it be possible for Biden, without the support of Congress, to do some type of ""Lend-Lease"" to Ukraine until Congress gets its act together, or perhaps the 2025 Congress?', 'score': {'original': 0.9999, 'ai': 0.0001}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Interesting question.\n\nOne that got me to do a little homework.\n\nAnd there I found that Lend-Lease provided weapons to be used for free until returned or destroyed.\n\nMost of what was provided fell into the latter bucket, obviously, but apparently a few ships were sent back.

Paul,1y,Why are leftists obsessed with pushing the gay agenda?,"Let me give you a “before” and “after” of the “gay agenda.”

I had a gay uncle. Uncle Don. He was born in the 1920s, part of the Greatest Generation. He fought in WW2. He lived in Paris and was in the ballet there. He became something of a beatnik. He was arguably one of the most interesting people in our family.

I only met him once when I was 10. Really nice guy. However, he was the blackest of black sheep and I never knew why. I was told he was just irresponsible and untrustworthy. It wasn’t until I was in my 30s and he was dead that was told by my in-law aunt that he was gay and for that reason he was basically disowned.

That shit should not happen. The “gay agenda” says we should treat gay people the same as other people, that they are no different than lefties and redheads. The “gay agenda” regards as tragic what happened to Uncle Don and says “never again.”

Misha Firer,Tue,"If a new political regime were to be formed by the combination of the autocratic tradition of Russia with the economic efficiency of South Korea, what would result from it?","Reinventing the wheel: sanctioned Russia has to learn 1960s technology from scratch in the absence of technology transfers and western firms.

Sanctioned Russia is so technologically lagging behind the West and East Asia that having been sanctioned they have to reinvent the wheel.

For example, Russian automakers don’t know how to produce airbags. Autovaz promised to launch first production of airbags in 2025. Promises that they rarely keep. Airbags were invented in 1966 and were commercially adopted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Russian automakers promised to “catch up” next year.

Putin stole and transferred the Ulyanovsk machine tool plant previously owned by the German Gildemeister, to the management of the Federal Property Management Agency.

The Russians received a big concrete box full of fancy tools they don’t know how to use nor how to maintain in the absence of the German engineers and patted themselves on the shoulder about a job well done.

It’s like a US plane falling on an isolated Pacific Island and local tribes decide to learn how to build them in order to bring a fleet of wooden birds to fight existential war with America.

Three days after the death of opposition leader Alexey Navalny in Arctic Circle penal colony, Federal Penitentiary Service top brass received new general ranks.

If this was not a murder, shouldn’t they have been punished instead for the death of a high-profile inmate on their watch?

Putin just can’t help flouting laws and sense of decency. Like a serial killer who brags to a detective about his crimes, Putin mocks his adversary. “America, look at me! I’m so cool! I get away with murder time and again and Ruskyy slaves still love me!”

First deputy director of the Federal Penitentiary Service is now lieutenant general and deputy director of the Federal Penitentiary Sertvice is now a major general.

The men who promoted them in an official ceremony were the head of the Federal Penitentiary Service public relations department and the head of the HR department of the Federal Penitentiary Service.

They awarded each other for the job well done in the same self-congratulatory manner as the thieves who stole German tool plant .

Boyarinev Valery Gennadievich, one of Russian dissident Alexey Navalny’s watchers, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general.

Boarinev , the dude who was promoted to lieutenant general, was involved with limiting Navalny’s rights of the amount of food he was allowed to have and a ban on voting in the elections.

Westerners ask why did Putin tolerate Navalny for so long? Putin’s regime didn’t fear Navalny for two reasons.

They believed that Alexey Navalny was dispatched to Russia to start a Color Revolution. This was to be achieved by bringing the populace to the streets angered by his anti-corruption investigations.

According to Russian state security agency’s belief, Navalny launched FBK (anti-corruption fund) next year after his six month stint in Yale that was signed off by Michael McFaul, then US ambassador in Russia.

Navalny’s course in Yale University took place in 2011 when Colour Revolutions swept across Arab World, in which young people used social media to gather on streets and squares and demand the overturn of the oppressive regimes.

Next year, Alexey Navalny opened FBK headquarters in cities across Russia staffed with daredevil young people who would lead the charge once Russians begin to take to the streets in big numbers following the framework of the Arab Spring.

Putin’s regime gets overthrown, Navalny becomes president, throws out Putin’s oligarchs, confiscates their assets and gives green light to Western corporations to have stakes in exploitation of Russia’s vast natural resources.

Back to the question why Putin tolerated Navalny - what I have written above have been broadcast on federal television with an emotional appeal to real patriots that they must not be part of Navalny’s movement, and consequently the majority of Russians viewed Navalny as a CIA agent, a foreign spy, a traitor of the Motherland.

To Putin, it was more beneficial to keep an ineffective enemy close who was being tailed everywhere by a group of seven-eight FSB agents than to get rid of him and await a new one who might become more popular.

Eventually, Putin couldn’t help himself like in the cases of stealing western property and awarding murderers, and poisoned Navalny.

Once Navalny was out of the country, he was strongly advised not to return. He did, and got jailed on the spot. His FBK organization was slapped with extremism charges and disbanded.

While in jail, Navalny continued to rebel, asked his visitors to publish inflammatory political posts online from his name, and stand up to figures of authority. This tough as nails dude just wouldn’t give up.

Once again , Putin’s smug henchmen ran out of patience and did him in. Was it an accident, an altercation with a warden that ended up lethally or a direct order of liquidation, we probably will never know.

One thing we do know for sure, the henchmen awarded each other for the job well done.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mlu2gy6cip0h4qrf', 'title': 'If a new political regime were to be formed by the combination of the autocratic tradition of Russia with the economic efficiency of South Korea, what would result from it?', 'score': {'original': 0.98195, 'ai': 0.01805}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Reinventing the wheel: sanctioned Russia has to learn 1960s technology from scratch in the absence of technology transfers and western firms.\n\nSanctioned Russia is so technologically lagging behind the West and East Asia that having been sanctioned they have to reinvent the wheel.\n\nFor example, Russian automakers don’t know how to produce airbags.

Anthony Zarrella,4y,"Conservatives, what is something good about Liberals? Liberals, what is something good about conservatives?","“Conservatives, what is something good about Liberals? Liberals, what is something good about conservatives?”

Conservative here.

Liberals push us to be better.

When conservatives say, “The way things are now is just fine. Everything is good enough for me,” liberals say, “Yeah… but isn’t there room for improvement? Maybe we’re ‘good enough’ now, but we could be better tomorrow than we are today.”

In their highest and best form, liberals take the good things and positive values that conservatives (in our highest and best form) task ourselves with preserving, and they carry those things and those values to the next level.

[There are, of course, liberals and conservatives who don’t always (or in some cases ever) live up to the “highest and best” of their respective philosophies—but that’s not what this question is about.]

The conservative says, “We must preserve our right to vote!”

The liberal says, “Yeah… but what if more people could vote?”

The conservative says, “We must defend our freedom of speech!”

The liberal says, “Now walk the walk—let’s see you defend even this speech that you hate.”

The conservative says, “Let’s judge everyone solely on merit—all men are created equal!”

The liberal says, “Just checking—do you really mean all men? And how about women? Can we maybe get them in there, too?”

And sometimes, the liberal gets a bit caught up in the spirit of things, and the fervor to improve leads to losing sight of the fundamentals that defined the values in the first place—mining out the foundation to provide more raw materials for the superstructure.

Then the conservative has to say, “Whoa! Pump the brakes a little there, no need to go crazy.”

But that’s the trade-off. That’s the balance.

Liberals tell conservatives when to step on the gas, so we’re not all granny drivers doing 25 in the right lane.

Conservatives tell liberals when to pump the brakes, so we don’t go careening through the guardrail when a sharp turn sneaks up on us.

I don’t think I want to be driving in a car without gas or without brakes.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/27egyv8iuqz6dsok', 'title': 'Conservatives, what is something good about Liberals?

Migration to Amritsar - When the partition of British India happened in August 1947, Manmohan Singh was 14 years old. He migrated to India’s Amritsar along with his family where they started life from scratch.
First Sikh to become Prime Minister of India - Dr Manmohan Singh was the first Sikh to become the Prime Minister of India.
Declined an offer from the first Prime Minister of India - When Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru offered Manmohan Singh to join the government in 1962, he declined as he did not want to dishonour his commitment to teaching at his college in Amritsar.

Murphy Barrett,1y,"Is there a point where you personally would be able to set aside your personal political views and listen to someone from the ""other side"" with an open mind, or are you afraid they might change your current way of thinking?","I do this all the time, but there’s a fundamental problem with people who frame the question as you have done. Almost invariably, when uttered this way, “open mind” means “agree with me”.

Note that these fellows are almost never willing to consider my position on the issue.

Contrariwise, when I ask someone to listen with an open mind, I’m not asking you to agree with me, though I hope you will. I’m asking you to listen to my side well enough to understand my position, even if you still disagree with me.

Nathan Stanish,2y,Why does Morgan Freeman not want a Black History Month?,"I think what Freeman worries about is what many of us worry about with the popularity of “diversity” ideals: division.

And by division, I don’t mean a military divide from violence, or an ideological divide from beliefs, I mean a cultural divide.

Look at this picture:

What do you see?

Some would say that they see a lot of famous black Americans.

What Morgan Freeman is trying to say is that we should be seeing a bunch of famous Americans. They don’t have to be made distinct from others by their race.

I can understand his concern. Sometimes, the “diversity” shtick can give the impression that somehow black history in America is distinct from American history, that black Americans are different than “regular” Americans.

I don’t care for that. As far as I’m concerned, Martin Luther King Jr., Jackie Robinson, Harriet Tubman, and others were famous Americans and do not have to be made distinct from other famous Americans by the color of their skin. There are no “regular” Americans. We are Americans regardless of our skin color.

Don’t misunderstand me as saying Black History Month is wrong. I understand the sentiment behind it, that after so long ignoring the history of Americans who are black, we want to highlight the stories that we never heard.

But if we continue to highlight these stories as if they are somehow separate from other great American stories about white Americans, what message are we sending?

Frankly, we’re continuing to emphasize this notion that an “American” is a white male and American history is about white males, as opposed to black history and the history of women. That’s not a healthy mindset. That’s a divisive mindset.

The story of Martin Luther King Jr. is as much American history as the story of George Washington. And you don’t have to be black to celebrate MLK’s history any more than you have to be white to celebrate Washington’s history. They are both parts of our history.

That’s what Morgan Freeman is getting at. We have a shared history, however ugly it may have been at times. And rather than try and draw a distinction between our histories based on our race, we should recognize our shared history.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/gfewxj2lq3s19yic', 'title': 'Why does Morgan Freeman not want a Black History Month?', 'score': {'original': 0.9625, 'ai': 0.0375}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think what Freeman worries about is what many of us worry about with the popularity of “diversity” ideals: division.\n\nAnd by division, I don’t mean a military divide from violence, or an ideological divide from beliefs, I mean a cultural divide.\n\nLook at this picture:\n\nWhat do you see?\n\nSome would say that they see a lot of famous black Americans.\n\nWhat Morgan Freeman is trying to say is that we should be seeing a bunch of famous Americans.
