Mats Andersson,4y,Was Einstein really as smart as they say?,"No. He was smarter. He was so smart that “they” are probably fundamentally incapable of understanding just how “smart” Einstein was.

Around 1900, Lord Kelvin, a physicist so brilliant they named a unit after him, famously recommended that young students not study physics, because so little remained to be done. He listed, specifically, two remaining issues to be solved, after which all that remained was to do ever better measurements: the photoelectric effect and the absence of a result in the Michelson-Morley experiment. He might well have added the Ultraviolet Catastrophe.

Einstein was the person who solved both those riddles (and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe in the bargain), and the answers were what 20th century physics was all about: relativity and quantum mechanics. These two are arguably the most profound breakthroughs in our understanding of the world around us in all of human history. He basically single-handedly created modern physics.

And in addition to that, there is basically no field of physics at the time where Einstein did not make a significant contribution. When you study physics, his name pops up all the time. He’s as ubiquitous as Euler in mathematics.

The best illustration is probably what Einstein himself called his “biggest mistake”. When he had formulated relativity, he found that it implied that the Universe must be expanding (or contracting, but that was already ruled out by various observations). But at the time, astronomers believed that the Milky Way was the entire Universe. Other galaxies would not be discovered (or, to be more precise, identified as other galaxies) for a few years yet. So Einstein introduced what he labelled the “cosmological constant” to reproduce the apparent static nature of our galaxy, hoping that a physical interpretation would come along later.

Think about that for a moment. Sitting at a desk, he deduced that the universe was expanding. He was that close to deducing that there were other galaxies, receding from us. Using only a pencil and a piece of paper.

And a mind that was quite out of the ordinary.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4e7mtzs0fcxjr38d', 'title': 'Was Einstein really as smart as they say?', 'score': {'original': 0.9998, 'ai': 0.0002}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'No. He was smarter.

Michael B.,Updated 3y,Why does Sheldon always mock Howard Wolowitz for being an MIT engineer? Are engineers really not as par with physicists?,"Because engineers are the non-commissioned officers of the STEM world.

The NCOs of Star Trek too.

Sheldon thinks of himself as the smartest person in the room. And why shouldn’t he? He has the accolades to prove it. First of all he has a doctorate, something Howard doesn’t.

This is how Sheldon seems himself unironically.

Second of all, he has a more “intellectual” job. For some reason in Western culture we tend to look down on people who work with their hands. A good trade school education can lead to a very comfortable life. But we don’t think of plumbers and electricians as being smart people. Despite the fact that these jobs require extensive technical knowledge.

And as an engineer Howard has as much in common with an electrician or a plumber as he does with a physicist. Sheldon spends his time in the abstract world of theoretical physics. But Howard’s work is applied physics. Taking Sheldon’s theoretical ideas and making something useful out of them.

And that fact, that his work has that usefulness and practicality to it makes it lesser in Sheldon’s eyes. That’s why he refers to MIT as a “trade school”. Because engineers work for a living in a way that physicists don’t.

Now in the real world this rivalry typically ends after college. Neither field of study is necessarily easier than the other. And there’s nothing wrong with going to a trade school because those are important skills that the world would grind to a halt without.

But Sheldon Cooper isn’t a particularly mature person. In some ways he’s an idiot savant. He’s good at theoretical physics, but not at much else. He’s not good at talking to people, or seeing things from a point of view not his own. At times it borderlines on being an actual disability.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7cd98jg0o2sw3byr', 'title': 'Why does Sheldon always mock Howard Wolowitz for being an MIT engineer?

Jack Fraser-Govil,5y,How could a PhD physicist not be familiar with the term exergy?,"Hi. PhD candidate here*.

I've never heard of “exergy”. Never.

Looking at the Wikipedia page, I'm more than familiar with what it means — but it's just not that common a term. The phrase “available energy” does the job just as well, and most courses don't think there's any need to add in a specialist term, when common language does the job.

It's also worth remembering that a PhD candidate is very, very specialised in their field of study. I study galaxies and stars — classical thermodynamics is not really something I've dealt with since second year! Thus it is not surprising if a PhD candidate has forgotten some stuff that they once knew, but haven't used for several years, if their field of study goes nowhere near this topic.

However, as I said, I never used this terminology in my course — we simply described it, rather than giving it a name.

What matters to a physicist isn't a comprehensive knowledge of phrases and terminology — but an understanding of the concepts.

It's easy to teach someone the specialist terminology if they already know the concept it refers to (i.e. me learning about this term!). It's somewhat harder to do it the other way around — I rarely find myself impressed by people who claim to have memorized “all physical terms”!

*Technically I'm a DPhil candidate, not a PhD candidate, but that's because Oxford decided to translate the Latin.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/dfw9v3850xjmncis', 'title': 'How could a PhD physicist not be familiar with the term exergy?', 'score': {'original': 0.9967, 'ai': 0.0033}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Hi.

Richard Muller,4y,What does Prof. Richard Muller think of recycling nuclear waste to make more fuel?,"Recycling nuclear waste to make new fuel does not really help the waste disposal problem, and it costs more than finding fresh uranium. A few decades ago we worried that we were running out of uranium, but now we know that we have enough for many centuries.

The high radioactivity in nuclear waste initially comes from the “fission fragments”, the pieces of the nucleus that come off when uranium or plutonium fissions. No recycling scheme eliminates these, so the radioactivity of the waste is not reduced by recycling.

Several “4th generation” nuclear reactor companies falsely advertise that they burn up the waste. They do NOT “burn up” the fission fragments (e.g. Sr-90, Cs-137) that dominate the radioactivity for the first few hundred years. They do burn up much of the actinides (plutonium, americium, …), but those do not represent a disposal problem. The biggest long-term waste isotopes are Cl-36 and I-129, and these are produced and not burned in the 4th generation reactors at the same rate as they are in the current reactors.

Some versions of “recycling” involve reprocessing. Reprocessing is vigorously opposed by many groups who fear that the plutonium could be used for weapons. I don’t oppose reprocessing, except for the fact that I think doing so makes nuclear power more expensive, since uranium is cheaper and abundant.

In fact, I believe that radioactive waste is not a problem in any case. The method I and others have been developing, to put the waste in 1-mile deep horizontal boreholes will keep the waste isolated from humans until all the dangerous radioactivity has finished. See Deep Isolation

Ron Brown,Updated 5y,How many physicists amounted to nothing over the course of their careers? In the sense that they did not make any meaningful contribution to their field.,"Interesting question. I’m sure I’m one of those who did not make any meaningful contribution to my field. Did I amount to nothing as a result of that?

My dissertation was an obscure addition to the literature about the magnetic properties of a particular rare-earth compound, one of a series of experiments trying to understand the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy of the europium chalcogenides near absolute zero. Excited about the results yet? No one else was either.

My forty five year career was largely teaching undergraduates. I would like to think that I helped many of them to succeed in their chosen educational paths. Is that significant? It probably depends on who you ask. Much that I have written - curricular materials in both introductory-level courses and my advanced course were used by students long after they were in those courses. And were used in those courses long after I retired and helped other instructors develop their approach to those courses. Was that work a meaningful contribution? I don’t know.

Most of my publications during my career were teaching related at one level or another - clarifying ideas that are often misunderstood and trying to give other university physics faculty a new perspective on some topic. Was that useful? And is being a peer reviewer for a physics journal - trying to make what others submit for publication readable and pertinent - also useful?

If I were to start my career over again, I would want to do exactly the same thing - spend my career at a largely undergraduate university. I found it immensely rewarding to be able to spend my career writing and thinking about fundamental principles and how they applied to the latest developments in my field, and interacting with articulate and talented young people as they forged their career paths.

I don’t know the answer to the original question.

Lynnie Saade,Updated 6y,What are some things that are widely known by physicists but not by laypeople?,"Most things are locally flat if you zoom in close enough. So you can reduce tons of physical systems to a bunch of spring and wave equations. (Flat forces = quadratic potentials = harmonic oscillators)
The Principle of Least Action is actually a mathematical concept, not just a vague notion of “things follow the path of least resistance.” And you can predict the behavior of a LOT of stuff with it, even quantum fields! (LaGrangians are awesome!)
Symmetries do not just make problems easier, they are ESSENTIAL for life as we know it. That’s where all those conservation laws we take for granted come from! (Check out Noether’s theorem!)
If you can’t actually use it to calculate a physical quantity, your theory is not physics. (Hint for all those “I disproved Einstein with my new theory of everything!” people.)
All of our scientific understanding is merely an approximation to Reality. The trick is knowing when your approximations are useful, and when they don’t help you at all.
Sometimes the simplest, least intricate things are actually the most powerful. See: black holes.
The sciences that are less mathematical are that way not because their subjects are simpler, but because their subjects are so complicated they are not as amenable to the tools of math. See: biology, sociology, etc.
All those mind blowing analogies science popularizers use for explaining physics to laymen barely resemble the real thing.

Jack Fraser-Govil,Updated 3y,Can mathematics deceive or misguide the physicist?,"Absolutely, if you're not paying attention. This is especially prominent when you start making approximations and abstractions to simplify your problem, and then forget the limitations that this places on your ability to solve problems. One of my favourite examples of this is an extension to the famous “monkey drop” problem. Consider a hunter, tracking a monkey in a tree. The hunter is a distance LLL away from the base of the tree, and the monkey is at a height hhh above the ground. The hunter fires a bullet from his rifle (bullet speed vvv, angle of elevation, θθ\theta) — the muzzle flash of which scares the monkey. The monkey lets go of the branch the second the bullet leaves the rifle. At what angle θθ\theta should the hunter fire the bullet such that the bullet hits the monkey? I will quickly solve this problem just for the sake of getting an answer (you can skip to the end of this section if you’re happy to take me at my word!) The gravitational acceleration on both the bullet and the monkey is: aB=aM=(0−g)aB=aM=(0−g)\displaystyle \mathbf{a}_B = \mathbf{a}_M = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ - g \end{pmatrix} \tag*{} (Here I have denoted the positive yyy direction as upwards) Integrating this up gives the velocity of the bullet and the monkey as a function of time, recalling that the monkey is stationary at t=0,t=0,t=0, whilst the bullet is moving at a speed vvv at an angle θθ\theta: vB=(vcos(θ)vsin(θ)−gt)        vM=(0−gt)vB=(vcos⁡(θ)vsin⁡(θ)−gt)        vM=(0−gt)\displaystyle \mathbf{v}_B = \begin{pmatrix} v \cos(\theta) \\ v\sin(\theta)- g t \end{pmatrix} ~~~~~~~~ \mathbf{v}_M = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ - g t \end{pmatrix} \tag*{} Integrating this up gives the position (we use the origin of the coordinate system as the hunter, so the monkey is at a position (L,h(L,h(L,h) at t=0t=0t=0) xB=(vcos(θ)tvsin(θ)t−gt22)        xM=(Lh−gt22)xB=(vcos⁡(θ)tvsin⁡(θ)t−gt22)        xM=(Lh−gt22)\displaystyle \mathbf{x}_B = \begin{pmatrix} v \cos(\theta) t \\ v\sin(\theta)t - g \frac{t^2}{2} \end{pmatrix} ~~~~~~~~ \mathbf{x}_M = \begin{pmatrix} L \\ h - g \frac{t^2}{2} \end{pmatrix} \tag*{} For the bullet to hit the monkey, there must be some time ttt when xB=xM.xB=xM.\mathbf{x}_B = \mathbf{x}_M. Setting these two vectors equal to each other gives us two equations: vcos(θ)t=Lvcos⁡(θ)t=L\displaystyle v \cos(\theta) t = L \tag*{} vsin(θ)t−gt22=h−gt22vsin⁡(θ)t−gt22=h−gt22\displaystyle v\sin(\theta)t - g \frac{t^2}{2} = h - g \frac{t^2}{2}  \tag*{} The first one gives that the time of the collision is t=Lvcos(θ)t=Lvcos⁡(θ)t = \frac{L}{v \cos(\theta)} — as long as |v|>0|v|>0|v| > 0 and θ≠π2,θ≠π2,\theta \neq \frac{\pi}{2}, else we have divided by zero. Substituting this solution into the second equation: vsin(θ)(Lvcos(θ))=hvsin⁡(θ)(Lvcos⁡(θ))=h\displaystyle v \sin(\theta) \left(\frac{L}{v \cos(\theta)} \right) = h \tag*{} This solves to give: tan(θ)=hLtan⁡(θ)=hL\displaystyle \tan(\theta) = \frac{h}{L} \tag*{} This is where most students go “ahhhh!”, because this angle is simply the angle between the hunter and the monkey before it lets go: the solution is that the hunter does not need to compensate for the monkey dropping at all! This is because although the monkey falls under gravity, the bullet also falls at the same rate, so the effects cancel out.So why do I mention this? Surely this is a nice and simple solution to a basics mechanics problem. There’s just one tiny hitch in this solution…. There is absolutely no dependence on the velocity of the bullet. OK, that’s not quite true, we do require that |v|>0|v|>0|v| > 0, which arose because we divided by vvv. This makes sense: if the bullet isn’t moving, it can’t hit the monkey! But other than that? No dependence whatsoever. So why is this relevant? Let me (hopefully) make it more obvious by explicitly stating what the mathematics has told us so far: The mathematics tells us that a moving bullet will hit the monkey, no matter what, as long as it is fired at the correct angle. Does that sound likely? Really? If I fire a bullet at a speed of 2 millimetres per hour, do you really think that it will hit the monkey? Because that’s what the mathematics tells us will happen! The answer we derived is absolutely correct: within the realm of the abstractions we made in order to reduce it to a simple calculus exercise. What abstractions did we make in this problem? Well, firstly, we reduced the monkey and the bullet to idealised point particles moving under a constant force of gravity without air resistance: obviously we know neither of these things is true: they’re both extended bodies, and the force of gravity is a function of height above the Earth — but these approximations are not the problem here (though in a different setup, these might be the problem!) No, the problem here is very simple: intuitively we know that as soon as the monkey hits the ground at h=0,h=0,h=0, the game is up: the monkey will scuttle away sideways and probably up another tree. But where, in the mathematics, is this information encoded? In fact: where in the mathematics is the fact that the ground is a solid object? If we consider our case of the bullet moving at 1m/s (3.6 km/h, 2.2 mph, a reasonable walking speed), we can calculate that the collision point (assuming L=20L=20L = 20m and h=5h=5h = 5m) occurs almost one and a half minutes after the bullet was fired, at 81 seconds. At this point in time, the coordinate of the monkey is: xM=(5−32,680)xM=(5−32,680)\displaystyle \mathbf{x}_M = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -32,680 \end{pmatrix} \tag*{} That means that the monkey (and indeed, the bullet) is almost 32km below the ground when the collision occurs…..supposedly. Of course — we know that’s not what happens, because we know the ground is solid. The mathematics told us that the angle was not dependant on the velocity of the bullet simply because we forgot to insert a term telling the mathematics that the collision had to occur before ym=0.ym=0.y_m = 0. Without that piece of information (that the floor is solid, remember), the mathematics does not know that the collision has to occur above the ground, and thus just churns out collisions that occur ever deeper and deeper underground. In the process of abstraction, we removed the fact that solid bodies can collide, which in turn made our answer nonsensical after being removed from certain bounds. This absolutely can decieve the unwary physicist (or, more likely, physics student), as it is very easy to think that when you’ve got an answer, that’s all there is to it! Physics largely revolves around abstracting objects that we see in the world around us into mathematical entities that we can manipulate and study: but it is worthwhile remembering that this is not a perfect isomorphism: in the process of abstracting, say, a bullet, into a math-bullet, we will (probably) necessarily lose some information. It is up to the discerning physicist to be on their toes, to notice when their approximations and abstractions may come back to bite them. Often, getting the answer is not the final step in solving a problem: you need to go back and check that this answer lies within the realms where you expect your approximations to hold. The example here was a somewhat trite and obvious example, and it is not problems of this simplicity which modern physicists find themselves `decieved’ by — but it serves as a nice introduction into the general concept of being aware that not every single bit of physics is always encoded into the mathematics of how you solve a problem.

The mathematics told us that the angle was not dependant on the velocity of the bullet simply because we forgot to insert a term telling the mathematics that the collision had to occur before ym=0.ym=0.y_m = 0. Without that piece of information (that the floor is solid, remember), the mathematics does not know that the collision has to occur above the ground, and thus just churns out collisions that occur ever deeper and deeper underground. In the process of abstraction, we removed the fact that solid bodies can collide, which in turn made our answer nonsensical after being removed from certain bounds. This absolutely can decieve the unwary physicist (or, more likely, physics student), as it is very easy to think that when you’ve got an answer, that’s all there is to it! Physics largely revolves around abstracting objects that we see in the world around us into mathematical entities that we can manipulate and study: but it is worthwhile remembering that this is not a perfect isomorphism: in the process of abstracting, say, a bullet, into a math-bullet, we will (probably) necessarily lose some information. It is up to the discerning physicist to be on their toes, to notice when their approximations and abstractions may come back to bite them. Often, getting the answer is not the final step in solving a problem: you need to go back and check that this answer lies within the realms where you expect your approximations to hold. The example here was a somewhat trite and obvious example, and it is not problems of this simplicity which modern physicists find themselves `decieved’ by — but it serves as a nice introduction into the general concept of being aware that not every single bit of physics is always encoded into the mathematics of how you solve a problem.

Alan Dillman,Updated 3y,I feel terrible because I want to study physics but my (online) IQ is around 126. I don't know a single successful physicist with an IQ lower than 135.

Romeel Davé,Updated 4y,"In 100 years, will Stephen Hawking be viewed as one of the all-time greats like Einstein and Newton, or will he be considered a second-tier physicist like Planck?","There is this fun tongue-in-cheek plot known as the Astronomer’s H-R Diagram.

For those of you who don’t know what the real H-R (Hertzsprung-Russell) Diagram is, it is a fundamental relationship between the luminosity and temperature of stars. Most stars lie on a “main sequence” (defined by Hydrogen burning).

The Astronomer’s H-R Diagram is a ripoff of this, in which what is instead plotted is “Number of peer-reviewed papers” versus “Number of google hits”. The former measures scientific productivity, the latter cultural popularity. When plotting these, they remarkably found that most astronomers lie on an analogous “main career sequence”. The biggest scientific stars are to the left, and the biggest popular stars are at the top.

Do you see Stephen Hawking? He’s up at the top, #1 in cultural popularity (this was in 2010). In terms of scientific productivity? Definitely no slouch, but compared to the top astronomers of today, he hardly stands out.

Frankly, I think it’s beyond ludicrous to mention Stephen Hawking in the same breath as Einstein, Newton, and Planck. If Planck was a second tier physicist, Hawking would be in double digit tiers*. He is not even close. He will be remembered for what he overcame to achieve, but not for what he actually achieved.

There are many astronomers today who are more productive, doing more interesting things, and will have a longer impact on the field than Stephen Hawking. They will not, however, ever approach Hawking’s cultural popularity, and you will likely never hear of them because they don’t write popular books and appear on TV. But their impact on astrophysics will be significantly larger in 100 years than Stephen Hawking’s.

* Just to clarify, this is more a statement about my admiration for Planck (who was not in my view a “second tier” physicist) than a dismissal of Hawking’s many important contributions. Maybe Planck was a touch below Einstein and Newton, but if we are defining tiers that finely, then there are a LOT of tiers.

Edit: Just a couple addenda based on recurring themes in the comments. I agree citations or h-index would have been better than just number of publications, and also this doesn’t account for first/high authorship. But trying to fix all these things would be attempting to give this graph more credibility than it deserves. It was not intended to be any kind of serious measure.

Also, it’s important to remember that this was done in 2010, and one cannot compare to today or different eras. Google hits continue to increase as Google’s indexing database grows, without anyone doing anything. In 2010 I was smack on the main career sequence, but now in 2019 I am way above on this plot, but I suspect that’s just because everyone is now higher — the whole plot has just shifted upwards. So it is time-dependent. Another reason to take this chart purely for entertainment and humor, not as a rigorous study.

Ron Brown,Updated 3y,"If you had been given the opportunity, what would you have discussed with Richard Feynman?","I was involved in one discussion with Richard Feynman - not one-on-one mind you, but in a small group. It was, as one of the others in the group once wrote, “like being on hallowed ground.”

The occasion was a physics teachers conference in November, 1987 - his last professional meeting just three months before his death - and he was obviously quite weakened by the illness and treatments. He had been on a panel discussion about what should be included in teaching high school physics - and was accompanied by Caltech’s David Goodstein, whom I knew well.

At the conclusion of the conference, there were a dozen or so of us (Feynman and Goodstein included) standing around at the front of the auditorium chatting about the events of the meeting. He was, as usual, exuberant - charming us all with his wit - in every meaning of the word. It was then that Robert Wild (who had been my freshman physics teacher) handed Feynman a long copper tube and dropped an object down the tube. And the object fell v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y through the copper tube. “Ah, it must be magnetic,” said Feynman gleefully of the falling object - something we all knew as it was a fairly common lecture demonstration showing how a falling magnet would induce eddy currents in the copper tube, which in turn would create a magnetic field which would then slow the magnet’s fall. And he dropped the magnet several more times, playing with it like a kid with a new toy, delighting in the interplay of interesting ideas that the demonstration evoked.

Then someone asked “the question”: “What would have happened had the tube been one of the new superconductors rather than copper?” And everyone just stopped! We were faced with a brand new question that no one had ever asked before - and we were in the presence of Richard Feynman. [NOTE: This was 1987, just after the discovery of the high Tc copper oxide superconductors earlier that year.] Feynman chimed in, “I don’t know anything about the new superconductors, so let’s assume it is just an ordinary superconductor.” Game on.

The discussion that followed was priceless - as we all speculated on what would happen, offering arguments and counter arguments. “It would never get inside the tube since it would levitate,” someone said. “No, it would be unstable,” said another. “One could always force it inside,” I offered, “levitation is just a balance of forces.” “Then it would just come to a stop inside the tube - or maybe pop back out,” someone else said. “Or maybe oscillate inside the tube,” said another. Then David Goodstein entered the discussion with, “Once inside the tube, it would be in freefall.”

“Of course!” Feynman responded gleefully - having just had a new insight into an interesting new physics question. (And everyone else said, “Of course” as well - whether they understood it or not!) “It would slow as it entered, be in freefall inside, then be ejected at the other end!”

It was exhilarating - a conversation I will remember forever. On the entire four hour drive home, I could think about nothing else. Why did Goodstein say what he did - and why did Feynman so quickly agree? (I’m pretty sure all the rest of us agreed because Feynman did.) What was really going on physically that made that answer correct?

The short answer, of course, which requires some assumptions that were never stated, was this: Since the magnetic field cannot penetrate the superconductor, any induced currents would just be surface currents - and since the tube would be resistanceless, those currents could not dissipate any energy. So the magnet could not lose any energy as it fell - so would be in freefall! Brilliant. But what was really going on?

.

I spent much of the next year looking at the very subtle conditions associated with this problem, what the induced currents in the tube would be like, what forces on the magnet they would create, how the Faraday effect and the Meissner effect would be in play - and how their effects were different. That led to talks that I gave - and a paper.

Ron Brown,1y,What did Richard Feynman do when a magnet fell into a copper tube?,"This question leads to one of the great stories I’ve been involved with as a teacher.

I was in a small group of physicists and physics teachers immediately following a physics teachers conference - with, in fact, Richard Feynman - obviously ill at the time, attending his last professional meeting a few months before his death. He had been accompanied by his colleague and fellow Caltech physicist David Goodstein, whom I knew. The year was 1987, the year of the discovery of what were called high-temperature superconductors - materials that became superconducting at the astonishingly high (at the time) temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 kelvin).

Following the official meeting (which included a panel discussion including Feynman), we were all standing around bantering about the day’s events when my old freshman professor (Robert Wild) handed Feynman a long thick copper tube - then dropped a magnet down the tube. Feynman was delighted as that magnet fell slowly down the tube. “Ah,” he said, “it must be magnetic!” delighting in the interplay of the ideas involved. (We all knew it was, as it is a fairly common classroom demonstration of the Faraday effect, how it creates eddy currents in the copper tube, which produce a magnetic field which in turn slows the magnet’s fall.)

Then someone (probably Prof. Wild) asked a new question - one that had never been asked before: “What would have happened if that tube had been one of the new superconductors?”

What followed was magic. Feynman was his exuberant self … saying, “I don’t know anything about the new superconductors, so let’s just assume it is an ordinary superconductor.” And the discussion followed from there - with speculations of what might happen, reasons why something might or might not happen, etc. “It would probably slow to a stop,” someone said, another said, “It would never get inside the tube - but levitate above it.” I said, “Well, one could always force it in, it’s just a balance of forces.” Someone else said, “But it would probably pop back out.” And so on …

Then David Goodstein said, “If it ever got inside, it would be in freefall.” Feynman immediately responded, “Of course! It would slow as it entered, then shoot out at the other end!” excited about the ideas and insights involved in a brand new problem.

As I said, it was magic. As an author/journal editor and another participant in the discussion said, “It was like being on hallowed ground.”

For me, I spent the rest of the day thinking about that problem - and why Goodstein said what he did and why Feynman responded so immediately. And why everyone, my self included, agreed so immediately! (But that might be obvious.) And, convinced they were right, I then spent weeks exploring all of the ideas involved - and that led to a couple of conference talks, and a central line of inquiry for my advanced topics in solid state physics class.

I’m not sure what, exactly, prompted the question here and what the questioner was hoping to find out. But this - literally - was what Richard Feynman did once when a magnet fell down a copper tube!

Mats Andersson,3y,Was Albert Einstein really a genius as much as the world considers him to be?,"No.

He was more of a genius.

If you don’t have a degree in physics, it’s probably impossible for you to comprehend just how outrageously smart he was. He made important contributions in basically all fields of physics, at a time when most physicists could master part of a single field.

Consider this: in the late 1800s, no less an authority than Lord Kelvin, who was great enough to get a unit named after him, discouraged students from going into physics, since there were only two questions left to sort out, then physics would be complete and done.

The questions were the photoelectric effect, and the lack of a result in the Michelson-Morley experiment.

Einstein answered both of them. The first answer was “quantum mechanics”, the second answer was “relativity”—and this has been all physics has been about since then. Basically all that Kelvin knew is covered (if somewhat briefly) in the first half of a B. Sc. in physics today.

And as a sort of side-thought, Einstein proved that atoms exist. You didn’t even know that, and it would have been the crowning achievement of any normal physicist.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/tueivd4ac62f0k9q', 'title': 'Was Albert Einstein really a genius as much as the world considers him to be?', 'score': {'original': 0.9996, 'ai': 0.0004}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'No.\n\nHe was more of a genius.\n\nIf you don’t have a degree in physics, it’s probably impossible for you to comprehend just how outrageously smart he was.

Richard Muller,8y,What does 'time' mean to a physicist?,"To Newton, time was simply a marker, something that was used to explain other things.  He never tried to explain it himself.  That was the way time was treated right up until Einstein, when he discovered that we could write equations about the behavior of time. That is the core concept in this Theory of Relativity.  He found, for example, that time progresses faster when you are upstairs in a gravitational field.  That was an enormous step forward, but it has left us still very confused.  Some people still treat time as a coordinate, a way of specifying an ""event"".  Others are trying to treat it as if it is a ""field"" (like an electric or gravitational field) that extends through space, the fourth part of ""space-time"".   There has been extensive work trying to understand the fact that time ""moves"" but except for Einstein's work (that shows the rate of motion is relative) we have made virtually no progress.  Most physicists today believe that the ""direction"" of time, also referred to as ""time's arrow"", is set by the second law of thermodynamics, the fact that entropy increases (in other words, the universe evolves towards one that is more probable). This is supposed to explain why time moves forward instead of backward.  I say ""most physicists"" because I personally don't accept that; I think it is more compelling to think of time as moving due to cosmological reasons.  Physics has studied time, but it has made no progress on the meaning of that special moment of time we call ""now"".  In physics, the fact that this special moment exists is ignored.  Einstein despaired of this fact, but some modern day physicists regard it as such a glaring omission that they argue ""now"" doesn't exist; it is an illusion. I disagree.  They are putting their physics theory as more fundamental than our own observations.  Some theorists tend to fall into that error; I think of it as the ""Pygmalion Syndrome"" -- falling so much in love with your theory that you ignore reality.   So the fundamental answer to your question is that we understand a bit about time, but it is still largely a mystery.  It is possible that time did not exist before the Big Bang; that it was created along with space, so there is no meaning to the concept ""before the Big Bang"" -- just as there is no meaning to the concept ""closer than zero"".

Dr Jo,1y,Why is the Fortran programming language still used among physicists?,"Some bloody good answers already, notably those of:

Rowan Hamilton,[1] who points out that physicists—despite, or perhaps because of their hypertrophied brains—are crap at writing C++
Jan Christian Meyer, who notes[2] that FORmula TRANslation is a hint as to why people who think in formulae might find Fortran useful
David Eliezer, explaining[3] that not having pointers may well be a good thing—unless you want your week-long computation to die mysteriously
Eliot Miranda[4] and Mario Galindo Queralt[5] correctly point out that there’s a huge, reliable existing code base—and why re-invent the wheel, especially as modern Fortran is actually quite a friendly language.
∗
∗

I think this last point is perhaps the best, but massively understates an important point.

If you’re doing linear algebra, chances are you’re using …

Yep. Fortran.

The core Fortran routines used to do linear algebra have been optimised over decades. Whatever machine you’re using, there likely exists an even better optimised version for that specific box. The speed gains you get are often non-trivial.

If you want to look at these routines, you might pick up a copy of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
. This however won’t do many things you need, so it’s usually wrapped up in LAPACK - Linear Algebra PACKage
. Which is also written in Fortran.

Now go ahead. Have a peek at this code. All precisely done. For example, if you want to perform an LU decomposition, you can start by looking through the source code (LAPACK: dgetrf
) and then integrating this with your knowledge of Sivan Toledo’s recursive LU algorithm.[6] Rewrite this in say C++, making sure there are no errors. Or do things from scratch.

Mature programmers will look at this and say something like:

Fuck All This For A Game Of Toy Soldiers

It seems much more appetising to wrap your serious linear algebra package around BLAS/LAPACK. And in fact, if you’re doing linear algebra in NumPy, Mathematica, Octave, MATLAB, R or Julia, that’s pretty much what you’re doing.

Or you can just use Fortran :)

My < 2c, Dr Jo.

Richard Muller,Updated 7y,Could Richard Muller create a nuclear bomb?,"Yes. Easily.

All I would need would be a few hundred kilograms of either highly enriched uranium or purified plutonium-239. That is not easy to obtain, and I suspect the material that North Korea would be willing to sell me would only be good enough for a fizzle (like theirs); I worry particularly about the contamination of Pu-240 in the plutonium, which would trigger pre-detonation. I would need to have a team of experts in high explosives, both to drive the gun style design (for U-235), and to develop the implosion device (Pu-239). I think a team of about 20 top engineers, maybe 5–10 experimental physicists, and another 20 expert machinists and technicians would do the trick. I’d probably also like to have a top chemistry expert in the phase behavior of plutonium; without that it would be very hard to get the plutonium implosion to work. Fortunately, much of the chemistry of plutonium was published under the atoms-for-peace program in the US, so the data are available; nevertheless, it is voluminous and I’d want to hire an expert. Let’s throw in a few top computer programmers for simulation and optimization. The plutonium bomb would have to make use of explosive lenses, and that is best designed on a computer. We’d need a safe and secure location in which we could do our explosives testing. We might need some more expertise in robotics to devise remote means for shaping and machining the high explosives, as well as the nuclear material. I’d probably need an expert in x-ray imaging. I’d want at least one expert in high voltage electronics. And I could probably make do with two or three theorists expert in nuclear physics (string theorists wouldn’t qualify).

Readily available high explosives would probably be sufficient for the uranium bomb, but not for the plutonium bomb. A plutonium bomb requires high uniformity machined into a precise shape. I’d probably want an explosives expert, someone who really knows how to fabricate arbitrary shapes.

As I work this out, I realize that I am probably underestimating the number of engineers and physicists I would need. But I could do with fewer people if there was no rush, if you were willing to allow me, say, 10 years. If it is a rush (as it was during the Manhattan project) then the expense goes up.

If I was doing this to impress another country, then I would want to involve a top geophysicist, one who could make certain that most of the explosive energy from the detonation was transmitted into the surrounding rock. That would cause all seismographers to overestimate the yield, just as I think they have done for the North Korean tests.

(Speaking of the most recent North Korean test, have you sensed the irony in the news reports? For the previous tests, the low yield was presented as evidence of high sophistication; the North Koreans had figured out how to make a low yield bomb! Tough to do. But now that they are making a bigger explosion, it is touted as an advance! So which is better, low yield or high? Incidentally, the 10 kiloton estimated yield for their recent test is half of what the US achieved in the original Alamagordo test of 1945. And I believe that North Korea did not even achieve 10 kilotons; they undoubtedly designed their test tunnel to achieve the maximum coupling to seismic waves—that’s easy to do—to make us overestimate their yield. Nuclear experts all want to give “conservative” estimates of the yield, and ironically that encourages them to overestimate it. But is it conservative to overestimate the yield when doing so causes political leaders to overreact?)

The budget for mine would be modest, maybe as low as $100M, but more likely approaching $0.5B. That’s less than they spent filming the series Game of Thrones! Cheap. Of course, that does not include the expense of obtaining the (highly enriched) uranium or the (highly purified) plutonium. Getting those materials would probably be the most difficult part.

Richard Muller,Updated 6y,"What do physicists know that lets them win at casinos? My physics teacher once told us that when he went to Vegas, he won a lot, so much that he was asked to leave the casino. He is also a programmer. How could this be possible?","A colleague of mine built a device that enabled him to beat the roulette table. Impossible you may think, but no; it was based on physics.

It worked as follows: to encourage people to bet at roulette, it has been traditional to allow bets to be made after the wheel is spun and the ball is flung, but only before it begins to drop. In that second or two, there is enough information to allow a measurement and computation that will, for example, double your odds of winning. If the computation simply rules out half of the wheel as unlikely, then the odds jump up highly in your favor. Whereas before, your odds of winning might be 98:100 (so you lose), if you exclude half of the numbers, your odds become 196:100; you win big!

You don't have to predict the number where it will fall. You only have to increase your odds by 3% to go from losing on average to winning on average.

He built a device with a switch for his toe in which he tapped each time the ball spun around; with a separate switch he tapped each time the wheel turned. This provided enough information for his small pocket computer to signal him back (with a tap to his leg) where he should place his bet. (He had to calibrate each wheel, but he did that by watching and testing before he started betting.)

The casinos don't have the right to search you, so how can they guard against devices such as that? To do that, they have lobbied to make a law that they can exclude any person without cause.

Rajratna Adsul,1y,How did physicists realize that linear algebra would prove to be highly useful in the study of quantum mechanics? Did they just try various types of math to see what might work? What would have happened if none of them had studied linear algebra?,"There is a very nice answer to this by David Griffiths in his superb book Introduction to Quantum Mechanics. He writes on p.95.

Quantum theory is based on two constructs: wave functions and operators. The state of a system is represented by its wavefunction, observables are represented by operators. Mathematically, wavefunctions satisfy the defining conditions for abstract vectors, and operators act on them as linear transformations. So the natural language of quantum mechanics is linear algebra.

The rigorous treatment of all this justification is given by the following influential book.

This book is one of the finest sources on the foundational aspect of quantum mechanics.

Remember that linear algebra is a geometric framework of quantum mechanics. This is not to mean that quantum mechanics was not studied through other methods. The quantum observables and states are also given in terms of 
C

C∗
-algebras which connect with the usual understanding of quantum observables and states in Hilbert space through what is called the GNS theorem (Gelfand-Naimark-Segal Theorem).

Richard Feynman derived Schrödinger equation from the results of his path-integral formalism. The original derivation is well-written and readable. And it is highly motivating to see how the total amplitude

 But let me be clear. All these routes finally lead to the Hilbert space picture of quantum states. You do get linear algebra of Hilbert space from a path integral.

Richard Muller,Updated 4y,How does Richard Muller study?,"The trick is to find the subject interesting—no, fascinating. It is remarkable that doing so is often possible.

Studying can be horribly boring, and when it is, doing so is tiring and ineffective. Here’s my trick. For most such things, there was someone who found it fascinating. Why? If you can figure that out, then you too might find it fascinating. And if you find it fascinating, then study becomes a joy. In fact, you will discover that you don’t have to memorize anything. You’ll remember it because the mind remembers fascinating things.

Taking a boring class? Ask yourself, why is this class required? Often the answer is because somebody thought the material was not only important but interesting. Perhaps your teacher doesn’t think that, and that’s why the class is boring. But who created the course? Why did they put it in? What did that person love about the material?

I learned this lesson in college. I had a difficult course in Western Civilization, and we were reading the challenging essays of some of the great philosophers. I was struggling to memorize their key points, their ideas, their arguments. Then, one afternoon, a friend of mine (Richard Shavitz) said to me, “Do you agree with what Kant said in that essay? I don’t. I think it is illogical. It’s all wrong. Here’s what I think …”

I was stunned. He wasn’t trying to study the essay; he was trying to figure out if he agreed. That evening I tried the same approach. It turned my study into fun. And I learned the material.

No. He turned it down because he was a pacifist, and knew that he would in that case have had to lead Israel in a war. The thought was disturbing to him in itself, and he also thought he’d be no good at it.

Richard Muller,8y,Was Richard Muller always exceptional in academics and passionate about physics throughout his childhood and graduation?,"I was exceptional up to 6th grade.  Grades 7-9 I was good at physics and math, average at English, below average in ""Social Studies"" and French. In high school I was average, although it was at the Bronx High School of Science.  I was not allowed to take Calculus because my grades in English and Social Studies were not sufficiently high.  I did well in HS physics and very well in math. In College, I was average. In physics, my average was B+.  In my junior and senior years I did very poorly, I believe in part due to undiagnosed depression. In the second half of my senior year I earned several C grades in physics courses. Fortunately, for me, they were not part of the transcript on which Berkeley made its admissions decision. I did well in literature courses. In graduate school, first year, I was well behind the other students. I flunked a general exam twice, one that 80% of the other students passed. It was in by second year of graduate school that I began to develop rapidly.  After a hard working summer, I did very well on the general exam, scoring in the top 5 out of 40 students. (They were incoming students.) Then I joined a research project and flourished. I give the credit to Luis Alvarez.  He was not very much interested in grades, and he was not a scholar in the traditional sense.  He wanted a student who wanted to learn how to do difficult experiments. I was that person. When he got interested in a problem, he analyzed it very deeply and thoroughly. He kept track of interesting problems and jumped in when he found one worthy of attack.

Alejandro Jenkins,Updated 7y,Does Isaac Newton deserve the praise and respect he's been given throughout history?,"I think that, if anything, Newton's enormous personal contribution to the establishment of modern science is under-appreciated.

It is now extremely difficult for a casual reader, even one with advanced training in mathematics and physics, to understand Newton's great work, the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy""), first published in 1687. The great astrophysicist and Nobel laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910-1995) dedicated the last five years of his life to reading the Principia and making it understandable to a modern professional physicist. He only managed to get through what he thought were the key bits before he died.

There are three main reasons why the Principia is so difficult to read (aside from the fact that it was written in Latin, which few people learn now). The first is that Newton presented his proofs in a geometrical (""synthetic"") form, in the manner of the ancient Greeks, rather than using the algebraic (""analytic"") language that is favored by modern scientists and which is much easier to systematize and to teach (especially to people who, as the Soviet mathematician V. I. Arnold complained, ""don't really understand it"").

William Whewell (1794-1866) memorably commented on this aspect of Newton's work:

Nobody since Newton has been able to use geometrical methods to the same extent for the like purposes; and as we read the Principia we feel as when we are in an ancient armoury where the weapons are of gigantic size; and as we look at them we marvel what manner of man he was who could use as a weapon what we can scarcely lift as a burden.

The second reason why the Principia is difficult to understand is that Newton hated controversies, and he deliberately wanted to keep his work technical and abstruse to ""avoid being baited by little smatterers in mathematics"". It is easy to blame Newton for this attitude, but if one looks into the literature of the time, it is clear that Newton had to contend against intense criticism from many fronts, almost all of it misguided and some of it malicious. Even a man with a less prickly and suspicious temperament than Newton would have balked at the prospect of straining to make his work accessible to people who were so eager to attack him.

The third reason why the Principia is hard to read is simply the incredible depth and breadth of what it accomplished. Newton created a new mathematics and a new physics, and not for the purpose of solving the simple problems with pulleys and inclined planes that we teach now to students. In the Principia, Newton formulates his laws of motion and then uses the calculus, which he had invented, to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion from an inverse-square force law for gravity. He goes on to use the same principles to explain the motion of comets, the shape of the Earth, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and even the irregularities in the orbital motion of the moon (an instance of the famously difficult ""three-body problem"" that occupies mathematical scientists even now). The scope of the work on celestial mechanics in Book III of the Principia (""The System of the World"") goes beyond what is taught today to an undergraduate student in physics or astronomy.

There is a mathematical result in Book I of the Principia, about the algebraic non-integrability of smooth ovals, that was not appreciated until it was re-discovered 300 years later by V. I. Arnold and others. There, Newton makes a topological argument long before topology was invented as such. (Arnold points out that it was the first impossibility proof since the ancient Greeks.)

Vladimir Igorevich Arnold (1937-2010)

In Book II of the Principia, Newton struggled with the problem of describing the motion of bodies in resistive media (air or water), long before the nature of that resistance was adequately understood. Much of that work is now obsolete, but fluid dynamicists still deal on a daily basis with ""Newtonian fluids"", because Newton was the first person to define precisely the concept of viscosity.

And Newton was not just a brilliant mathematician and theoretical physicist. He was a also a first-rate experimentalist, who built the first practical reflecting telescope and demonstrated (using a glass prism) that white light is a combination of the colors of the visible spectrum. (His other and far more accessible published work was the Opticks, which appeared in 1704.) Newton also came up with the idea for the sextant (the most important of all nautical instruments until the advent of GPS), formulated an empirical law for the rate at which hot bodies cool off, and studied the speed of sound.

Moreover, Newton was philosophically well ahead of his time. For instance, his great rival Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) rejected the Newtonian theory of gravity because it did not explain how gravity acted across empty space. Newton famously replied that he did not know what gravity was, that he was only formulating a mathematical law that described its observable behavior. Richard Feynman commends the modernity of Newton's approach in his famous lectures on The Character of Physical Law (1965).

It is true that classical mechanics is not taught today in the language in which Newton formulated it, but the ideas are very much his. Two people were principally responsible for the analytical approach to mechanics that we use now: Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) and Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813). Both of them admired Newton greatly. In fact, Lagrange was often heard to remark that Newton had been both the greatest and the most fortunate of all mortals, because one may discover the system of the world only once.

It is also true that we now know that Newtonian mechanics is not the last word on the workings of the Universe. It fails to describe both the behavior of objects traveling very fast with respect to each other (for which we need Einstein's relativity) and the behavior of matter and radiation at very small scales (for which we need quantum mechanics). But the discovery of relativity and quantum mechanics would have been impossible without Newton's pioneering work, which created the framework in which the exact sciences have proceeded since. (Einstein left several touching tributes to the greatness of Newton's intellectual achievements.) Newton himself understood quite clearly —often more clearly than his followers— the scope and limitations of his work. And as long as there continue to be physics students, it seems quite likely that they will start by learning Newton's laws of motion.

Post-script: I am a physicist, so I naturally focused on Newton's contributions to physics. But, besides sharing the credit with Leibniz for the invention of calculus, Newton made other seminal contributions to pure mathematics. He generalized the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents. He contributed greatly to the theory of power series (the ""Taylor series"" is more Newton's than Taylor's). He classified most of the cubic plane curves (in the process helping to develop the techniques of projective geometry) and he showed how to construct the conic section for five given points or tangent lines. Those who work on numerical analysis are very familiar with ""Newton's method"" for approximating the roots of a real-valued function. Also well known are ""Newton's identities"" relating the powers of the roots of a polynomial with the coefficients of that polynomial.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/l4msoqz731fjenap', 'title': ""Does Isaac Newton deserve the praise and respect he's been given throughout history?"", 'score': {'original': 0.50906666666667, 'ai': 0.49093333333333}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I think that, if anything, Newton\'s enormous personal contribution to the establishment of modern science is under-appreciated.\n\nIt is now extremely difficult for a casual reader, even one with advanced training in mathematics and physics, to understand Newton\'s great work, the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy""), first published in 1687.

John Gustafson,8y,What role did Richard Feynman play at Caltech?,"I knew Feynman pretty well when I was an undergraduate there in the 1970s. I was the guy who got him involved in the student musicals, where the first “role” he played was that of Joey Biltmore in Guys ’n’ Dolls as well as the bongo player in the Cuba scene. More on that in a bit. But here is what you should know:

Caltech adored Feynman.

No other faculty member came remotely close to the level of fascination and obsession that the students had for Feynman. Here is a bas-relief that has been part of the architecture of the undergraduate student housing since the 1960s:



It’s funny, but it also is the way students actually felt about him. We idolized him, shared anecdotes about him (many of which later appeared in Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman), and hung on his every word. You have to realize that Caltech has dozens of Nobel laureates; the ratio of students to Nobel laureates there is similar to the ratio of students to faculty members at other universities. The guy in the wheelchair whose illness made his lectures on cosmology difficult to understand was also the topic of considerable admiration and late-night bull sessions, but in the 1970s we had no idea how famous Stephen Hawking would eventually become. Feynman was already famous, and was clearly the star of the show.

I only once heard a faculty member say anything negative about Feynman, and it was another physics Nobel laureate from the same era, Murray Gell-Mann. Gell-Mann was cynical (and obviously more than a little jealous) of the adulation that Feynman received, especially from the undergraduates. I once I heard him say something like “The students think Feynman walks on water.” But other faculty members treasured the fact that Feynman was in their midst. I watched, fascinated, as my advisor George Zweig had an animated discussion with Feynman about how Feynman said he saw numbers and letters in color when he thought about them. Anyone could walk by Feynman’s office on the fourth floor of the Downs-Lauristen building and find him in his office and start a conversation with him.

The students put on a musical every year, usually from the same collection of Broadway shows that high schools draw from, and as the producer and impresario for the 1977 choice, the classic Guys ’n’ Dolls, I was struck by the need for a good Brooklyn accent for the Joey Biltmore telephone booth scene and also, interestingly enough, someone who could play bongo drums for the Cuba scene. So I summoned my courage and approached Feynman about providing some cameos, assuring him that he would not have to attend many rehearsals. We both understood that the effect on the audience was assured. He reluctantly agreed to do it.

It turned out , not surprisingly, that he took to a theater-like role so well we had no problem getting him to rehearsals. With his natural extrovert personality, he caught the show business bug right away. Here is what he looked like for the Havana scene:



At the end of the Intermission, the lights went down and you heard the bongos playing. I was in the orchestra pit, playing keyboard, and when the spotlight hit Feynman, dressed as shown in this photo, the audience turned into a synchronous army of heads that turned to one another and said in almost perfect whispered chorus, pointing, “That's FEYNMAN!”

Years later, in the alumni news, I saw what looked at first like yet another Caltech prank based on the tallest campus building, and I reacted with a derisive snort:



Then I read the article and discovered that it was no prank. Feynman had died.

Isky Mathews,5y,"Can you name some scientists who if they had not died early in their life, could have made great contributions to mathematics or physics?","I think we surely mention not necessarily those who are famous, but those who are relatively obscure due to their death.

One of the people I feel has to be on this list is Yutaka Taniyama, the Japanese mathematician who worked in complex analysis, particularly at the boundary between modular functions and elliptic curves, and who is most famous for his part in the creation of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. Here is our only photo of him:

The official statement of the conjecture requires some pretty ”heavy machinery” in analytic terms, so we shall try to summarise it here.

There are some very important functions in analytical number theory called modular forms
, which are complex-valued functions defined on the upper-half plane (of the complex numbers) that are holomorphic (that is, they are differentiable in a neighbourhood of every point in their domain) and their output is invariant, in a specific sense, with respect to action by the group (or sometimes a specified subgroup, depending on the text) 
S
L
(
2
,
Z
)
.
SL(2,Z).

There are other, perhaps more interesting objects called elliptic curves - these are algebraic varieties on the projective plane taken from the solutions of equations of the form 
y
2
=
x
3
+
a
x
+
b
y2=x3+ax+b
 - which are of central relevance to number theory, often due to properties of their bases related to group actions
.

Now, the aforementioned conjecture states that all plane curves that are elliptic are in fact modular. This may seem to those first reading this to be unimportant, confusing, meaningless or all of these and more, but at the time that he was working in the 1940–50s, this was a great revelation. In fact, many didn’t believe the claim at all and even in the early 1980s, when people were more sure that it might be correct, it was considered one of those “untouchable problems” - it wasn’t simply that it was difficult, nobody knew how to tackle it!

It’s importance was made known when Andrew Wiles announced his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, in which the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture was proved for a certain subset of elliptic curves (semistable curves) and played a central role! At last Taniyama and Shimura got the recognition they deserved.

Or, at least, Shimura did. Taniyama had comitted suicide on the 17th of November, 1958. Why? Nobody really knows. All we have is his suicide note:

Until yesterday I had no definite intention of killing myself. But more than a few must have noticed that lately I have been tired both physically and mentally. As to the cause of my suicide, I don't quite understand it myself, but it is not the result of a particular incident, nor of a specific matter. Merely may I say, I am in the frame of mind that I lost confidence in my future. There may be someone to whom my suicide will be troubling or a blow to a certain degree. I sincerely hope that this incident will cast no dark shadow over the future of that person. At any rate, I cannot deny that this is a kind of betrayal, but please excuse it as my last act in my own way, as I have been doing my own way all my life.

Shimura himself said that when he heard the news, the only thing he felt was ”confused”. He had felt that his best friend had been slightly down recently, but not suicidal. He also said this:

“He was always kind to his colleagues, especially to his juniors, and he genuinely cared about their welfare. He was the moral support of many of those who came into mathematical contact with him, including of course myself. Probably he was never conscious of this role he was playing. But I feel his noble generosity in this respect even more strongly now than when he was alive. And yet nobody was able to give him any support when he desperately needed it. Reflecting on this, I am overwhelmed by the bitterest grief.”

And this, one of the most interesting comments I have read about him:

“He was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to imitate him. But I've realized that it's very difficult to make good mistakes.”

Today, there is still some debate over the naming of the Taniyama-Shimura Theorem. You will notice that I name it after these two Japanese mathematicians (Shimura is, after all, still alive) but others call it the Weil Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil Theorem. This is because a Western mathematician called Andre Weil talked to them in the 1950s and wrote a paper about it in Western mathematics journals detailing the ideas and some work he had done in relation to it - but didn’t cite them at all. Many in the West first came to know about the idea from Weil’s paper, so they called it “Weil’s Theorem”.

Some people, such as Wikipedia
, simply call it the “Modularity Theorem” to be diplomatic; however, whenever I hear someone refer to it with “Weil” in the name, I recall Shimura calling him “a traitor” - for it is not for mathematicians to steal ideas - and whenever I read “Modularity Theorem”, I think of the photo above and Taniyama being forgotten.

Incidentally, I find the photo above one of the saddest I know - if there had to be just one photo left behind showing him, this wasn’t bad. He and Shimura were part of a college group of friends, full of bright sparks, and the photo above makes me think of the time I spend with my friends in the afternoons discussing maths together. It makes me wonder what he was like as a mathematician … or as a friend.

Paul Mainwood,Updated 4y,Who is the greatest American physicist of all time?,"First, let’s say that when we say “American” we mean “American born and bred” as opposed to — say — “fled to America and took citizenship after their best work was done because Nazis”. Otherwise it’s Einstein.

With that condition in place, there are probably fewer than ten candidates at the very top level — the level where a Nobel Prize adds more to the prestige of the Nobel than it does to theirs.

Millikan, Bardeen, Feynman, Schwinger, Gell-Mann… maybe a couple of others? Weinberg?

But I’d vote for someone who towers above all these in terms of his actual achievement.

In popular recognition, he’s nowhere. If you Google his surname, you get a Wikipedia article on a fictional character from the show NCIS before you find him.

Hint. Not him:

Him:

Josiah Willard Gibbs

His achievements? They’re both enormous and rather difficult to communicate — but basically he took the mess of concepts about heat and microphysical dynamics that had been put together by Carnot, Clausius, Boltzmann, Maxwell and others, added a load of his own and tied them into a tear-jerkingly elegant framework that held together, matched experiment, and was flexible enough to be used by every physicist and physical chemist for the next 150 years. Amongst other things, Gibbs’ work founded the entire field of chemical thermodynamics — the field that tells us which reactions will happen and which won’t (which is just as important as it sounds).

In that sense Gibbs is up there with a Maxwell or a Dirac. I can’t do any better than Millikan’s summary:

… he did for statistical mechanics and for thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure

He was also all-American, receiving only the fifth PhD awarded in the US in 1861. His was a devout, Christian scholarly family, all of whose members achieved highly in scholarship, law and business. His father was a New Haven theologian and lawyer who was best-known for his involvement in the Amistad case, when he taught himself Mende from slaves and well-travelled sailors in order to prove the slave-owners’ stories to be false. Willard himself had a quiet, sober career at Yale, writing papers on the mathematics of statistical mechanics that were ignored by almost everyone around him, but were received with awe by the tiny number of physicists in Europe who could see what he was doing.

James Clerk Maxwell, and later Einstein, Planck, Poincare and Bohr all raved about the insights of this obscure, isolated American, who was working almost entirely alone. When Maxwell died in 1879, the joke at Yale went:

Only one man lived who could understand Gibbs’ papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead.

Einstein published papers on statistical mechanics in the early 1900s, But when he finally read Gibb’s 1902 textbook “Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics”, he noted that he would never have written them if he had known of Gibbs (whose works were not then published in German) — for Gibbs’ treatment was so much better than his. Later, he declared Gibbs as undoubtedly the “greatest American genius in history”. And then right at the end of his life Einstein was asked who was the most insightful person he had ever known. He said it was Henrik Lorentz, but added that if he had been able to meet Gibbs, his opinion might have been changed.

For anyone learning physics nowadays, the strangest feature of Gibbs’ work is simply that … it’s still used … unchanged. This almost never happens. When students learn Newton’s mechanics, they never use his original geometrical techniques: they use his ideas reinterpreted through layers of new concepts like vectors (oddly, a concept co-invented by Gibbs) and never actually make contact with Newton’s own writings. Likewise for Maxwell, Boltzmann or other path-blazers.

But Gibbs’ mathematical tools are pretty much unchanged today, and can be written down straight into the textbooks. They were so elegant, well-chosen and general that they even survived the quantum revolution. That is, while there was an earthquake in the understanding of the microphysical, Gibbs’ statistical mechanical framework survived intact, and we are still able to use his ideas in quantum mechanics. This is quite extraordinary, and the result of deliberate design by Gibbs. He was determinedly agnostic about the nature of the microphysical, and constructed his analysis on general enough principles that it would hold whatever the detailed dynamics turned out to be.

So, why is Gibbs so little known? Possibly, because as the above might hint: it’s quite difficult to explain why concepts like the grand canonical ensemble, the Gibbs Free Energy, and similar ideas are as important as they are, without going through a few years of undergraduate study first. So only a few physicists and chemists will ever appreciate what he did.

Another point is that Gibbs was quite so unassuming, normal and quiet. He didn’t deliberately cultivate his own legend, like Feynman. He didn’t (directly) create a technology that changed the world, like Bardeen. Nor did he emphasise the full scope and significance of his conclusions: he assumed that his readers were as insightful as him, and would easily see the consequences that would follow from his mathematics. They didn’t, and it often took several decades for the wider world to realise what he had done. In his personal life too, he was modest and did not seem to care one bit about his lack of recognition.

But if you look at Gibbs’ work, the extent to which it was unparalleled by his peers, and how over decades it influenced others and lies at the base of the advances in 20th Century physics and chemistry — it becomes clear that Gibbs was the greatest American physicist, and for that matter, the greatest American scientist in history.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/xmy34bg7u6kveslq', 'title': 'Who is the greatest American physicist of all time?', 'score': {'original': 0.5176, 'ai': 0.4824}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'First, let’s say that when we say “American” we mean “American born and bred” as opposed to — say — “fled to America and took citizenship after their best work was done because Nazis”.

Paul Mainwood,7y,Are there some dangerous experiments that scientists/physicists are too afraid to execute?,"I dropped organic chemistry as soon as I could. The experiments all seemed variations on “A vaguely white substance was added to another vaguely white substance; after twelve hours, a small amount of white substance was produced”.

This was a huge mistake, and one that I might have avoided if I could have read Derek Lowe’s posts to Science Translational Medicine. Together, these occasional entries make up the most entertaining and terrifying science-related blog on the internet.

The collection is called “Things I Won’t Work With”
 and is a hair-raising categorisation of substances that Dr Lowe in particular refuses to go anywhere near. He has curated a horrific collection of nasty poisonous reagents from his own field of organic chemistry, alongside a hellish collection selected from other specialisations. Let’s look at a couple:

First, Dr Lowe was musing on the ever-present sand-bucket in the corner of chemistry labs, and wondered if there was anything that if dumped in there would just set the sand on fire. Turns out there is: chlorine trifluoride
, and he quotes a colleague’s description:

It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that’s the least of the problems. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals-steel, copper, aluminium, etc. because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminium keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.

Then there’s Dioxygen Difluoride
. This is what you get when you run oxygen and fluorine through a 700C heating block. (Yes, people have actually done this.) To anyone asking why anyone would be so idiotic, Dr Lowe is with you:

Elemental fluorine has commanded respect since well before anyone managed to isolate it, a process that took a good fifty years to work out in the 1800s. (The list of people who were blown up and poisoned while trying to do so is impressive). And that’s at room temperature. At seven hundred freaking degrees, fluorine starts to dissociate into monoatomic radicals, thereby losing its gentle and forgiving nature. But that’s how you get it to react with oxygen to make a product that’s worse in pretty much every way.

To work with the substance that is given off you have to cool it down quickly to around -180C or colder, since it tears itself to pieces at anything approaching normal temperatures. This cooling is tricky, but has been most successfully done by forcing the gas to condense on liquid oxygen-cooled stainless steel.

On a review of the literature, Lowe notes that the vast majority of the work has been theoretical, which seems sensible. However, a few experimenters have had a go with dioxygen difluoride and survived. The most extensive work appears to have been done in the 1960s by a certain A. G. Streng working at Temple University. Lowe lists with incredulity all the substances he managed to react with it:

… ammonia (“vigorous”, this at 100K), water ice (explosion, natch), chlorine (“violent explosion”, so he added it more slowly the second time), red phosphorus (not good), bromine fluoride, chlorine trifluoride (say what?), perchloryl fluoride (!), tetrafluorohydrazine (how on Earth. . .), and on, and on. If the paper weren’t laid out in complete grammatical sentences and published in JACS, you’d swear it was the work of a violent lunatic. I ran out of vulgar expletives after the second page.

Yes, at hundreds of degrees below zero, this stuff sets ice on fire.

But even A. G. Streng chickened out of reacting it with sulfides. It seems that no-one has done so (or at least, no-one has done so and survived in a state to write a paper about it).

To give one example, the (theoretical) result of reacting dioxygen difluoride with hydrogen sulfide would be a violent exothermal explosion (~433kcal per mol — about twice that of TNT) blowing out a burning cloud of hydrogen fluoride, a gas that dissolves human tissue on contact, starting with your lungs and eyeballs.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/7myusdhfc2oknb6p', 'title': 'Are there some dangerous experiments that scientists/physicists are too afraid to execute?', 'score': {'original': 0.99965, 'ai': 0.00035}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I dropped organic chemistry as soon as I could.

It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals-steel, copper, aluminium, etc. because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminium keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire.

Alfredo A. Sadun,Updated 1y,Did you have the chance to get to know Richard Feynman?,"I did. I spent time with Richard Feynman especially in the period of 1978 and 1979.

When I was an undergraduate at MIT, I got to know Philip Morrison. Half of Morrison’s stories were about the Manhattan Project and the makings of the atomic bomb for which Richard Feynman was a key and colorful player. When, six years later, Phil heard that I was going to spend my post-doc at Caltech, he suggested I meet Feynman. We knew that Feynman didn’t care for such formalities and didn’t use a formal letter of introduction. However, I got into the habit of dropping by a Caltech hang out, called Burger Continental, where, on Sundays, Feynman used to hold court. He would sit out on the warm and sunny terrace, underneath the olive trees, telling outrageous and funny stories. There was always a crowd of students hanging onto his every word. I was usually at the far end of the table eating my chips and salsa and drinking a beer. I knew that Feynman recognized me because he would also say hello at a few conferences or lectures we both attended.

That year, in addition to my Caltech post-doc, I did a medical internship at the local hospital. One day, because I was on call, I looked at the admissions board where 4 names had my initials by them indicating I should go and exam them for admission. There were also 5 names listed by another intern who was admitting. One name was Richard Feynman. No one else spells their name like that. I went to my co-intern and told him I wanted the honor of taking Feynman. He was glad to reduce his workload and agreed.

Feynman was surprised to see me in this different capacity. He had come in with a very serious diagnosis and I spent half the night getting him worked up for what would be extremely serious surgery. There is an intimacy in trying to find and stick a vein in a very sick patient at 2 am in the morning. Feynman was remarkably serene and faced his mortality with stoicism. I checked with him for several days after the surgery too, but he was in too much pain to talk meaningfully. But after that, we visited each evening before I went home from the hospital.

We didn’t talk much physics then. Feynman was amused that I had studied with his “red book” as an undergraduate at MIT and that I found Feynman’s book difficult, for me, to follow. And he was happy to hear that Phil Morrison was still telling Feynman stories. But mostly, Feynman wanted to talk about how other patients handled their pain, their fears and their life limiting diagnoses.

Feynman was always a student. Everything was fair game for him to study and think about. Along the way, I learned of Feynman the family man. And Feynman’s thoughts about medicine and doctors (he realized our limitations but appreciated the effort). He wasn’t as funny talking about these things. And he wasn’t as irreverent as I had come to know him from the Burger Continental tables. But I was more impressed than ever that Feynman liked to crack a smile. He had watched the tragedy of his first wife dying when they were in their early twenties. He had watched the atomic bomb, that he helped make, kill almost 200,000 Japanese. He had watched his heroes, Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi, Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard, pushed aside by the U.S. government when the scientists tried to advocate for humanity in regards to nuclear weapons control. So a part of Feynman was pretty cynical. But another part was passionate about the quirkiness of physics and fun loving for himself and friends. He was a very complex man. He had a twinkle in his eye. He was larger than life.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/mnw4u7zcqfsv15ix', 'title': 'Did you have the chance to get to know Richard Feynman?', 'score': {'original': 0.7333, 'ai': 0.2667}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'I did.

Viktor T. Toth,5y,Is there anyone alive who can match Stephen Hawking's intellect?,"Please do not misconstrue what I write below, as I have had the highest respect for Stephen Hawking. His contributions were outstanding.

BUT… so are the contributions of many dozens of other top notch physicists.

What made Hawking stand out and become an icon was not just his intellect but also his illness. Or to be more precise, his unwavering will with which he overcame that illness, making top notch scientific contributions despite the enormous physical difficulties that he faced.

Without the illness, Hawking would still have been recognized by the physics community as an outstanding theorist, an outstanding cosmologist. He would have received accolades. And when he passed away, he probably would have earned a nice obituary, say, on the pages of Physics Today.

But his name would largely have remained unknown to the general public. Just as the names of many other top notch cosmologists or gravitational theorists remain unknown. What do you know, say, of Clifford Will? How about Jayant Narlikar? Or maybe Thanu Padmanabhan? Hans Ohanian, perhaps? These names popped into my mind at random; all well-respected, all top notch physicists, well-known within the gravitational physics/cosmology community, yet as far as I know, all unknown to people outside the community. Hawking would have been among them.

Unfortunately for him, he was crippled by ALS over five decades ago and was given less than two years to live. He defied the odds. Moreover, he made major contributions to his chosen field after he was already severely disabled by his illness. That made him much more than merely a top notch theoretician: He became an inspiration, an example of the human spirit, the will to endure, the will to fight.

Alon Amit,Updated 1y,"Is the chess champion Emanuel Laker the same person as the physicist who was one of the ""Hundred Authors Against Einstein"" in 1931?","It’s the same person, yes, but Emanuel Lasker wasn’t a physicist. He was a mathematician, a world chess champion, and a personal friend of Einstein’s. When Lasker’s biography was published in 1952, Einstein was invited to write an introduction to it. He wrote:[1]

Emanuel Lasker was undoubtedly one of the most interesting people I came to know in my later years. We must be thankful to those who have penned the story of his life for this and succeeding generations. For there are few men who have had a warm interest in all the great human problems and at the same time kept their personality so uniquely independent.

Later in that same introduction, Einstein addresses Lasker’s criticism of the theory of (special) relativity, which is what earned Lasker a place in that miserable compendium, A Hundred Authors Against Einstein:

Now I must justify myself because I never considered in detail, either in writing or in our conversations, Emanuel Lasker's critical essay on the theory of relativity. It is indeed necessary for me to say something about it here because even in his biography, which is focused on the purely human aspects, the passage which discusses the essay contains something resembling a slight reproach. Lasker's keen analytical mind had immediately clearly recognized that the central point of the whole question is that the velocity of light (in a vacuum) is a constant. It was evident to him that, if this constancy were admitted, the relative of time could not be avoided. So what was there to do? He tried to do what Alexnder, whom historians have dubbed ""the Great,"" did when he cut the Gordian knot. Lasker's attempted solution was based on the following idea: ""Nobody has any immediate knowledge of how quickly light is transmitted in a complete vacuum, for even in interstellar space there is always a minimal quantity of matter present under all circimstances and what holds there is even more applicable to the most complete vacuum created by man to the best of his ability. Therefore, who has the right to deny that its velocity in a really complete vacuum is infinite?""

To answer this argument can be expressed as follows: ""It is, to be sure, true that nobody has experimental knowledge of how light is transmitted in a complete vacuum. But it is as good as impossible to formulate a reasonable theory of light according to which the velocity of light is affected by minimal traces of matter which is very significant but at the same time virtually independent of ther density."" Before such a theory, which moreover, must harmonize with the known phenomena of optics in an almost complete vacuum, can be set up, it seems that evey physicist must wait for the solution of the above-mentioned Gordian knot - if he is not satisified with the present solution. Moral: a strong mind cannot take place of delicate fingers.

But I liked Lasker's immovable independence, a rare human attribute, in which respect almost all, including intelligent people, are mediocrities. And so I let matters stand that way.

With the perspective of time, we may observe that the theory of relativity easily withstood the criticisms collected in that “authors against Einstein” silliness, and that Lasker’s particular contribution wasn’t his shiniest moment. To be charitable about it, he misunderstood the theory when it was fairly young, and many people – including some highly knowledgeable and intelligent ones – were still struggling with its counterintuitive aspects.

He was a mathematician, a world chess champion, and a personal friend of Einstein’s. When Lasker’s biography was published in 1952, Einstein was invited to write an introduction to it. He wrote:[1]\n\nEmanuel Lasker was undoubtedly one of the most interesting people I came to know in my later years. We must be thankful to those who have penned the story of his life for this and succeeding generations. For there are few men who have had a warm interest in all the great human problems and at the same time kept their personality so uniquely independent.\n\nLater in that same introduction, Einstein addresses Lasker’s criticism of the theory of (special) relativity, which is what earned Lasker a place in that miserable compendium, A Hundred Authors Against Einstein:\n\nNow I must justify myself because I never considered in detail, either in writing or in our conversations, Emanuel Lasker\'s critical essay on the theory of relativity. It is indeed necessary for me to say something about it here because even in his biography, which is focused on the purely human aspects, the passage which discusses the essay contains something resembling a slight reproach. Lasker\'s keen analytical mind had immediately clearly recognized that the central point of the whole question is that the velocity of light (in a vacuum) is a constant. It was evident to him that, if this constancy were admitted, the relative of time could not be avoided. So what was there to do? He tried to do what Alexnder, whom historians have dubbed ""the Great,"" did when he cut the Gordian knot. Lasker\'s attempted solution was based on the following idea: ""Nobody has any immediate knowledge of how quickly light is transmitted in a complete vacuum, for even in interstellar space there is always a minimal quantity of matter present under all circimstances and what holds there is even more applicable to the most complete vacuum created by man to the best of his ability. Therefore, who has the right to deny that its velocity in a really complete vacuum is infinite?""\n\nTo answer this argument can be expressed as follows: ""It is, to be sure, true that nobody has experimental knowledge of how light is transmitted in a complete vacuum. But it is as good as impossible to formulate a reasonable theory of light according to which the velocity of light is affected by minimal traces of matter which is very significant but at the same time virtually independent of ther density."" Before such a theory, which moreover, must harmonize with the known phenomena of optics in an almost complete vacuum, can be set up, it seems that evey physicist must wait for the solution of the above-mentioned Gordian knot - if he is not satisified with the present solution. Moral: a strong mind cannot take place of delicate fingers.\n\nBut I liked Lasker\'s immovable independence, a rare human attribute, in which respect almost all, including intelligent people, are mediocrities.

Mark John Fernee,Updated 4y,Who suffered the greatest fall from grace in physics?,"Jan Hendrik Schön.

In 2001, Jan Hendrik Schön was the wunderkind of materials physics. Everything he touched turned to gold. His publishing record was envied by almost everyone who knew of him. At one point he was publishing papers at a rate of one every eight days (and Schön was an experimental physicist). What's more, his papers were in the most prestigious journals, including Nature and Science. In just a few short years, Schön had amassed nearly one hundred published papers. His progress was nothing short of gob-smacking!

People were talking about Schön at conferences. All eyes were on him. Schön was the one to watch.

However, people were having trouble repeating his results. It seemed that he really did have the golden touch. However, there is no such thing as the golden touch. Science thrives on reproducibility and there are plenty of very capable people who should have been able to reproduce his work.

One day, someone perusing his work noticed that two completely different data sets from different experiments had the same noise! From that point, the word spread, suspicions mounted, and people started looking at his published data with increased scrutiny… It was all fake!

When pressed, Schön stubbornly refused to release his raw data, claiming that he had erased his hard drive to save room.

It all quickly fell apart from that point. Schön's papers were retracted. He lost his position and eventually his PhD was revoked (but not without a fight, going all the way to the highest appeals court in Germany).

As far as I know, Schön has never publicly admitted fault or offered to explain his actions.

It's a fascinating story. After the scandal broke we even had a staff member give a seminar on the techniques that Schön used to fabricate his data.

Viktor T. Toth,5y,How accurate is this cosmologist's claim that particle accelerators can crush the Earth into the size of a soccer field?,"It is, in my considered opinion and without trying to be disrespectful of Rees, complete bonkers nonsense.

Of course we can never say 100%. Our knowledge is finite. And we live in a fundamentally probabilistic universe, so arguably, we cannot even say with 100% certainty that we won’t all turn into pink unicorns tomorrow.

But the actual probability of something like that is so small, nobody that I know is worried about the prospect of some great unicornization event happening anytime soon.

The very idea that a puny little (in the cosmic scheme of things) particle physics experiment could do something so fundamental like turning the Earth into a black hole or rendering the vacuum unstable is… preposterous.

As the LHC observed, “Whatever the LHC will do, nature has already done many times over during the lifetime of the Earth and other astronomical bodies.” Sure I heard the counterargument: those ultra-high-energy cosmic ray events are rare, whereas the LHC has tremendous luminosity. Very well, but whereas the LHC runs at most for a few years, those cosmic ray events have been “running” for billions of years. And never mind the luminosity at the Earth; how about the luminosity at the source? How come those cosmic sources did not already destabilize the vacuum, produced strangelet stars and whatnot?

As for the prospect of turning the experiment into a black hole: no, black holes don’t suck; they suck at sucking, if you allow the pun. That is to say, a star (which is much bigger in geometric size) is far more efficiently collecting material in its neighborhood than a same mass black hole.

In any case, a particle physics experiment is still subject to conservation laws. Which means that any black hole created by the LHC cannot be bigger in mass than the energy that was input. Which may be a lot on a per particle basis, but not a lot otherwise. So it is hard to see how the LHC (or even a future, much bigger collider) could produce even a Planck mass black hole (22 micrograms) and such a black hole evaporates essentially instantaneously; in short, it’s just a fancy way to turn some of the particle energies into high energy photons, nothing more.

To sum up, there are many things I worry about when it comes to our long term prospects of survival: war, climate change, emerging machine intelligence (no, not self-driving cars going berserk Hollywood-style), even a catastrophic impact event. But a particle physics experiment gone awry? Not a chance.

Ron Brown,3y,"What Richard Feynman stories do you have to share with? How does he inspire you, if he does?","I have written about this before:

The occasion was a physics teachers conference in November, 1987 - Richard Feynman’s last professional meeting just three months before his death - and he was obviously quite weakened by the illness and treatments. He had been on a panel discussion about what should be included in teaching high school physics - and was accompanied by Caltech’s David Goodstein, whom I knew well.

What made the event so very special, however, was the discussion after the meeting. There were a dozen or more of us gathered around Feynman reviewing some of the day's discussion. He was, as usual, exuberant - charming us all with his wit - in every meaning of the word. It was then that Robert Wild (who had been my freshman physics teacher) handed Feynman a long copper tube and dropped an object down the tube. And the object fell v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y through the copper tube. “Ah, it must be magnetic,” said Feynman gleefully of the falling object - something we all knew as it was a fairly common lecture demonstration showing how a falling magnet would induce eddy currents in the copper tube, which in turn would create a magnetic field which would then slow the magnet’s fall. And he dropped the magnet several more times, playing with it like a kid with a new toy, delighting in the interplay of interesting ideas that the demonstration evoked.

Then someone asked “the question”: “What would have happened had the tube been one of the new superconductors rather than copper?” And everyone just stopped! We were faced with a brand new question that no one had ever asked before - and we were in the presence of Richard Feynman. [NOTE: This was 1987, just after the discovery of the high Tc copper oxide superconductors earlier that year.] Feynman chimed in, “I don’t know anything about the new superconductors, so let’s assume it is just an ordinary superconductor.” Game on.

The discussion that followed was priceless - as we all speculated on what would happen, offering arguments and counter arguments. “It would never get inside the tube since it would levitate,” someone said. “No, it would be unstable,” said another. “One could always force it inside,” I offered, “levitation is just a balance of forces.” “Then it would just come to a stop inside the tube - or maybe pop back out,” someone else said. “Or maybe oscillate inside the tube,” said another. Then David Goodstein entered the discussion with, “Once inside the tube, it would be in freefall.”

“Of course!” Feynman responded gleefully - having just had a new insight into an interesting new physics question. (And everyone else said, “Of course” as well - whether they understood it or not!) “It would slow as it entered, be in freefall inside, then be ejected at the other end!”

It was exhilarating - a conversation I will remember forever. An editor of a physics journal was also part of the discussion - and he later wrote that “it was like being on hallowed ground.”

On the entire four hour drive home, I could think about nothing else. Why did Goodstein say what he did - and why did Feynman so quickly agree? (I’m pretty sure all the rest of us agreed because Feynman did.) What was really going on physically that made that answer correct?

The short answer, of course, which requires some assumptions that were never stated, was this: Since the magnetic field cannot penetrate the superconductor, any induced currents were just surface currents - and since the tube would be resistanceless, those currents could not dissipate any energy. So the magnet could not lose any energy as it fell - so would be in freefall! Brilliant. But what was really going on?

I spent much of the next year looking at the very subtle conditions associated with this problem, what the induced currents in the tube would be like, what forces on the magnet they would create, how the Faraday effect and the Meissner effect would be in play - and how their effects were different. That led to talks that I gave - and a paper.

Monte Davis,Updated 5y,"How can I learn to think like Richard Feynman, who claimed that he only had an IQ of 124, and in his words ""If one fool can learn to do it, so can another”?","In 1983 I helped document the Shelter Island II conference on quantum field theory and cosmology for the American Institute of Physics.

 and three Nobel Prizes: Bethe, Dyson, Feynman, Goldhaber, Lamb, Rabi, Serber, Weiskopf, Wheeler, et al).

Feynman was recovering from surgery, mostly lazing in the sun. He didn't plan to speak until Bethe and Dyson genially nagged him into an impromptu talk on quark confinement, and he disappeared for an hour to do a handful of transparencies..

When he went to the lectern, he seemed to drop 30 years: vigorous, pacing, gesturing. He wasn't breaking any new ground, he insisted.

It wasn’t really about quantum chromodynamics and asymptotic freedom: it was about what tools for thinking about them you could (and couldn’t) borrow from springs, rubber bands, inverse-square forces.

Alfredo A. Sadun,Updated 2y,What did Einstein do in his free time?,"Einstein was unusual as a scientist for he devoted a lot of time to just thinking. This was rare in his time and even less common in our time. Most of us have to be content with a few minutes a day, in the shower or perhaps while commuting, where we get simple non-interrupted time to think. Einstein spent a lot of time alone, thinking. For him, that was the best use of his free time.

Einstein pursued several relaxing settings to help him with this thinking. He practiced the violin and when he felt intellectually stumped, he would go to his violin and play music until he had a new thought to break through his frustration. Like most scientists, most ideas don’t pan out. So for Einstein, like other scientists, lots of ideas lead down blind alleys.

When the weather was nice and when he had the occasion, Einstein would go out on his tiny sailboat, usually alone. He sailed short distances and over quiet water. He had a small cabin in rural Germany where he owned a very modest small sailboat on a lake. When he left Germany and moved to the US, he sometimes rented a beach house on the Long Island Sound where he had access to another small sailboat.

But I suspect most of his brilliant ideas came from his walks. When he lived in Princeton (112 Mercer St.) he liked walking to and about the Princeton campus. When he had a good idea, he sometimes ducked into the nearest classroom to commandeer a blackboard where he would sketch out the equations related to his latest thought. Then he would abandon this work to continue his walk. Who knows how many brilliant equations were later erased by the janitor doing his rounds? So in an attempt to mitigate this, Princeton rotated post-doctoral students to follow Einstein’s chalk board excursions and, without disturbing the great mind, copy down on paper his blackboard markings. Some of these still live in the Caltech Einstein papers collection in Pasadena, CA.

Einstein’s brilliance was one part unparalleled intellect, one part dazzling creativity, one part patience, and finally, one part great stubbornness to keep thinking. When I get stumped, I often give up. He kept chipping at it. It was clearly a joy to him.

Alfredo A. Sadun,Updated 2y,Would Richard Feynman have been able to make any notable practical contributions at Tesla if Elon Musk had made him the head of R&D and given him a huge budget?,"Why would Feynman be interested? He certainly would have turned down the job. No amount of salary would have interested him. After all, Feynman initially planned to turn down the Nobel Prize and the million dollar prize. He eventually accepted it to avoid insulting other laureates, many of whom were personal friends. And his new wife insisted that the trip to Sweden would be fun.

Feynman loved academics and all that it afforded him. He delighted in the interactions with his colleagues and students. And he loved giving the lectures for his courses at Caltech. He continued doing so even when, at the end of his life, he suffered from weakness and pain. His joy masked the pain.

Authority didn't impress him. He only did jobs that seemed interesting and that he could personally do the fun part.

Money, meant next to nothing to him. He lived very modestly in a small house in Altadena, a 45 minute walk to work at Caltech. Though after his prizes and higher professorial salary, he was able to afford at least a grander house in Pasadena nearer to Caltech, he never made the move. And he didn't mind the long walks which gave him opportunities to think. He did own a VW van that was good enough to take the kids to Mexico and nearby beaches for holidays.

I would sometimes have a beer with Feynman at Burger Continental, a local dive, and he enjoyed the free chips and salsa. He also was not above bumming free food by crashing events at the Athenaeum.

Would he have been capable of the job as head of R&D at Tesla? Probably. Feynman was a genius capable of many things. But it would have been a very bad fit of job skills to job needs. He’d have become bored quickly. And he had none of the managerial skills expected for heading R&D. It would have been a terrible assignment. Would you harness Secretariat to a plow?

Huang ZheYu,Updated Dec 19,Do theoretical physicists find renormalization more depressing the further they go into the topic? Is this why theoretical physics like to work on string theory etc.?,"Before answering the question let me briefly introduce how renormalization works. Renormalization was actually encountered much earlier in experimental physics. Experimental physicists often use simplified, empirical models which often blow up at some points. As a result, they need to use some clever tricks to work around those infinities by introducing a cutoff. One example is electron emission from conducting plates. We have learned that the attraction between a point charge and a conducting plate is equivalent to the attraction of an opposite charge at the mirror image position. The problem is that the electrostatic potential is inversely proportional to the distance, which means it would take an infinite amount of energy to pull an electron out of a metal plate. We know that this is absurd because we have already measured the work functions of various materials. We also know that the infinity is just an artifact because when the distance is comparable with atomic radii the plate is no longer perfectly planar and electrons can no longer be treated as classical point charges, but quantum waves instead. However, quantum mechanics is rather complex to calculate. So could there be a simpler way to rescue the model?

A few clever physicists came up with an interesting idea. Since we have already measured the work functions of materials, why don’t we just use them? We can assume that electrons are somehow mysteriously “teleported” to a finite distance from the metal plate without costing any energy, then climb out of the potential well on their own. The distance of “teleportation” is chosen precisely when the height of the potential well is equal to the work function measured in experiments. Although this idea sounds rather bizarre, it actually works pretty well in describing field induced electron emission. So you can see the basic principle of renormalization: by introducing an artificial cutoff we can ignore those annoying infinities while focusing on meaningful finite quantities.

Infinities are not only encountered in experimental physics. For example, electrons are modeled as infinitesimal particles emanating electric field. The problem is that in electrodynamics, electric field carries energy itself, and energy is equivalent to mass, which means the electrons’ mass can be regarded as a combination of “bare mass” and “electromagnetic mass”. This is rather peculiar because we don’t know the exact proportion of them. What’s even worse is that the EM mass blows up as the size of electrons approaches to zero, which means even a single electron would carry an infinite amount of mass. As a result, some physicists came up with a similar trick. Since we have already known the electron mass, we can assume that electrons have a very big (infinite) negative bare mass, which almost perfectly canceled out the EM mass while leaving only a tiny mass which is exactly the rest mass we measured (0.511 MeV). It should be noted that this is a gross oversimplification of the actual renormalization trick used in quantum electrodynamics (QED).

But here comes a problem. Experimental physicists invented renormalization because they used a flawed model. In another word, those annoying infinities are artifacts of oversimplified models rather than physical realities. For example, if we solve the Schrodinger equation of electrons in metal plates rigorously, not only can we eliminate those infinities, we can even calculate the work functions from scratch instead of borrowing experimental results. However, renormalization is not supposed to be used by theoretical physicists because theoretical physics should describe our world in the most fundamental level while renormalization is a sign of incompleteness of theories. Unfortunately, even though many theoretical physicists despise renormalization, no one can point out what is wrong and QED has survived rigorous tests to the 10th digit with no signs of breakdown. Some physicists believe that QED is already complete because there is no obligation for theoretical physics to be “natural”. Some physicists believe that renormalization is flawed and must be replaced with a more comprehensive theory which includes gravity (which remains refractory to renormalization). Other physicists believe that even if renormalization is just a provisional measure, it may have a deeper underlying cause which may explain why we can renormalize 3 fundamental forces except for gravity.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4bfe9iwcn2sdq6ky', 'title': 'Do theoretical physicists find renormalization more depressing the further they go into the topic?

Rick McGeer,4y,Why was the theory of relativity not really criticized by creative physicists?,"General Relativity is constantly criticized by physicists because, as the great physicist Richard Feynman put it: “It is a classical theory. In other words, it is wrong; it does not incorporate the quantum principle which we have found to be fundamental to the Universe”. This may seem like a philosophical objection, but it isn’t. General Relativity treats as continuous variables fields which we know to be quantized, namely, mass and energy. It does so because it equates the density and motion of mass/energy with the curvature of spacetime, and no one knows how to quantize spacetime curvature; so in order to equate these quantized variables with the continuous variables of spacetime curvature, we treat mass and energy as if they were continuous, which we know is not true!

So all of us believe that General Relativity is an excellent approximation to a deeper, quantum theory of spacetime; but so far, no one has been smart enough to find that quantum theory, and some very, very smart people have spent lifetimes trying.

There are two fundamental reasons for our failure to find the quantum theory. The first is that General Relativity is an excellent theory of gravity. The gold standard of physical theories is that they agree with experiment, and General Relativity agrees with every experiment and every observation to astonishing precision. The second is that the divergence between General Relativity and Quantum Gravity will only happen in an exceptionally strong gravitational field; but gravity is such a weak force that we cannot produce a strong field in the laboratory, and in fact very strong fields are produced only fleetingly and rarely in the Universe today. In fact, fields of sufficient strength may only have been produced in the very early Universe. Thus, we’ll only see these fields with gravitational astronomy, a field very much in its infancy.

But there is hope! The LIGO
 and North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves
 (NANOGrav) observatories are looking for gravitational waves today, and LIGO has found some; NANOGrav is virtually certain to find waves produced in the Big Bang in the next few years. When the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna

Mr Shelby,Dec 1,Why wasn't Albert Einstein on the Manhattan Project?,"Einstein, the brainiac behind E=mc^2, surprisingly wasn't part of the top-secret Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II. Seems odd, right? The dude's equation literally laid the groundwork for understanding atomic energy, yet he wasn't on the team. Let's break it down.

First off, Einstein was a pacifist at heart. He wasn't exactly keen on building weapons of mass destruction. Although he ditched strict pacifism due to the rise of the Nazis, he still wasn't the ""let's build a bomb"" type.

Secondly, and here’s the juicy part, Einstein was considered a security risk. Yeah, you heard that right. The father of modern physics, a security risk! Why? Well, it boiled down to a couple of things. Einstein was a known supporter of left-leaning causes and had associations with various peace groups, which, during that Red Scare era, raised more red flags than a bullfighter convention. The U.S. government was like, “Einstein, your science rocks, but your politics? Not so much.”

Plus, Einstein wasn't a U.S. citizen until 1940, and even then, he had a history of hopping around different countries. The U.S. was playing it super cautious about who got the inside scoop on the Manhattan Project, and Einstein's globetrotting past didn't help his case.

So, while Einstein’s famous equation helped usher in the atomic age, he was pretty much on the sidelines when it came to actually building the bomb. It’s like being the composer of a hit song but not getting invited to the concert. Einstein did play a role in getting the U.S. interested in researching atomic weapons – his letter to President Roosevelt in 1939 helped kick things off. But when it came to the actual project, he was more of an unofficial mascot than a team player.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/skud6fo29mz7x4q0', 'title': ""Why wasn't Albert Einstein on the Manhattan Project?"", 'score': {'original': 0, 'ai': 1}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'Einstein, the brainiac behind E=mc^2, surprisingly wasn\'t part of the top-secret Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II.

George Hagstrom,Updated 5y,What does a mathematical physicist do that a theoretical physicist doesn’t?,"Mathematical physicists prove theorems. Often, they publish papers in the mathematics literature, which subjects their work to a different level of scrutiny. The need for rigor restricts the types of problems which are accessible to them. Theoretical physicists, on the other hand, use formal calculations which are not mathematically rigorous, and need to work on pushing the boundaries of existing theories.

As an example, there are many interesting mathematical problems in regular quantum mechanics which would be suitable for study by a mathematical physicist but would not be interesting to a theoretical physcist. I would venture that >90% of theoretical physicists do not know (and don’t care about) the difference between a self-adjoint operator and a symmetric/Hermitian operator, but this is a fundamental sort of thing in mathematical physics, about which much of their research has been historically focused. On the other hand, the Standard Model, which is a huge achievement of theoretical physicists, has never been made mathematically rigorous.

Ergodic Theory is another excellent example. This is a rich area of mathematical physics which sits at the heart of the foundations of statistical mechanics, where ergodicity of the dynamics is assumed. Theoretical physicists will recognize that the ergodicity has not been established for nearly any of the systems of interest to physicists, but this does not bother them, and they likely don’t spend any time learning about current research in ergodic theory. Results in dynamical systems which all physicists accept as true, such as the existence of strange attractors for famous chaotic systems like the Lorenz equations, are still considered serious open problems in mathematical physics.

The following is a quote from Peter Lax’s Functional Analysis book, which illustrates a little bit the separate development of the two fields:

“The theory of self-adjoint operator was created by von Neumann to fashion a framework for quantum mechanics. The operators in Schrodinger's theory that are associated with atoms are partial differential operators whose coefficients are singular at certain points; these singularities correspond to the unbounded growth of the force between two electrons that approach each other. To define such differential operators as self-adjoint ones is not a trivial task. Examples 5 and 6 presented in section 33.4 allow some singularities in the potential q, but the ones occurring in quantum mechanics are more singular still. I recall in the summer of 1951 the excitement and elation of von Neumann when he learned that Kato has proved the self-adjointness of the Schrodinger operator associated with the helium atom.

And what do the physicists think of these matters? In the 1960s Friedrichs met Heisenberg, and used the occasion to express to him the deep gratitude of the community of mathematicians for having created quantum mechanics, which gave birth to the beautiful theory of operators in Hilbert space. Heisenberg allowed that this was so; Friedrichs then added that the mathematicians have, in some measure, returned the favor. Heisenberg looked noncommittal, so Friedrichs pointed out that it was a mathematician, von Neumann, who clarified the difference between a self-adjoint operator and one that is merely symmetric.

Jack Fraser-Govil,5y,Can a person become an accomplished experimental physicist with poor math skills?,"Recently, on an answer about the failures of the experimental physics behind the EM drive, our very own Mark John Fernee left the following comment, which I think highlights an important aspect of being an experimental physicist:

Many people don't realise just how much effort must be put in to check experimental observations.

…

Double checking and then checking again is just good experimental practice. This was demonstrated with full public scrutiny when a report of possible superluminal neutrinos was announced. …. Eventually the result was traced to a faulty connection, but only after some weeks of vigorous debate.

In my own experience, I've had an abundance of experimental results that seemed real and quite astounding, but were eventually traced to various spurious causes.

For example, a highly fluorescent batch of quantum dots eventually traced to the ubiquitous use of fluorescent whitening agents in paper and most laundry detergents. Most room dust is fluorescent because of this. A sharp fluorescence onset eventually traced to a filter that was in place in a piece of equipment that we were not intimately familiar with.

A correlation signal that was exactly as expected and which seemed to give a linewidth narrower than ever observed (using a technique that I devised, making me even more excited).

However, further checks on expected behaviour of the signal with changes in the experiment revealed the signal was just some equipment artefact.

…

Experimental science is hard and exacting and people do get things wrong all the time. Those examples above were all caught before publication. However, many wrong results do get published. That's why independent reproduction of experimental results is so important.

(The full comment can be found here)

I think this is highlights a really important thing, which is that there is a perception that theoretical physics is the hardest type of physics, and that experimental physics is for the ‘second rate’ scientists.

I’ve seen this first hand. I tell people that I will be doing my PhD in astrophysics — and they say “ooh that’s interesting”, but when I say that it’s theoretical astrophysics, suddenly people start cooing over how smart I am, and how difficult that is. All because I added the word “theoretical”.

But I want you to go back and read that comment from John, and ask yourself if that type of problem solving could ever be achieved without the ability to crunch huge amounts of data, rigorous statistical analysis, and, more importantly, a firm grasp of the underlying theory.

It is something of a misconception that experimental physicists just sort of dick around, and discover things just by walking into them. That’s not the case — experimental physicists go looking for things that are predicted by theories. Of course, sometimes they do run into things accidentally, but usually whilst looking for something else.

But, in order to know what you are looking for, you need to understand the theory behind it! And, more importantly, when you do find something, you need to be able to interpret that data in the correct framework! There’s no use in spotting, say, the Lamb shift,
 if you don’t know how to interpret quantum mechanical results!

The theorists make new theories sure, but the experimentalists then take those theories, understand and digest them, and then go looking for stuff. That means that the experimentalists have to understand the stuff the theorists produce.

So, whilst they don’t quite need the same cutting-edge mathematical tools at their disposal, it would be a disservice to the experimental physics profession to think that they were just the grunts following the big-guns of the theoretical physicists around.

If you want to test theories with experiments, you have to understand what it is that you are testing — how else will you be able to interpret what it is that you are seeing?

So, not only do experimental physicists need to have their own rigorous toolbox of mathematical skills, to be able to filter out spurious results, to crunch the numbers of experiments producing more than 200 petabytes of data
, but they also need to be able to understand the maths of the thing that they are actually testing!

It is true that this wasn’t always the case. Rory Coker in his answer, notes that Faraday was famous for being an experimental physicist despite having no mathematical background, but Rory also emphasises that the world has changed since then.

Physics has evolved, pushed the boundaries, and gone way beyond the level we were at at the middle of the 19th century. Experimental physics is no longer a hobby of the “gentleman physicist”, and isn’t something you can just knock up in your back room.

It is a rigorous, difficult, scientific endeavour. It is every bit as demanding (and worthy of respect) as theoretical science.

So, if you have “poor math(s) skills”, then you can still become an experimental physicist — you just need to work hard to make your mathematical skills better. Hard work and determination can overcome most academic problems. Your maths skills are not necessarily the roadblock.

The thing standing in your way is your willingness to learn mathematics. If you are willing to learn, then you can indeed be an experimental physicist. If you’re not, then that’s where we have a problem.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/3joytv8nwpa1c95d', 'title': 'Can a person become an accomplished experimental physicist with poor math skills?', 'score': {'original': 0.4835, 'ai': 0.5165}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Recently, on an answer about the failures of the experimental physics behind the EM drive, our very own Mark John Fernee left the following comment, which I think highlights an important aspect of being an experimental physicist:\n\nMany people don't realise just how much effort must be put in to check experimental observations.\n\n…\n\nDouble checking and then checking again is just good experimental practice.

This was demonstrated with full public scrutiny when a report of possible superluminal neutrinos was announced. …. Eventually the result was traced to a faulty connection, but only after some weeks of vigorous debate.\n\nIn my own experience, I've had an abundance of experimental results that seemed real and quite astounding, but were eventually traced to various spurious causes.\n\nFor example, a highly fluorescent batch of quantum dots eventually traced to the ubiquitous use of fluorescent whitening agents in paper and most laundry detergents. Most room dust is fluorescent because of this. A sharp fluorescence onset eventually traced to a filter that was in place in a piece of equipment that we were not intimately familiar with.\n\nA correlation signal that was exactly as expected and which seemed to give a linewidth narrower than ever observed (using a technique that I devised, making me even more excited).\n\nHowever, further checks on expected behaviour of the signal with changes in the experiment revealed the signal was just some equipment artefact.\n\n…\n\nExperimental science is hard and exacting and people do get things wrong all the time. Those examples above were all caught before publication. However, many wrong results do get published. That's why independent reproduction of experimental results is so important.\n\n(The full comment can be found here)\n\nI think this is highlights a really important thing, which is that there is a perception that theoretical physics is the hardest type of physics, and that experimental physics is for the ‘second rate’ scientists.\n\nI’ve seen this first hand.

Jack Fraser-Govil,5y,"As a physicist, what words/phrases would be understood by other physicists, but would make no sense to anyone else?","Every morning, at 11 O'clock, the entire theoretical physics department at the University of Oxford gathers together in our main collaboration area for a coffee.

It sounds a really frivolous waste of time, but an incredible amount of physics gets done during this time, as people from vastly different groups and areas of research gather together and chat about their work, commenting on anything that they might be able to contribute, and so on. As a brand new postgraduate, I mostly just sit and listen in on some of the fascinating conversations.

On this occasion, however, I was actually deeply involved in one of the conversations — chatting to a guy named James Binney
, a man renowned in my own field of galactic physics (he literally wrote the book[1] on my subject….oh, he actually wrote two[2] ). Also present was John Magorrian
, another astrophysicist.

This conversation, however, was about quantum mechanics, and the way this subject and related ones are taught in the undergraduate course at Oxford. James has also written a textbook on quantum mechanics, because he used to lecture it, and John currently lectures the 1st year Linear Algebra course, which forms the bedrock of the Quantum course we were discussing.

This topic is something I have thought a lot about, both because I recently emerged from this exact same course, and because I am currently writing my own textbook on the prerequisite mathematics for quantum mechanics — so I have fairly strong opinions on where the course I was taught had strengths and weaknesses!

It was during this conversation, that Binney came up with a sentence which makes perfect sense if you hear it….but which is also completely barmy if you don't know what he's talking about:

You have to teach quantum mechanics before thermal physics — students just don't know how to COUNT before you do quantum!

Physics students … don't know how to count?

What?

…

What!?!

That's a pretty crazy assertion to make, right?

However, it actually makes perfect sense — if you understand the context of what he's talking about. Whilst Binney made this rather baffling statement, John was nodding sagely next to him in agreement!

The reason this makes sense has to do with the kind of thermal physics we were referring to — namely statistical physics.

Statistical physics is a way of finding out what configuration an insanely large number of particles settle into at equilibrium, given some conditions — using a method known as the Principle of maximum entropy
.

In this case, we use a very specific definition of entropy — not the airy fairy “measure of disorder” you may have heard of, we define the entropy 
S
S
 as:

S
=
k
b
ln
(
W
)
S=kbln⁡(W)

Here 
k
b
kb
 is a constant (the Boltzmann constant), and 
W
W
 is the number of possible microstates corresponding to a given macrostate.

Simply put, for a given “large scale” configuration there are many, many different ways to put together the individual pieces (the microstates) to end up with the same final result — you can replace any of the bricks in a house with any of the others, without altering what the house looks like!

The task of statistical physics, therefore, is to be able to enumerate these possible microstates, given some initial information.

In other words….you need to be able to count.

However, you can't do this properly, until you understand the concept of a quantum state.

Thus, we see that what James Binney was actually saying was:

You have to teach quantum mechanics before thermal physics — students just don't know how to [enumerate all possible ways of constructing a given system from its microscopic components] before you do quantum [because this teaches you about those microscopic components]!

But still: the idea of physicists redefining the word “count” just because they felt like it certainly triggers my “normal people have no idea what we're talking about” bell!

Naveen Subramanian,1y,"Why did Abdus Salam, a Pakistani theoretical physicist, give his Nobel prize medal to his Indian teacher?","The Asian culture and ethnicity are deeply rooted in students worshipping/respecting teachers. Eklavya had made a statue of Guru Dronacharya & had learned archery on his own, turning into the most powerful archer. He was one of the able competitors to Arjuna. When his guru learned about him, he demanded his right thumb. Eklavya due to respect for his teacher, cut his thumb to show his bhakti.

Students’ impressions of their teachers are influenced by, among other factors, the attributes that the teacher brings into the classroom and the behaviors they display in the classroom. The Confucianism that exists among Asians requires “obedience to and respect for superiors”. Our students are diligent and achievement driven, with high regard for their education and teachers.

Students positive perceptions of the teaching and learning process lead to deep learning, whereas negative perceptions lead to surface learning. We Asians respect knowledge and knowledgeable teachers. We believe they influence our learning behavior, and they sow the seed for knowledge in a subject. We respect and thank our teachers when we excel in subjects that later fetches awards and recognitions.

We celebrate Guru Purnima every year across generations. It’s an ethical, ethnic, and philosophical value that we had nurtured traditionally.

Dr. Salam was from Mohalla ChainPura In Pak where he studied in Govt high school, later did his higher education at Sanatan Dharma College, Lahore. where Prof. Anilendra Ganguly from Calcutta was his mathematics teacher. He instilled an interest in Salam to learn maths.

Dr. Salam’s interest in physics and maths paved the way for him to discover the foundation of Higgs Boson which was laid by ‘the theory of particle physics” discovered by Dr. Salam. This theory leads to the discovery of particle mass, ultimately the Higgs Boson, popularly known as the ‘God Particle’, for which he bagged the Nobel Prize in 1979. He was the first Muslim to win a prestigious award in any science stream.

Once winning the Nobel prize, he felt his maths teacher Prof Ganguly deserves credit for his success. He wanted to meet him and thank him in person. But prof Ganguly had already moved to India from Lahore following the India-Pak partition. Dr. Salam tried to trace him for 2 years (1979–80) and failed. By 1981 he requested Indian PM Indira Gandhi to trace his professor.

Finally, on 19 January 1981, Dr. Salam met his professor at his Kolkata residence. He dedicated his Nobel Prize medal to Professor Ganguly, who had grown very old and was unable to even sit up. Dr. Salam hugged his bedridden professor saying - “ this medal is a result of your teaching and the love of mathematics that you instilled in me. This medal is your’s sir, not mine” saying this he wore the medal around his teacher’s neck and hugged him.

It was the ultimate tribute to a teacher that went far beyond the parochial limits of religion and nation.

Later in 1981, the University of Calcutta decided to award Dr. Salam the Debaprasad Sarbadhikary Gold Medal to honor his achievements. Instead of accepting the award, Dr. Salam refused and said it was his teacher who deserved it.

Guess what - the award ceremony was conducted at his teacher’s home. The University later held an award ceremony in an ailing Anilendranath’s South Calcutta residence in 1981,

Dr. Abdus Salam was present to see his revered teacher getting his due respect at last.

Christian Santangelo,Updated 4y,"Do physicists get a ""high"" from solving a tough problem?","Do physicists get a ""high"" from solving a tough problem?

When I was a student, I was working on a problem that was meant to explain some experiment. In the course of working on this problem, I got stuck. The experimental phenomenon I was trying to explain relied on a subtle balance between different terms in an equation and I was getting stymied by the fact that I only had an approximate solution to the problem rather than an exact one. With only an approximate solution and a problem relying on a subtle balance, it is pretty hard to be sure what you are doing.

Lo and behold, I ran across a paper that went through some mathematical gymnastics to find an exact solution to a similar (but not the same) problem. In the course of puzzling it through, I noticed that there was an interesting way to interpret their results and - amazingly enough - an entire set of exact solutions that no one had ever noticed before! And, of course, those exact solutions were exactly what I needed.

I remember telling people that evening at dinner how I had cracked this important problem. In the passage of time, I admit that I no longer recall exactly how I felt, but I remember how excited I was explaining it. It was definitely a “high” of sorts. Yet, I had a nagging doubt. My solution was fairly easy to come by and, well, how could everyone have missed it?

The next morning, I pored over my calculations and (curses!) I found an error. Some term I thought had canceled the day before was persistently not doing so the next day. I wouldn’t say I was devastated; the typical situation in physics is that whatever you are doing doesn’t work. I was definitely embarrassed. I mean, I told people I had figured something out and I was wrong!

And, I don’t know how much later it was, but I noticed the part that didn’t cancel looked like something I had seen before. And based on that understanding, it was clear that sometimes that extra term really was zero! I had actually understood something important about the original exact solution that I had originally read about. And, I had successfully managed to find lots of new, exact solutions! The method I used was borrowed from high energy physics but I had applied it in a completely new field.

Unfortunately, my original problem wasn’t one of the new exact solutions I had found. In fact, though I had a nice way to think about my new exact solutions, further exploration showed that they were still fairly limited in scope. And after all this, I still had gotten nowhere on the original problem I had set out to solve. Sometime later, I mentioned this to the experimentalist who had originally posed the problem to me. “Oh, that was wrong. It turned out we interpreted the pictures on the microscope wrong.”

Shit.

That is physics. Sometimes you feel high. Sometimes you feel low. Often you never even solve the problem you meant to solve; you keep changing the question as you learn more things until, in the end, your answer and your question match.

Raziman T.V.,3y,How do physicists picture an electron in their minds?,"For me, it depends on the kind of physics I am working on

When the problem I study involves a single electron affected by an electromagnetic field, I think of it as a (very) tiny blob of charge.

When I am looking at the behaviour of an electron inside an atom or a molecule, I visualise it as a wavefunction — spread out with some probability density function specifying the chances of where it can be found.[1]

When I think about electrons inside a metal oscillating due to a light wave, I picture an electron as a drop in a liquid which sloshes around.[2]

When I am working on high-energy electron beams diffracting from crystals, I picture them the same way as light beams — high-frequency oscillating localised wavepackets which move fast.[3]

But most importantly, I try not to let my visualisation mislead me too much — I get into the relevant mathematical model as soon as possible.

Colin Riegels,Updated 4y,Who did Albert Einstein look up to?,"Kurt Gödel.

Einstein and Gödel were both at IAS at Princeton at the same time, and Einstein described walking to work with Gödel as a “great privilege”. Because he worked in the slightly obscure field of logic, he was much less famous than other mathematical geniuses of his age. But I can do no better than quote von Neumann
 on Gödel's seminal ‘incompleteness theorem’:

Kurt Gödel's achievement in modern logic is singular and monumental—indeed it is more than a monument, it is a landmark which will remain visible far in space and time. ... The subject of logic has certainly completely changed its nature and possibilities with Gödel's achievement.

Gödel was originally a logician, but later in life his interests turned to philosophy and physics and some of his postulations caused Einstein to doubt and re-examine his own theories.

Sadly Gödel was also a bit of a nutcase who literally starved himself to death through fear of being poisoned. Madness and genius are sometimes said to be close cousins.

Jay Wacker,Updated 7y,How important was Richard Feynman’s work?,"Richard Feynman had four signature achievements that are taught regularly to this day. The first is the Feynman path integral. The Feynman path integral states that quantum mechanics is based off of the classical Lagrangian formulation of theories, but one where you weight the different paths between points by exp(iS/ℏ)exp⁡(iS/ℏ)\exp( i S/\hbar). The principle of least action from classical mechanics arises out of the mathematical approximation known as the stationary phase approximation. The Feynman path integral has numerous implications, the biggest of which is that you can formulate quantum mechanical theories in a Lorentz invariant manner rather than the canonical commutation approach where Lorentz invariance is a miracle that occurs. The second achievement of Feynman are Feynman diagrams. Before Feynman, basically no one could do relativistic quantum mechanical calculations because they were too technically difficult. Feynman gave an approximation technique that let ordinary physicists (read someone not named Julian Schwinger) do calculations. This technique is how we still do calculations to this day; although, there are some cracks in the wall showing that this formulation may be over-complicating the underlying quantum mechanical behavior of theories. The third achievement, for which he won the Nobel Prize, was showing that quantum electrodynamics is a consistent relativistic theory of electromagnetic interactions and matched the predictions observed in experiment. The primary challenge was the appearance of divergences in the quantum calculations. The whole procedure of renormalization was a great achievement even if it was another three decades before it was properly understood — these theories could have been thrown away for that interim period, possibly delaying physics for 30 to 50 years. Feynman shared this Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and Sin'ichirō Tomonaga who also made the same achievements near contemporaneously and Freeman Dyson was heavily involved with this achievement. The final achievement that is widely used to this day is the Feynman parton model of hadrons. The proton is a complicated entity that most people know is made up of three quarks. Well this turns out to be a dramatic oversimplication that is qualitatively wrong. Feynman came up with a model for the proton that let us compute predictions for subnuclear interactions of the protons where the constituents of the protons are bunch of nearly independent particles. The distribution of the constituents is actually far more complicated than the three quarks picture. This way of thinking about the proton lets us understand how Gell-Mann’s quarks and quantum chromodynamics maps on to strong interactions. This model isn’t taught until advanced graduate courses in quantum field theory, but it is very important for our understanding of nature.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/wbl3z1h0c9jvf5tq', 'title': 'How important was Richard Feynman’s work?', 'score': {'original': 0.9952, 'ai': 0.0048}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Richard Feynman had four signature achievements that are taught regularly to this day.

Neal King,8y,How did Richard Feynman raise his children?,"A couple of times, I ran into Feynman at the Caltech cafeteria. He recognized me from my enthusiastic participation in Physics X (that has been described elsewhere in Quora), and invited me to join him.

On one of these occasions, we went back to a topic that someone had raised in Physics X, about Feynman's son, Carl.

He was very proud of Carl: He mentioned that he had been describing the nuclear reactions that powered the Sun to him, but Carl was slightly more up-to-date than he was, and was able to inform him that the experts now focused on a slightly different set of reactions. (Imagine the effrontery of correcting RPF on nuclear physics - even if he IS your dad!) One of the students said, ""If I had a kid like that - I'd strangle him!"" Feynman retorted, ""No you wouldn't - not if you had made him yourself!""

One of the girls in Physics X asked, ""What about your daughter?"" ""She's different,"" he said. ""When I told her that the Sun is made of gas, she said, 'Daddy, I don't like gas.' "" So he wasn't able to pursue the same line of development with her as with Carl. (I do not believe it was, within the Caltech community, generally known at the time that daughter Michelle was adopted.)

On this lunch occasion, he mentioned a topological question that had come up with his son: Imagine a plait of rope with a loop at each end. Now imagine the same two-loop plait, but with the loops interlinked. The question is, Can the plait with interlinked loops be continuously converted into the plait without the loops? Are the two cases topologically equivalent?

Carl had the answer: Yes. He was able to imagine himself as a two-loop plait, by linking the loop of his arms through the loop of his legs (with feet in contact); and he was able to imagine the continuous shrinking of his torso until the difference between the two cases vanished. So the answer was Yes.

RPF had then taken the same question to two different topologists, neither of whom was able to answer the question. But they validated Carl's approach.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/4qk9corta5jdfbme', 'title': 'How did Richard Feynman raise his children?', 'score': {'original': 0.9993, 'ai': 0.0007}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'A couple of times, I ran into Feynman at the Caltech cafeteria.

Richard Muller,6y,What do physicists think about engineers who solve design problems using the sciences and creativity? How different is it from developing theory in physics?,"Engineers are true geniuses. They do things that I can’t do, and that I can’t imagine doing. I love to work with them because they are so smart, so intuitive, and can accomplish so much.

When I was a graduate student, I worked with an engineer, Bill Pope. I wanted to design a liquid hydrogen target to fly in a large balloon-borne instrument, to study the interactions of high energy cosmic rays. I sketched up some initial ideas and presented them to Bill. He took them away and a day later had a complete design. He had identified potential problems, and figured out how to make it lighter and safer. I was blown away. It was beautiful.

One week later I told him how great his design was, how much I admired it, and how I wondered how he had done it. He laughed. He said that he thought the true genius was in my original design in which I had worked out the fundamentals and gotten it basically right.

I felt he had performed a miracle. He thought I had. Put together, we had actually done a wonderful job together. We both thought the hard part was done by the other. That reflected the fact that our talents were mutually beneficial. A physicist working with an engineer was far more than the sum of our two talents.

Leanne Davis,6y,"How did Richard Feynman learn so much in his life with such depth, without procrastinating?","Feynman was brilliant and from a very early age he was tinkering with everything and taking things apart. He’d get broken radios and take them apart to figure out why they were broken. During the depression, he’d take small jobs fixing radios and solving problems with them just by seeing the issue and just thinking about what caused the problem. As part of that, he’d tear ideas apart too in order to make them a part of his way of thinking about things. He was much more interested in knowing the answers to things rather than publishing papers. Feynman had a childlike curiosity about everything and never thought that the answer to anything, no matter how small, was not worth knowing the answer to.

He always said that his father taught him a very important lesson between knowledge and understanding when he was a child.

“One kid says to me, “See that bird? What kind of bird is that?” I said, “I haven’t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.” He says, “It’s a brown-throated thrush.

He had already taught me: “See that bird?” he says. “It’s a Spencer’s warbler.” (I knew he didn’t know the real name.) “Well, in Italian, it’s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it’s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it’s a Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese, it’s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing—that’s what counts.” (I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.)”', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.9954
Nasir Afaf,Updated 10mo,"Why is Richard Feynman such a prodigy among the physics community and even to the outside community, even though there were physicists like Dirac?","Prodigy isn't the right word.

The primary reason physicists rated him highly was because he liked working things out for himself rather than take somebody else’s word or authority for it.

This attitude has profound implications.

It meant first of all that he could be trusted - there was an honesty involved in his approach. So physicists trusted him to know what he was talking about. That's because he had taken serious time out to understand a topic, or to fail to understand it. But tell you the truth always.

As opposed to passing on 2nd or 3rd hand ideas handed down to him. His understanding of topics was as close to the orginal discoverer’s as possible - where he was the re-discoverer of a topic already known, or the discoverer of a new way himself.

This is the opposite of what happens in social media for example. There are high levels of dishonesty and overblown claims in social media. Feynman was the opposite - despite the showboating he was often accused of.

So Feynman, right or wrong, was almost always original. That's not something that can be said of many others.

Now always being original isn't always a good thing. You can end up getting stuck, or rediscovering the wheel. I'm not sure if it was Mark Kac, the mathematician, who was the other half of the Feynman-Kac theorem in stochastic calculus, who said that:

“Some talented people can be too original for their own good. You see the people who came before weren't fools. Learning from them is no bad thing. You can't climb Mont Blanc without learning from others. But the thing with Dick was that he was so damned smart he really could climb Mont Blanc on his own.“

So in a nutshell, he was simultaneously original, very talented, and very hard working. This led him to unique perspectives on most matters he touched.

Kac also decribed different typres of geniuses. He described the first type as those we could match if only we were much smarter and hard working. You'd look at their work and not only be able to follow the logic of the argument, but as well the manner in which they came up with it.

Feynman was not this kind of genius according to Kac. He was the 2nd type, who Kac called magicians.

“This second type of genius is a person whose work you may be able to follow, but you can't understand how they came up with it in the first place. Their thought processes remain hidden. I call them magicians. Dick was a magician.“

Now, in my view, it takes a very high level of intellect to differentiate between the two kinds of genius - Kac himself was no ordinary man. So we must thank him for this hugely insightul distinction.

Still, I have a slightly different take on the matter. I think talent aside, character traits of curiosity and tenacity, even stubborness, play a huge part in genius. You see Feynman’s celebrated path Integral approach was based on an observation of Dirac that Feynman picked up. Dirac had noticed something and never developed it. Feynman not only took it, struggled with it, but then used Lagrangian methods of variational calculus he had never liked, to eke out what he could from that observation.

We know the end result as the Path Integral method.

And so here we get something of the man. Takes a little clue, hangs on to it, and develops it using a technique he had never liked (because it is indirect and less intuitive). And ends up giving us something that most theoretical physicists would regard as as the most intuitive formulation of Quantum Mechanics.

Was it Edison who said genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration?

The final word belongs to Julian Schwinger, another remarkable man, and who it must be said laid the foundations of quantum field theory.

When Feynman passed, Schwinger who was seen as a critic of Feynman diagrams, had this to say about his long term rival:

“The outstanding intuitionist of our age, and a prime example of what lies in store for a man who dares march to the beat of a different drum.”

Both Schwinger and Feynman can be said to be founding fathers of modern day theoretical physics, each marching to the beat of their own drum.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/uzvh0qdjw7lb42cf', 'title': 'Why is Richard Feynman such a prodigy among the physics community and even to the outside community, even though there were physicists like Dirac?', 'score': {'original': 0.5415, 'ai': 0.4585}, 'blocks': [{'text': ""Prodigy isn't the right word.\n\nThe primary reason physicists rated him highly was because he liked working things out for himself rather than take somebody else’s word or authority for it.\n\nThis attitude has profound implications.\n\nIt meant first of all that he could be trusted - there was an honesty involved in his approach.

David Kahana,6y,"What do physicists think of XKCD's claim that we still don't understand the mechanics of ice skating, piling sand, or sticking a balloon to the wall?","It’s just a joke, but it’s a joke with a point. You can give rough descriptions in each of those cases.

But the joke turns on the level of your understanding.

Let’s take the case of the hair and the balloon and the wall - the standard explanation goes: electrons are transferred by friction to the balloon from your hair. Your hair is positively charged afterwards, and the balloon is negatively charged. When the balloon is brought near to a wall electrons in the wall are driven away from the negatively charged balloon and so there is a region created with a net positive charge on the surface of the wall. The attraction between unlike charges is then enough to hold the balloon to the wall.

Now this is clearly a far more complex question than it seems. Why should electrons be transferred from your hair to the balloon? Why not the other way around? Why can the wall become polarized enough to attract the balloon? Surely the balloon must become polarized too? Why don’t the electrons jump from the surface of the balloon to the wall?

All of these are extremely complicated questions to answer - having to do with the electrical properties of each material. These are ultimately not problems that can be solved from first principles - so in this sense we do not understand them. This is not to say that no understanding can be gained at all: but you are dealing with complex physics at this point - physics that you could well spend a lifetime on trying to understand.

All materials are different - they have different electron affinity, different polarizability. These bulk quantities are fiendishly difficult to calculate from first principles: and that is what the joke turns on.

The cartoon is implying that in the real world apparently simple phenomena are actually very complex, and we cannot start from a theory of everything and ever expect to give intelligible explanations of those phenomena.

Now, where I diverge from the thrust of the joke is in disagreeing flatly with some philosophers of science that this constitutes a failure of reductionism in any important sense. No one should ever have expected all problems to be solvable from first principles - that was long known to be an un-realistic goal.

The search for a theory of everything as far as such problems as these ones are concerned is long over and it has already succeeded.

The basic theory is already in place to explain such things.","{'success': True, 'disclaimer': 'If you are trying to scan content that is under 50 words in length, you will run into AI accuracy issues.', 'public_link': 'https://app.originality.ai/share/bn4uezt3pw79gask', 'title': ""What do physicists think of XKCD's claim that we still don't understand the mechanics of ice skating, piling sand, or sticking a balloon to the wall?"", 'score': {'original': 0.9997, 'ai': 0.0003}, 'blocks': [{'text': 'It’s just a joke, but it’s a joke with a point.

Neal King,7y,What was Richard Feynman like as a person? How much interaction did you have with him?,"The first time I met Feynman, I was visiting CalTech, and thinking about transferring there from Berkeley, as an undergrad. I dropped into the Physics department to talk with anyone. The guy that I ran into said, “Not many people are around right now. Why don’t you talk to Dick?” The idea scared me, but what the hell? I sat down in his office, and waited. I did some minor calculation on his blackboard.

When Feynman came back in a few minutes later, he first carefully erased my calculation from his board. Then he asked what I wanted to know. I wanted to know whether it made sense to transfer from UC Berkeley to CalTech or Princeton, as an undergraduate. He said it really didn’t matter, because they were all good schools, where they would not “spoon feed” me. I agreed that that made sense, I just wanted people to “show me the things”. That was pretty much that, except that as I was leaving, he also left his office. So he ended up taking the same elevator down as I. So I said, “Goodbye,” and he said “Goodbye”; and I somehow felt uncomfortable with that, so I said “Goodbye” again, and he said “Goodbye” again! We might have gone three rounds before I snapped out of it and escaped!

I was impressed that he had been willing to take the time to deal with me, a total stranger who was not even a student at CalTech. I decided to disregard his advice and transfer to CalTech.

When I changed schools, I made a bee line for Physics X, his Monday night Q&A session. I have told that story elsewhere in Quora, so you can find that by looking at my content.

On three occasions during the year I was there, I ran into Feynman at the cafeteria around lunchtime when he wasn’t with someone else, so he invited me to join him for lunch. I remember asking him about the weird way your fingers create shadows with venetian window blinds (he said, “You’ll feel like an idiot once you figure it out!” Then I realized it was just due to the finite size of the Sun.)

Another time, I commented on the statement in the FLoP, that for every symmetry there is a conserved quantity (reference to Noether’s theorem). So for translational invariance, there is linear momentum; and for rotational invariance, there is angular momentum. But I thought it was weird that you actually cannot shift the location of an object; but you CAN shift the orientation of an object with respect to the rest of the universe (the way a cat twists around to land on its feet, if it’s dropped from a height). He agreed that it was interesting. In the statement in the FLoP, he had mentioned that charge conservation also came out of an invariance principle. I didn’t follow his statement, so I tried to get some clarification. He talked about it a little bit, but he basically said it was trivial and not really very meaningful.

Another time, he told me how proud he was of his son, who had figured out that a rope with two loops that were interlinked was topologically equivalent to the same rope with the two loops unlinked.

Another time, we talked about how kids can quickly pick up on patterns: Say a transformation from “a b c d e” to “a c b d e” after a few examples. I was blowing it, possibly because I felt a bit on the spot!

One time, I remember that Kip Thorne came up to our table, and asked if Feynman wanted to sign someone’s birthday card. Then he teased Thorne: “Who’s going to sign your 65th birthday card? How old are you, anyway?” Thorne: “35.” “35? No wonder you’re so much smarter than I am!” Thorne just grinned and moved on. Feynman continued his remark to me: “35? He’s just a baby!”

So, I found Feynman to be very personable. I never tried to impress him (I figured there was no way to win that game), I just asked him what I sincerely wanted to know about, so he took all my questions seriously and tried to answer them.

He talked about it a little bit, but he basically said it was trivial and not really very meaningful.\n\nAnother time, he told me how proud he was of his son, who had figured out that a rope with two loops that were interlinked was topologically equivalent to the same rope with the two loops unlinked.\n\nAnother time, we talked about how kids can quickly pick up on patterns: Say a transformation from “a b c d e” to “a c b d e” after a few examples. I was blowing it, possibly because I felt a bit on the spot!\n\nOne time, I remember that Kip Thorne came up to our table, and asked if Feynman wanted to sign someone’s birthday card. Then he teased Thorne: “Who’s going to sign your 65th birthday card? How old are you, anyway?” Thorne: “35.” “35? No wonder you’re so much smarter than I am!” Thorne just grinned and moved on. Feynman continued his remark to me: “35? He’s just a baby!”\n\nSo, I found Feynman to be very personable. I never tried to impress him (I figured there was no way to win that game), I just asked him what I sincerely wanted to know about, so he took all my questions seriously and tried to answer them. If I was blowing it, he let me know I was blowing it; and if I discovered something (as in the fractional derivative issue described elsewhere), he took pleasure in that, too.', 'aiModelVersion': '1'}",0.99705
Alfredo A.

My questions were foolish, according to Feynman, for two reasons. Firstly, you don't want to ask a scientific question that doesn't create a testable hypothesis.

Spandan Mallick,1y,Are Marie Curie's remains radioactive?,"Thank you Asmiati Utari for the A2A!

Sadly, yeah. Both the Curie’s bodies are radioactive, as they have been suspectedly bombarded by isotopes of radium during their research, which have half-lives of around 1,600 years. So, it’ll take a long time.

Both of them are buried in France’s Panthéon, a mausoleum in Paris which contains the remains of distinguished French citizens - like philosophers Rousseau and Voltaire. Both of their coffins have been lined with about an inch of lead to save viewers from getting affected.

Adam Lantos,2y,Why was Feynman so awestruck by Dirac?,"I would be surprised if he wasn’t. I don’t know any physicist who is not awestruck by Dirac’s work. Indeed, those who studied his work/research, know he had an original and genius-level way of thinking.

Dirac worked on the foundations of quantum mechanics, magnetic monopoles, relativistic quantum mechanics, etc. The latter, relativistic quantum mechanics, is the field where his contributions arguably shine more brightly. He discovered the Dirac equation, which describes the motion of electrons (or any spin-1/2 fermions). He also was instrumental in the discovery of the statistics fermions obey. Through the Dirac equation, Dirac was able to predict the existence of anti-matter, such as positrons, which are anti-electrons (same mass and spin, opposite charge). This was a huge discovery and it came purely from Dirac’s theoretical arguments.

Feynman had a more personal reason to be even more impressed by (or at least drawn to) Dirac’s work. Feynman produced the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. He was reportedly inspired by a footnote in Dirac’s book/monogtaph on quantum mechanics, in which Dirac mentioned just the essence of this formalism, without any details; he made it seem unimportant. To give you a better idea of the whole story, here’s an excerpt from the introduction (written by the masterful Anthony Zee) of the newest edition of Feynman’s book “QED: The Strange theory of light and matter”:

“[…] in 1932, Paul Dirac suggested, in a somewhat rudimentary form, yet a third formalism. Dirac's idea appeared to be largely forgotten until 1941 when Feynman developed and elaborated this formalism, which became known as the path integral or sum over history formalism. (Physicists sometimes wonder whether Feynman invented this formalism completely ignorant of Dirac's work. Historians of physics have now established that the answer is no. During a party at a Princeton tavern, a visiting physicist named Herbert Jehle told Feynman about Dirac's idea and apparently the next day Feynman worked out the formalism in real time in front of the awed Jehle.[…])”

On a personal level, the first Dirac paper I read was called “Quantised Singularities in Electromagnetic Fields”. There, Dirac barely uses any math (nothing advanced). He uses basic quantum mechanics and through the simplest of arguments, which he goes into great detail, in words, out emerges the possibility of existence of magnetic monopoles.

He did not predict magnetic monopoles, but showed they are allowed by quantum mechanics. Furthermore, he found a relationship between magnetic and electric charges. His argument is incredibly eloquent. Though his pages-long argument could be summed up by some quick formulas from advanced differential geometry (using bundles and such), the fact that he spelled it out without referring to such technical geometric language shows his depth of thought. I was shocked.

As a fun aside, I’ll give you an example that shows what a strange lad Dirac was. The following is from this
 website (I cannot confirm that everything written here is true, but the one I’m quoting is):

“In 1932, Dirac was appointed the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. During one lecture in class, a student raised his hand and said, ""I don't understand the equation on the top-right-hand corner of the blackboard.""

Dirac simply nodded his head in agreement and continued unabated. When asked again, he expressed puzzlement because he thought the student had simply uttered a fact and not asked a question.”

Finally, it must be said that he didn’t have a ‘superstar physicist’ personality, like Einstein and Feynman did. He was much more quiet, withdrawn and anti-social. He was an extremely weird dude. For this reason, he’s not as popular to the average Joe, but physicists definitely put him in the upper league of best ever physicists.
